Just take a look. What annoyed me the most? The extra long dance scene in the beginning, how people whirled around so much that I got dizzy ... without showing where the music came from ... All part of a college degree that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Or maybe it was the fact that each scene took about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What kind of film is this? And the most annoying aspect is that the bad guys are so bad and obviously so horrible that it seems like the director is shooting this movie for second graders. "These people are bad ... These people are good". Whenever a movie has its agenda heart on its sleeve, I'm outraged. There is a scene in a roller skating rink that seems completely out of place. Long extended love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. John Hurt's character, who is part of the overlong beginning scene, drinks and disapproves of the exaggerated villain. His death scene could well be the dumbest of the story. I hear everyone, including the haters of this film, of how great the cinematography is. I think it looks washed out. Check out "Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful backyards. This movie is even worse than the antihype. It makes no sense. The epilogue that showed the main character on a yacht was almost as stupid as the prologue. The fight scenes are boring and dizzy. This movie is really bad. Avoid it, unless you love bad movies because this is the king of them.
