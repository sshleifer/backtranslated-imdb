This movie was garbage. Not the worse movie ever. If it broke, the acting was good enough to get the job done, but the script was SO and so stupid that you stayed and thought, "Where's my life going?" Even Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love (and that's why I saw it), was in vain. Absolutely wasted. She did not even leave an impression. The direction was so far away that none of the characters left anything behind me, but to see nothing to Redgrave. Her role was nothing. She was good as a mean boss, but that was it. Deepen and give depth to small roles - see Venus and Reconciliation. I would not waste my time and was annoyed to have spent the $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted it back. No turning back. Skip the movie. It only brings sorrow ... and boredom.
