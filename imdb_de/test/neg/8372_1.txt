This is really by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (I'm going to 47)! The description on the back of the cover corresponded to the scrolling text at the beginning of the film. The conspiracy was close to zero and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their "acting". I looked at the whole length and was really relieved when the death of the last figure signaled the end of my suffering! The location was either a kind of vault or a dirty beach. I suspect that home video equipment served as a camera and the lighting was below average. The dialogues were uninspired and meaningless. What were the faces of the actors? What brings me to make-up: It looks like they got it as gadgets in some teenage magazines "My First Own Makeup" or something similar. What prompted me to buy the DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection to the works of this brilliant spirit was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was falsely translated as "Book of Light". The 4,70 EURO, which I paid for this DVD, was a full loss, because the DVD went without further into the recycling box.
