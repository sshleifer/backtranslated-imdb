I did not like this movie. It did not make much sense to me. It was hard to figure out what was really going on. I did not find it scary either. However, I thought that it was stupid absurd, but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the main character of the film, which came out in 2003. It was also by chance in 2006 "Silent Hill" that I hated "is not that bad, but I think it's certainly below average, there's nothing special, the script is just too messed up and there are things in the movie that are mine I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress when she has more work to do, my voice for "Visitors" is 4/10
