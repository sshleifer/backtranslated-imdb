CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ outta 5 stars) Sorry excuse a movie you might enjoy if you like really boring, nonsensical jungle films seasoned with scenes of violent scenes. A pair of drug dealers fleeing from the crowd travel to the jungles of Paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine. They meet with another young traveler and his two hot, hot companions, one of whom is an anthropologist, who definitely wants to prove that cannibalism did not exist and never existed. One of the two dealers turns out to be a psychopath, and he tortures and kills a few natives so they tell him where to hide their jewels. (And how could they even tell him if he does not seem to speak their language at all?) Well, the natives are suddenly not particularly fond of white people in their jungle and catch them all for retaliatory torture. Bad action, bad action and bad direction. No decent moment of suspense during the whole bleak 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not very convincing (though most viewers are still startled by a few blows). The only good scene in the entire film is when the two women are locked up in a mud hut and touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of "Red River Valley." The following is a quote from the movie, but I would not be surprised if many viewers at the time did not say exactly the same thing: "Oh God, please let them die soon Oh, let them die soon And please leave me soon too to die. "
