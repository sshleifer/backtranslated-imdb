I wish I'd rated this movie ten, that weird. If they had intended it to be so funny, I would have given her a ten. I have to give it a 1, but it's the funniest crap you'll ever see. See the huge blur above the screen! Where did that come from? What is it? It flies, it's scary, it's electrifying, it's thread! This bird has real personality. I was about ten years old when I saw it for the first time, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were one and the same!
