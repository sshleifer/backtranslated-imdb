This movie is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsense / Half Lifetime Original Movie. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, this movie has only one purpose: to make you want to spend the duration of the movie in a dark room that hits your testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I will explain why I rented it shortly). I'm not a big fan of Ms. Jolies, though I'd say her performance was outstanding! Her blank look and her robot drama really made me believe she's an Android hooker. If anyone has a clip of Inside the Actor's Studio explaining how she prepared for this role, please send it to me. I will definitely use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against integrity. <br /> <br /> So, what made me rent this movie? One might think that it was the hope to see Angelina Jolie's nipples, but that was not it. No, the reason for this rent was solely on one of the pictures on the cover of the DVD. that of Jack Palance's face! Half of his face was robotic! Seeing this, I envisioned legions of "palances" marching slowly through a fiery wasteland devastating all people foolish enough to resist. In my mind's eye every member of this unholy army of palaces had a red, glowing eye; a red, shining eye that looked at the human and saw only "flesh". They should be the architects of Oblivion ... a cold, steel apocalypse ... a nightmare from which humanity would never awaken. It is a beautiful picture that I will cherish until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the actual movie did not meet my expectations. No, there was only one "Jack Palance" and the only visible cybernetic improvements he had were on his legs. Unfortunately, these improvements have not really "improved" anything. That is, unless you count WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a superpower. At least it was a scene where Jack, grinning like a triggering Alzheimer's patient, could make hell for some people. I waited for him to shout, "I'm damn tired to pay too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, there were few outbreaks of geriatric rage. <br /> <br /> What the movie actually had in abundance was a poorly developed love story about a man (Elias Koteas, aka De Niro of the Poor Man) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, also known as Demon Spawn by John Voigt ). Oh man, can the love between a Romeo of flesh and a Julia of silicon ever survive?!?!?! It can happen if you follow Jack Palance's simple advice: "You have to TASTE the other's TIME". <br /> <br /> Yes, I do not know what that means. However, I'm sure I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I want to make sure he does not show me! As an experiment, I suggest that you ask your partner if he / she "believes that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTE the other's TIME?"
