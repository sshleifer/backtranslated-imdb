I can not remember when I saw a worse movie. The acting was reworked, the dialogue became so painful that it was hard to hear, the special effects were secondary and the whole story ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to leave a movie anymore And if I had been alone, I would have done it in about 30 minutes and would have spent nearly two more hours of nauseating dialogue and a plot with more holes than a Swiss cheese spared "Texas in size". "I just can not stress enough what a pitiful experience it was to be sitting by this Collosal waste of perfect celluloid. <br /> <br />
