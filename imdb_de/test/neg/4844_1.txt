Like most of you, I've seen a lot of great movies. In between, we often find, voluntarily or by mistake, those films that are so pointless that we think of reasons why someone would do it. That's exactly what I can say for the head bonus of Dead Man. <br /> <br /> The least I can do is to "warn" some of you. If you are entertained by a movie because of the story, acting, and intensity, you may want to choose something else. Well, it's not all bad ..... In fact, if you just want creative movie editing and unique angles along with the original music ambience, this is fine. When someone who appreciates movie portraits, acts and entertains a movie, I thought this movie was incredibly awful. I could easily find a place for it on my list of the worst movies that have been seen for some time. <br /> <br /> Regarding Val Kilmer, the truth was told, he was probably considered a favor for the director. As a fan of some of Kilmer's films, I can not understand why he did this. The film seems to be part of Western romanticism ... In the end, I'm sure most of you can agree that it's just a gross waste of time. If you have not seen this movie, I would recommend avoiding it completely.
