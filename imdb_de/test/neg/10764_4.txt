I've studied marketing in college, and although I've missed a lot of classes and never really paid attention, I'll always remember the most important and important principle of marketing, namely: It's not what you sell. It's how you sell it! This principle fully applies to "The Devil's Triangle" as it is basically a beautifully packaged and seductive but empty package. Writer / director Richard Winer knew well that he had to distract the viewer's attention from the large inaccuracies, and added some elements that never fail when it comes to a spooky atmosphere, like the eerie voice of narrator Vincent Price and the Nerd music by King Crimson. I suppose Richard Wintert's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, since there was a huge Bermuda Triangle hype in the mid-70s and literally every movie production? whether it is an inaccurate documentation or a dirty exploitation film? A lot of money was made on the topic at the box office. "The Devil's Triangle" overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant, but the stark dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating, crass voice of almighty Vincent Price creates an ambience of horror and horror. The narrative jumps back and forth in time, covering a whole series of "strange occurrences" and "mysterious conspiracies" of ships and airplanes in the Bermuda Triangle over a period of almost a century, but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent Mr. Price invariably ends every chapter with the eerie words "just another unresolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle". After a few cases, the whole formula becomes ridiculous and almost pathetic, but I think that in 1974 it caused real mass hysteria. The documentary extends slightly more about the infamous Bermuda Triangular Secrets, like the five levels of military flight 19 inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the ship USS Cyclops, but even in these chapters is given only a minimum of useful information. The cameras never go underwater to explore the depths of the Bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the supposed real-life witnesses of the dramas look suspiciously like scene scenes. If you're looking for an informative and objective documentary about the Bermuda Triangle, I certainly would not recommend this movie. However, if you want to sit back and hear Vincent Price's mesmerizing voice for almost a full hour, this is your chance!
