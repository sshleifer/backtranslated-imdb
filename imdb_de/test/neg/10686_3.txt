The animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After seeing Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The worst was when the guy ate the head of the mouse. But they were so fast and few that they did not bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was just interesting. I always like to hear stupid voices. They never sound the way you think the actor / actress would sound in real life. I liked the bright colors of the princesses. The shots of strange-looking beetles were cool too. The youngest princess REALLY looked young, almost 14 or so. The fight scenes were not as long and boring as most battle scenes, so that was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
