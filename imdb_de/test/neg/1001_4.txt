I'm a big fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and amused them so much by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly rather small movie that had all the ingredients have more to offer. The too short scenes, in which he is a boring, infinitely legitimate, worthless son of a rich man, are embarrassing and entertaining. But for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry of which one could speak. The music was an awkward movie of the week, and the voice-over noise was completely superfluous. The work of a first-time director on a small budget, either lacking advice or not paying enough attention, is obvious. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the people you hate in the beginning are the ones you like in the end, and vice versa, so there is a kind of arc of drawing least in terms of perception. For example, while Watson's character was refreshingly honest with her husband about her feelings for another man, in the end she began to annoy me, especially when she announced to her husband that she simply had no control over her actions, and later, when she merely stated that she would retire into her marriage without asking for permission to offer no apology. And I went from an aversion to Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to somehow understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This film was awkwardly transformed from a whodunit into a "love story" or "steel magnolia" disease drama, without informing me sufficiently, and I distracted myself as to what the next turning point might be. long after they were all revealed (was it the gentleman who drove the car? The dog of the Lord?) The scene in which Mr. Wilkinson visits and reports how brave Watson is, the best nurse, the dying friend Anyone could ask, Florence Nightingale incarnated, etc., was alright until he started sobbing like a baby Good God, if you ask me, she's just another fat person with too much time, and so she drives her hard work by driving the spouse crazy with unnecessary drama, their being together was just another way to fill their empty lives, the dying guy was an added bonus to them as they somehow avoided their previous actions made beyond reproach. <br/> <br /> See, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he behaved like an abused dog. His open desire for the affection of his wife increased with every step she gave him. I'm not an anti-pc or anything, it just does not sound right, even taking into account all the harsh realities of middle age that we all face. The end was depressing for me (and not the director's intention for sure). The movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just do not belong together. So I did not enjoy the promise that their relationship will continue. I do not want my feelings manipulated by a story, it just has to be plausible and not cheated. Is that too much? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
