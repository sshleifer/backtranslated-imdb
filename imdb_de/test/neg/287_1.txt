I thought it was a comedy !! What a scream! I can not believe that Forsythe or Reynolds would actually appear in this garbage about 50 !! The plot is ridiculous, the acting absolutely abhorrent and the tired old clich√©s that are carried out over and over again, boy, it took a lot of stamina to sit by this dog. And there are MUCH! If you really want to kill, say, one and a half hours pick up this baby in the rental business, but make sure you have a room with brain dead people to watch with you. I think that's who it was written for. It's like thinking about a real, drug-induced audience.
