This movie was awful. I thought it was OK, but it was getting worse and worse. From the starting scenes it seems to go towards another safe, predictable Rom-Com, but the moment he reaches the house, it simply decays. None of the characters has any depth, and the only person anywhere near believable was Tom, though the way he was so easily distracted annoyed me after a while. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film is almost non-existent. In an insulting attempt at comedy, the writer / director introduces into virtually every scene a new character or event, none of which is realistic, which makes it very confusing to keep track. The plot is hardly an excuse for a movie: man likes girls, house sits fathers home to meet girls, destroyed house, gets girls. A complete waste of time.
