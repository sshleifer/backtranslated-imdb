I'm sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Musically decent, but the presentation is boring - great. Most songs sound the same and singer Jeff Lynne is as lively as a shop mannequin. He has a pleasant voice, but there is not much to see. He only stands in one place and sings an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all sound like bubblegum-stuff from the 1970s-1980s: pleasant, but not exciting. Lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, Rosie Vela, who is not too animated. The only song from 23 that causes a stir is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven". If only some of the other 22 songs had this excitement, this could have been a much better concert DVD.
