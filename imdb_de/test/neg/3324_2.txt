I should have known when Anne Rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. I could not foresee that years after its release, I just thought about it when I think of the movie. The novels are amazing, and although I understand that much is lost in the translation to the canvas, this film was a great middle finger to their original work. I hope one day it will try again, in the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and looks of main and minor characters without good reason. They destroy Lestat's story. The acting of the queen is exaggerated until the comedy, but I just can not make myself laugh. The charm and fascination of the novels simply does not exist. The film is a bad excuse to put as many musicians and "dark" pictures as possible in a movie in the hope that the youthful Goths of America would clear the ball. The first film, the story of Louis, makes the charm that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat should take over and show the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Luckily I read the books first or I never touched them after this movie.
