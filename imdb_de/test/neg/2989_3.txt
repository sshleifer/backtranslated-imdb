I have seen comments from Turkish people (who I am not) saying that this film is fantastic and that it accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey has to be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world because in my opinion that was exactly this movie for me. If I were Turkish, I think that would have had a bigger impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on it. Many scenes are laboriously long and have little or no purpose. I do not even understand the goals of the director in including many scenes. It should be noted that the director used his own car, his apartment and his friends to make the film ... Well, you know what? It shows. It looks low. Acting is bad. If it's a cultural thing, then it should be like this. I just do not understand the purpose of creating a movie on this story. It is unbelievably boring.
