How did I earn this crap? The Worst Ever Acting was horrible when I read that this was a comedy I expected to smile at least once - or twice, but ... If you want to lose an hour and a half of your life, this is the place Movie. I recommend just looking at a wall or something other than watching this "movie". You can even watch a documentary (if you're a guy) about pregnant women, I guarantee that it gets more entertaining :) The actor in this movie (I forgot his name) is not that bad and I'm surprised how he assumed that role. "I want someone to eat cheese" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
