Jim Varney's first real movie is a real pleasure, but do not expect to see Ernest P. Worrel soon. I found the wide variety of characters that Varney presented to be great, but the rest of the film should, without being said, be put into a mulcher or something else. A rather strange beginning for a movie icon.
