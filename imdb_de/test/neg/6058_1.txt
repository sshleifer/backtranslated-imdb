I do not know how expensive the creation of this movie was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was filmed on stage in front of a movie screen (that's for sure Blue Box does not seem so artificial). When traveling on a boat, the background screen was moved to mimic the motion of the waves, but the characters did not move. The CGI effects: awful (I'm not sure, but I think the effect was created with Paint and a GIF sequence made of it - next time the developers should hire a professional CGI manufacturing team). It looks as if the CGI creator has drawn the image strip with shaky hands. Terrible, that's for sure. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My chin worked, I was so shocked, I thought he was joking. Guys, I recommend you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you will not enjoy it.
