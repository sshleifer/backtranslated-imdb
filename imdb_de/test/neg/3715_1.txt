"Until then you were one of the worst movies we have ever seen. It fails in every way. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better in Waterworld (as an actress ...). In comparison, this movie is Dungworld. If a character stumbles once or even twice during a movie, you can understand that. But Jeanne's character falls, stumbles, and stumbles so often that she may have a bit of Jerry Lewis in her. In their defense, any (prat?) Fall was likely blocked, choreographed, and rehearsed. And rehearsed. Although this is bad enough for a movie, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to be spending most of the action going "smoking" or looking for a place to smoke. If the movie was an altercation because there was no room to smoke - OK - BUT it's not. <br /> <br /> As long as this movie is running, it's too long for 10 minutes at runtime. <Br /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST is acting in a public forum meeting. They almost see her break life into the figure. Oh, it's almost as convincing as their scene that Michael Douglas shouted in Basic Instinct - hmm, the second thought is not really caught in anonymous nicotine addicts or forced to watch snippets of HOOPER (Burt Reynolds). And even then throw a coin or go to sleep.
