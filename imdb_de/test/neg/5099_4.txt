As the above said, I was ultimately not impressed with this movie. It's nice to look at, the scenery is lush, but the details of the story, especially the characters, are absolutely incredible. Films do not have to be credible, but films of this kind with political lead and social commentary do. <br /> <br /> Likewise, I have no problem with the commercialism itself, but again, movies like these should not make casting decisions based solely on the cash register. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is honestly called Doyle Garbage. His accent was anything but authentic, but he fell in the worst case of all, his accent is his achievement, and we end up with a caricature of Irish people without personality outside his nationality. I find it completely implausible that everyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. All in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest in quality, and if you try to be The Mission, that kind of success destroys your chances of success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents a few more issues, one was the striking modernity of Boys Akzent, which dispelled the feeling of being put into another time. More surprising was Samantha Morton's acclaimed Irish accent, which was, to say the least, variable. Her voice moved between the strong north and the soft south, even in the voice overs, where I expected such discrepancies. <br /> <br /> However, these are minor issues compared to Sarah's motivation and actions. She never seems to be at home among the English, and almost instantaneously at home with her son and tribe. The dilemma between the life she knew and the life she would offer seems easy. Maybe a lot has been lost in editing, maybe this should be a three-hour movie or a miniseries that could have fleshed out those things, but I can only judge what I've seen. <br /> <br The biggest problem, Sarah's (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland), is incomprehensible. The fact is that her affection for him is in no way conveyed until she has to choose between him and her son. The conflict she went through at this point was, frankly, ridiculous and brought the movie to a standstill. <br /> <br /> As you might have guessed. This movie did not work for me at all, but it's first class, you really do not see anything better in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it.
