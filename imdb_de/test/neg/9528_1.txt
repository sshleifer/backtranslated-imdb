Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still is a very courageous and courageous film. I enjoyed it and was very impressed with the filming and the story. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People are horrified when they reveal the naked statue that represents the truth after they did not lead it, and the few who did it help along the way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them that they are putting things before God, going to inappropriate beach parties, their materialistic ways, and other things that the people of our world do not tend to do be morally right. If he does not win any followers, he will end up entering the gates of heaven alone. This movie seems very daring to me because it shows a naked woman everywhere, especially considering the length of time this movie was made. I found the images and symbolism presented in this film incredible. The way they have made the naked woman translucent and use a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing people's different sins as they walked down the street and refused to follow the path with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities was a great way to represent the people of today. This film does very well to convey the moral message to the audience. Lois Weber captures the attention of her audience with her creativity, her symbolism, her visual elements and her hearing in an impressive way. Even the piano music is very beautiful in this film and fits the whole theme.
