Christopher Guest is the master of mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentary filmmakers. Zak Penn is not good at it either, but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. Guest often plays around with reality and fiction, but the line between the two is always clear in his films, a kind of essential with a mockumentary. Penn also got a lesson from The Blair Witch Project. Although you knew it was a fake documentary, you were totally into the world the filmmakers had created. It seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real, although you know that you are watching fiction in depth. In other words, the fiction has been successfully disguised as truth. In fact, many early viewers who saw it in Sundance and other premieres, considered the audience real. Penn, whose strength, as he says himself, is screenwriting, should probably stick to it. Documentary or documentary (and it's hard to say where one starts and the other ends with this movie) is obviously not the case. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he's trying to sell as a legitimate documentary filming a documentary, a kind of metadocumentary. However, Penn confuses the audience and loses his confidence from the beginning as he enters Duke's house before the film of Duke "Enigma of Loch Ness" about the myth of the Loch Ness Monster (a movie that was apparently made) was never filmed ready, probably because of Penn's fault). Although Penn seems to be the director of the movie we see, he starts him by looking at the cameras and says, "What's the film crew doing here?" and begins to shy away from them. He also does so on a few other occasions. He stops and tells the cameras to stop filming, forcing the cameraman to hide in the shadows to record dialogues between Duke and Penn. It seems like a gimmick, but it's never clarified, and Penn obviously keeps us in the dark on purpose. The audience scratches their heads and asks themselves: "Who is responsible here?" When Penn works against his own film crew, what world are we part of? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to fully enter the fictional world (I think) when the crew has sightings of the found Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster first appears, we've completely left the fictitious world that Penn has been trying to do, making everything seem stupid and pointless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity where Penn has the chance to document a master at work, but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about Penn and his Possen instead of filming a documentary. Penn's presence begins to permeate and overshadow everything else in the film. <br /> <br /> The Herzog interviews are convincing and we really believe that he does not act. We even wonder if he and others of his crew are outwitted by Penn the way the audience is, but you're never sure. In his interviews in front of the camera, Penn tries to be funny and unintentionally funny, like the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary, but he only succeeds in being annoying. In a Guest movie, this effect is funny, while staying flat here because you're never sure what Penn is about. As a result, we, the audience, begin to like him the way the crew seem to do. Apart from the beautiful landscape and the superfluous appearance, which has nowhere been added to a beautiful model to spice up the film, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps the only redeeming (unintentional) quality is that it's a great example of why the audience is so important. and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling you are having a hard time. That's why I think this could be a good movie for film students? a kind of "what not to do" kind of movie. I have nothing against a film that is narrated in an unconventional way, as long as it is skilfully made, with a thematic base that gives it substance. This movie is completely missing. <br /> <br /> I would like to call it a valiant attempt, but I'm not sure what it is except a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time. <br /> <br /> (As a side note: It seems like bad art is always well remembered.) This movie made me think of Lillian Ross' "Picture." Ross followed John Huston during the filming of "The Red Badge of Courage "and documented it brilliantly for the New Yorker, it would actually make a great movie, if you want a good example of meta-art, read it.)
