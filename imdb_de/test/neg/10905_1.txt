I do not often write reviews here, but I can not stand in front of it and make other people suffer through this movie without at least warning them. This movie is horrible, not because "I do not know what the director wanted to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; This movie is terrible because of the bad direction, the script writing and the acting. This is the "trifecta" of the bad move and the reason why the movie was aimed directly at video. It tries something like "high voltage," "hostel," and "TCSM" by picking up some of these ideas, but it just does not work. I had no high or medium expectations, but was still very disappointed. It had the potential to be very good, with a nice backdrop and a good idea for a movie, but it was wasted.
