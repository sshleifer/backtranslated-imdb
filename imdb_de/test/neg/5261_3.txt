My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are the best friends in a year. What Moses does not know is that Keats is really Jack Carter, a covert policeman who is waiting for the right time to beat Moses and Frank Colton, an important criminal involved in Moses. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a police officer, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he gets away after shooting Carter in the head, which does not kill Carter. Moses is found by the cops and taken as proof of Colton's wrongdoing. But as the cops, including Carter, escort him aboard the plane across the country, all the other cops are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter has to stay alive and take Moses with him. <br /> <br /> Bulletproof is a fairly average action comedy and has a fair plot, but much of the movie is just stupid. For a comedy, I found most jokes to be completely funny. But as an action movie, there are some pretty good action scenes. Since I am neither a good fan of Adam Sandler nor of Damon Wayans, I found the acting and thus the characters significantly below average. The climax is not really great and the movie is so unrealistic. It's not bad, but it's not too good and it's way too short. Under 85 minutes, it was still 15 minutes to the end, but there were none, and the film felt too short. All in all, not a waste of time, but I still would not recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: Mid Level Violence, Sexual References, Medium Reasoning Language <br /> <br /> Rating: 56 out of 100
