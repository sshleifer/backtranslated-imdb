Just in case the title did not tell - this movie is garbage. <br /> <br /> Short review? Yes. <br /> <br /> I've decided to spend so much time writing this review as Hollywood probably chose the script. I doubt it will be released, considering how badly I put it, but if that's the case and everyone reads it, consider the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every respect. The sequels are not worth buying or being seen, and anyone involved should be ashamed to ruin one of the most classic and original films of our childhood.
