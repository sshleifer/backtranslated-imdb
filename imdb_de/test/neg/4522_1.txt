Get Smart should be called Get Stupid. There is no funny line or gag in the whole movie. This movie is so bad that the Austin Powers movies are Shakespearean. A few more films like this and Steve Carell can say goodbye to his career. What is Anne Hathaway doing in this movie? She is a good actress, but she is just terrible. <br /> <br /> The letter is lamentably lame. There is no funny, clever or funny line. There is no good sight gag. <br /> <br /> The director is terrible. The comedy depends on the timing. Someone should tell the director that. Any line that is supposed to be funny (and not) is delivered with the absolute worst sense of comic timing I've ever seen
