1. 1. 1/3/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): Sober drama about a wealthy doctor who has trouble keeping a relationship with a younger woman with whom his family begins to live it as well married to another in the same household. His search for happiness is not clear, but they pretty well express the reason for his misfortune by showing the overbearing quality of women in his wife's line. Well played, but predictable drama.
