I participated in a screening of this film. It was worked with clich√©s and very listless jokes and setups. I think the other comments were from people who worked on the movie or were family members of the cast. I am amazed that this movie cost $ 3 million to $ 4 million without real stars. Where did the budget go? Obviously, it was not up to authors to rewrite them. Nice thought to bet on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a big failure. There was little or no spark between the main characters, and the incident was exciting. The director was not inspired and looked like a student film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it means that every Italian wants. Is that a true proverb? I have never heard it before.
