Apart from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful movie is notable for just 68 minutes like two hours. <br /> <br /> It begins with an endlessly long intro introducing the Leeds family, including two intolerable Tykes and their adult brother and sister, perfectly clich√©ed Pa and Ma, and incredibly annoying grandfather (played by Charles " Chic "Sales). During dinner, the family is disturbed by the gunfire and rushes to the window to see two men being shot down by gangsters in the street. The gangsters flee through the family home, leaving them as witnesses of the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Walter Huston as the Crusade, who occasionally interrupts long anti-criminal speeches to make half-hearted attempts to protect the family from the mob. The whole ends in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> Among the good points of the film are some decent shootouts and a really nasty beating, Nat Pendleton being one of the gangsters and the gorgeous Sue Blane in a little movie role as a daughter of Leeds. <br /> <br /> If you want to see how Huston plays his early Criminal Lawyer, try Beast of the City, 1932. Avoid them, if at all possible.
