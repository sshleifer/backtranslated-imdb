One night on an independent channel, which was famous for showing films off the wall, this monstrosity was broadcast. Although he was tempted to turn it off, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping for a semblance of saving value. Unfortunately, there were none. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was favorable; the soundtrack was muddy; The editing was ridiculous. On the other hand, there was hardly anything to save. After a few minutes in which Cameron Mitchell's doctoral character tells of one of his patients, the viewer is not tortured by any plot, wretched writing, suspiciously horrible spectacle, and a total lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on this lazy mess was the most frightening "special effects" and "make-up" that ever embarrassed the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles through his role in a Dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves, seemingly dipped in glue and rolled in pearls. Maybe the poor lighting conditions and gag-quality movie quality were trying to hide how bad the make-up was to tithing. One can only hope that at least one conscious decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-old children could have produced a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell returns (desperate for his money!) And threatens some nonsense to connect this pile of crap with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare yourself and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty if you go through this. It was so bad that even Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not save it.
