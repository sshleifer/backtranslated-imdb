I do not like this show at all. I mean, basically everyone at this school is perfect and rich, and I doubt a boarding school looks so cool. And why do you suddenly let girls go to school? Is not that just a bit weird? Anyway, Jamie Lynn spears CAN NOT act. She always has the same expression, which really annoys me. She is basically emotionless and all the guys seem to like her. <br /> <br /> and should not you tell him that he likes her? it is not that hard! Really! None of these shows is real life and she is not a "girl like me" as the majority of normal girls do NOT go to boarding school, have no designer clothes and do NOT live on the beach <br /> fake counterfeit fake.
