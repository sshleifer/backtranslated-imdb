The dog can act ... unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this dirty faux children's movie. A stray but very clever dog introduces the lives of two motherless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-hearted father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the wicked widower forbids his children - who may be mentally challenged - from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obey. Soon, the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police to find them. Only then does the old man realize that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> Tom Lester, whose only acting experience so far seems to have played the gritty Eb on GREEN ACRES, is one of the kidnappers. So too the unfortunately overloaded Deborah Walley. Walley's previous winning games include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the sad IT'S A BIKINI WORLD. She also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past, trying to destroy her reputation with bad music! <br /> <br /> Stay away from BENJI ... he's a dog and this movie is a dog!
