I rarely did a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with this movie. What scared me off was that it was so obvious that the sole purpose of this movie was to show as many of the skin of as many actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; I like pretty actresses and sex scenes, and Sexploitation movies have their own scale of merit, but this director does not do anything else gal and of course there are all these supposedly funny skirmishes between them talking about the first dead body. The camera pans between the lines for each line (there is more than one screen width between them!) And you end up wondering if you are seasick from this or the unsuspecting dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, I WANT to be better after the first 10 minutes, but I would not know. I declined the bet and found something better.
