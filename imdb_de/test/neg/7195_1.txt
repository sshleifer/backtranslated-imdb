This was shown on a DVD, which a buddy of mine had bought for me. They had it listed as "The Savage Guns," which was a completely different movie. Obviously, the people who packed the DVD never cared what they burn on the CD. <br /> <br /> This movie is as bad as it gets. The soundtrack is a combination of TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western. Many gallop to this music. It seems that the guy has to gallop between the scenes to burn some time and do something to the soundtrack people. I wish it had only been a bit worse and then there had been a bit of the camping feel of the Ed Wood movies. The way it is, it's just awful.
