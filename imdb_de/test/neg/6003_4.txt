If I did not know better, I would have thought Resurrection was made in the late '80s / early' 90s when crap was sold in Hollywood as a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if he's reading cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emulate himself. He was easily the weakest aspect of the movie. The other actors were okay, nothing terrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where most of the budget was: the special effects. The murders look quite professional, but they barely make up for the boredom of the movie. <br/> <br /> I would not say that Resurrection is a copy of Se7en, but it certainly bears some resemblance to the movie. The investigators, who deal with a religious-thinking murderer for a modern crusade, must rely on biblical passages and Christian history to compose the mystery of the killer. The resurrection, however, is without Sezen's clever storytelling, cinematography, acting ... deprived of everything that makes it good. Instead, Resurrection lies to the audience and puzzles them with the Scooby Doo method. <br /> <br /> In summary Resurrection was about as bad as I expected. I feel almost bad because I have criticized this movie because I knew it would be bad, but ... sue me.
