I just saw it at the Madison Horror Film Festival and was disappointed. A few shocking, funny moments (fisting of Hollow Carla, a urinating harpy in Dreamland) and two interesting interesting spaces (similar to New Nightmare with the belief that brings a mythical character to life, and also Lost Highway with a man in his life had a fantasy head) but had long stretches without movement and incoherent plot development. Just because you use the frame of dreams or a mental joint state is not Lynchian. They need convincing pictures and scary performances. <br /> <br /> Positive things: dr. Maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute. Carla's father, Chalmers, and Ingrid Pitt looked like they were having fun. And Tom Savini at least looked like he had memorized his lines and we could not see if he was just reading cue cards. <br /> <br /> I get the Hammer credentials, but it looks like the director realized that the script was a snoozer and added just a few shocks to try to laugh out the material he could put together. But they do not work because they are too few and too far apart to produce an inconsistent tone. Compress this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts, and you could have a surreal dumb-short show. It's not "that bad, it's good", it's just "that bad, it's boring".
