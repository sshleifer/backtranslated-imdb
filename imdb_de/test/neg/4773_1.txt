I have not seen such a dumb, stupid movie in a long time. It has absolutely no logic, no horror - do not scare you, no tension, not exciting .. I mean, I did not even find a part of the movie appealing. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they thought when they made the film. They look at the whole movie to find out there's a plant that can run around, pull human bodies and eat human flesh. Not only that, but it can also talk, ie imitate sounds, like ringing a cellphone or talking to someone ... so it sounds like the system is ringing the sound of a cellphone, so they go after the cellphone and find it out that it is a plant. .. how intelligent the plant is to build an ambush. <br /> <br /> This is clearly the creativity of a primary schoolchild ... bad !!!
