This seventh (yes, you read right - the seventh) Puppet Master movie shows how the demented group of puppets originated; by a French puppeteer who uses them to avenge a group of old mummies looking for him as soon as they learn that he is keeping the secret of life. He was taught by a sorcerer, also on the run, before he died. He used this power to bring normal dolls to life. This sequel is basically nonsense and is sprinkled with even more nonsense as most of the Puppet Master sequels. Due to the PG13 rating we do not even get entertaining puppet murders. Come to think of it, there are NO puppet murders. If there was a franchise that had to be cut, it would be that. No more .... God, please no more ...
