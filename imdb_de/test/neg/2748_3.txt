Before I saw this movie, I heard some negative comments. Looking at it, though, I thought "ok, it's a bit slow, but that's pretty interesting." Towards the end, a complex moral dilemma developed that led to a shocking but credible decision with extremely dramatic consequences. Had this been followed, this would have been an enormously powerful ending and would have given me a very positive impression of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, due to an ending that is not just emotional, tackling an unnecessary happy-ish ending with no real emotional credibility, but also in the context of the movie makes absolutely no sense to you if you see that one of the characters performs an action that should end their lives, but inexplicably not. By the way, please tell me if I missed anything here, and there's a reason why she survives because I just could not understand how logical she could have been, and that destroyed the whole movie for me. <br /> <br /> That said, all three main roles show strong performances, though the transformation of Kevin McKidd's characters eventually goes a bit further than convincing and creates a very powerful ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended when you are ready to leave when your mother and sister lie on the bed. But look no further unless you only have a pinch, but several mountains of salt.
