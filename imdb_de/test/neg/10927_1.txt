This conglomerate fails so miserably at every level that it's hard to decide what to say. It does not deserve a line, not less than ten, but to comply with the IMDb rules this is probably the case, and I probably will not succeed the first time. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen this blow during the 70's of my fungal phase, I would still have found it unimaginative and shallow. The most exciting setting for me was the wide angle shot as the elevator door opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. as if this was a red-lettered day in his life. One can only pray that something far more exciting happens in this poster life.
