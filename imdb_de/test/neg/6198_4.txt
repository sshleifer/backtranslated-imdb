The movie is beautiful. Well imaged, but not original ... <br /> <br /> This movie is directly copied from "The Hitch", where Salman looks like a date. like Will Smith plays and Govinda like a big jerk. If you desperately try to fall in love with your boss, you end up with an old Indian flimi style. The bride father does not like the lover of the bride and gets another groom. Govinda, the lover of the bride, comes in the end and rescues her from the new groom and a fancy dance and such. <br /> <br /> The comedy was really good, no doubt, if the jerk meets Hindi, Hindi would be funnier .... <br /> <br /> Ultimately worth a watch, but if it was after a few months in the TV is coming ...
