The gate to hell opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has disappeared in the tunnels under the city to find the gate. During a hike in the underground, he and his colleagues have to deal with the inhabitants of the tunnels both humanly and demonically. A good idea with a good cast of second-level actors is far from being like the tunnels it's in. I've looked at it twice now, and I still have no idea why this is perceived as scary, if not much happens when others talk about the evil and we see shadow shapes. Nothing is clear and frankly, I did not understand everything, as a salary test to grant those affected. (Second: Val Kilmer is in a few fleeting scenes that mean nothing more than allowing him to do so.) The idea is really good, the performances are alright, the script is not going anywhere. Take the advice of several characters in the movie and do not cross the river to see this.
