Another recent comedy showing that Hollywood can not even lay the foundations for the filming that has been done in its sleep for decades. If the author / director had any sense, they would have built the film around Stamp's character, the tyrant boss Jack Taylor. If he's early in the movie, that's nothing fancy, but he's bland and amusing occasionally. As soon as he leaves for most of the film and Kutcher completes his "weird" adventures with his guests after a boring guest visit, the movie crumbles completely walk-through timewaster transforms into an inappropriate stinker.
