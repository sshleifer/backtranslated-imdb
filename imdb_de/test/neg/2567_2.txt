Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. This film seems to me a stupid serious, who has become an unwanted classic (the best type). Memorable lines include: "Knowledge is like a deer, follow it and it will run away" and "drink that. It will make you feel better." It is so sublime bad - they could not have made it worse if they tried. Segal tries to convince you that he is sensitive to the first - by rescuing a battered pony; 2. a good father - through a sweet cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a man of science - by viewing a wrong spectrum; 4. in harmony with nature - with homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural - by Indian friends; 6. an iconoclast - by opening a rural practice after a past life in a national research laboratory; and 7. an action hero - being really fat and still able to fight. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's good to see a late Saturday strip with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) drunk.
