I'm a big Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he had only one scene in the movie. This was also my favorite scene, in which he confiscates the weapons of a character and leads them down to Below. Unlike Thirdspace and River of Souls, most of the actions took place outside the station. After the first three seasons Garibaldi did not interest me much and I think Sheridan is okay, but no Sinclair. I like Lochley, but she only had a limited screen time. If you like crusade or space battles, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give it 1/10.
