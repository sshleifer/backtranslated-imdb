This is an idiot. Scene of the Crime dates back to 1949 and is often more like a 1940s Coen Bros. film filmed in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche is not quite as well tuned here is - perhaps this is instead a forerunner of Oscar propaganda such as Road to Perdition. To be honest, it is a wonder that this film is not universally regarded as a classic by film professors and critics, considering how much it offers in the form of too articulated Mannerist thriller dressed in the wrong sense (much like the Grandfather of all such art films, Citizen Kane or anything from Murnau.) MGM is usually a studio that in my eyes can not go wrong, and I think every story, every atmosphere, even "grim realism" can only be of use for grotesque overesthetization. You could say I am a student of the Minnelli School. But it does require some light touch to write the harsh dialogue with the Dashiell Hammett strip, a readiness, maybe a scene or two without a line like "Beware," Mr. Wiggly, or you have thirteen fish to fry and none small worm fish to catch them. "I made the most of it -" Mr. Wiggly, "unfortunately it cut short - but believe me, the dialogue is just that it bloated before Loon and interspersed with non-sequencers, even the policewoman's wife, played by Arlene Dahl, speaks of a moon-shaped scar one eye and the Christian name Rocco, when Van Johnson alternates with the line "I am mortally ill and deadly" in the episode, you will wonder how the writer could ever succeed in using elaborate literary devices, in this case zeugma misunderstood as a "street". <br /> <br /> For those who came out of the Naked Gun series, this is the funniest movie of the cops.
