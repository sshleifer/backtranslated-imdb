A group of tourists stranded with their boat on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident. You're forced to spend the night, and as you probably suspect, that does not mean Snake Island, because it's just so much fun to say - it has a history where people gradually disappear due to the large snake population disappearing these poor stupid souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off-screen snake attacks and lousy performances by NOBODY actors. The only entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and enforced strip scene that is not seen in a PG13 rated movie, folks. If you are interested in snake movies, you should try SSSSSSS, but do not bother with this crap.
