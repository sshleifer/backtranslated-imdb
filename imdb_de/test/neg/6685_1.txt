What a nasty cynical movie. Obviously, this sad excuse for a dramatic urban view of what 20-year-olds are doing as they crawl through the gutter of Sydney's nightlife somehow seems to connect to their target market. SAMPLE PEOPLE at the Australian box office was unfairly denounced by some industry and cameramen who seemed to think they could put together any sloppy behavior with a young cast and put it in multiplexes. It is so offensive in its clich√©d representations of obvious and easy goals that it was completely rejected by the audience it intended. Sloppy and cruel, and without trying to give quality or resonance to the young audience that might have been attracted to the marketing or casting of SAMPLE PEOPLE, could have been interesting or even informative, if it was not from its exploitative point of view, what the teenagers want to see is a movie. The character played by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive, and Kylie Minogue is again wasted on bad material and immoral filmmakers. It's as if the producers thought the teenagers were seeing ugly garbage and related scenes and characters that are flat and soulless. Well, that was very wrong. A 1983 mini-budget movie titled GOING DOWN has handled this issue properly and is an excellent antidote to this poison.
