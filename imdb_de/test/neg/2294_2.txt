From time to time I like a good horror movie, so I thought this would be a Splatter and Gore movie. but it was a boring boring movie, maybe because i saw a cut version because there were only two things that splashed a bit, once where some somebody cut off a poor and where somebody shoots a poor but where the only ones things. Wismaster, for example, had more cool senes than angry Ed, it was boring rather than angry Ed. and some actors were too bad
