Possible spoiler alert, although not much to spoil this movie. I saw that Project A Part II did not see the first movie. I do not think that I missed much. Project A Part Two is not only the worst Jackie Chan movie I've ever seen (worse than "Fantasy Mission Force"), but this movie is one of the most unsurpassed films the world has ever seen. It's at the top with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" on the scale that stimulates sleep. The plot is twisted and knotted like a 50-foot ball of yarn with which the cat has played, and finally remain dead. The "humor", if you could call it that, seems to have been written by an annoying high school freshman who, despite the many people who tell him he is not funny, is determined to bring out his lame humor no matter how painful a movie is. And this movie is painfully bad. The attack involves Jackie Chan, a naval officer who was recruited by the police to rally "all known criminals." He sums it up in the first half hour of the movie and I prayed for a quick end that I did not get. I do not know why the movie is progressing from this point. The film continues to move on purposeless, without conspiracy and humor attempts that fail so miserably that Carrot Top looks like a comedic genius. The kung fu in this movie is lame and forgotten. There is better kung fu about the 3 Ninja children in this movie. Project A Part II is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, but it is a complete waste of the talents of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung, who are superior to movie worlds. As Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes certain death, I go into Blair Witch mode and ask (and would like to): Will he die NOW for the movie to end? `. An example of how ridiculous this movie is: Jackie Chan is tied to another guy. A pirate gang (who does not look like pirates) throws Jackie at axes. Does Jackie grab one of the stubborn axes and break the chain on the handcuffs? No! You see, that would spoil the "weird" gag if it's handcuffed to another person. If you have a friend who laughs at everything, I recommend you watch this movie with him or her and see how he does not even laugh from this movie. If you are an insomniac, this movie will surely make you sleep. Do not operate heavy machinery while observing Plan A Part II. Possible side effects include headache, retinal effort and boredom. 0/9 stars
