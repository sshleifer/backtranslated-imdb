I really like sci-fi movies of the 50s. I like the really good ones (like the day the earth stopped when worlds collide, the invasion of body snatchers and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really fun and with friends (like Plan 9) space). However, if a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun, it should definitely be avoided. This movie is such a movie. The posters make it look like a kind of sexy animal attacking humanity, while the actual plan is much less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. It's contaminated and growing to a HUGE size and decides to track down that worm and kick its tail, and that's it. Also, a lot of special effects really stink - especially the huge paper mache hand that comes into the room to grab the bad husband.
