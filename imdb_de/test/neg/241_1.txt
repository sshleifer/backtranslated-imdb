The Mexican "classic" was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series. As you will soon learn, this film is anything but a classic, but more like a movie that bores you on purpose. <br /> <br /> Some scientists want to steal Aztec treasures from a grave, but they guard this grave is the running toilet paper business: The Aztec Mummy. Knowing that he can not beat the mummy, he builds a robot and a very bad one. We only see Mr.Robot on the last roll as he walks around fighting with the Aztec Mummy. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of lousy sci-fi movies, damn it. Fi movies I see are miserable, but for the entire duration of 64 Minuites, this movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. Fubar comes soon after that .... <br /> <br /> In summary: Do not waste your time.
