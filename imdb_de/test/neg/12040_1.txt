The opening scene really got me to watch the movie. But no more than 5 minutes later, I hollowed out my eyes. Not only could I not understand a word that said the drama could have been bettered by a group of the mentally handicapped. The highlight of this movie was that there was a white punk. However, I did not quite understand how a white dwarf was the child of two African Americans. But I think everything is possible. Why was Robin in the movie hell? I am not sure if it has added something artistically. Overall, I would strongly advise you to jump off a cliff before borrowing this movie.
