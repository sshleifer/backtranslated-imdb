Ah, the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? I think often, do you show good films? OK, you gave me the great "heroes" and the reasonably good "The Lost Room", but they are series, and as far as the movie is concerned, there's really nothing positive to say. Bad drama, bad direction, terrible characters and a flat story, and that's only for beginners. I tried the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing interesting in his CV (in fact, I think half of that is a pseudonym). The premises of four motorcyclists crossed in a national park under a motto, if one of them has an accident and needs a parking attendant to rescue them, only to be caught by a forest fire is faint and predictable. Senior man Bryan Genesse, Park Ranger, is so bad it's awful. When the action hero martial artist has been following in the footsteps of so many others, this guy Seagal and Van Damme looks like De Nero. The cast is not much better, and long before the end it was hoped the fire would cover them all, then the film crew. Avoid at all costs
