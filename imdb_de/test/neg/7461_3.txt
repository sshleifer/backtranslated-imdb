Oh, I'm not usually the type to give a movie less than 5 points. Mostly because of the effort of actors and directors. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for Keyman from me. If someone thinks that the main character (or whoever) has earned an Oscar, I have earned the Nobel Peace Prize. <br /> <br /> Seriously. I can not believe that this movie made it to Europe. The drama was terrible, the plot was terrible and what about the horror music of the 70s. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> "Popeye" eg. What about him? Why is he here? He has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> And what about the Keyman? Once he can not say a decent word, next time he becomes talkative. He almost dies when he wakes up and some sunlight shines through his bunker. But when he walks down the street, the sunlight does not seem to do anything. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only when you are on the verge of boredom. I regret that I did not see my roses growing, which are more entertaining than this piece anyway ...
