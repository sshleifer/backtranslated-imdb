What a disappointment. The story is so simple - "The good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things" - disguised in a racial environment to make it wise, sophisticated and meaningful. It is not lacking any subtlety. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens will be telegraphed and then re-executed if you missed the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this to convince and convince the audience, it must portray the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; It's not just a series of 180-degree changes in the actions of each character. <br /> <br /> Halfway, I really did not want to waste any more time on it, but I thought I would stick to it if it got better; Big mistake, I should have stopped - it just got worse.
