Oh, what a disappointment this movie is. I can not believe it was headed by Wajda. There is virtually no plot, and 90% of the movie is made up of various people who enter and leave the screen while faintly trying to interact while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes at the end, but at that time I simply stopped trying while suppressing my yawn. <br /> <br /> Almost the entire movie is filmed with a handheld camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of "personal immediacy," but most of the film is not personal or immediate. Instead, the constant twitching of the camera made me seasick. To be honest, there are some great shots (no pun intended), but nothing that makes you "Wow!" To go. <br /> <br /> If you are unfamiliar with the Katyn massacre, the movie will go scratch your head. If you know something, you'll scratch your head too, maybe for a variety of reasons. In fact, the film keeps saying and repeating that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point keeps pounding, as if someone in the audience had to be convinced of this fundamental historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers were not injured in the other Soviet POW camps and released in 1941. It is also never sufficiently explained HOW MANY people perished, although the number 20,000 is thrown in some cases. > <br /> Acting is appropriate if only Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Lt. Jerzy) give remarkable performances, but they can play for a total of 10-15 minutes. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been selected for their matinee looks rather than for their acting skills, but I will not mention their names. Suffice to say that they are definitely NOT the Oscar material, so any claim that this film was "robbed" of the Academy Award is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sound of the film is also wrong. On the one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama, on the other hand it resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda such as a Russian soldier ripping the Polish flag and cleaning his boots. Then there are some enigmatic scenes that have no bearing on the plot, like a couple climbing on a roof, or the dissolution of Cracow University. <br /> <br /> There are many missed ways to make this movie more interesting B. Add the political perspective to the story or show the discovery of the tombs in Germany or even depict Anna's journey from the Soviet-occupied part to the German-occupied Krakow , All of these aspects could have made up most of the movie, but are reduced to a few minutes instead. At the end, we get a collection of loose-fitting, confusing, boring scenes about the Poles' response to one of their greatest tragedies of World War II. Not very convincing and not worthy of Wajda at all.
