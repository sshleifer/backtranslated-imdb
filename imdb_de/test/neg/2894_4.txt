This is a very boring movie with poorly developed characters, undergrounds that go nowhere, and barely bearable acting. It looks like a badly thought-out rip-off of "2001". <br /> <br /> The only things worth paying are the sets, costumes and visual effects. But that was not enough to keep me from taking a nap. I want to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the spaceflight sequence, for nights when I'm having trouble falling asleep.
