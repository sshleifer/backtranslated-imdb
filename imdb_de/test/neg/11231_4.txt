A few years ago, I recalled an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the "strength" of the "strong women" Rozzie R. played was partly due to her ability to stand by her husband (even if he was not worth it). I thought of this essay after seeing Crimes of Passion. Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She is the object of affection for two men: the crazy priest, played by Anthony Perkins, and a mild white bread boy whose marriage is slowly fading. And she will not let any of them leave her until ... <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end - but I will say that this is ultimately the fantasy of Bland Whitebread Boy. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he can not hide the fact that this movie is basically a 40's melodrama for the MTV generation. Apart from the retrograde class and gender policies, these old black-and-white films are revolutionary in comparison.
