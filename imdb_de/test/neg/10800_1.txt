This jug of doodoo has won a prize? You must have desperately tried to spend a price on something. This movie stinks of tiny Bopper stuff and it made me sick. Fortunately, I saw it alongside Mike and the bots from MST3K, making it bearable. Terrible acting, unsettling mother / daughter moment, stupid premise, if you want a bad movie here, that's it. Be warned, but look at it with Mike and the bots or you'll suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 I still can not believe it won a prize and the director defends this * && ^ $$ # $ ^ && piece ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @ movie!
