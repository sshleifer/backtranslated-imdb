When the movie starts, it's obvious how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is enormous, Stanley looks like death is over. Apparently he was terminally ill during production and obviously had lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live for a decade and a half, he looks like a dying man. When I saw the movie, I was shocked to see how many Pratfalls Stan was experiencing - I half expected him to drop dead in the effort. I really can not understand why they retired because of their health - especially when the story and production values ​​are as bad as in this movie. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to go when Antoine, a stateless person, is literally dropped into their boat, and they begin their journey to find the island. On the way they discover that Giovanni has stowed, but still the four men become friends and land on another island. It seems like paradise and they are all very happy. A little later, a pretty young lady comes along and everything looks great. Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place is flooded with Rifflaffen. Eventually, the mob decides to hang up the four men and take power - at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men will be protected. But one thing is not FUN - and that's unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy movie. It's not a bad movie, but certainly not a good one. A sad ending to her brilliant career. <br /> <br /> All actors except the duo are dubbed in English because the film was filmed in France. It's not the worst movie they've made (this would be THE BIG NOISE), but it's very close !! It's painful to watch this movie, as if you were cleaning up people after a serious accident.
