When I read the reviews by Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, "Huh?" It was so confusing. To be on the safe side, I watched the movie and what do you know? It's a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Some scenes have been changed to reflect the full essence of indianness, but the rest is a direct deduction from the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is not a remake for remakes, but it's one that's so poor that it hurts me just to see it. I moaned so much looking and realized I was not the only one doing that! One guy actually went out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop making comedy roles. He yells and whines too much. Why can not he just take it easy? He does not live up to the original role played by Adam Sandler. He has no feeling for Sandler's weird timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she is not a Drew Barrymore either. The scene in which she stands in front of a mirror and tries to pronounce her new last name ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Pugalia"), does not fit to Barrymore's version ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia"). I was embarrassed to see this scene, even though I loved the original. The music is not so bad. It's probably the only salvation of this otherwise terrible movie! Avoid this at all costs!
