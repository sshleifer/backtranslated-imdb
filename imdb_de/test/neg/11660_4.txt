Like most musicals of that time, you have to check the reality on the door. Broadway MELODY from 1938 is neither credible nor plausible from afar, but in its strange way it is fun. This movie is really just an excuse to perform the stars' talents. Some scenes just happen as if they were in a review and not in an action-oriented movie. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland shines and it is a pity that she has so little to do with not much left on the tailoring floor One of the most insane events is how Eleanor Powell starred in a Broadway show Robert Taylor says it will be work, work, work from morning to night. Several scenes go by and there is no work, no rehearsals ... NOTHING. She needs money to win a horse in an auction. She has no money. Will not she be paid if she rehearses? Taylor has to borrow money to help. He should be a great producer. He has no money??? In any case, these are just two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are pretty wonderful, which prevents total loss. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better than Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
