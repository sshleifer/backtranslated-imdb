Can I just say that I'm a fan of bad movies? And that is a really bad movie. There are 100 passengers on the front, 3000 snakes, but I think it is more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> The snakes do not do anything particularly interesting, the whole movie does in fact start off with little. Although there are occasionally a great shot of pulsing arms and green buddy (bad movies must have green buddies, right?). But then the end comes and will literally knock you off in hysteria. And for this movie gets a boost of up to 2 *. <br /> <br /> There are certain movies around the world that you want to show your friends so that you can watch the reaction in them. A certain event happens in them. <br /> <br /> For example The arrival of 'Big Man' in R Kelly's '' The Line 'in' Shark Attack 3 '(you will know it when you hear it) The arrival of the Mother Shark in' Shark Attack 3 'Almost every scene of' Troll 2 'The end of' Dracula 3000 '(for absolute unbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie is in this category. It's worth it to get through it. So, drunk, stoned, whatever your poison is, and watch this movie with some friends. <br /> <br /> Quite simply, if you like bad movies, get it, but do not confuse it with 'Snakes on a plane' ... there is no relationship. <br /> <br /> And do not pay more than a fiver.
