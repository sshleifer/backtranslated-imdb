If you do not like bad acting, bad editing, ridiculous dialogues, and incredible characters, you'll hate this movie. If you like it all, that is, if you're a Lynch fan, you'll love Mulholland Drive. This is probably the worst movie that can be rated in IMDB above 7.0. Outside of Naomi Watt's work, it will be difficult for you, competent actors in Mulholland. to find. The other female lead went to the "hide your face with your hands if you do not have the chops" drama school. Given the script they had to work with, it's a wonder all actors do not hold their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> Characters wander into and out of the film that do nothing to promote the plot. They have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulteress and their lover who plays a clich√©, a mafioso-like figure sitting in a dark room talking through an external voice box. Suffice to say that they manage to do a little more than fill the screen time. <br /> <br /> However, this is not so bad as to distract the viewer from the fact that the film has no recognizable plot. They will wait and wait for all the loose threads to come together, and in the end you will be extremely disappointed. For a writer, the most difficult thing to do at the end of a movie is to bring everything together in a credible way that makes everyone feel satisfied. The simplest thing a writer can do is create a lot of weird characters and insert them into scenes that are not related to the movie as a whole, and then take the few coherent threads that end up being put together for the movie be surprised because of. Guess which way Lynch is going? TO SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know you have a bad script if you have to resort to dream sequences to make sense of it. A dream sequence finally includes all sins. Dreams do not have to make sense. Everything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> The editing is similarly incoherent. Let's just say that good editing does not attract attention. Much of the way this movie is processed seems to be for the sole purpose of drawing attention to the editing. "Look at me ... You can see my editing ... Am I not a genius?" Uh, well ... NO! This movie has all the features of the worst and most selfish French movies. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so popular? My theory is that this is just another sign of the decline of our culture. Melodies are hard to compose, so let's listen to rap. Actions are hard to follow, so we'll let them go. Pictures are hard to paint, so let's pee in a cup and put in a crucifix. These are the symptoms of our time and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the suffering.
