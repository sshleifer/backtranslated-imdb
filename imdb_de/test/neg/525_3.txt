Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances by Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who gets distracted by the terrible performance of Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She kills the songs with her screeching voice and exaggerates a role she obviously does not understand. I also think that the choir has no snuff. They pull the pace and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is alright, but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done right. This production does not reach the level required by this material. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
