Basically a road movie. The gay, transsexual and other gender issues are very disturbing, especially when the child is involved. You have to hand it over to the costume designers. The actors were known only to Terence Stamp. I assume it was a very good performance, outside the normal range (or other). The film was flat overall, just a vehicle for the clever, bitchy joke. All in all, I can not recommend this.
