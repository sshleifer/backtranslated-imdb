The film 'Heart of Darkness', based on the book by Joseph Conrad from 1899, is a film with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic plot. If you've read the book, you know that little or none of the important story-making scenes have been included in the movie. In the book, so much is left to the imagination, and I feel that this is one of the parts that makes the book what it is. An example would be if Marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months, waiting for rivets, and excluding the entire scene from the movie. Again, once you've read the book, you would know that this scene in the book almost describes the main theme, the theme of uselessness. Finally, I think the film was too dry and too dry. However, not enough has been added to the original text and how history has become what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book "Heart of Darkness" (preferably the Norton Critical Edition), do not take the time to rent or buy the movie. However, if you've read the book, in my opinion, you'll appreciate the book much more if you decide to watch the movie. Eric 2007
