Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays pvc-clad slut Alexandra, Faust's loyal follower, a wicked entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the malevolent dwarfs break into a warehouse to steal a magical gemstone essential to their success. As he conducts a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the stupid mare inadvertently enters the pentagram she has drawn on the ground, resulting in the loss of the gemstone and the release of two tiny, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem that will not be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick will be worn around the neck of her former lover, police officer Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who raided examined on the warehouse and knows only too well what the evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, wise-cracking interdimensional half pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of crazy trouble as they try to find a way home. <br /> <br /> In the distorted movie world of Jim Wynorski, all women are big-breasted babes with the fashionable sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this movie - whether she's a police captain, a curator of antiques, or a mental patient in an asylum - is hot, hot, hot, and does not carry much, and that's the fact that's what else does completely unsurpassed piece of STV crap only bearable. <br /> <br /> But be warned, even though the semi-nude, high-quality Crumpet makes walking a bit easier, there's still much about this movie to guarantee it's termed as an ordeal: the acting is over Wood and the dialogue is painful; the black humor (as the DVD blurb describes it) is as weird as a knee, with the comedic chatter of Lite and Dark being particularly frightening; and the special effects are a bargain basement made up of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years ago. <br /> <br /> 3/10, only for the high bimbo quotient.
