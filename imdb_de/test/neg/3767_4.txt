Rocketship X-M should be viewed by any serious movie lover for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) It's one of the first - and the least - films that have no happy ending. Undoubtedly, the effect in America after the Second World War was deeper than today, but the sad ending adds the message of the film. <br /> <br /> 2) It's also one of the first films dealing with space travel in a serious way, using space as a valid setting for drama. Despite the lack of scientific background, the film is a dramatic food for itself. It's not so much a space drama, but a drama set in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious way that is not lost in sfx and big grasshoppers, men, or beasts. The impact of Martian society on nuclear destruction is clearly and openly presented. The fact that expeditionary crash survivors, as such, are unable to preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of grief to the tragic end. Sterno says you take Rocketship X-M with you.
