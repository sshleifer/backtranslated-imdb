Breathtaking blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, less sad widow in the hilltop villa telling her story to a television reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the well-bred horses of the community she is suspected of having been involved in the death of her older husband. This is James Brolin, who trusts as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama from Canada, based on an article published in the magazine Vanity Fair. It must be true! Whatever, it's far more romantic than a mystery and a very familiar story. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a gold digger hospice? That could happen, I think. And it's nice to see Brolin in Antwone Fisher after his dignified turn in a sizable role, even if he does not make it to the end of the picture. The end of the picture? He does not even make it to the beginning of the picture. Therefore, of course, flashbacks were invented.
