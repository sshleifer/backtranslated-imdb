Killjoy 2 surpasses the first movie just a bit. What has improved here is the play, the killjoy make-up and the story. This is more of a celebration, it does not have the supernatural elements like the first. In this episode, Killjoy kills his victims more normally, he does not set them on fire, and he does not shoot them with bullets in his mouth. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the end. A bit half-hearted, in fact it was half-hearted, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies. The first movie was seriously good, but the second one is better 10
