If it were possible to award negative stars, I would be for that stink bastard. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I'm doing a good shitty movie. I'm a big fan of movies like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics of the B-Cinema. <br /> <br /> But this movie makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like a winner of the Academy !! The dialouge is thus unnecessarily lengthy and is usually used inappropriately. (ie "I will condense now to your liking (yes, condense !!).) The spectacle would have been much better if they had had more logical lines. <br /> <br /> The story? What story, A count is in exile because his wife had leprosy? I'm still not sure if he's being counted, a (Rich?) fleet and the Captian of one of his ships are overthrown on the island? Humans who behave unnaturally? I like a lot in b-movies, it's a lot of charm, but that was just stupid ... plain stupid A salty lake-captian who sounds as good as a college professor - a fleet owner like that This guy did not have a clue how he should play it, a scene in which he looks Spanish, the next Englishman / European, the count who is not sure if he has one Reincarnation is or really DeSade (do not ask me how DeSade comes along in that direction 4 Beer, my A woman, my friend and I still could not figure it out. <br /> <br /> The Fear Factor: I could show this turkey to my little grandchildren and just worry that they're asleep by the horror movies of the early '60s, and some still have good shocks, but this thing ... had never a shock or even a hint of fear. <br /> <br /> The info on the back says: "This movie contains scenes that are so alive and humiliating that they will surpass your worst nightmare." The ONLY humiliation is to watch this movie. It's 90 minutes (the case says it's 74 minutes.) Of your life you will not get back. <br /> <br /> I only paid one dollar, yes one dollar for this and another movie. I still feel like I owe fifty cents even if I just sat there. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: Dungeon Of Harrow had NO named Harrow in it, but he had a nice cardboard dungeon.
