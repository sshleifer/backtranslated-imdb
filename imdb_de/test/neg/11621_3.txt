I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really could not understand those who did not like it. But I can not defend this nonsense. Follow spoiler. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters are now regularly inexplicably doing stupid things: <br /> <br /> If Starbuck thinks she knows where the earth is, why should not she Send? in a bird of prey? Would the admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the college elect its newest member, the unelected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience under his belt and is the son of a man whom they distrust. Would Adama and Starbuck send Gaeta AND Halo without senior officers? Would Adama get a man to have sex with Cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet? I just do not buy anything from it. Second, while I accept it Until the end of the third season, there were miracles and references to God, now everything is totally exaggerated. I started to look at BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, not a biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to be reasonably intelligent, and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the crazy developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character on the show, but he seems to be totally crazy now. Not illogical considering what he went through, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All characters seem to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third party (some godlike being). This is not a good drama, it is annoying and a writing cop out. <br /> <br /> OK, what are the good points? Nice fight at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well represented) when viewed in isolation. A good final scene, a nice winding curve of a development. <br /> <br /> But that's not Sci Fi, it's fantasy. I can not imagine how the authors can find that out.
