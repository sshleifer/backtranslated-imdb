This was a shitty, miserable movie based on sublimated male fantasies. Too bad it was based in Texas, an otherwise excellent state. I would not recommend this movie to anybody, and wished it had never come into my consciousness because I am so irritated now that I waste my brain cells, even if I have the slightest attention to it.
