I look back to high school and it amazes me that I never went deeper than Marvin in this BAD movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character, whose bad luck is getting worse. Despite his intelligence, he manages to be bullied, exploited, supports his lousy Deadbeat Dad, and many other weak points, including a reckless assault that we say does not go quite to plan. Of course, the viewer does not feel empathy in this film, so this catastrophic gloom will bounce off like harmless zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you feel bad, just let the movie in and you'll smile and say, "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
