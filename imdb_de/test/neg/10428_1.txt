The bubbling, scattered and sometimes suspicious report by journalist Bob Woodward about the rise and fall of actor John Belushi becomes a totally misjudged film, a nebulous "fantasy" staged by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital , Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "The Shield") finds himself in the awkward position of portraying Belushi, making a journey to death through his life, and re-creating the "Saturday Night Live" hits that are now becoming a reality Belong to TV history. It's like watching someone try and try - Lucy Lucille Ball - that's not possible. The reason why Belushi's death was so painful was that it was unique. Chiklis makes a notable attempt to look at the part, and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue. Still, it's an adventure, and no actor - no matter how talented - could have saved it. * from ****
