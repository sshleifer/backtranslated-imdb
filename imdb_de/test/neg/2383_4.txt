Synopsis Correction: The end does not show how Ben travels online for men. He is looking for Arabic language courses at the Presido Military Acadamy in San Francisco. Maybe to participate in the war in Iraq as a translator (many years of dishonorable dismissals of "D'ont ask D'ont say that translators have been (they are now a big drawback) Ben also spoke Russian.) This movie is one good time capsule of living in Manhattan, but a bit of non-reality here, mostly a good laugh about Lame social skills and the sad portrayal of "grown-up," twenty things that do not go beyond college party mode Changing scene in Manhattan (somehow it always stays on the edge of the same BS) <br /> <br /> Watch the films "Englishman in New York" and "The New Twenty" together, both good for nostalgia I think the movie "Twenty" shows how far the blurring between gay and straight has developed. <br /> <br /> These two movies are GAY Time Travel For Sure !!!! ENJOY
