I've seen the MST3K version of this movie, and it's a bad movie - but it's not nearly as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least the movie has a few production values ​​and apparently has a competent editor (unlike the films that are really horrible). The main problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters. The main character, Marv, is so pitifully sullen that he practically asks about all the bad stuff that happens to him. And he's not very smart either, or he would have found out that he was keeping away from the mischievous girl Betty. And even miserable than Marv is his father, who is just a drunken loser. The highlight of the film is the Heist sequence at the end, but even if performed so faintly, any excitement that the movie might have added is missing. At least, this movie was made for a very funny MST3K episode, as Mike and the 'Bots do a great job and make fun of it.
