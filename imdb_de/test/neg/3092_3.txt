This movie should have been a lot better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is a great actor, but even he could not save the story of a young woman searching for the truth after her sister's death. Warning about the spoiler: The truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs. Not much and not so interesting. The movie is also overloaded with far too many flashbacks and voice-overs, and it lacks dramatic steps. All in all, this is definitely worth it - not recommended.
