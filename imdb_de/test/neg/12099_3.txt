Cheesy 80s horror genre favorites Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash as well as Brenda Bakke are some of the outstanding actors in this story about a haunted fitness club. Dumb dialogues and some evil gore effects make this film visible. Not bad, but not great either. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogues and spectacles. Only for B-movie fans. <br /> <br /> B
