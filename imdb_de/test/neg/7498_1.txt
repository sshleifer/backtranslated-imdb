Hi everyone - at what it's worth, I'm in PhD studies on Indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a year of field work, most of it in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big movie fan So in general, I went out as often as I could and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This is what I have seen in the theater since it was first opened, and soon afterwards it was happily closed. <br /> <br /> Who was the intended audience for this movie? The spoiled women and daughters of the Indonesian superelite, whose antics are weakly and ineffectually parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford a single meal, let alone a full meal, in the movie's central restaurant? Or gay Indonesian men, whose dilemma in the Muslim society of the country is reduced to absurdly simple, self-proclaiming sermons. <br /> <br /> If all of this was not bad enough, the soundtrack was either so recorded or mixed that even indigenous Indonesians could not hear many of the lines. In short, if you're looking for an innovative gay-oriented movie from a region of the world look for, which is one of the least inclined to produce such an animal, forget it. "Westerners" from the early 80s or "My Beautiful Laundrette" from the same era succeeds much better in giving a happier face to dealing with homophobia by showing that he does not speak through incessant, verbose scenes. All in all an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can not raise all its children and keeps them from getting well.
