If you look at the making of this DVD - they tell you what they are trying to do here - they tell the biblical story of good versus evil and try to preach it to a mainstream movie audience. In a modern society like ours, the movie fails. There are far too many sheep in this movie. People today are too powerful for this kind of preaching. <br /> <br /> As far as acting, directing and technical functions are concerned, they are fine. Chuck Norris is actually fine as an angel, because Norris' unpredictable performance as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers in the 1960s.
