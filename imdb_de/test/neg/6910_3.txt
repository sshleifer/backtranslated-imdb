This series presents not the British view of the Revolutionary War, but also an anti-American view. The underlying theme of the series is that a quiet majority of the colonists enjoyed British rule; the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose sole purpose was to force Britain into a violent civil war; that the American proponents of the revolution and the militia were racist, violent louts involved in the fight. Clearly, the author Richard Holmes' intention is for the viewer to extrapolate these properties in a straight line from the American population of 1775 to the present day. <br /> <br /> For example, in the episode "The Shot Heard Around the World," Holmes expresses a dark image of the Boston massacre, in which he claims the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man who was killed in the revolution was intentionally "balanced." Holmes claims that the portrayal of Attuck as a black man was a bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never tells how he knows that. And there is more. Holmes goes too far to work in a single, unfounded cruelty: the desecration of the corpse of a British soldier. He compares the American militia with the Viet Cong and the Mujahadeen - without mentioning the differences in the goals of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Supposedly this series was created in response to Mel Gibson's "The Patriot". It says a lot when a scientist feels the need to respond to any issue on Mel Gibson. Instead of portraying the British viewpoint, Holmes really did seem to have a sensational, anti-American outlook, and he himself made himself historian to Roger Corman - a strictly third-rate strike.
