I am really disappointed with this work. It is quietly flat, repetitive, usually inaccurate, and sometimes close to being wrong. I think it's done for elementary school, especially because it repeats itself over and over again, leaving big gaps. A small child may actually enjoy and learn from it, but a better way to appreciate a child's theoretical physics is to read books such as "A Brief History of Time" or "The Tao of Physics." If you are familiar with the topic at a very simple level, you will not receive any new information or views from this series. Do not waste your time with it. Beautiful eye candy.
