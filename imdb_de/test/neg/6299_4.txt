This movie does not try. For non-Australian audiences, it may be appealing as a travelogue, but for the native, it's just boring. Anyone living here knows that Broken Hill is a harsh, harsh, isolated mining town. If a few cited fruits appear on the train, everything is so predictable. Where did I find this worn topic? Oh yes - city mouse and land mouse. Spare us. <br /> <br /> I always hoped it would get better, but after the scene from Broken Hill I could see where the trip went, so turn off the TV and go to bed.
