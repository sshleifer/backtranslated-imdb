Comedy is a tough animal to overcome. Ishimoto fails as a writer and director on all accounts. Some things, like making movies that are funny, just have to be left to the pros. 1 out of 10 Terrible. That was not funny. I tried to laugh, but it was just not funny. I was not the only one who did not even laugh at the Chicago Festival, at least at the show I saw. Simply very bad, sorry :(
