A Brazilian cable television presents "Yadon Ilaheyya" this month in its "Cult" channel. I saw the trailer, listened to the ad and decided to watch this movie. It's an absurdly boring, presumptuous, dumb, meaningless, incoherent crap about the conflict in the Middle East, and together with "Soultangler" these are certainly the worst films I've ever seen. I've actually wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap. How can this film be awarded and nominated in Cannes? My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
