Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapeze pilot, is under attack for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high wire cohorts. Meanwhile, there is an elaborate "camp show" for army soldiers and personnel, and the entire studio of M-G-M has been shown to participate in the fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (indistinctly), with acts like Kay Kyser and His Orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter, and the M-G-M Dancing Girls (dressed like vegetables). Red Skelton does a little bit of work with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comedies suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the supposedly live audience (they are terribly quiet until the editor sees them as overreactive shots). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a Jumpin 'Night at Carnegie Hall (unlikely accompanied by classic pianist Jos√© Iturbi, whom Judy calls "hep"). The production is brilliant, but the manic energy feels wrong. ** from ****
