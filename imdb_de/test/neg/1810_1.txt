Taylor Deemer Mrs. Drake German 10 PIB B4 March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> A shot in the dark <br /> <br /> It's hard to survive the movie Heart of Darkness because it's unbelievably exciting , The book on which this movie is based initially has little effect. The idea of ​​turning it into a movie seems to be a completely different idea anyway, which basically guarantees a failure. <br /> <br /> Most of the book is about the spiritual journey of a young sailor named Marlow, who has a job through the many dangers of the Congo and the people as a whole. I think the scriptwriter severely failed to capture the essence of Marlow's travels while capturing the film. The biggest problem between light and darkness was completely missed. That's the main point of the book, and if that's not translated into the movie, there's only 100 minutes left of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> Since this is the case, the question is asked, why would someone make this into a movie? An even better question could then be asked, who would like to see it? It is really a chore to see. Had it not contributed to a grade in my English classes, I would never have thought to watch the movie. I would never recommend this movie. Heart of Darkness will remove all its insight and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. The novella is a torture until reading the last twenty pages or so, but in retrospect it's a pretty decent book. The film is like a setting in the dark, in the world there is no chance to hit its target. <br /> <br /> How can a book dealing exclusively with the mental processes and realizations of darkness be presented in the physical, visual sense? I feel that it is impossible to show thoughts exactly. I also have the feeling that the time difference between book and film creates main points that do not even add up. The novella Heart of Darkness was released in 1902, while the film version of Heart of Darkness dates from 1993. The 91 years between the two could be a reason for the seemingly different terrain. The novella seems to have much tougher conditions, and the film does not show the prehistoric feel of the Congo. The Congo just seems to be a different place in the film, not the dark, inhumane place where the book paints this attitude. I feel it removes another important element that truly contributes to the novel. <br /> <br /> With two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie, the little decency contained in Heart of Darkness is gone. When the controversy between light and dark is the biggest issue. If you do not include it in the movie, the entire movie seems to be incredibly meaningless. It's boring, uninspiring and a great waste of time. There is no reason to see it. The book has no meaning anymore. If it is necessary for any reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs.
