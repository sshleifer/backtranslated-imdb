This Swedish Splatter movie tries to parody / imitate American horror movies like "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. The writer / director / actor / cinematographer Anders Jacobsson and the writer / producer / actor / makeup makeup supervisor Göran Lundström (did I miss anything?) Were obviously inspired by Sam Raimi. But the camera work is a bad copy of what's in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this movie, but I did not do it. <br /> <br /> The movie bothered me rather than entertained me. It's trying to combine tension and comedy, and the end product has given me a sense of oppression, though it was not scary or shocking. The combination of different genre elements made this movie very strange. I was never sure if it should be scary or funny. <br /> <br /> The story is quite imaginative except for the hospital showdown, but I did not like the way it was staged for the reasons above. The gore & make-up effects are remarkably good and at least the sequences of "Loose Limbs" were very entertaining as the filmmakers did not mix fear and jokes in these scenes. All in all a weird movie that you either hate or love. Rest in pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stay with American productions)
