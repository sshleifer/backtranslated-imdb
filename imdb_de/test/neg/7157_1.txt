Include spoilers! These guys are total cheating, they did the Lost Roles of Judas and said Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now that? This is clearly an attempt to destroy a religion and should be illegal. You have no proof, it could clearly be a setup. How can we know and trust these people? What if they carved the tomb and "said"? And in the end, do they SEAL the tomb forever, so that no one can research there? How stupid do you really think we are? Should we trust that they are trustworthy people? Who really found a tomb of Jesus? And how can you stab all Christians like that? I think that this documentary should NEVER be made by a non-religious man. It can ONLY be done by a Christian and I mean the DIRECTION AND SCRIPTURE. It should be illegal for Jews to film a Christian-related documentary, especially if the documentary alleges that Jesus is not a "Son of God risen" (no objection, it could be Buddhists or atheists, anything but Catholic) <br /> For me, this is a total joke, a mere documentary scam. They sealed the grave so that people "would not" think about it. This documentary is a total failure. How stupid do you think the Christian people are? And what about the Lost Pages of Judas? It was also a total scam, they said in the end seriously, like, "We know some people who could do fake roles, and nobody would know. It was a fake." Oh my God, they just said it ... "Dude, we might have done that" ... This kind of documentation should be illegal, it's a slap against all Christians and Catholics behind which they should stand! I am not a fanatic, I am a former Jew, now atheist, but I have courage and will always respect the religion of other people. The part Israel orders to seal the tomb forever was PRECIOUS !! PRECIOUS!!
