If good intentions made a movie great, this movie could be one of the greatest movies ever made. The film has great actors, one main director, one major theme - at least a potentially significant theme, an undertone of existential world fatigue in the fifties, aerial scenes that should have inspired both the senses and the imagination, and characters that could be deeply watched. It's about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way. <br /> <br /> Less than ten years after the movie, I knew Air Force officers who used my R.O.T.C. Classes at the university. They were intellectuals. They have thought deeply about their work. You have a sense of humor. One was a crew member on the first plane that had dropped a hydrogen bomb. I was wondering if any of them died in Vietnam. I can imagine that they flew missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film fails. The film lacks visual interest, drama, the expression of emotion and celebration of patriotism that underlines the narrative. No actress has used the June Allison in this movie. Her Susan Holland is a woman who would flee, not hug. Colonel James Stewart (who was then colonel) makes a good stab at this role as Lieutenant-Colonel (and later Colonel) Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing he does in this role is to bite into a sandwich. I'm not joking. Stewart was good at biting sandwiches like The Spirit of Saint Louis. <br /> <br /> You might think of Ted Williams, but I do not see it when I see Mr. Steward in the role. I think of William Holden as Lt. Harry Brubaker at The Bridges in Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who seems to be wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> Footage taken on a B-36 looks like cut-outs from commercials for an airline. Although beautiful, the aerial photographs are banal. For the time, they might have impressed the audience. The crash in Greenland involves unexplained modeling. They expect the result to be good. <br /> <br /> The undertone - the subtext - for the film addresses the boredom that Air Force flight crews must have felt during their long missions. The banality with which the Air Force has done its business - a business like each other. You can imagine how a director of La Nouvelle Vague could explore this subject, and then you begin to think about how someone with fantasy could have made this film. Little moments will be missed. As crews returned from long missions, the crew members received a shot of Scotch and a massage before discussing the mission. That might have helped. The banality was the image the Air Force wanted and Mr. Mann put the brass. Maybe the movie works in that sense, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I grieve when I watch the movie because I think all of us, directors, actors, crew, spectators and members of the movie Weapons Force might have been much more fun and enjoyable than we get here. <br /> <br /> I do not think that this film Dr. Strangelove or 2001 had to be what both predicted, but he had never realized potential Nevertheless, I like to look at it. I think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated locations. Here a certain sense of honor is celebrated, and I celebrate this honor. <br /> <br /> I certainly understand why people who praise this film here and elsewhere appreciate it. If there was no deliberate mistake, I would get a 10 from me. <br /> <br />.
