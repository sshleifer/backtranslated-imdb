This horrible piece of tripe was loosely based on a true story involving two family members of mine (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This movie is offensive; Apart from the fact that it was not a very good movie anyway, it in no way captures what it was like to lose such a close family member, and completely leaves out those who were truly affected by the tragedy of real life. > <br /> As for the director; He managed to take advantage of the misfortune of a family for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could have given him a zero I would have. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
