If you can stand the campiness, you should laugh out loud in this movie several times. At least for me. I just want to mention one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "fish" "swimming". The sound that accompanies these recordings is also great. <br /> <br /> One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun. Seeing him as "The Greatest American Hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago and has not been very visible since. He seemed somehow depressed in this movie. Someone gives him a good job on a good show or something.
