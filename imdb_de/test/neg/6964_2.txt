Bela Lugosi as god? Transvestites, who were discussed in a film in the fifties? Golly must be an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Looking at this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter ego Glenda. If this movie were done now, I could somehow see Kevin play Kline Glen / Glenda. Note that all crossdresser alter egos are versions of their male name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). It tries to portray it sympathetically as the mental disorder it is, rather than graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Wood manages to sneak into Bondage and S & M sequences in his first story of Glen / Glenda. Along with these fast-paced scenes, Satan shows up, obviously with a bad hair day. There is no dialogue and tempo, but the movie is pleasing in context - the crazy world of Ed Wood. Sterno says, don your favorite lace panties for this movie.
