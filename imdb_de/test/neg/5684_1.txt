I saw the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. So I wind all the way to the end. This film must be the worst in the category of cheap sci-fi films. Bad drama, cast, instructions, Lara Craft custom imitation, story, storyline, everything! Throughout the movie, I think there may only be 6 to 7 people in the cast, but only 2 of them started in the entire movie. I had expected something like the Starship Trooper, but there was nothing nearby. The movie title and the picture on the DVD cover made me fool. Do not waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Come to think about it, I wonder, why did you even bother to release bad movies like this one?
