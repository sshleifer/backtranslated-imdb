A very, very, very slow, aimless movie about a desperate, impulsive young man. Not sure who was lost anymore - the flat characters or the audience, out of which almost half. <br /> <br /> When trying to do art with black and white and skilful camera angles, the film was disappointing - even more ridiculous - because the acting was bad and the plot and lines were almost nonexistent. Very little music or something to talk about. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo was looking for a song that ran through his mind. He goes to a used record shop to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sellers before they find the album. The cute scene promised, but from there it went downhill. The rest of the film lacks the art, the charm and the meaning. When it comes to emptiness, it works, I think, because it's empty. Wasted two hours.
