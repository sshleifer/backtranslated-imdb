Boring, ridicule and stupid "Submerged" is a waste of time. The shootings were a joke, real people are not only open without cover and hope to be shot first! So many things are wrong or bad, it's not worth listing them except a big mistake. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of LA and the water is 100 feet deep ??? Even so, none of the humans would have survived decompression when exposed to 100 feet of pressure for 20 hours. Just terrible.
