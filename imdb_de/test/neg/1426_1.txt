Which way forward? on TCM (UK) it's a really horrible movie. If I had paid for the pictures, I would have gone out. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess of a movie. Byers (Lewis) and his buddies prance in out-of-the-way uniforms from an Italian science-fiction movie of the 1960s. Was the CND / Peace symbol on the Ironic uniforms? The sets were from 1970, I'm sure a Hollywood TV lot could have offered a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of racism. The movie bothers veterans. <br /> <br /> Not funny, as Lewis got everyone to make another movie.
