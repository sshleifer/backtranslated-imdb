Not many people remember "The Carey Treatment," and I can not say I accuse them. Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (ie between "Pink Panther" movies) and for a story of a detective (Coburn) who wants to solve a murder in his hospital, is actually quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> Coburn is as always reliable and O'Neill is beautiful as always, but it just seems to be something missing in the process. The twists and turns of the story are not very exhausting, and even the climax, which is supposed to be nerve-wracking, is instead a real thrill. <br /> <br /> as it was based on a book by Michael Crichton. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Crichton did not write a sequel. <br /> <br /> A star. "Carey," Coburn.
