I saw that with my kids, they love it, but she was not overrun by a reindeer in the song, but what the hell in that crappy movie she hit off the sled is what the hell why when my kids heard the sinking , they thought it was good, but we saw that this was like "Dad, why did grandma". So my kids say grandma, however my kids said so. "Daddy, why was grandma hit by a daughter? Sled?" I told them that the movie was shitty, they agreed, it's sad, why should any dog's name be "doofas" who is just stupid & if everyone's black Daphne looked like a Dang Emo Goth girl one looked like Goths and in the song where they found Grandma on the floor, I think she died in the song, but in this one funny, crappy movie she had gone, I think they should drop that show. Everyone would love this from 10
