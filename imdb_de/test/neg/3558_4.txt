A beautifully highlighted scene from the 1930s offers the viewer a great interest in the early 21st century; Unfortunately, "London Belongs To Me" is not recommended, apart from whipping English charm. All problems are based on the completely fuzzy story. The main plot refers to the actions of the young fellow Richard Attenborough, the problems he faces, and how the community he lives in assembles to save him from the laws of society. Or so. The main problem with this is that Attenborough's character attracts everything and, frankly, almost every accusation is to blame why the movie (and all the characters) have so much sympathy for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances when he really is not; and besides, he does not show much remorse for his actions, but only cares to get things he did not intend. Alastair Sim gets a lot of time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plotting line, and you wonder what he does there (though Sim is always superb, as usual). You know that there is a problem with the structure if the main chart is constantly affecting the subplot, but not the other way around. After a modest pace and a cautious set-up, the storyline completely disintegrates in the last 20 minutes, with a profoundly unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that does not even show us whether Attenborough's character has evolved from previous practices. The movie does not stop, it just stops. <br /> <br /> Although the acting, the direction and the general feeling of the film can all be praised, the story and the structure of the play are constantly undercut. One last important point: Alec Guinness has related his performance in the superior movie "The Ladykillers" to the performance of Alastair Sim in this film until both characters had almost identical first scenes.
