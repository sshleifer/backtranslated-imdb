<br /> <br /> This film is best enjoyed in a large audience with the giggles. <br /> <br /> Very often the characters in KADOSH are staring at nothing. Very intense, unhappy faces, very thoughtful, very serious. During these moments, there is a very serious-sounding music, just to make sure that the audience is aware that the scene is not fun and games. <br /> <br /> The entertaining parts of this film come between the many pensive ones staring We learn that the women of the KADOSH community have two roles. One is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The second is that you stay busy to get your husbands out of work. What do these men do with their free time? They pray. And we learn that they are praying aloud at home, "Thank you for not creating me as a woman." And in their place of worship, they pray to thank for having functioning male genitalia. Along with prayer, there are many scenes of insane antics, screaming and endless pushing and body rocking back and forth. and mixed with everything are many complicated and bizarre (or simple but equally strange) ritual activities. <br /> <br /> The cream of unwanted comedy comes from sex. The imagery of a hot and disturbed man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while trying not to drop his cap off the scalp is unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is funny, but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face at the feet of his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis). Oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality ... but NO! The rubbing of the feet stops before anything happens, and the husband begins to rock his autistic-looking head and rock his body until the scene ends. Technically, there are some interesting pictures and pleasing applications of light and colors by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more believable, educational and entertaining treatment of the need to be an impure woman who is not worth keeping a book in a book In the world where respect is measured by speed with which a man can quote a sentence from ancient scriptures, I propose the YENTL by Barbra Streisand. <br /> <br />
