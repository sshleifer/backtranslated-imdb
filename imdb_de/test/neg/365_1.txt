I say "flick" because it does not deserve the name "movie" and certainly not "movie". I regret that I paid the rent, and although I had never left a movie before, it would have been if I had seen it in a theater. A future society in the future (oooh, THAT'S original), many burning drums, inexplicable ambient light shining through windows, a thankless woman and her shock-absorbed son ... the list goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell influences the rough voice of the stereotypical loner; They know how Eastwood was killed. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child, but he is the same age in the flashbacks! Talk about a bad memory! I stared in disbelief when little boy Abe accidentally pushes a code into a door and opens! No tension, religious (which religion?) Subtleties ... the saddest of all: I expected better from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> Probably the worst movie experience in my life.
