After reading other reviews on this site, we were not sure if we could criticize this movie because it did not sound bad enough. After 2 minutes, however, we knew that we would make another flop. There is no summer without ice cream, but this film served a melted, acidic broken-ground ice cream cone (you know you're sticky and dirty looking for a nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? It seemed to be a psychotic iceman driving through the neighborhood. That's it. Otherwise nothing happens. What are the prerequisites for becoming an iceman in this humble city? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital that man knows. This hospital was plagued with clowns, graffiti, artificial sunflowers and oversized syringes on the head. 2. Do you have extremely bad hygiene and a mutant face to drive the kids out. 3. Make sure that your truck is equipped with severed body parts, cockroaches and eye white! <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are pure B-movie caliber. Mixed with a number of unknowns is who except ... a trailer trash version of Macaulay Culkin !! Even his courageous charm could not save this kick in his pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this film. The whole concept of the film stunk! Who would shoot an ice cream man while driving? Gangster? Girlfriends? Vanna White? Who? We still have problems with this question. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has been responsible for the wardrobe for this film should immediately be blacklisted from Hollywood. Did you really think a pillow under a kids shirt would make the audience think he was really fat? Did you forget your arms, face, legs and all other body parts? Secondly, this film was filmed in 1995, but the dressing room seemed to have been picked out of a lame movie from the '80s, as evidenced by the white, high-strung trousers worn by the big brother while we were working on this messy production both serious cases of ADD. We had to leave the room to walk around aimlessly. In many places in the movie, we found that looking at a blank wall behind the TV set was more entertaining than the actual movie. We were stunned that this movie did not make it to the 100 mark. Then we took the tape out of the VCR and left it on the black top to melt like a below-average ice cream cone.
