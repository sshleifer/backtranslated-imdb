It's a shame when actors and actresses are involved in pure crap, probably because they were offered a lot of money. None of Helen Mirrens better career steps. The acting of "teens" is just awful, not helped by a script that is sometimes just incompetent. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above the box office average. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that you see on TV when there's nothing better and you've drunk half a bottle of wine and wait for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.
