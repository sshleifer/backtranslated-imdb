One of the worst gay related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story, it is difficult to comment on the actual movie. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) has revealed his life to all, I think he is quite criticized. And that is not difficult. Here goes. 50 Something Glen is a big pornstar who wants fame and fortune as a great singer. (I think 11 films make him a "star".) As a gay and forty I saw porn and did not recognize him or his lover. Personally, they all look the same to me with different hairstyles. Honestly, people, he's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. That's fine. The purpose of these films is about 6.5 minutes. So you all have the same requirements, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So Glen wants to be a serious singer dumping the porn industry, but he can not make anyone take him seriously. I wonder why? Was he so stupid as to think he could wash himself, undress and have sex in the movie? And, according to the film, it's not just porn movies he enjoys, he lives in a house with other "stars" where people can connect via webcams to their bedroom, the bathroom, and everywhere. It's $ 500 an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip gigs in clothing optional "hotels". Do something called meth, which I assume is a drug. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone tries to touch you at a club gig - because he's "legitimate" now. Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting figure that is not made of cardboard is the Oscar-winning gay screenwriter, who would not give his name. And considering that this is a documentary, porn is just like porn. You can say that he is most amused by the stupid bunny pornstar. Glen has a hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a pornographer to make him gay - club gigs. He tries to do the Svengalli routine. "Wear this." "Do not smile." "Say that" for control, but our anti-hero will not be controlled or what to do. First mistake: I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but when a budding vocalist chooses the Managers interviewed, they will not get very far. A little bit like: The one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client /> <br /> All this would not have been bad if not just a little information remained. Drum roll please. He is bad. He is shit. His vocal talents up there with Ashlee Simpson are hard to root for someone trying to make his dream come true - at 50! - does not work like normal people. No job Do not accept me. And after a few months scratching the surface of the music industry, he says, "Why do not I have a record deal?" What? Actors are waiters, writers work in simple newspapers or magazines - whatever This guy stands over it, that's true, he just wants his success now because he's decided to want it. "Wailing. Wailing Whining His lover leaves him back to return to the nurse, but I'm telling you, I do not want to that idiot who grants me medical care, both of them useless, airheads, the movie is useless unless you like Whine and Cheeesy people, do not waste your money on the shitty lives of useless people, there's a lot more interesting things that are at the foot of your shoe.
