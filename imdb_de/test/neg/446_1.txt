Funny and unnecessary sequel to a classic Bonafide. An American werewolf in London was undoubtedly a jewel in a movie: humorous, demented, with a touch of romance and so much, very British. Then came this abomination. You know that you are in real trouble when the discharges are so unlikely that you are happy when they are slaughtered, and actually begin to cheer for the lycanthropes. I tell you the truth, folks, I only got about halfway through this CGIed travesty before I lost the will to live and shut down. Absolutely pathetic and a lazy waste of time.
