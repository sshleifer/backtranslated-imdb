Some modern Janapese horror movies are very good. Strong action, scary moments, good acting, while others only ... Uzumaki unfortunately belongs to the latter camp. <br /> <br /> I will rate the movie based on 3 elements: Plot, Scary Factor and Drama. <br /> <br /> 1) Plot - true to the name of the film, the plot moves in a circle and never really explains itself. OK, the city is fascinated by the curse of the spiral, but why? And why are people acting so stupidly? There is a cursory attempt to explain what happened to the reporter. Unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> 2) Scary Factor - if this should be a horror movie, it has failed miserably. I can not really remember a good, spooky scene that's richly set up. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting - very monotonous. People go around saying meaningless phases. I can not really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are much better modern Japanese horror films with coherent plot and strong characterization. Do not waste time with this would-be.
