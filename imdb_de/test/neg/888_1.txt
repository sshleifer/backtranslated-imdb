I have seen many bad movies in my life. Date Movie. That was bad. But that ... that's just ... it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It's that simple. It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people. Oh, and it's not funny. It is terrible. So terrible. Chris Stokes may be a BET superstar, but he's an idiot. He can not write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to call him a weaker, lesser-known Uwe Boll. Except Uwe Boll's films are funny horrible, if you know what I mean. You can invite some friends, pop in Alone In The Dark, and have fun laughing and eating snacks with your friends. Chris Stokes is like that, unless you invite friends to see House Party 4 with you, nobody will laugh. Not even the biased black guy or the illiterate. I'm serious, I did not even laugh during the entire movie. The acting is awful and the movie looks like a bad indie movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie is just shit; Do not waste your time with this crap. It's disgusting.
