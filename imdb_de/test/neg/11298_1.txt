Hannibal must be the most horrible movie I've seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No conspiracy, minimal character development, questionable motives, bad dialogue, inferior behavior. What else can I say? If you have not seen it, do not bother. I would not rent the video at all and if you come on TV, change the channel. The only reason anyone would have to watch this movie is to see if the violent violence was up to all the hype (which, frankly, is why they added it). If you want to see how a Gug eats its own brain, then quickly move on to this part. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this movie? It's like someone just asked, "I wonder what Hannibal's doing right now," and we just drove along. In the beginning he is free and in the end he is free. In between, there is much complacency from Anthony Hopkins and the filmmakers. Julianne Moore bravely tries to breathe life into Clarice, but she gave her a standard script, and in my view she was doomed to a very bad story in the truest sense of the word. The only reason why it made so much money was because of the pointless violence they have added, and which leave you with a sense of contempt rather than the horror that you should feel at the end of the day rather give it a fat one fat raspberries!
