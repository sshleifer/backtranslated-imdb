This movie was a waste of time. It looks nice, beautiful settings, played nicely, seems serious and seems to lead somewhere, so you stay tuned and wait for a sensible payout. It does not happen. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that so much effort could be put into a movie, it was clearly very professionally done and has a result that does not seem to oppose a B-movie. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and watch a good French movie like Les Visiteurs (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can not remember the language in Europe Europe, but that's another great movie - hard, but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie seems promising, but it does not work.
