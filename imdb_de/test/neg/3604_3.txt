I really liked the movie 'The Emporer's New Groove', but seeing it was like coming home to see how your wife had "relationships" with a lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I should write 10 lines, but I do not know what else to say. I laughed a few times, but only because I drank. Such a movie should at least be funny when drunk. It was not. Maybe llamas are just funny and normal cartoon people are not. Either way, just stay with The Emporer's New Groove for a fun, Lama-themed movie. Line 10 is this line here.
