Synopsis: Kid is not accepted into any colleges. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can celebrate by using their parents' tuition. <br /> <br /> Wow. A paean of ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you think we're all OK, man, then this movie is for you. In addition, you need to understand the following: <br /> <br /> 1. Kids have it all - they just have to let it out. <br /> <br /> 2. The teaching really stifles the innate creativity with which everyone is born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4,300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you abolish these restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Unprepared speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Board of Education allows you to start a "chartering school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques", it is because they care about your best interests. (Not that they're willing to let go of ill-functioning students who will be working with fast food anyway.) <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the college comedy genres, Animal House. It follows the pattern pretty much. What is new here, however, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. It lacks the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the worthy part of university life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will condemn this movie to the last series of blockbusters. It's so one-sided that I wondered if it was an ironic self-reference for the entire genre - for about a minute. The film has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. It's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural, is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I would say that: I prefer to do something with Will Farrell, his comedies can be amazingly sophisticated.)
