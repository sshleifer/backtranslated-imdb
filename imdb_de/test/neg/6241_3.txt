I wanted to like this movie and certainly there is room for a psychological character movie that is not for the cheap thrill. However, to enjoy a movie, you need a credible storyline, some speed and cut, and a sense of involvement. In The Clearing, what begins as a fascinating mystery with kidnapping and unknown motives becomes a slow, thoughtless exercise. It does not really happen much, and the so-called character-driven angles (as the director puts it in his commentary) really do not make much difference. <br /> <br /> Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford tries to persuade Willem Dafoe. Dafoe gives his character a little nuance, as far as you can feel a little sympathetic to him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe was typed as a villain. He has gone to Typecasting's Christopher Walken Hall of Fame. Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her character's entry into the film was short and sweet, and I wondered why they even bothered to introduce their character. By far the biggest talent waste was Helen Mirren. In the commentary of the director, I only heard how great a talent is. I agree, she is a great actress. Why was not she used properly then? Only to the climax of this film can she show herself, but until then the viewer has stopped looking after him. Too bad, I liked parts of this movie, but as another reviewer wrote, once you know 'Halfway, you know the movie will not get much better.
