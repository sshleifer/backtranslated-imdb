It's about jealousy, it's about racism, about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to bring Shakespeare's Othello into the modern context. The actors, however, were not convincing enough to achieve this. There were extra bodies helping to put everything in perspective, but John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot in this film, which led to the fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, and eventually ended in Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the main character of the movie. He did not give enough evidence that Dessie Othello had cheated on Michael Cass of Richard Coyle. Instead, he just played a friend and gave a reason why she had "cheated". In the game Iago needed much more conviction to even suspect Othello. This change made the film more out of rage for false reasons than what the book was based on. However, the film had some good points. It turned the army scenes into a more racist group headed for the Black, where Othello is the head of the police. These scenes are made believable by the raging masses and burning fires. They are able to feel the amount of racism in the film, more than in the book. This book plays the modern scenes in a way that is easier to understand than written in Shakespeare's time. In the play in which Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, he is tortured, but in the film he is satisfied and Othello position. He never gets what he deserves and never gets caught telling Othello the lie until it's too late. I saw this as a downfall in the movie, because I think the villain has conceded his treasure to lies, and in the book he finds out from Rodrigo. Overall, the film could have done a better job based on the piece than what it did. I feel like the director of the film has skipped some of the most important parts of the piece that were mentioned or were there to make the piece flow, or rather to make a tragedy. I would say that you should read the book first to understand all the events of the movie. Otherwise, you may feel lost and confused.
