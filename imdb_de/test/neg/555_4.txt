I can accept the fact that this was the NEXT Karate child. Ralph Macchio can happily retire from the series, and while Hillary Swank is great for the role ... the plot of the movie is just awful. <br /> <br /> Mr. Miyagi's old buddy from World War II dies and lets his widow take care of her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die from an accident. The girl does not have any discipline yet, but she is the hero because the local ROTC ... what I explain right now, has gotten out to get her. They know the practice ... Miyagi takes them under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> It's hokey, cheesy, it's the 90s ... but that's not even the long and the short of it. My first case of "huh?" Why is there a "military department" in high school? I thought the stuff went out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside looms in his role as main heifer, since when is the military involved in a high school? My next point of criticism is that during the prom scene the militant bungee jumps scare the shit out of people ... why? The thing that struck me in all 4 movies was that the heels all of a sudden change faces after they've gone through the main character (Billy in Part 1, Sato in Part 2, Kreese in Part 3). This movie is no different. After Ned and his cronies have basically sabotaged the senior celebrity, blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank with the movie ..... Ironside tells them to beat them up and they're like "um ... no "Make a pathetic face, and make sure the characters did not do too much; B. blow up a hot rod in the air. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love story between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... crazy, but nothing too melodramatic, that's a breath of fresh air from the garbage that Ralph Macchio pulled in the first three films. <br /> <br /> I'll say for his own movie after watching the first 3 movies I can accept that it's more or less a spin-off ... but I can not accept the whole military thing Far too unusual to be taken seriously. If now Ironside and the crew were a wrestling / football team and he was the coach, THAT would have been more credible. Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is alright ... the rest is the same Whatever, the only highlight is blowing up the hot rod, which was cool 4 out of 10
