Whatever the committee of PC Enforcers is responsible for this movie has achieved something that I never thought possible: to take some really gifted actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) to make sure they are never in a closed one Room encountered. The feelings underlying the script are so peculiar and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine which audience would find this image appealing, let alone funny. Architecture students maybe? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually clever: Marcia Gay Hardin, all the shakes and rhythms in a bar, manages to spread more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the rest of the film sums up and multiplies by tenth power. As far as the other members of the cast are concerned, they probably do not want to include it in their CV.
