... Brian? What the hell were you in signing when I signed this? <br /> <br /> I saw it recently at a festival and it was greeted everywhere with howling laughter. As the credits rolled, many spectators streamed into their faces. <br /> <br /> The plot is a chunky merger of 'E.R.' and 'The X Files'; as cynically addressed to the television audience as it is possible to be sued without. The sequences involving the kidnappings are hilarious - both Yuzna's "Floating Off Bed" staging and the "Screaming Mad Georges wretched plastic alien" met with incredulous, mocking laughter. <br /> <br /> Limp, camp and stupid. My only hope is that it was a departure. As terrible as 'Return of the Living Dead 3' was good. Steev
