I had to rent some movies for my little cousin for New Year's Eve and she chose the Swan Princess: The Secret of the Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2. We both watched the movies while she was sleeping, I thought I could get some comments in. :) Although this is a very kitschy cartoon, it really was not that bad. You must admit that these conspiracies are new to children, and it could be a great introduction to these stories. Odette discovers that Derek has the magical secrets of Rosthoe and she tells Derek to destroy her immediately, but since he's a guy, he usually does not do that and tells her that no one could achieve the magic without his help. When a witch named Zelda gets hold of her, she finds out that Derek has torn down the last words of a spell she wants to destroy, and she abducts Odette to retrieve this information. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess: The mystery of the enchanted kingdom is stupid and predictable, but for the kids I would honestly say it's an attempt. It's so rare that we've had these clean-cut cartoons for days now, so I'll cut the movie a bit more loosely. It was just strange to see how all the voices suddenly changed. I grew up with the first, so I guess she just stuck in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
