I have absolutely no idea why I saw Ali G. Indahouse except that Salon seemed to have committed a crime when Sacha Baron Cohen was not nominated for an Emmy for his work on the Da Ali G Show. It is a safe bet that I will never see this show because the movie was absolutely nothing funny. Comedy? Torture was more like that. It was about the dumbest thing I watched. I have to admit that Rhona Mitra fascinated me. I had not seen her in anything. She was not on The Practice at the time I was watching, so I think I'll have to look up Boston Legal on one of those evenings to see her doing something that might be worthwhile.
