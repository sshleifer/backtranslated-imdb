A spaceship cruising the galaxy meets a mysterious cargo ship seemingly floating in space. The crew researches and hopes to use their cargo and procure the ship. Once the ship is aboard the ominous ship, it mysteriously detaches itself to fight itself and fight none other than Count Dracula or Orloff, as that creature calls itself. <br /> <br /> Not a bad start. I mean, it follows any number of typical sci-fi / horror plots. The genres have gone so far that even the most original story will inevitably create a comparison with other films. However, if you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the legend of Dracula and Vampires, and combine them with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, a crew that gets on and gets incapacitated to fight what they are forced to do The filmmakers are better off having some clever sleeves up their sleeve to make their mark on the well-known genre clips. <br /> <br /> Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this failure. Well, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing in their sleeves but their arms. <br /> <br /> This movie starts ominously enough, with a very poorly voiced voice from Caspar Van Dien, which provides essentially enough information to explain who that crew is on his ship. I should also point out that Van Dien's character is Van Helsing. And, oh, so smart, this Orloff character comes from the planet Transylvania in the Carpathian system. Seriously. I mean, come on, guys, we understand. Also, do not be stupid and use such names unless you have something special in the store. <br /> <br /> After Van Helsing's introduction to the crew, we basically captured a movie about this crew in a spaceship with a vampire loitering around. <br /> <br /> I'm a very forgiving crowd when it comes to low budget movies. Occasionally they can be brilliant, see Raimi's first two Evil Dead films. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd strings like Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio etc. However, unlike the EVIL DEAD bands, there is no talent behind the camera. The talent in front of the camera is low, but I will give the actors an advantage out of doubt. It seems they do not know what to do. The group's best actress, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is quickly beaten to death, and the ever-enjoyable Udo Kier becomes an exhibition vehicle for the spectator as the late captain hears and sees through a video journal. Grant Swandby is also fine as a professor, but it's hard to take seriously a scientist from the year 3000 who wears glasses and drives a wheelchair. And yes, it's a RAD chair, because there's nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors, well ???? I'm sure Coolio really tried to be scary after turning into a vampire, but I do not think irritating it is scary in most people. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak also do not offer much. Lister is never really more than the big black stereotype of the IL. Eleniak seems to be unhappy throughout the movie and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid-thirties, but looks a little worn and uninterested for the duration of the movie. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff, played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can not remember who the vampire is. He introduces himself as Orloff, but at some point he also recognizes himself as Count Dracula. Imagine that. In any case, you'll be absolutely surprised how lame this vampire is. Have you ever shown a scene where those gaudy horror shows that host local networks have time windows for their creatures? Yes, that's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, has found it almost impossible to focus on such a ridiculous outfit. I am sure that he is still being harassed by his friends. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the conspiracy. The vampire is the last of his kind, and for some reason he wants to go to Earth, and there is lip service in his bid to defeat the character of Van Helsing, Caspar Van Diens. Most of the crew members become vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and pistols to defeat them before they find out about the old heart routine. Yes, that's right, bullets and yes, the year 3000. In this amazing vein is one of the main areas in which the crew pinned themselves during the fight against the vampires or the vampire, because there is never really anyone who threatens them , is filled with old Soviet posters and insignia and stuff. What the? There is also evidence that God / religion are outdated systems. But those references just puzzled me. Did the Soviet Union make a comeback? Is there a point that Roodt and Milborrow want to do with it? It never really goes anywhere, seems stupid and the posters, etc. just look cheap. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is expertly shot and edited. The cinematography is not spectacular, but obviously made by professionals, and I had no problems with the special effects. The ships look like ships in space. I remember how horrible the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discovers it. What did they think? Why did not anyone say something? Do you see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without resorting to the negatives? I think that's the end of the story. Whatever you are trying to do as a positivity for this sci-fi / horror debacle, you will be overwhelmed by the lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kier.
