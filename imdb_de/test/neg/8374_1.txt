This has to be rated with the worst movies I've ever seen. It just was not funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose, if you are the kind of person who sees all eyes at the sight of a dog, this can do something for you. If you expect humor from a comedy movie, you will be disappointed, unless you find an English radio host who finds the f-word very funny. The strippers in the club stopped their underwear, so it was not even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom. What happened in the Strip Club makes no sense at all. The main character, with whom I did not have any sympathy, muttered a lot. Mena Suvari was hardly in the movie, probably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt to make a movie. The bad guys were unconvincing and as threatening as a dead sheep.
