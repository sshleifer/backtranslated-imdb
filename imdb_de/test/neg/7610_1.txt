I rarely give one or ten stars for a movie, but that was so terrible that I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm a sci-fi fan and I've really liked some comic interpretations of SciFi. There was nothing to like. <br /> <br /> I realize that this started with a very small budget from a film student. But even with that in mind, the sets and the effect are bad. The cinematography is mediocre but may be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. A sad state when the female voice is the best actor for the computer. The dialogue is bad. The script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> The humor is not only subtle and sublime; it is nowhere to be found. For example, a whole 20 minutes of the 80-minute movie is spent with an alien mascot and the elevator for a lame 2-stroke combo joke. <br /> <br /> This should be a spoof on everything bad 50s sci-fi until 2001. What ends up, however, is just a slightly updated version of an old 50s SciFi C movie. At least these movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.
