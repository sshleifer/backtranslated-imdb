Movies like these do not need sequels. The advantage of Don Bluth, who has moved away from Disney, is the advantage that he does not have to suffer from the endless tirade of directly animated, badly animated box office successes. But apparently it was a brilliant idea to do a sequel to "All Dogs Go To Heaven", so we get that here. Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he is not really that good. Most of the film is just a bad excuse for a sequel, and it's not nearly as dark, different, or entertaining as the original. <br /> <br /> I regret the future generations who suffer endlessly from sequels like these, without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood was not completely reliant on successful movies as a crutch they do not need to release banal crap.
