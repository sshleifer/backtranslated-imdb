This meandering history of Revenge of the Pack is simply not particularly interesting, even if Ed McMahon plays a mature role as the main challenger. Jim Brown effectively kicked his ass, Gloria Hendry proves once again that she can breathe life into even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who by The Book. It's still boring and poorly built, and even the imprint on the cable is now emasculated from its original James Brown score.
