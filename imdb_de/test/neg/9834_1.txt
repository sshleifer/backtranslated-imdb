Okay ... for the most part and with all of his cheese making, this movie was actually pretty good for a MST3K movie ... but then they decided to ruin the little good, about fifteen minutes before the end. * SPOILER ALERT * The movie is very simple ... a rich mother boy named Danny meets a bum called Bix, and the two of them travel to a small town where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (that's so much). Well, the basic requirement of this movie seemed promising. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of every romantic movie ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a scary guy in town who's longing for Carrie ... Well, me Know what you think. .. Bix fights the sneaking and finally decides to settle down with Carrie, and Danny returns home, and everyone lives happily ever after ... right? NOT CORRECT!! Because Carrie is murdered by the city cries because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many homosexual overtones between Danny and Bix.) And then the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even if the city scare had easily been the prime suspect. Then the stalker of the city confesses Carrie without much hesitation ... (must have felt bad, poor dope.) Then Danny brings Bix home ... that's the "happy movie". Sorry, right? All I can say, thank God for Joel and the Bots. Because they made this hockey hockey one of my favorite MST3K episodes.
