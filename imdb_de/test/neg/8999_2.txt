What a waste of time. I had about five minutes and got very annoying and went a little fast, and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast-forward button did not exist. The actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy were very capable, I thought, but no one I saw performed well. Take this review again with a big grain of salt, because the movie was so unbearable that I could not make it to the end. Heck, I could not get into the middle !! <br /> <br /> I can not submit this review because it is not long enough. Maybe the last sentence will be exaggerated.
