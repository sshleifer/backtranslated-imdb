This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Do not watch the movie, even if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This Laurel & Hardy movie is when they inherit an island, they become shipwrecked and are hung up. An incredibly boring movie that is not exactly funny. <br /> <br /> This was the last Laurel and Hardy movie and a very low grade to end such a great career. The 40s movies were not that great, this movie was shot in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their prime, the 1930s. The short films are better than the feature films, my favorite is "Me and my buddy". Another reason why this movie is horrible is the synchronization. The actor opens his mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap, but last but not least, Laurel and Hardy were in my opinion the best double act ever.
