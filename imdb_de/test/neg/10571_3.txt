This movie is funny if you're the gentleman who sat about three rows behind me (repeating every punch line, laughing, when there were no gags on the screen, and every scene involving a computer or mobile device) "haaaa" appears). <br /> <br /> For everyone else, it's a spiteful "comedy." The film follows strictly the formula of the later "Scary Movie" films as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", but without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating. Yet, the renunciation of intellectual and peace-making personalities around the world is clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy brainpower. "Superhero Movie" is especially and consistently evil for Stephen Hawking, introduces him as a sex hungry drug and uses his disability as a vehicle for slapstick. <br /> <br /> The storyline is based on "Spider-Man". with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" just to bring physical comedy. The movie is mostly slapstick, but not in an invigorating or interesting way. The longest-running gag is a fart joke, and screenwriters seem to believe early on that the main character is thrown into flashy stacks of fake animal mice, automatically reviving an otherwise uninspired remake of Spider-Man's spider bite scene. Perhaps the only salvation of this trait is the energy that is lacking, especially in other parodies. The filmmakers pretend to do something new, and the audience feels the actors bouncing on the screen. An extremely shortened length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the enthusiasm of the presentation make "Superhero Movie" more bearable than terrible.
