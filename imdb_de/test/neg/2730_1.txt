I was dumped on a Wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching him. I can not get over someone who is basically making a remake of a fucking high-budget Hollywood flop ("the CORE" with upset actors like Luke Perry). If the HIGH budget flopped, why do people think the SAME movie would go nowhere 2 years later with no budget? I laughed about the movie most of the time because it was so awfully similar (in fact, I'm shocked that it does not bother with Legal and is not televised), and basically the script of the CORE was just bad You have seen "the core", you know why it is worse to be funny, because the CORE was already so bad that it was funny. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy laughing at really bad movies, this is the case will be in your lane. The only thing I can say is that I wish Luke Perry could have made a career because he's not a terrible actor. He only gets terrible roles. Crappy, who was made for television movies that only run in daytime television, is almost over for him, if he was not for 90210, he would have a career.
