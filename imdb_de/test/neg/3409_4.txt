First of all, to say that I did not get the edition, I thought I would - I chose the Italian version of the R2, but what actually mattered was a 1998 release in the UK - which claimed one Special Edition - I never knew there was a UK DVD release - but the promised Biogs were not really on the CD - just a few duff trailers. Anyway - as far as the movie itself is concerned - just as I was recovering from "Night TRain Murders", my second genital mutilation thriller appeared in the same month. This time in (an Italian) British schoolgirl are quit and teacher Fabio Testi - (unfortunately) married, but pinning one of his students - becomes the main suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is the detective in the case. I'm sorry to say I was less than enthusiastic. It was visible, but more than equally incompetent, and apart from the already mentioned cruel nature of the crime, the "surprising" killing of Cristina Galbo, who was actually "spoiled" by the DVD cover and told me about it - Grrrrrrr !!!! and a surprising twist that put the "victims" in a new light - I found that very routinely. Itwont, however, put me off the two "sequels". with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit your grave ") Keaton.
