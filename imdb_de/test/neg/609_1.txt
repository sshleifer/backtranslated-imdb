A show about an incredibly stupid man-child and his ingenious hot wife. 99% of the action revolves around Doug doing something incredibly stupid and then a variable comes along: a) He either hides it in front of his wife or b) tells his wife she emasculates him and then it's up to his father-in-law (Arthur): the typography from Seinfeld) to make the situation worse. <br /> <br /> And the authors dare to say that they were influenced by the "honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the actions come from real situations. If you do not live in a cave, you know that not true. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it like this. If Kevin James had been skinny, the show would have been canceled by the pilot. If you are 12 or love fat jokes ... be my guest, watch this show (or one of Kevin James' films). <br /> <br /> I've noticed that some posters are compared to each other This travesty to many superior shows like Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond - I'm still wondering how anyone could do that
