Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I saw that with a few friends (and although this may not be the best way to watch a horror movie ...), most of the dialogue and action was ridiculously real. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the movie. It always flashes back to "explanatory scenes" that dissolve any discernible tension. <br /> <br /> And the character relationship "turns?" Yes, they suck. I do not say what they are, but they do not add anything to the film / plot. <br /> <br /> (By relationship I mean the two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Eek. My recommendation is: Watch this movie if you can not imagine anything better. Mediocre at best ... Maybe not even that.
