I'd rather have somebody cut out my eyeballs with a razor blade than have to see this movie again. I've seen it from beginning to end and thought it could not get any worse ... BUT IT HAD. The writers and producers should be beaten if they publish this kind of crap on TV. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood, fools, and work at McDonalds, sweeping the floors and emptying the garbage. Anyone who thinks that this movie is even remotely decent should be hung up. They are embarrassing to humanity. To think we have soldiers who put their lives on the line for everyone who produces this kind of garbage. It makes me embarrassed to say that I am an American.
