I did not really like Sliding Doors or Twice Upon a Yesterday, so I certainly did not do that bad second-rate excuse for these movies. An idea that was put to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is humble and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity just to get an R rating and certain scenes too but they were necessary to push the boundaries (I really do not have to urinate a child or fight a diaphragm, especially if they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film). <br /> <br /> The acting was also very bad, the only actor I found least satisfying was her daughter; The rest was two-dimensional and pretty incredible. The people with whom I saw this left the room about halfway. I managed to finish it, but not without a part of it. All in all, nothing new here, it's a generic and boring movie. The few rather funny moments are far outweighed by the stupid or stupid moments. That would be boring, even if it had not been done before. If it were not for such a repetition, I'd rate it at five, but even for an indie movie, he was lacking a lot, and as a repeat, it also loses originality: 3/10.
