I saw this movie last night and went online to see if others thought it was as horrible as me. Of course some people in this movie see a lot that I have not seen you're one of those people, well - good luck to you. But I am a patient person. I have enjoyed extremely long movies. But this was a torture exercise for me. <br /> <br /> I really felt that this was one of those films that had little to say, and that it was more about style than substance - but also style. I felt like pulling my hair out. Pretty much anything interesting that happens during the movie happens off-screen. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a movie entirely outtakes - the bits that would normally be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a DVD, if they were ever shown to the public. <br /> <br /> In the end you can even learn EVERYTHING about the main character Francois. I had no sympathy for the characters in this film, except perhaps for the violinist and his goat and the old man who believes that octopuses live to 300 because they are really smart. Seriously, I was excited when Francois held a pistol to his head. I felt so disconnected when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? Even smoking opium? I swear I would have screamed almost every time I was subjected to a long shot, except that somebody was going back and forth, and then there would finally be a very abrupt cut to the next scene, and it would be a year later And us have missed everything that happened in the meantime, and all still wore the same bloody garments ....!?!?!? <br /> <br /> So, in the end, if you liked it - great. But this review is intended as an antidote to the dirty word. "You will love this movie if you love the cinema" I have seen here and elsewhere. (See? I hated the movie and I've still added a sly hint to its content!)
