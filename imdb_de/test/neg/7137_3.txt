The Hollywood movie industry is the laziest in the world. It only takes a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap that has been reinvented over and over again. Take superheroes, for example, for every X-Man and Spiderman there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worse. It was only the ring that was pitch-perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky) to bring a ton of looking-like scary women based on horror, such The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but pointless) and the Grudge. <br /> <br /> The first grudge was not that bad. It was almost scary, what you could expect. In addition, the plot had some brains that mixed stories. Grudge 2 is just like the previous one; That could be a good thing, but hey, what kid Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire script and just change the villain? For the Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> <br /> Tired of fear, bad acting (except Amber Tamblyn) and clich√©s everywhere. Three stories take place in different places and at different times. Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigates what killed her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar); Allison (Arielle Kebbel), who is brought by colleagues to the house in which the incident presented in the first film took place; and finally, an American family witnessing strange things in the apartment next door. I'm glad to say (and I mean it) that in the end everything is tied, but you do not have to rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is just tiresome and boring. There is coldness everywhere a girl alone in the lockers, someone who should not enter a house, others who dig too deep. In the meantime, ghosts are killing and killing, worse than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, does not that look like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yes, it's getting easier every day to fight a grudge ... against Hollywood bullshits.
