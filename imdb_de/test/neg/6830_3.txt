I would avert any temptation to watch this movie, it's just boring. The characters are predictable and thoughtless. The assassin is pretty unenigmatic. There is no tension, no fun, no style or even a hint of originality in this train crash. And the swamp of Hollywood stereotypes is stifling. Oh, and you have a movie that turns a IRA terrorist into a hero. Sweet. And now I have to talk a little more to fill up the ten lines. And a little more is that enough? Not quite like now? No, another confabulation should do the trick, but The Jackal really is not worth ten lines. The original was great.
