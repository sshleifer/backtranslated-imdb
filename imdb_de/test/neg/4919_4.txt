"A New Generation" is Amityville's third entry, based on the idea of ​​author John G. Jones to remove an item from the Long Island house that causes spectral distress and death for the new owners. First a lamp, then a clock and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession', directly following the real events that started the entire series. This time, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, one day gets a macabre looking mirror of a homeless man. Soon, people around him begin to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the house of Amityville. On the night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is no coincidence, and he soon learns the truth about his past, a truth he has buried since childhood. This seventh installment in the often-worn series is a disappointment to me. Things started to refresh with the stupid and uneven yet entertaining "It's About Time," and considering how much this film tries to take its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better it was. <br /> <br /> Three trips from the same well with another evil artifact from the Amityville House with another explanation for the malignant paranormal visits, however, carry me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the unwavering determination of all producers to completely ignore every other episode of the series. Firstly, it is quite reasonable that they do not want to be tied to the continuity of another, but at least they could recognize already written storylines and possibly * not repeat them over and over again *. <br /> <br /> The way the story unfolds is a bit more rigorous, no doubt due to the inevitability of this repeat celebration. Since you already know what will happen, the careful construction is slow and boring. Or maybe it's just boring anyway. Director John Murlowski could probably have done more to amplify the tense atmosphere of the mirror than simply flashing it and creating chattering "angry" voices lacking any sort of subtlety. There were times when the characters seemed quite unimpressed by their otherworldly qualities. If they do not take it too seriously, why should we do that? <br /> <br /> What a pity, because "A New Generation" has a more than capable cast. I did not want to wait until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She caught my attention, just as she always did, and if anything, annoyed me that her role was not extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and under-stressed again. Partridge himself is clearly in line with the over-flourished lumberjack hero types of the '90s, and while I'm not sure he really did give the Gravitas, it's not like anyone here plays Ibsen /> <br / > The sets are also notable, from the dramatic artworks that fill Suki's rooms to the claustrophobic corridors that can be seen in flashback / supernatural sequences. The proper appearance of these elements is particularly important because certain sequences throughout the movie are repeated in simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director than a director of an actor or horror. Unfortunately it's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> "A New Generation" races the same race for the third time in 4 years. Added to this is the lack of direction in which it was really needed and the whole effort is not as great as it should be. It should, however, be appreciated for its strong attachment to the starting material and some good actors in not necessarily their most beautiful hours. Honestly, the ideal person for someone who has not seen the sequel to "The Possession," for whom the story will not be such a formidable Deja-Vu journey.
