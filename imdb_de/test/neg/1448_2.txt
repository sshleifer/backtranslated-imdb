The power looked promising, but soon became boring and boring. The plot is about an ancient Aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it. The idea is "decent" and this movie would have been pretty entertaining if it had been done better. After the first ten minutes, it soon gets boring; We do not get good death scenes and have to hear a lot of talking. In the end, one of the possessed finds his death by melting in front of two girls, but it is not very interesting and definitely not bloody fan, since there is little to gain.
