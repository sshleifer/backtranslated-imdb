Heart of Darkness was terrible. The novel was hard enough to understand, but when a production company decides to release a movie on it loose, it just ruins everyone. Not only did the people in charge choose to change certain characters and eliminate others completely, but the acting was terrible and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete dud. I looked at the movie hoping to get a better understanding of the novel, but it just completely blew me and my classmates. I think the movie was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing movie, especially when he has fantastic movies like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs in his stomach. The same goes for the very cool John Malkovich.
