With Al Jolson at the peak of his popularity and Warner Brothers' Jazz Singer was the film with the highest grossing of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would produce some vehicles for their own characters requested by Jolson. While the jazz singer was a sensation for the first part-talkie, the matinée idol lacks the voice of his star (the now-obscure Johnnie Walker), and he just has to settle for his visual antics. <br /> <br /> The Matinée Idol was an early directorial work for the renowned Frank Capra. Capra's first full-length series by Harry Langdon shows a very conspicuous, excessive style that made Langdon's mediocre slapstick almost unsurpassable. A few pictures later, and Capra has learned to lose some weight with reasonably regular and decent camera work. He still does not show any talent for shooting physical comedy. The longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have some good gags, but everything is divided into many different camera angles, and the comedy has no chance of course flowing from the performances. Theoretically, a good part of the jokes is in the subtitles, but there are far too many and none of them are particularly funny. <br /> <br /> Of course, Capra would eventually become a dramatic and romantic drama director, and you can see how he develops in this regard. He cuts the line and approaches Walker and Bessie Love in the scene where she first looks at him in his Don Wilson. Stand up and make the wordless connection between them. Then there is a beautiful and delicate framing of the couple in their joint scene in the Masquerade, which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in Capra's early '30s. Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson is not an exceptional talent. His comic timing is good, but there is nothing that sets him apart. Bessie Love, on the other hand, is also a pretty good actress with an expressive face. Kudos to her for engaging in the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, this plump and funny character actor who seems to show up in the late 20's and early 30's. <br /> <br /> The Matinée Idol is one of those images that has won more than its fair attention, as the director later made a handful of masterpieces. In and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece and like most of Capra's work, before he met Robert Riskin, a disappointment.
