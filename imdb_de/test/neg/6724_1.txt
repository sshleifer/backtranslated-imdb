Usually I really enjoy Steven Seagal movies. They are usually very entertaining and something of aikido. I like the way Steven integrates these martial arts techniques into the combat sequences. <br /> <br /> However, this film is a really bad filmmaker It seems to me obvious that the blame lies with the director and the producers, who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone someone like Steven Seagal guide and use his knowledge and competence. <br /> <br /> I never saw the end of this movie. I just went out before the end because I could not see this bad movie anymore. I'm sure many people share my feelings too.
