This movie moved much too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different as he explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally retarded family member in ways I have not seen on screen before. The execution of the concept was flawed. Each character had been fully developed in the scene of their first appearance, then had to endure the feeling that each character entered the rest of the way with water. That is, each character moved awkwardly in his interpersonal relationship with others in the film, which I found to be a form of emotional and social disability. I suppose that this has artistic value, given the irony that the story revolves around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by above-average intelligent friends and family. The acting was without exception well done. I agree with the other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. In summary, I think that the film due to the fine effect has a strong artistic value and cinematography, but fails at the emotional level of the shortcomings described.
