This is a classic type B movie you would rather not waste your time and see. It started well and I thought it would be a good thriller, but I was wrong. Throughout the film, you have the feeling that something interesting is about to take place and that it suddenly becomes a tense thriller. It runs slowly and peacefully to the end, with nothing interesting. Only the end was unexpected and original, but that's about it. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this movie still rated R?
