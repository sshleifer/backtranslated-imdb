I was a teenager when it first appeared in theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The storyline of the movie was not my second high school sophomore, but I looked at the 3D process. It had been ballyhooed in the press so even overseas service personnel had heard of it, though it was never shown in the Posttheater. The film began with the trend of throwing objects at the audience with later 3D movies to absurd levels. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this is a spoiler, but you have been warned if this is the case. In many of the films of that time, actors often worked in front of a "back-projection screen" onto which backgrounds could be projected to give the impression of being in a different environment, such as a jungle background, where the actors were actually on one Movie were sound stage. This works well with regular movies, but in 3D they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the movie that used rear projection, and it did not work well in the theaters. In 3D this will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film's only meaning is historical, being the first of its kind.
