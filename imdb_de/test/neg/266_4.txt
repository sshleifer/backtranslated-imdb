I enjoyed Oceans 11, I found it very enjoyable, supported by the performances and the directing. However, I was disappointed with this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not a complete guy, thanks to the outstanding achievements of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon, and the efficient direction of Steven Soderbergh. However, the movie really suffers from a really lethargic tempo. Part of the movie was so slow that I almost fell asleep between a keystroke. Second, the plot is very complicated and there are many twists that make it hard to keep up. The camera work was not as innovative as in the first film. While it was smooth and professional in the first movie, it was jerky and awkward, and the music was not particularly memorable. The script was not that funny or funny, and the movie felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day everything felt a bit lazy, despite the expert game and the instructions. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
