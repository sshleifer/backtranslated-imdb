This movie could have been great. It is not in my opinion. The plot is fragmented, the editor seems unable to choose between a Guy Ritchie-style narrative and a more straightforward one. There is a lot of emphasis on excessive force, including torture. So much, if you ask me. The characters are very flat and stereo-typed, I would have liked to see more depth. It's hard to identify with the main character. As a result, the film remains flat overall. <br /> <br /> The film says it gives the viewer an insight into the British criminal subclass, especially the Essex subclass. Football hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, lots of violence. Violence due to paranoia and fear in general. Nobody seems to use his (or her) brain in this film. We look at a bunch of animals in clothes. As I said, there is not much action and storytelling leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you're a man under 30, like Gore and hardcore violence, and think that's entertaining, then this is a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that depicts real people with a well-developed storyline, suspense, and depth, you can skip this movie.
