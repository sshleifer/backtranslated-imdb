WARNING!! This review may contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. It says all that crap about children telling ghost stories what they do, but it implies they're all killed by a killer in the forest. That does not happen. The stories they tell are a bit interesting, especially with the dog and all the licking, but most are rather boring, monsters in the woods, a dumb girl and most importantly, the whole movie.
