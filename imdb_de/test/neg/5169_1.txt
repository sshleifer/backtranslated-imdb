Kokoda was inspired by the events on the Kokoda route during World War II, as the Australian militia slowed down and eventually stopped a jab of 10,000 Japanese troops to move across the country and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the movie plays at this time, but it's fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war movies. The first hour is just one clich√© after another. Some of the scenes are just there to make us feel that this conflict was incomparably horrific when there is little evidence. Both sides fought hard around the track, and there was no mercy on either side. Both sides suffered from logistical bottlenecks, and the terrain was a great asset in this conflict. As the Japanese approached Port Moresby, their supply line grew, eventually leading to a fall. However, as the Australians withdrew closer to Port Moresby, their supply lines decreased. Some of the scenes seem to come directly from the manual on standard scenes to include in any war movie. The film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could have done with a great movie about one of Australia's best moments, the movie Kokoda is a little disappointment.
