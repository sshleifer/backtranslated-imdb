Well, the plot is entertaining, but it's full of filth. In summary, the cop wants to rescue his son from cancer, but the only option is to get the transplant from the criminal (Michael Keaton). The transplant was in progress, and the police and the cop-dad can not shoot at the criminal to save his son. (dead criminal, no transplanted dead son). Well, the police in this movie have no sense if they have never heard of a TAZER defeating the criminal without killing him. End of the movie, it's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> But if everything is crazy and stupid, including the deaths of 2 policemen and a few doctors who are burned pretty badly.
