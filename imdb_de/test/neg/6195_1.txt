Okay, I sensed that a Mormon-Mormon film would be a catastrophe for Mormons just waiting for it, but I did not know how painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The Church's official film campaign has produced rare and enduring jewels that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow," which was filmed as an educational film in the late 1970s. Then there's Neil LaBute's disturbingly masterful oeuvre .... <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films largely depended on the fact that they did not focus on Mormons or a particular Mormon theology. Instead, they choose a universal theme and treat it on a fundamental human level. "God's Army" gives up the pretense of universality and runs head-first into the stilted and short-sighted world of the Orthodox. While this may suffice for someone other than the most devoted Mormons, director Richard Ductcher's inability as a filmmaker and his youthful approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge God's Army, which is unsurpassable by almost any standard. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's own terribly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you'll ever meet. Dutcher's wretched scripts obviously do not help the performers' sad performances. He should be honored not to avoid some of the controversial aspects of the Church, but as you might expect, he conveniently summarizes these controversies in sympathetic light. It should come as no surprise that most of the answers to the dark side of the church are addressed only with faith. Once, an African-American missionary is abused by a black couple because he joined a church that was separated until 1978 (about ten to twenty years after almost every church in the degenerate areas of the deep South had already done so). Instead of dealing with the Church's active racist history, perhaps the most painful passage in Mormon theology, which even the Church leaders no longer defend, Dutcher's troubled figure is considering the murder of Joseph Smith instead - an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching , Complete this milky Milktoast with third-rate leprosy jokes that go down in comic relief, and you have a strong case for reviving silent movies. <br /> <br /> If you did not know much about Mormons before watching this movie, you may be vulnerable at all costs. If you are Mormon, this movie offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
