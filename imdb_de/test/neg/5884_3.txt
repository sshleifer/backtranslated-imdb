The title is a misnomer: The film shows barely a year of the so-called "Divin Marquis". It was a hard time for him because he was threatened by the guillotine: the quiet pleasures of the reign of terror. <br /> <br /> Historically, the background is rather sketchy: "The Feast of Love," Robespierre's failed attempt to create a secular religion, his downfall, a heaven that offered the opportunity to see Dr. Speed). <br /> <br /> Sade is an almost mediocre affair: waiting in a former nunnery with other noblemen, a golden cage when compared to Marie-Antoinette or scientist Lavoisier's fates, and he trades in vain Conversations with a young maiden about death, love and other trifles. There is the obligatory "daring" scene, but you have to be patient, because it takes a long time to appear on the screen. Can we call that risqu√© today? Cy Enfield's "De Sade," which has one of the IMDb's lowest ratings, is at least entertaining, and Keir Dullea was a credible marquis rather than the aging Auteuil. And he showed John Huston.
