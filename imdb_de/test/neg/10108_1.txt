<br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> I will be as sweet as possible about this movie (some people, including directors !, can get quite upset when critics express their opinions) ... < br /> <br /> There's a nice car accident and the header sections look good and ... that's it; Everything else bites the big one. The acting is terrible, the script is embarrassing, the special effects look as if they were made by school children on cheap computers. All in all, this movie has serious bowling shoe trends. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie he is not very scary and if he was to lead to a horror movie of a "thinking man" then it was successful on some level, I always thought the end of this movie is a terribly long one Path. It may be an ironic look at bad horror movies, and I miss the point, but I doubt it somehow. <br /> <br /> This is a complete car phone camp of a movie, and I can not recommend it to anyone and I hate to say so while I wait for the resurrection of British horror. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with this review, that's fine, it's just my own opinion, and I'm sure someone out there will love it (for example, the director's mother).
