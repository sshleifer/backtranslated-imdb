As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to put my head in a bucket of lye, pull out my eyeballs and jump off a cliff." This sums up my feelings about this miserable waste of human effort. Artless, selfish, thoughtless and just plain bad. Bad misunderstanding. What else can I say? If you are unhappy enough to be in an area where this idiotic garb is playing, please have mercy on the soul and avoid at all costs.
