This two-and-a-half-hour film was recently shown at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) on a 22 o'clock show. After that, there was a scheduled 1 o'clock show, but I wondered if anyone would stay awake until 3:30. The opening scene shows a man walking on a field, taking four minutes of film time. It's a sinister sign of what's to come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. In the sun is a scene of a man and a woman on a wall. It is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. Occasionally these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close-up of female genitals shown for a full minute of film time (viewers laugh in the last 20 seconds and say, "What is the message?"). The story is similar to Dostoyevsky's novel "The Karamazov Brothers," in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of slight morality. In one of those rare moments when the crowd laughed (more in desperation to justify having been there for two full hours to see nothing), the message of a British tourist was that he could not see clearly since The Eurostar train ran at a speed of 180 mph and was read by the translator with automatic switching of units from the English system to the metric system in "they could not see things clearly as the train was traveling at 300 km / h". The amazing thing about this film is that the quality of the cinematography shows that a lot of money was spent on it. This was not a movie kitchen 8mm experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, traded, assembled. Still, I did not get out so much. Some comments pointed to the agonizing detail, such as the minutiae of a shabby keychain on a door just opened. Okay, it was noticed, but what was the purpose? Some crazy people in the audience went away after the first hour. The rest was out of curiosity: in the end something must happen. It was never there. And maybe that's what the movie is about. All movies in the theater are full of action. This one wants to be different. There is nothing going on.
