Ask a thousand people about the biggest unintentional comedy ever, and they'll almost always tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From The Space. You are wrong. American Ninja crushed these two turkeys for a variety of reasons, not least because of a script that was obviously not thought out. While I fully support the B-imaging industry for keeping slobs like Michael Dudikoff in work, a little work on the product would have gone a long way. <br /> <br /> For those who give a rat back, my next paragraphs will give away significant portions of the plot. <br /> <br /> When we get background information about the titular hero, we first learn his date of birth, his next of kin, parents, and so on are all unknown. I do not know about you, but I expect the US Army to take the facts about their staff a little more seriously. They also manage to mess up the continuity of the data quite effectively, though I do not remember exactly which dates were wrong when. This is actually one of the less obvious mistakes of American Ninja. It has been pointed out earlier, but with many martial arts films it is common for our heroes to be confronted with a large number of antagonists attack after another. Newer films like The Matrix Reloaded defy this convention, but in almost every movie from the '80s, the audience has to scream: "Hey, why are not you all attacking at once ???". Martial arts films are usually much more impressive when the arguments are more extensive than one-to-one interviews. The central premise was originally a joke, but with the recent events in which the US Army can not destroy a mob of insurgents just because they are not being delegated to the specialists, that seems strangely ironic. Phillipino renegades steal weapons from the US Army's local division for sale to wealthy clients. It does not matter that such a theft would cause the army to give a rectal aerial survey to the responsible local business people, or even to the responsibility. This is a cheesy action movie from the 1980s but part of the film is the pinnacle of the battle. When Joe and Jackson combine pose and fight into an art form, the evil ninjas explode for no apparent reason. I agree with an earlier commentator that this film should have been called the Ninja Holocaust, as I am willing to bite a total of at least three hundred evil ninjas during the filming period. In addition, the Black Star Ninja begins to struggle with rocket launchers, laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous devices that are not only poorly thought out, but also completely executed. You will never see a laser beam effect that looks cheaper. <br /> <br /> Best of all, the movie is so damned serious. During the scene where Joe meets his old mentor again, I dare the viewer not laugh at the hideous dialogue. Not that I know modern practitioners of Ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination has a hard time believing that they have spoken this way at all times in their history. In this mentoring scene, I half expect the old man to tell Joe that he has to cut off his manhood with a blunt plastic spoon. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've given the American Ninja a 1st is a special score in my system because it's reserved for the worst, most horrible and offensive movies I've ever seen, or movies that me make you laugh without even trying. The American ninja is definitely an example of the latter.
