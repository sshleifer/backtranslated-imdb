This movie is awful. Acting is cheesy and ridiculous. If you know anything about rugby, the game action is boring. In fact, every Episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The "action" consists of nothing more than a shot and a shot of a guy landing over the line or being attacked without a ball and hectic shots of people who know who is doing what. It is impossible to say. There's nothing of the excitement, skill and construction of the trial rating that real rugby contains. As for the haka, these are a lot of jokes that try to imitate a tradition of which they know nothing, much like the white rasta character that should have been left out of the film. The next rugby movie, we can only hope that rugby fans will make it.
