I hated it. I hate self-confident, overbearing madness that disguises itself as art. This movie is either stupid or stupid. After the first half hour, I quickly went through the DVD version and saw the same young Shennanigans over and over again. I got angry that I had spent hard-earned money on second-graders. The tinting sepia in sepia or blue makes film nothing, let alone art.
