I saw this movie quite amused. I'm not sure if this was a horror gore feast in a rob zombie affair or an investigation of real events. Historically, it's not very accurate when characters are hacked and changed for historical purposes. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither captivating nor bad. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could have gone that easy without compromising the overall impression.
