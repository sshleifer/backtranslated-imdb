This documentary was boring and pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... the documentary filmmaker obviously does not even know how Darwinian evolution works. It's a theory, and the name is just stupid. By reading a textbook on biology at the college, the documentary filmmaker might know what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is considered politics. <br /> <br /> Also in this documentary there was no real evidence in which only a few people were interviewed. br /> <br /> The documentation was also boring. I mean, it could have been reduced to 35 minutes and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There is much better documentation than this ... that was not worth to be seen ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = D Do not waste your money and your time!
