I had not expected much when I saw that, but my God, what a disappointment. The original was a bit of fun in its genre, but that's so bad, I felt abused when I left the theater. There is no action, it is not funny, it is not pleasant to look at, it is downright embarrassing. After an hour, I hoped that my patience would be rewarded, but now I regret not leaving the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore it, see it when it comes to the small screen. Or see it on the budget DVD. Whatever you do, do not waste money. Do not say I did not warn you.
