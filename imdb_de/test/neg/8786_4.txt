I rented it when it appeared on a videotape in 1995. After watching it again, my idea has not changed much. <br /> <br /> I was grown up then and I'm still an adult! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did not bother me. This is not a documentary, it's a fantasy story where animals can talk! <br /> <br /> Although I was not interested in many songs, I liked the one at the end of the picture where it was sung barry manilow and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to apologize for the primitive animation by saying that CGI is not often used in animated films, but let's not forget that THE LION KING was released about a year ago and that was maybe more excellence than any other animated feature that came before !! <br /> <br /> But I think it's pretty fair to say that THE PEBBLE AND THE PINGOIN was made cheap while THE LION KING was not. t .... <br /> <br /> The highlights for 1995 and today for me are the tension created by the few (mostly) dangerous underwater hunting scenes. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene, which plays on a page with music notes, and a little bit of the love story. Most of the time, however, the story dragged on and was boring. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look if you like animation, but if you're an adult and not a risk taker, you should instead get another Walt Disney production this one!
