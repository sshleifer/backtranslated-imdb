Visually, this movie is interesting. The light is literally thrown in front of the titles along with the cinematography and a tempting introduction, which had my hopes in the beginning, but then - a B-movie is a B-movie is a B-movie, no matter how much acting is going on seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the world's most famous serial killers. Active at the beginning of the 20th century, Fish is treated hurriedly and blurry before he started killing children when he was a child. This film is based on two tracks: Fish's life and that of William F. King, the lead investigator of the case. What keeps this movie from becoming a Hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual kind when it comes to movies about serial killer is the direction that is a double-edged sword; Director Scott L. Flynn focuses enough on the actors not to let their mistakes shine through, but at the same time a really boring and stereotyped view of the American police through the King Angle. Sure enough, he's been thoroughly discussing Fish's meeting with Grace Budd, the ten-year-old girl he killed, though I'm not really sure her mother was the media-mad person Flynn really wanted to emphasize. I miss more psychological immersion in Fish, not to mention the very short time spent on Fish's reconquest. All in all interesting for those who like serial killers, but mostly disappointed; However, if the director is going to make another movie about another serial killer, I would definitely see him hoping that holes have been repaired.
