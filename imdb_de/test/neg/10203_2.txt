Hulk Hogan and Zeus are terrible wrestlers and terrible actors. For some reason, Hogan was so popular that he got a movie deal. I will never know why. Without the money of McMahon, this stupid movie would never have been made. Maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. No Holds Barred is not the movie.
