The sheltered young woman, who is educated at home and may well be gifted, has a troubled, overly emotional side that comes to the surface after her absent father visits her mother and asks for divorce. Directed by famed cinematographer William A. Fraker, this ill-defined psychological thriller falls into the trap in which most of the films directed by the directors of photography find themselves. Each recording is composed for the utmost style, but with the Sacrifice flowing pacesetter and a tight tension, gripping narrative. Fraker (and his cameraman László Kovács) are very fond of gossamer whites and golden tones, giving the image a polished, tableaux-like feel. The mansion in the center of the action looks like a funeral home, and Fraker goes through the gasp like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancee), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite convincing despite the jagged editing (which turns their scenes into small, half-realized stores). , Sondra Locke, another interesting film personality, seems to be cast in "Repulsion" because of her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve. Locke is pale and with the eyes of a saucer, with imposing, thick and long hair. It's a strange human puzzle and at first pretty intimidating and dangerous. However, this role is so old that Locke can not find anything new from the frozen area and she stumbles. Fraker lets Locke's freaky scenes continue while Shaw (who looks terribly discouraged) takes the impossible position to play her a sensitive-lazy daddy. All this nonsense can be worth it if the script was peppered with a certain degree of tangibility (or at least dry joke or humorous relief). Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume's limp script adapted from Stanton Forbes 'novel "Go To Thy Deathbed" bristles with the viewer at an early stage, and only the players' charisma brings us to the finish. * 1/2 of ****
