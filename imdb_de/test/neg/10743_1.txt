I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap. <br /> <br /> This anti-Bush propaganda piece, dressed as a horror movie, looks like an episode of Michael Moore's original Batman. Political satire should be smart, but it does pull a ten-power on the confusing scale with all the style and credibility of a L. Ron Hubbard movie. In his Campy, inhumane, she accuses the Republicans of stealing elections without any reason to go to war and treat soldiers and women as mere cannon fodder. It's even a blow to the second change and the religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero, as the president was pleased with how he had orchestrated the September 11th. <br /> <br /> I think the end should be the "we support our troops" moment, but I think they would be offended as happy with the whole endeavor. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the elites of Hollywood are sitting in their Malbu villas and patting each other on the back, while the malformed anti-war acts on this "gritty" work. Drones welcome it as a genius. <br /> <br /> Time to equip yourself with new aluminum foil hat children.
