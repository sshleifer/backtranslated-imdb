This is an irrevocably stupid, boring, unimaginative, lazy piece of garbage. If you look at a direct-to-video slasher pick, it's only to be expected that the movie is trashy on some level, but that goes beyond Trashy. It's just awful at every level, with a clich√©-ridden script that's both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring, an unnamed cast of actors, and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even fans of Slasher films will not find anything here that makes this film worth an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend on a remote West Virginia farm that a member of the group has recently inherited. Unfortunately for teenagers, the land once belonged to a farmer who made sacrifices to grow his crop, or something stupid in that direction, and now some evil scarecrows want to kill everyone. I do not know anything about writer Paul Moore's director, but I'm assuming he's over ten, so he should be able to do something more original than scarecrows. Honestly. <br /> <br /> The special effects the scarecrows bring to life are ridiculously bad. They often look like barely more than Haloween costumes on sticks. Such special effects would have been considered rather weak twenty years ago, but by today's standards they are no less embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of time for all viewers, regardless of whether they are in horror movies or not. If you need to watch a Slasher movie, rent one of the movies "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween". Most of them are not very good, but they are certainly superior to the crap.
