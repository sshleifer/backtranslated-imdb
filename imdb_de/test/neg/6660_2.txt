Words can hardly describe this film. This film is packed with ridiculous stereotypes, a stupid plot and bad music, and it's missing in almost every category. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the IMDB credits. This is not a Michael Dorn movie. He is a secondary character in a big way. <br /> <br /> Also listed in the credits is an actor named "Prince" - which makes me wonder if it's the same artist who used to be known as ... I'm not sure if this one Movie is worth watching only. <br /> <br /> Big summary ... bunch of teams ... you have kidneys ... you have $ 35,000 ... you have an "illegal" substance .... and you have $ 350,000 They add some confusion and confusion, who has to meet whom, revenge for being taken and stuff, and you end up with this mess of a movie movie.
