I like to watch Robert Forster. That was the main reason why I rented this movie. I also wanted a story to be played in the middle of nowhere, where the characters can get along well and without distraction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I found the movie boring. I could not care for the characters. I could not care about the story, which seemed to be moving nowhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I will rate the movie with 4 out of 10 points. This falls well below the compulsory rating of 7, which makes a movie worthwhile.
