Actually, the mask's son made me laugh a few times ... mainly because of the cartoon-like jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is not equivalent to CGI, but I would choose it right away. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which was not so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie ... and should therefore be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. His attempts to be "crazy" are not very good and acting is bad overall. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is not so bad. <br /> <br /> Basically, my 2- and 5-year-olds have seen the whole thing without complaining. At least I could stand it. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means worse than ** Shudder ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for the CGI and a few laughs.
