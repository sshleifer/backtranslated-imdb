Every great romantic comedy needs a conflict between the romantic clues to bring excitement, anticipation and lure into the storyline. This story is completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least not that would prevent the later connection of the two main characters, and so the tension is flat, there is no anticipation and there is really no charm. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane stands for friendship at best, and I was quite surprised with the talent of these two special actors. During the movie, I expected them to play a game with controllers and talk about the weather as a moving passion. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a fan of the two actors, I believe that the casting in this movie was off - or, maybe the direction was off base and it had an impact on their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which could have affected the performances; Surely the script could have needed help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience to put the romance into a cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry, Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
