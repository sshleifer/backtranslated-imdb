I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> That is, this movie is reprehensible, mean and transparent. It only works on the level of the presently fashionable (and tired) hate motive of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film had been made about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family or even a black Christian family, the outrage would have been palpable, and the film would have disappeared in ALL circles. As it stands, it is "OK" and "artful" because white Christian fundamentalists are one of the last "acceptable" goals for garbage like this one. <br /> <br /> And it really is garbage. If you want to see a quality movie with similar curvatures, search for "badlands" and look at these articles or write them. Nothing good was done in "The King", which was not better in this masterful movie decades ago. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers note, the figures in "The King" are almost undeveloped snooze, the cinematography is lackluster. We have seen that the story of the sociopath was 100 times better. This movie is not suitable for thoughtful viewers.
