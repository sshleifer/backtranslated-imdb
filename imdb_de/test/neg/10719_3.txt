This movie was perhaps one of the most unusual and indescribable films I have seen in a long time. To be fair, I had not expected a revolutionary comic formula, but I expected to at least be entertained. How could I be disappointed with such low expectations? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (no sarcasm), has stepped in this movie barely more than water. He seems to have temporarily returned to his witty faces and created a character that does not differ from his Fletcher roadstead. This new character, Dick Harper (aka Fletcher 2.0), is a poorly rendered and miserable puppy. If you smile while looking at this wretched and essentially boring character, it's most likely because Carrey is trying so hard to give it a third dimension. Carrey's quirky posturing becomes humorous awkward - and ultimately sad. <br/> <br /> Tea Leoni as Jane makes Carrey's Costello little more than the Abbott. I usually find Tea Leoni refreshing and unused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could easily have been played by all actors aged thirty to forty-five, and it is precisely in this unspecificity that the character of Jane becomes uninteresting. It simply has no defining features except its pursuit of the general theme of the film, which seems to be ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you count "Big Business Is Evil" as a topic. I thought that would be more of a matter of course. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both provide credible (albeit tired) supportive services, but none of the men really seem to be invested in the role they play. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin has also endeavored to play his role as the eerie C.E.O. while he's having a sandwich (which he seems to be doing lately). <br /> <br /> Slightly, but Alec Baldwin has not played a role in recent years, which did not require him to be a strong idiot in a suit? <br /> <br /> Take my advice, if you have not experienced the horror yourself: Save your money. This is the point that you can see on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but it's no fun.
