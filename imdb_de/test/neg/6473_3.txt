But I still enjoyed watching her, so I gave her a 3 instead of a 1. Her face is priceless. Some of the other actors (eg Michael McKean) are really asleep. The cat itself is a bit amusing. Apart from that, the movie is all clich√© and ends in a much too long chase. (At this point, too, the film becomes unnecessarily rude, because until then it was very "familial".)
