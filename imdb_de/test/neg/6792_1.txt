This TV show is probably the most pathetic portrayal of crap on TV today. Terribly predictable, obscene use of slow-motion photography, cheesy plot. Chuck Norris is an abomination that could never be filmed in anything. The way he turns each episode into a public announcement is really annoying. His acting is so bad that a person is terrified of embarrassment. I'll give some credit to the series ... it's sometimes entertaining, but not enough to make a difference. With all the negative points this series has, I still prefer it to reality TV. It can not really be more valuable than that.
