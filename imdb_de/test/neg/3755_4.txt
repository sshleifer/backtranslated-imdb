Big Fat Slob 'Uncle Buck', played by John Candy, visits the healthy members of his family for a week to seat two cute kids (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and a baby handsome but snobby teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). The Shenanigans start when Buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed too small for his body. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring, but studded with two or three funny scenes, including Buck, trying to get a word with his angry girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and meeting a very disgusting clown. <br /> <br /> Candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds.
