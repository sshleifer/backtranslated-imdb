A rather mild horror movie; If not for a few sex scenes, it could easily have been a television movie. Plot holes abound (for example, why should there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the top floor of a house that was burned down and a new building built there 200 years later?), Cardboard games, figures, Doing Things Anyone who has a bigger IQ than his shoe size would not do that ... <br /> <br /> It has a few fun moments, but overall it's a minor movie, the Roy Scheider because of his bills could win due. If you're looking for an extremely formulaic, predictable movie that could bring a few laughs, it's worth taking a look. If not, then this is not for you.
