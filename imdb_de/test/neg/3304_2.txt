I have no idea who these others are, but this movie is just awful. You must support Joe Pesci if he is a minor character. Bait and movie changes like the studios with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I watched says that "this obscure jewel revolves around JOe Pesci's MOB character, who is a hothead triggering a war," and so on Joe plays the role of Joe, he does not even carry a gun, plays a shaky character and gets SPOILER - (beat up). So much for the film around Pesci. The only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gasoline waiting for a score. If you watch this movie after reading, I have warned you. Please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.
