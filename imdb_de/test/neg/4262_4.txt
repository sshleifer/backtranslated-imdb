Amitabh and Jiah Khan have raised high expectations through their press conferences, though it has been quite easy for critics and fans alike to see Ram Gopal Verma Factory's much-praised product rock out in all odds! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish and Bacchan was guilty and uncertain. They themselves did not know what they were talking about, the press and the tagline, that some love stories are incomprehensible or such wastes! Why is the title Nishabd? Ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit as Vidhu Vinod Mahabharata has to learn to stay in line, another glorious flop of the year, Eklavya! Comparison with the Sweet Hearts and Lolit's is inevitable, since the so-called Plotlinie should be inspired by them. but unfortunately, Ramu has barely made any serious effort to delve deep into the psyche of aging and young people. Is Lolly Pop the ultimate indicator of innocence? and in contrast to this childish ramble, the leg at the dining table reveals itself with a vijay, that is, Bacchan in that role, and incessantly breaks out into guards in shameless laughter? This girl is indeed in her seductive game and tempts poor Vijay to think she's in love with him. Even the legs are thin enough, and the fact that the water hose is stuck through the legs is quite obscene. It is understandable for everyone, how can a girl who comes as a guest in the house of a body, be so bold, bold and overpowering? and why the hell was this stupid woman, played by Revathi, remarkably good, though poorly written and unrealistically characterized, encouraging her own husband to dance with a sexy girl? This part of Vijay trying to get some soft drinks for his normal life is downright nonsense. Apparently, it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well thought-out life and a hobby that he can reshape. This is reminiscent of the blame for Rio, the older father, and his young love, the Michael Caine plays outstanding. Bacchan looks awesome in close-ups, and especially when Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons looked unhappy and handsome, which is why the young chicks are sometimes attracted to older men for their charming personality compared to the vulnerability of boys to their age. The only good thing about this film is the green, expansive landscapes, winding roads and pleasant cinematography. No substance or even a sparkling appearance of emotion, drama or even fascinating, stormy sex as in Lolita. This flat film has no miracle, fell flat on his face and had to be rolled off the screens in the first few weeks! Next time Ramu has to do his homework before copying such a Hollywood theme headlong, and Bacchan should think twice! You can not fool all people at any time, Mr. Bacchan!
