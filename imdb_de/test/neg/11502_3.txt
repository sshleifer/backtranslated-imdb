This show is pretty decent and fun, she is a great Disney channel and sometimes entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season, but I hated the second and third season. This show has completely changed. The first season was more about science and animals, all that is now gone in the season and the third season. It's more about her life and dating. Since this gay kid (Ben) came along, this show is shit. The authors made an absolutely good children's show and turned them into a fucking teen comedy. Disney worsened. I can not see the latest episodes, they're all garbage.
