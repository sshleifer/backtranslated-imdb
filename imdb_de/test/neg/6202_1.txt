If you're planning to see "partners" and read about it in the IMDb reviews, you've already wasted too much time on the stupid, idiotic, horrible movie of the movie 'Hitch.' I decided to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews I heard about this movie and waste precious 20 minutes for it. I thought that eventually David Dhawan who produces him has Govinda? But after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, I could not take it anymore and switched my computer off 1 star rating because that's the lowest you can do. If I could go deeper, I would have rated it -100.
