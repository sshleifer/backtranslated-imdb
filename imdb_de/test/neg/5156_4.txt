Cockroaches are portrayed as super carnivorous killers in this movie. This was possibly the first movie in which cockroaches were the main killers, but not the first movie in which cockroaches are murderers. "Damnation Alley" showed a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story that she had. In this they are the star. Not as good as it could have been, this one does not have that many kills. However, I could be wrong about that because I have not seen it for a long time. The cockroaches are murderous and this very strange researcher is in town to study them. Yeah, she's pretty weird because she once has her hand in a box on the killer cockroaches and she's like "you're biting my hand," and she almost says that in ecstasy. There is also a super big cockroach at the end of this, as in so many insect films. Not a great movie, but it's worth trying out a night you're bored with.
