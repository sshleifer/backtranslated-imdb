I was an extra in this movie, but I wish I was not because of the trash. The worst thing about this movie is the music, but the drama, script, editing, direction and story are also awful. The main reason is bad because the budget is so low and the only way to make a good low-budget movie is to have a good script. the script that should have been ripped open before the movie is made is not funny, I did not even laugh. What made me laugh is, as the creators probably think, the most important thing is to make the movie. The film needed about a million pounds more budget and a better author. The only reason why I did not give the movie any of ten is that I'm sorry the guy will lose a few hundred giants if he does that. haha
