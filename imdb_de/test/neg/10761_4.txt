It's unbeatable how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is not an understatement to call it far-fetched. How the man managed to build a wooden labyrinth of underground spaces in such a short time is pretty ridiculous or perhaps he was the best carpenter since Jesus. The obscure sheriff, played by Hoyt Axton, looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show, and I found blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather simple. Here in the United Kingdom, we have an expression: mutton as lamb, which fits in perfectly with her. It was not all bad, but I really enjoyed it when the credits rolled and "The End" surfaced in discounters in no time.
