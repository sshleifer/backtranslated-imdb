Not much happens in this movie. There are some crucial moments, and everything else speaks of a crucial moment that takes place before the film begins. The main mechanism in the story is the flashback. Flashbacks can be used very well but are not here. There is no indication when flashing back and forth, and there are only a few weeks to separate the events. So when a scene develops, you can only know when something happens. Maybe this should give a sense of mystery in places, but it was largely annoying. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in watching a 100-minute discussion about the why of things on screen and enjoy lazy asking good against evil. If you see close-ups of a mostly blank look on Ryan Gosling's face while you cover most of the movie, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I can not find a reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as noted in another review, Spacey is really just in a cameo role playing with a disinterested detachment that you've probably already seen. *** The rest contains some spoilers Big points are held back *** <br /> <br /> First, the killing of the so-called backward boy happens before the movie starts, and we never know what exactly happened. The implication is that he was killed to stop the deep sadness mediated by the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions, as the characters beyond the boy and the main character are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> What about the main character? ... Another report suggested he was crazy. I agree that he is not "right", but I do not know that I would call it crazy. It seems that the film was trying hard to convey that he was either autistic or in some way lagging behind because he certainly seemed slow and could not understand the obvious. Either that or they wanted a neglected adolescent with a resolution disorder and / or who was heavily medicated. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at giving the audience something, but it seems to be exactly what he was deliberately in the air in this case. This movie does not provide any answers, just questions, but it was a bad enough movie that really did not interest me.
