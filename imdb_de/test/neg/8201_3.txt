This is a very low-budget movie that's in a place in a valley that is shielded by radiation. The cast, an elderly man and a daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a hard buy and a gallon), a drifter, a donkey, and an irradiated man, interact during the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There is also a unit that watches the women while bathing. <br /> <br /> They all have guns, some of them are shot, some of them are supposed to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away Well, that's the movie. Harvey Cormann's first film shows a certain simplicity in filming. To avoid expensive sets, actors walk through curtains to enter and leave the house (ie the studio). The filming locations in the hills near Hollywood form the backdrop. <br /> <br /> I would not say that it is worth seeing, but it is interesting to see how human-made films were made in the 1950s.
