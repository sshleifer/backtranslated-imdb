Gritty drama? Emotionally strong? Blah! The BBC has lost big time through masterful productions like HBO's The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale. Okay, the budget is much smaller, but last night's "The Street" was badly traded, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a great waste of time. Television (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is still falling behind American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no feeling of brutal violence by the "local gangster". There was no indication that this man was "insane" enough to beat a man he had respected for a long time. There was no remorse when he did, and this was not the kind of character that would fall behind when Bob Hoskins called his son a pansy in a "valor" ad. I wish I was more eloquent in expressing my contempt for this show, but I am not and although I can not prove my point well enough, believe me when I say that this was trash, shock TV, that does not offer a truly inward perspective of life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
