Sadness was the emotion I felt after the screen went dark. Confused was another. Why should two experienced veterinarians like Matthau and Lemmon register for this lazy project? I have the impression that they have not read the script before the cameras start to roll. The entire cast is wasted in this listless, uninteresting and unimpressive movie. Unfortunately, this was one of Edward Mulhare's last projects, here as a heavy one. Dyan Cannon tries it, Hal Linden looks bored and Donald O'connor recites a few lines that are loaded with madness. (?? !!). I am not at the Legion of Decency. My point is that they only bubbled up for the strangeness when he heard him in the non-colored language. This is a desperate attempt to integrate "humor" into a picture. In fact, he provided the only bite of entertainment as he patted the dance floor. My hardest criticism I save for the hints. Walter Matthau should have known better. He still delivers great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character is gracious, but rather boring and one-dimensional. I saw him once, saw everyone. Jack Lemmon gives another of his hallmarks, weepy, "just too damn sensitive" male depictions. When he starts this mode, I want to give him a box of handkerchiefs. OUT TO SEA is painless and the one who made this mess should run the plank.
