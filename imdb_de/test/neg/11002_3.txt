The Fanglys is located in a small Texas town called Layton on the eve of Halloween, while city dwellers treat it as the second coming of Christ. Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was called to another murder when local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) discovered a body in the surrounding woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch killing teenagers, who knows? A fun guy, Mark (director and producer Robert Harvey) convinces his wife Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to drive to a cemetery that his buddy Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before for a Halloween party. The idea of ​​staying in a cemetery in the middle of the forest evidently appeals to Kelly and she agrees, along with Steven and a girl named Camille (Natalie Woods) and her nerdy friend Jerry (Tim Boswell) has found for a night of fun, as well as much fun you can expect in a remote cemetery. However, they soon discover that the legend of Fang Lady is far removed from the bedtime story that makes up many ... <br /> <br /> Edited, produced by executive producer, written and directed by Christopher Abram. The Fanglys are a pretty stupid attempt on a horror movie. The script is very predictable, boring and offers no entertainment value in the right hands and with a decent budget. The Fanglys could have been an effective horror movie, but it's not like that. It moves at a reasonable pace, but the "action" on the screen is so bad that it does not matter. I do not know what else to say. The Fanglys is a really bad movie and I can not see it Anyone who gets some kind of enjoyment from it. The dialogue is simple, the characters are clichéd and lifeless, while the movie as a whole appears much longer than the 90 minute runtime. There are a few lame attempts at humor that do not sit so well next to the horror elements. And what was this retard posture in this cage? I would imagine that the budget did not allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what's going to happen to Jerry in the end, then you'll have to look after the credits while revealing the lame truth, assuming you can actually get this far (believe me, that it takes a few steps ) <br /> <br /> Director Abram does not do anything special. Abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light are stylish. I can tell him that it is not when the movie is shot in the forest. There is no atmosphere, fear, excitement, excitement or elements that make a good horror movie good. Forget about a decent gore when someone eats some skin off an arm and puts a pitchfork through a person's throat. Obviously, the Fanglys had a $ 2,837 filming budget, which makes them one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release and to be brutally honest, it shows. What about the backward guy and his fake shaving teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the camcorder cinematography and the terrible spectacle of all involved, which makes the sitting even more. <br /> <br /> The Fanglys is downright a video crap, it has no redemptive features Whatever & it's low IMDb user score is completely justified, it's one of the movies I put on within half an hour the clock looked and wished the thing was just finished.
