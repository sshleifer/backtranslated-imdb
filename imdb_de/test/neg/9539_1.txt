I assume that this movie came from. I mean, I've seen a lot of B movies in my young life, and I would not even class that as a B-movie. I remember watching movies in my high school mass media class outclassing them. <br /> <br /> So the premise is ... a lot of dancing numbers and stupid crap. Women in bikinis, who do not look so great at first, dance in the beginning and sing. Hairy-haired guys are emerging and girls with fangs out in the sunlight. I mean, I can hardly put together a coherent sentence if I just think about this movie. According to most people on this site, Manos, The Hand of Destiny and Pod People are the worst movies (MST3K classic :-D) ... I was one of them. Then I saw this movie. I do not usually try to ruin a movie too much, but the people who did it really deserve it. It is so bad and so unbearable, and I assume that the director or an actor in the film is the only person who rated this at ten.
