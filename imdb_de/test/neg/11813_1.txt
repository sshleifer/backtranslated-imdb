The worst thing about this movie is that it did not have to be that horrible. <br /> <br /> You had a good budget, although many films do; They made it look sleek and pretty, and best of all they had the lesbian-savvy 21st-century audience interested in a lesbian-positive movie ... and yet the author and director have done everything they can to make each and every revised film to improve lesbian torments and confusion in boarding schools (you know, the place where all lesbian lovers live and die). <br /> <br /> This is an issue that has been made over and over again and AGAIN in the movie, but something that audiences apparently can not get enough - using this voting forum as a guide. <br /> <br /> Every element of this story was so exaggerated, inappropriately wrong and invented that it was painful to sit through. The main characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, ingenious, rebellious lesbian, tough girl (well, they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to roast her, but she did not stop much) seducing a rich girl, destined to to betray her. <br /> <br /> You will watch every step of the way. Character 3 is a stupid, well-meaning, wide-open, good girl. I say 'every step' because she shares every one of her thoughts with the audience about the stiffest and most indecent monologues. <br /> <br /> Her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen-year-old, though they try so hard. It's so hard to sound like a fifteen-year-old really, um, you know, well ... talk. "To hear her with her sounds was, um, well ... okay!" She tells of her two wanton roommates, who roll around in bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later, she asks Graham Greene, the consummate American actor totally wasted in a role as a gardener (!). "Is it wrong to be interested in what people think?" <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but is she a teenager or is she 7 years old? Granted, Piper Perabo (as Polly the Torture) Dyke) & others do a fine job of talking to the awful lines that force them. Perabo has a pleasant energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. It would do well in a decent project, so this is in no way a critique of acting. <br /> <br /> But this story is SHAMELESS when it comes to perpetuating all stereotypes about lesbians in a person. They could not stop herself (Polly) from being an angry, crazy-passionate, secret genius who ended math problems for the speechless teacher. Oh, that's after arguing with the teacher who dares accuse her of gabbing. <br /> <br /> "That's a word YOU (men) use against US (women)!" she says, trudging out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is this ALL, what could the writer do? Or maybe we should ask: why stop? <br /> <br /> Poole and Co. went on to make Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by shouting their name in the woods. <br /> <br /> Cue the slow motion, sci-fi, Xena atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we wrote her to her birth mother ... (most lesbians are starving orphans after love, in case you were in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one in the middle, one in a crazy guy) with loose neck ties), who float around the whole action (the school looks terribly big for only 2 teachers). and give tense glances to dark child / seductress / bird girl. Hmmmm. I wonder if something is good, you know ... um, FUN is happening between these TWO TEACHERS ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for something that is done so badly. Heartbreak is happening, but the writer and the director certainly know that there are lesbians in far more demanding times than this blow. <br /> <br /> I can not put an end to those who are forced to push through to the end. But if you do not laugh, I can only assume that you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I do not mean the shaky scenes.
