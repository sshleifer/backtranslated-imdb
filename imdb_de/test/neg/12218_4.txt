The real problem with this story is that the story does not tell much. There is hardly a conspiracy to talk about. Widower buys an electric grandma for his children. A child resists the electric grandma. Then she finally accepts her. Then the children grow up and Grandma leaves. Really, very little happens. It is much more a premise than a story. <br /> <br /> In addition, you should free it from Schmaltz, and you have a story that has been made before, and better: The Lonely. The same basic idea: Humans can not initially accept the love of a robot because it is just a machine and then gives in to the robot and will love it. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful as both the protagonist and us, the audience, are abruptly shocked and forced to remember that the robot is really just a mechanism in the end /> I also find the story very flawed that the electric grandmother is just too perfect. She is not only "human", she is * superhuman *. She is * wiser * than a real person, she has no traces of mechanics and she makes marbles appear out of nothing. Honestly, it really hurts when she thinks she's a machine.
