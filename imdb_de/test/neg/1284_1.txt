I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old. He has not laughed once during the entire movie ... and he loves dogs and will laugh at almost everything! This movie was horrible from all angles: bad script (even for a G-rated movie for kids), bad production (the nervous camera shots made me sick in the first ten minutes), bad acting (maybe they were "judged") Act cartoonish) and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the audio level seems good, then you can not hear what the next actor says). I'm ready to endure a lot when it comes to a child's movie, but that was worse than having a stick in my eyes. I also did not like being hit over the head with God-Heaven Faith. All in all, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I wasted some time on my day!
