One of the worst movies I saw in the 90s. I would often use it as a benchmark when watching other films. "At least it was not as bad as Caro Diario." Three absolutely pointless segments in which the director plays himself - and he is not particularly interesting. A whole section about this hypochondriac going to the doctor. Another in which he rides his scooter through the countryside. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen agonizing minutes. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set on Keith Jarrett's 'Koln Concert'. Asked me to go home and rediscover this wonderful album. The best thing to say about the director / actor / egoist is that he has a good taste in music.
