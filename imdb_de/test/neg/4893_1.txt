This movie was ridiculous from the beginning. Let me save you all the time before watching this movie. A woman selling corn brandy to locals picks up her cousin or nephew and convinces her to open a café downstairs in her house. She does it and she and the cousin get closer. Later, there is a scene in which she connects with her lips. Later, the woman learns that an old friend is returning from jail, and it is tense, leading to a fist fight in the café. The cousin / nephew of the woman is in love with the man. The end was terrible, the story was terrible, and if I could get the time I wasted on this movie, I'd appreciate it. A definite jump.
