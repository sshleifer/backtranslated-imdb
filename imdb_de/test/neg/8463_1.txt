Five Fingers is so bad that I hardly know where to start. Let me first admit that I only saw the first half hour. After the first finger was chopped off, I considered sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Could not the producer, the director and / or the scriptwriter ask a chess amateur? Like me? You should have used a digital chess clock and no analogue. This big weakness only makes the mental pressure on Martijn laugh. How, when and why did Martijn have a Moroccan girlfriend? Such a thing is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> If you call me delays, of course, this is an insult to anyone who suffers from a much lower than average IQ. As far as I know, retards do not play chess. I do that. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is of course the script. Just compare the little intelligent movie Hard Candy. In order to control the viewer, the information must be revealed piece by piece. A nice turn helps every now and then. From other reviews I understood that at the end of the movie there is a big one. Every smart person can guess what it is. Of course this raises further questions - why is the guide killed? Oh my God, why should I care? The whole movie focuses on just one thing: the choppy fingers. The creators have not even learned the lesson of Hitchcock: It's exciting to explode a bomb. It's more exciting to show how the bomb is ticking. But no, we will not see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown is over. I will not waste words on this crap anymore. Go to Hard Candy.
