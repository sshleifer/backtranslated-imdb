Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal pretending to be a spiritual being, but to hit and kill heads as if it were nothing. Of course, in the end he justifies it by donating the money to an orphanage. How sweet. Make the world disappear and we ignore it when you look after a little girl. Jeesh! This time he is partner of Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). I have to have someone hanging up all those frightened lines, man, and there are many. The dialogue is pure crap. <br /> <br /> They are following the bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people who were born to play the fools. <br /> <br /> He presses Mari Morrow and impresses with soap star Sarah Buxton. How sweet. <br /> <br /> I think if you have a July Force excitement this may be enough. If nothing else, it will help you to graduate in Seagalology.
