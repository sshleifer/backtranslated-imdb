When I saw the icon on TV, I was surprised. I know the first clue was that it was on the Hallmark Channel - it must be said - sorry !! I was hopeful when I saw that FF was the executive producer, but very quickly, I realized that the TV movie and the book were all about name and character names. The TV act was a bumblebee, to say the least, but I agree that the action was worth 3 stars in and of itself. In my opinion, Mr. Swayze could have portrayed a valid Monk, but I think to do the film justice, it would have been a much longer movie, and I do not think Hollywood itself would have done the act of discrediting by deception. An example is the terrible movie version of The sum of all fears - do I have to say more?
