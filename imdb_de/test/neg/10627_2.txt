Trying to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to conquer a tropical island that looks like a paradise, so the men who hired his team can mine it for bird droppings. In fact, the nitrogen gas that comes out of the dirt on this island is what they are looking for. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this movie - the island location where it was filmed was beautiful. Otherwise, the story drowns itself and leaves the actors no business. Result: Much violence, lots of language, lots of blood and a few women who are upstairs without. If you want senseless violence (sorry, history can not even give violence a point, even though it tries), then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Parents: Be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood, the R rating.
