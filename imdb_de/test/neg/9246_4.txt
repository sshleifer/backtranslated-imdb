Too broken for fun, too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be bearable. MR LONELY is an interesting idea that is ruined by the really bad movies. Like a Ken Russell movie in its worst form or the DAY OF THE LOCUST of amateurs, MR LONELY might have a good idea and a free vacation somewhere but in the US for a few scraps of paper (no script, as you can see) We end up with a widescreen movie that looks like it was made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did is a brilliant creation. Or did I understand the filmmaker correctly? MR LONELY is a waste of resources trying to (gawd!) Quirkily and deliberately get out of balance. It will end up annoying and indulgent .. and pointless. What's the point of going to a community in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about Hollywood deception. Maybe Korine wanted to redo GODSPELL ... well, the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh, and there are some subplots like leftover shots of Fitzcaraldo, including Werner Herzog, nuns, and a plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistfully and melancholy, and add to James Fox, who seems to hope that he (as in PERFORMANCE) is considered daring. The result is an amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen format. It was fun to film, but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
