There are two parts to this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. The "present" time when Gulliver is at home in England, and soon by the evil Dr. Bates is taken to a madhouse. <br /> <br /> 2. The "described" time when Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> Times are interspersed with a very choppy pace, which makes the willing tension of unbelief far more difficult than if the movie had been easy, discarded that part and followed the book as written. There is no Dr. in the book. Bates, no asylum, and Mrs Gulliver is mentioned very little. The journeys - in the plural - are presented in the film as one. There are several films that deal with the topic of mentally ill people brought into the asylum by a nasty person out there. The "Now" period adds absolutely nothing to the history's value, is a complete invention of movie adapters, taking valuable time out of real history. The whole time this happened, I longed for the next real trip. <br /> <br /> So much for the disadvantages. The parts that are actually part of the actual story are well done, and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small (and some mid-sized) pieces of real travel are simply cut out, but that does not stop the story from happening. This is AFAIK, the only version that represents all four trips, and that's why the movie should be mentioned. <br /> <br /> The two interspersed parts receive about the same time. I rate the first part with 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage with 8/10. On average I give a 4/10. Had they just saved the garbage and focused 99% on the actual trips, as this saving would have taken much more time to complete the details. <br /> <br /> I do not know why some adapters think he's talented enough to improve Swift's work. My best guess is that CGI was so expensive in 1996 that the film company felt the need to incorporate many fillers that did not require elaborate sets, GCI, etc., to keep the total cost under control a certain number of minutes arrived.
