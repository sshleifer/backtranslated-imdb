I'm a big Shirley Temple fan. When I saw this movie, I knew what a talented child Shirley really was. Ashley Rose Orr possibly made the worst Shirley on the screen. Imagine an 11-year-old Shirley Temple, which is five years old. That's wrong in itself. But make her emulate Shirley's voice? And her singing is sad. The dance was good, I say that. As other users have said, there were few dramatic scenes, nothing that makes the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to see more of the worldwide phenomenon that Shirley Temple had created. The Wizard of Oz was concentrating too much when Shirley was actually being considered for Dorothy. The movie portrays it as if it were the end of the world if it does not get the role. Shirley herself said that she is glad that Judy Garland could play her. For me, the star of the show was the lady who played the Gertrude Temple. Otherwise stay away! For great Shirley Temple movies, check out Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
