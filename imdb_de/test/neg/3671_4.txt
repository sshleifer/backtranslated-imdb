Take a few dark and stormy nights, mist of the coast, obsession and doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hate, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night silently smashing a glowing cigarette butt, and finally, a trembling heroine who sees herself threatened both by her own doubts and by one - but which ones? - from the men around her. Sounds like we have a good 80-minute noir. Undercurrent, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and with two A-list leaders Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, will lead to a nearly two-hour matin√©e melodrama, a long slog of threatening anxiety amidst perfectly groomed, sewn and clothed cast. If you take a look at your watch halfway through a movie and find that you have an hour left with a sinking heart, both you and the movie are likely to have problems. <br /> <br /> Minnelli, in one of his earliest non-musical films, is not as heavy on the Rococo Greenhouse approach as he later did. But what is essentially a simple story of greed, murder, and obsession is transformed into an endless vehicle by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn shows us in carefully lit close-ups how to demonstrate fear, love, fear, dizziness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and horror. Robert Taylor is more or less involved. <br /> <br /> Hepburn begins the movie as the tomboyer Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in pants who helps her father with his inventions. Her housekeeper is determined to marry her. As Dr. Hamilton decides to sell Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor) an important formula, this is love at first sight. Garroway is the sleek, handsome, dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, who was critical to the war, making him a tough millionaire maker. He is an industrial captain, as one of his many Washington friends says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may still be a bit of the tomboy, but her husband shows her how she gets dressed and how she is a successful social host to all the congressmen and judges her husband knows. She learns quickly and eagerly. Both are obvious and blissfully in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. The cancer is gnawing. Ann realizes she knows nothing about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk to her about it. When she learns that Alan's mother has died at the piano in Middleburg, or he has a brother, Michael, who has disappeared, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes gets angry. He always apologizes. But wait again. Did his mother really play the piano? Did not she really die in bed? Had Michael not been caught taking money from the family company and Alan sent him away? All this takes place against the exquisite hotel suites, the well-kept country house in Middleburg with the horse stable and the tasteful ranch house by the sea. Everyone in the movie, except the employees, is wearing the nines. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black and white film, Minnelli can not help but provide us tables with crystal and porcelain, tasteful and elegant furniture, and many dresses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after all is known, Ann is being chased on horseback by a villain on another horse along a high, well-designed mountain trail as she is threatened Death by boulders and her Prosecutor finally meets death on horseback, it's a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, can not bring much suspense to the movie. What would have been in a few hands probably a tight little B-movie, with the A-list is just a revised melodrama, too big for his bones.
