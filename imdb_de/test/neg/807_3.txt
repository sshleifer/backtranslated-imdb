Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a miner (probably the Ozarks) hunting with his favorite raccoon. However, the dog seems to drown when Hunnicutt jumps after him. It quickly becomes clear that despite Hunnicutt and his dog, who wandered around after leaving the water, both have died in the water - since no one answers, when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog. Strangely enough, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow in recording and it takes a while for him to understand that they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as upholstery because there really was not enough material to fill the half hour window. Later, in the "Surprise Curve", he comes to heaven - or to heaven At least his concept of the place. He is invited, but since they do not allow dogs, he has other ideas! Well played altogether, but of dubious spiritual value! Without twists or ironies, this episode is a bit boring - not "Twilight Zone-y" enough for my taste.
