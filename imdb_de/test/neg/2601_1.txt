This is the most overrated show on TV. I think people continue to see it because they feel they should, because it has become a kind of "cool" show that lets you watch your friends the next day at work or at school can. it rarely triggers anything more than a giggle and never provokes a sense of irony or thought in the audience. Every joke is interchangeable with "punch lines" that are seemingly pulled out of a hat. The total lack of originality in combination with the even sophisticated Lamer spin (see: American Dad) makes me question the intelligence of a public that keeps this awful show on TV. I give the family man no points and may God be merciful to his soul ...
