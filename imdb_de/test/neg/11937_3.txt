I had high hopes for this film when I saw the offer and decided to watch it on television without interruption. I've loved Lee Van Cleef in a lot of movies, but I'm afraid if the other characters call him Chris repeatedly, he will not even become a decent facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris. <br /> <br /> I've found this The film is a complete disappointment - the musical sound has tried to convey the splendor shown in the original, but even he has not made the film the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were missing mostly in this film. I think if you did not see the original, it would be okay. Too many clich√©s and too little depth for the characters. I missed the humanity and the compassion and the three-dimensional characters of the original.
