The film begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant, who fight against the same vampires. This scene is probably the best in the entire movie. The rest of the movie is sadly cheesy, highly unrealistic and a rip-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The end is shit, too. <br /> <br /> A few moments, such as the scene in which Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular Chinese duo-band Twins: Charlene & Gillian) fighting for a stuffed teddy bear, are particularly jarring. The plot is also lame, surely they could have found something more frightening than a book entitled "Day after Night". Some good parts. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film bearable with their comic roles. However, the good parts end right there. Charlene & Gillian (from Twins) have never been able to behave well and annoy you to pieces. Unfortunately, the role of the friendly but crappy vampire was awarded to Edison Chen, who is a talentless handsome boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
