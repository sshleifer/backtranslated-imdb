At a time when Duvivier returned from strength to strength, he was released. "Black Jack", trapped between the overlooked extraordinary "Au Royaume des Cieux" and the dazzling, stunning "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", is a mess that Duvivier himself hated, which is not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this guy. We can note the following: 1. Orson Welles admired Duvivier. That might explain why Duvivier's films featured Wellesian actors: Joseph Cotten in Lydia (1941), and here a completely wasted Agnes Moorehead. It's the first time I have not enjoyed Moorehead's performance. Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier). Duvivier's "Au Royaume des Cieux" for his "Othello". <br /> 2. There are one or two worthwhile sequences in every Duvivier movie, and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier has the meaning of Mystery works wonders (for a short time), then the hunt when Dalio gets involved in th e fishnets.Duviviers touch is also felt at the unfortunate end. <br /> <br /> As far as the rest, according to my dear pen pal's reign, this is a black joke.
