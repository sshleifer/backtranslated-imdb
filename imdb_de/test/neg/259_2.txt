Where should I start with this film? All I know is that it's a mess. Be the script, the story or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing by Salman Khan, who gave us a funny Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before. Secondly, Rani really gets annoying and appears in every stupid movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (glad that Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story was stolen by The Wedding Singer, but ruins the funny movie. The dialogues are missing. I may have laughed here and there, but entertained? NO!!! Salman Khan was bearable in the above films, but here he is crazy. His character is poorly written. In a minute he is poor, and in the next minute you ask yourself how poor he is. Rani Mukherjee looks like a simple Jain and did not try. She has fortunately been replacing her career with Saathiya because her career was completely crazy during that time. Pooja Batra has a small charm with her look, but it's still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. Kashmira Shah's beauty and acting escapes her because she has chosen such a terrible screenplay. Raveena Tandon looks nice but does not perform well. Mohnish Behl receives the award for the worst (supporting) actor (they need razzies because of terrible films in India). He says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks funny and is not in his normal form. Just to tell you, there are more to the performers, who are also terrible. If Raveena's stunning beauty had not been in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I would not give the film a point. Otherwise the dance of Salman was terrible. Pooja Batra danced like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I wish the costumes were reworked and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dance) blown away by the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya, which does not have enough good pictures. The same applies to the reasonably decent title song. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) is a no for everyone.
