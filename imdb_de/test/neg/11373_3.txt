I rated it with 3 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> And, sadly, I looked at the film schedule for this channel so as not to miss it. I wanted to watch this movie because it's based on a book by my favorite author, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected to love this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Ms. Wilson felt about the movie, but I found it a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> It should have been fascinating - it was a mystery - playing in Spain, and the main character Cassandra is a language translator contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers Cassandra plenty of money to pay her ex -Men Ben Find There are secrets galore, but for some reason it did not matter. It was like, so what? I could not deal with these characters or take care of them or feel for them. I could not even identify with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think a big part of the film's failure was the actress who played the main character. She looked old, tired, exhausted and dull like rinse water. Her hair was an eternal mess, her loose clothes were boring and she just was not appealing or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was to listen to a Dean Martin recording, but even that was ruined by the strange make-up worn by the man who danced and lipped to the song. Believe me, it was nothing but seeing the really good-looking Mr. Martin at work. <br /> <br /> The end is so syrupy that you wish you had pancakes with the syrup. <br /> <br />
