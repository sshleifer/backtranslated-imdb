The core themes (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can and should be extremely compelling (as thousands of artwork / music / literature / film show). Unfortunately, End of Days is nothing more than a two-dimensional cartoon.

Girlfriend? It is both erotically charged and dismissive - the vampire themes are modernized, the seductive power of evil.
