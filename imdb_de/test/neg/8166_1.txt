Well, I just caught the last end of this movie on HBO, just the last 10 minutes or so, but I have to say that it probably contains the most ridiculous depiction of the distance track ever shot! I am a serious runner and avid fan of the sport. I've been to many painful demonstrations in movies. Nothing could ever prepare me for what is being shown on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this movie. It literally contradicts the belief! The portrayal of the runners is even more ironic, considering that African runners dominate the sport completely and are elegant and graceful. The female protagonist shuffles like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "well-trained" male supporters are no better. Until well into the race, this alleged world-class runner is surrounded by chubby, overweight people, many of whom are WALKING! I find it interesting that the director has decided to lead the female competition, but in the end she is shown passing people who look like they are stumbling on two broken legs! Should we believe that this amazing outstanding athlete has passed just one crippled person at the end of the race? Maybe the director just thinks runners can not run faster than 12 minutes, and he's obviously never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you're not a run fanatics you'll be amazed by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running, and this movie is just an unintentional comedy. Here's a hint to the director: Next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, it may be worthwhile hiring at least one person who has actually watched this sport.
