Uma and Travolta were very good together, but when they left the screen, the movie was nothing more than a bunch of very boring and verbose minor characters packed into extremely poor writing. Occasional glimpses of size, such as the dance scene between Uma and Travolta, quickly eroded as Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting thugs appeared. And the white guy who tried to black out became VERY, VERY tiresome after having too much exposure in the picture. He did a pretty good job on the rock, the only minor character you could not expect to leave the screen. Bad, stupid plan. Obviously, the authors could not figure out if they were writing Generation X or the 12-15 year rap crowd, and the combination turned into a movie that stared at my watch!
