I absolutely can not believe my colleagues in the IMDb area. All praise for how "original" this movie is, it's as if they have never seen "Ring" or millions of imitations that have sprung up in the 10 years since this film. And some claim to be horror movies! I do not think so! "Shutter" is fine. Average, I would say. I give 5 out of 10, but there's just no way, it's original and great and "the scariest thing I've ever seen," said one critic. Puh-leeeze, people. This one is easy. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear when I see another ghost movie in which the hero tracks the mind's past to find out why she's so crazy, and then I'll scream. <br /> <br /> "Original"? Give me a break. You have to come out more. Or at least stop calling yourself "horror movie fans".
