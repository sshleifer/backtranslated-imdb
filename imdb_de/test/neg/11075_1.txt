I love movies ... and rarely do I see a movie I hate ... but this was the worst movie I have ever seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends in a rape scene is awful. No doubt ... I can not believe I spent 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really mad, I want my money back and my time back. DREADFUL! Do not go, the cinematography is terrible, the plot is terrible, the end is terrible. I did not know what was going on for half of the movie because I could not see it (and I was looking at a very nice and big TV). Rent saw, the hills had eyes or a house made of wax of which are better if you want something sinister.
