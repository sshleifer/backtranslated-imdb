This film was utterly unwholesome, disturbing and unsatisfactory. Apart from a few nice photos of Italy there is nothing that could recommend this film. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a broken existence - the _next_ guy you meet, sleeping with after knowing for a few hours that he needs to be Mr. Right. As far as the humor is concerned, there are some in the film as well, but I can not see anyone calling this a romantic comedy, because about three quarters of the movie is totally depressing! My recommendation? Skip it in the cinemas, wait for it to appear on DVD, and skip it there too. I want someone to give me back the two hours I wasted by watching this filth.
