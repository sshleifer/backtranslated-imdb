A Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he became famous and did not make him famous. (That would be done by "The Firm"). Therefore, this movie was shot much later, after Grisham had no meaningless books with the dollar-dollar signs in mind. Unlike most, this book was actually about something. It had meat, it had weight and it had heart. <br /> <br /> But it also had a deadly mistake, and this deadly mistake was translated into the movie. Namely, with "A Time To Kill" you will be used. <br /> <br /> Here we have a black man (Jackson) standing trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old boy. We have an underdog lawyer (McConaughey) who is fighting the big bad system to save his client. By the way, the whole thing is against the background of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses. <br /> <br /> In other words, we should sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We are to believe that a father who loves his daughter is entitled to kill the men who raped her. We are to feel the injustice of a system in which a racist, entirely white jury could judge a black man who has just tried to avenge a brutal crime. We feel like we're standing next to people singing "Free Carl Lee." <br /> <br /> But the racism problem is a smoke screen, and the whole thing is invented. Carl Lee Hailey was Vigilante. Yes, there were extenuating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he was not innocent. This would have been true, regardless of the color of his skin or the color of the skin of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else. <br /> <br /> And what's so cumbersome about this movie? Anyone who thinks Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be, if you think the law should not be taken in your own hands, you could burn crosses in a meadow that has a hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the case The first time a strong dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it will not be the last. As a movie, A Time To Kill remains fairly loyal to the book, and acting is not bad. But it really played the hand with which it was dealt. Even a good cast can not improve bad starting material.
