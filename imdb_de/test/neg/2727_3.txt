In times like these, I really wish I was a passionate reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, as few things feel worse than not fully understanding a movie with this stunning "visual" caliber. Based on the novella "Cabal," the story of "Nightbreed" encompasses an immense amount of lush and bizarre creatures and locations in an underground society of demonic ghouls. A normal guy connects to the alien world called Midian through his dreams and his psychiatrist forces him to believe he's been responsible for a series of cruel family killings in recent months ... Given that, he moves to Midian back - under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. The diminutive is, however, entitled to Homeboys healings with a devious plan to whip up the nightbreed community ... <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie so much that in the long run I was very disappointed. Unfortunately I did not read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and its purpose and all these monsters were terribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand how the final cut went to hell and even Barker shows a modest aversion to the overall product, but I simply did not "understand" it. Although it is important to read the story, it should at least be translated into the film in a way that is understandable to those who are unfamiliar with the literature. If "Cabal" is as confused as this movie, then Barker has really milked a dead concept. I could not help but feel bored after a while, especially as things got increasingly ridiculous (somewhere in the prison scene I realized how boring I was) - like a police department fearlessly going to war with Midian, as happens every week! Nobody seems to take the idea of ​​immortal monsters as a bit strange. I liked the visual effects and all the crazy things that were going on in Midian, especially this porcupine lady and the big-headed SOB ... Definitely an epic movie, considering the tremendous amount of effects and the convincingly morbid decor. David Cronenberg fills his position well, while the crazy guy gets shrunk down with his cool potato sack mask with zipper, but we ALL wish he had worked behind the camera to save this bunch ... so if you're a Clive Barker And exactly what exactly Midian is, why they show the creatures during the first title sequence (terrible idea!) And why these creatures live there and how a punk kid shares a telekinetic connection you should probably try "Nightbreed". I'll one day look for "Cabal" and hopefully gain some perspective ... Or maybe I'll forget about this travesty ... Until then, this is a badly constructed and pretty boring mess of a movie. Look at Hellraiser instead.
