It's hard to get excited about this horrible cartoon-like epic, which for some reason has become a cult classic. This is certainly not the total artificial appearance of the scenery or the transparent effect of an All-Star-Cast. Nowadays it is shown far too often on the Fox Movie Channel or AMC. It hurts to report that experienced actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this kinky science-fiction travesty. It's like looking at an expensive budget spent on a Saturday afternoon show full of cardboard figures and unconvincing dialogue. It's a comic version of the Jules Verne novel. <br /> <br /> The maturing Fontaine was still attractive, but wears a painful expression on her face and perhaps regrets that she accepted the role of the psychiatrist before she read the script. She contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role, but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks most of the time out of place. Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and - above all Peter Lorre - and Frankie Avalon, who can sing the theme tune, which - one can say - do not become a popular theme tune, are no better. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience when you sit through a movie like this, which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost all intelligence. Absolutely unconvincing from beginning to end. The film sinks as well as the fantastic submarine long before the fight with a rubber caterpillar on the seabed and brings the film to a bleak conclusion.
