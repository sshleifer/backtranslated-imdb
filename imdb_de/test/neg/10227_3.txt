This is one of the most unoriginal, clich√©d films I've ever seen. Even if you did not like the forerunners of this movie, The Bad News Bears and The Mighty Ducks, you've probably done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class, they say, "Do not worry about us, we're all losers." You can see everything that is 30km away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to the spunky teacher, there's a group of supposedly brutal kids (they're brats, yes, but not so adorable), a slow-paced small-town sheriff they like to torture, an arrogant head coach, the winning rival team, and so forth. Only Olivia d'Abo as a new teacher shows sympathy. Steve Guttenberg was never particularly important to me before, and his performance as a sheriff does not change anything. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work for. Let's hope that the writer / director Holly Goldberg Sloan will find something better next time.
