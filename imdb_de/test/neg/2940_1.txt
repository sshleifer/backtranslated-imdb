Stay away from hell ... No, really, I'm serious - I know you think that's a funny, kitsch, cheesy Hong Kong action-style B movie. I did it, but trust me, it's not like that. In fact, the only thing that is true in this description would be the words Hong Kong and then used only in a strictly geographical sense. Yes, Donnie Yen has staged it. Jackie Chan has a cameo. The guy Ekin Cheng by Storm Riders plays the lead role. It got vampires. It should be good - or at least funny, charming and action-packed. Once again - that's not it. I could digress why this movie is shitty - I could split it up, chop it up into tiny, trembling pieces. But where should I start? There is so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it easier and to give some credibility to this hate, let me say that I am usually a big fan of Hog Kong cinema. The heavier drama stuff as well as the lighthearted action and / or comedy. The really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones. I can do bad subtitles for hours, jokes lie enough to roll my first graders with my eyes. I can treat lovers like chastity and celibacy like a congregation of nuns, and just about anything else that would arouse the average movie viewer's metaphorical toes on the path between the action sequences. Also Hong Kong or another origin - I love it when a movie gets bad, to be bad, to be good. <br /> <br /> But this - Arrgh! It's just awful, stupid, insurmountable garbage. So far from being funny or charming, it's actually painful. So derived from the action that a Bergman movie looks like a Texas massacre. <br /> <br /> Why? Why waste such an opportunity ?! That could have been so much fun!
