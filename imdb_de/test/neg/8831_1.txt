I want to make it clear that I am not religious at all. I am an atheist, but I could see that Richard Dorkins repeatedly contradicted himself. I'd also like to say that I'm not the sort of person who's always arguing against something with philosophy, but I think that if we compare science and religion, we have to be philosophical and willing to question the belief in the mainstream science I wonder if Richard Dorkins ever spends time philosophically thinking about faith. Anyone who thinks long enough and hard enough about science and religion will realize that science is indeed a religion itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way scientific beliefs are represented in comparison to other religions but at the roots there is the belief in a certain human instinct. In this whole series, Richard insists on scientific methods being the only correct way of thinking and it makes sense to believe only in something if the evidence is strong enough. If you delve deeply enough into the workings of science, you will realize that it is as irrational as religion and that ultimately it is based on faith, belief in the evidence, belief in our reason, belief in our senses, but more Otherwise, we believe in our instinct to follow repetitive patterns. <br /> <br /> This is not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were decided because they were the most common recurrence patterns and still we know that. I think that people have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something stays in a particular state or place of existence, the more we simply assume from the blind belief that it is more likely to stay that way. For example, we do not expect that gravity will suddenly work in the opposite direction tomorrow. I mean to push matter away as if it were putting on. But the only reason why we do not expect this sudden change is that we have known for so long that, as far as we know, it has always lured. However, that does not mean that tomorrow or even now it could not be the other way around. It does not matter how long something can stay in a certain state or change. There is no reasonable reason to make assumptions about it, but we do it out of instinct. I would ask you to consider what a long and short time is? There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it took for these alleged wise men to decide that everything has to consist of matter, sound, light, and so on, but let's give them what they think is an edge! Let's say much longer than it really was 12.00 billion years! Is that a long time? 99999999999999999 years makes 12.00 billion years like an incredibly short period of time. From what we know, within the next trillion years, there might be an extreme change in the so-called science laws. It's just about comparisons. Only when we compare things can we say "that's long," or that's short. The same applies to big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others. I doubt any scientist could tell me why he believes that trusting in this instinct makes sense. I certainly do not understand why that is, but that does not mean we as human beings should absolutely give it up. In view of this, the most hypocritical comment that Richard Dorkins made when he said that faith is irrational was "a process of not thinking," he said. If what we have in this instinct I have described, and that instinct we all have on a certain level, is not faith then I do not know what the hell it is. Other times when he is hypocritical are, when he talks about the Bronze Age, "Bronze Age myths," he says. I would point out that the pure rules of science are getting older, no matter how many scientific methods have changed over the years based on experience, experimentation and assessment. They could even be called the holy Bible of science. He figured he was tired of the persistence of the various religions: "I'm right, he's wrong," but looking back on how rude he was to the various respondents, he seems just as stubborn , To be fair, at least he does not try to bomb religious communities. I appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that cause war, but I do not respect his arrogance in his own beliefs. <br/> <br /> If I am, Richard has the right to believe in science, if that's his way. I am also scientifically interested, but I do not believe that he has the right to go to religious leaders who have unkind arguments, try to impose their opinions on them, and call them practically stupid. Despite all his education, experiences, and discoveries, he does not seem to have the wisdom to properly question his own belief system. I have read what he has read in defense of this argument, which open-minded atheists, such as myself, have read. What he claims suggests that he completely missed the point. Finally, the title of the documentary, Root of all evil. This says that religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. The entire documentary series was frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical and flat.
