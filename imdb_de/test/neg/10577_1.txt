This movie was the worst I have ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I had not been to the cinema, both my young cousins ​​(who also thought it was disappointing but not as terrible as I thought) would have left the cinema. There were two points in the movie I almost laughed at but the rest was either boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it was a parody of all the superhero movies (which I love), but in fact, it was mostly based on Spiderman, with a few slanted references to other superhero movies like Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can not say anything good about this movie. Do not waste your money on this movie - there are many other better movies!
