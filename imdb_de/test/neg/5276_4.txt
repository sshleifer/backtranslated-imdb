The German regional broadcaster WDR has shown both "The General" and ODC. On Saturday I saw "The General" and thought it was not very bad, but not very good either. But yesterday I saw ODC and turned it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the lead actor, the film was totally confusing and restless. "The General" just told the story and ordered, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference to the Guy Ritchie movies "Lock, Stick and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch," but not the coolness of these movies it's 3 out of 10!
