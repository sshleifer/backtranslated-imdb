Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you will thank me for that. This is the worst movie I have seen for quite some time. I came to this board with the same reaction that I had, but inexplicably there are several people who love this movie and especially the performance of Spacey. <br /> <br /> Some will torment me for saying so, but I think Kevin Spacey is quite limited for him despite the admiration of the world. I felt like I saw a meaner version of Kevin's "American Beauty" role. His character in this film is ridiculously exaggerated, right down to his ridiculous insults he throws at his assistant equal rather than sweating and low. Somehow I suspected that the scene should be funny, but at that time I was ready to press the stop button (this is about 20 minutes after the movie). <br /> <br /> What about the faux homage? to "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley announces, "I think I saw that in a movie once," as if he were cutting Spacey's ear off. But what does he use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, he'll give him paper cuts! This must be one of Hollywood's worst scenes, and the fact that the actors and the director have tried to do it with a straight face makes it even worse. <br /> <br /> I admit that I did not do it The end of this movie is not shown (my DVD was locked about half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say that could give me that Save line, that I missed a great turn and everything would have made sense. Well, I do not care what happened in the end, because it could never bring all the bad acting and the relentless dialogue over the top. I even had the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie as bad as I did.
