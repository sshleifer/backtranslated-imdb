Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire on the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a Buccaneer Captain whose name sparked scare in the hearts of sailors and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the London trading houses for a short year ..... Hmm, these Opening to the film sounds like we're going to do a damn growl, loot, rip up a movie, right? Well it is not. As a curiosity it is not completely worthless. Anne Of The Indies is adapted from the 20th Century Fox by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar after a short story by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Directed by Jacques Tourneur, the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson delivers Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the title title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence}, and the support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. Originally thought to be a true life pirate, Anne Bonny turns out to be a story about a woman who seeks identity and is in the predominantly male-led world of piracy and sea-based Shenanigans. Filled with clich√©s and well-known set pieces, the film also suffers from a mold that has a largely misfiring effect. Peters is fine, and Paget illuminates the screen with dazzling beauty. While Robertson Justice, while not being used, actually sees the role and does not exaggerate like the rest of the male cast. Some reviewers have desperately tried to delve deeply into the movie to find intelligence and hidden meanings just because it's touring the director's chair. But there is no depth here, this is just a job for Tourneur, a professional, but he is thinly planned and he actually lacks momentum to go with the buckles in the action piles. <br /> <br /> Best available. 4.10
