I did not really hear much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even these people would think that the movie was moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. This scene, the Dialouge, was great. And then the movie went downhill. <br /> <br /> While I respect the vision of the filmmaker, this movie has to shit. It was too slow, too predictable and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great as always, but this movie is not good enough to get through. It tries to be shocking and abnormal, but uses the talents of all actors inadequately. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.
