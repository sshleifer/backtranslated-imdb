If you're home for a week-end, very bored, and you lack the will to move, and have nothing better to do for your life in the next few hours, you might make fun of this movie. The drama and screenwriting and film production of this film is actually not that bad, which is why it is possible to actually get through this. This is definitely a movie they would show in the High School Health Class to convey the dangers of premarital sex. Or they could show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - rock band Brian Austin Green is really terrible. I think that's a much bigger threat to society than unmarried parents.
