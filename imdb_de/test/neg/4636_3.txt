Here is the sample number 87.358 of Hollywood's antibiblical bias, which is so typical of her. <br /> <br /> Early on, Ray Liotta's wife did it and women are interviewed for the housekeeper's position. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking man (clothing, manners, speech) who immediately sets strict rules: "Every day there are two hours of Bible study." <br /> <br /> This is To make it sound as if reading the Bible would be the worst punishment you could impose on anyone, especially a child. Again the Bible is equated with clogged, common people. This woman will of course be fired immediately. <br /> <br /> Of course, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voil√†, saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawning.
