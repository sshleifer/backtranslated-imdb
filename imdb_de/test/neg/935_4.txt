I saw this movie as a normal Hollywood movie, but then I learned that it was a movie made for a TV station. On my DVD cover of 2 critics, one of the critics commented on Moviline's Stephen Farber as one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> All the characters were simple and decent performances, except for the character Brains, who never has any leeway that the director wanted to keep secret until the end. There was tension to the end, but when you see the end of this lady The police officer and the main culprit had a lesbian affair, seems to be a totally stupid idea. God knows what happens to DAVE, the main male character. Not quite up to the hype ... what I've seen after watching the movie. For that I partly agreed ... I should have read this first, before I take the film.
