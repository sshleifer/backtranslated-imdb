This episode was just aired in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The hard act of humor was unpredictable, childish, and impaired what could have been a pretty good action. I can not believe that Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode. I have seen every previous episode of this show, and even the episode in which Jack played himself was way ahead of this episode. The lesbian kiss was a pathetic sensation. <br /> <br /> There was also no continuity from the previous episode. There was nothing in the story that examined Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. Similarly, Jack's budding relationship with Ann was not explicitly written. Usually Without A Trace is pretty good at this kind of continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode needs to be improved significantly.
