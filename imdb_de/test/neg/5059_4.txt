Mr. Moto's Gamble has a pretty straightforward conspiracy. If a boxer is murdered with a mysterious poison in the ring, it is up to the even more mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for Mr. Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I like Mr. Moto and I enjoy Charlie Chan, but I can not say that I cared for the mixed mash of the two. For those who are unfamiliar with the story of Mr. Motos Gamble, it should originally be a movie by Charlie Chan. When Warner Oland got out, some scenes and actions were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I have indicated, the final result has not challenged me. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He is more mysterious, sportier and more exotic. Trying to put Moto into a Chan movie is like trying to insert a square pin into a round hole - it does not work. And listening to Lorre / Moto trying to deliver one of Chan's signature euphemisms just sounds stupid. In addition, almost 10 minutes of the already short 72-minute runtime consist of boxing scenes (something I never seem to like) and you end up with a movie that I can not help but aloof. If I have to say something positive, I would point out the achievement of Keye Luke. But even he's not close enough to save Mr. Moto's Gamble in my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best I can give here.
