Killer Flood: The day the damned broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoilerfest. Even with the low standards of disaster movies, I apologize for being able to correct myself, even with the low standards set for TV disaster films. Where should I start? <br /> <br /> The dam modeler may have seen a photo of a dam, but I doubt it. Most dams, especially those that generate electricity, have no power station nearby, some locks through which water can run, even a high voltage wire or two. <br /> <br /> The dam is also a bit understaffed. Two, they count, two employees the whole dam, all three layers. And the employees seem to have been imported from a clich√©d World War II movie, as they preached heroically and rather unnecessarily long death scenes with photos of passing grandchildren passing by. Heck manages one of them to be shot at by the dam itself, which contradicts a description. <br /> <br /> The special effects are made up of running water superimposed on photos of the city, in a way that makes a Godzilla movie of the sixties look like the Matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue pencil on the footage would have produced better results. Since the disaster shots are worthless, what's the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the script and acting follow the special effects guide. This is not a rough diamond. That's the rough one. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is horrible enough to make some laughter and the movie itself has the serious incompetence that makes a good cult classic, but bad disaster movies must age like a good wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green, hiding in a dumpster with a golden retriever before the flood, will ever agree with the great Henry Fonda, who is crammed with raisins that are probably killer bees , Have a look at me in 2024.
