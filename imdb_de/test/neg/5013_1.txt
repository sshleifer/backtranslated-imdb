This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do, so I had it on. This must be the worst football movie ever made. This must be one of the worst movies. The premium service of the cable system has a rating system and 2 out of 4 stars have been awarded. This movie is not even a half star. Bad spectacle, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller? Sinbad could not act if he tried. Rob Schneiders One-liner stank completely. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was in the movie at all. The only salvation for this film was the hope that you would see Kathy Ireland naked in the shower, not even nearby. A complete time and movie waste. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
