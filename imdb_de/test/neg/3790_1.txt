I think I've finally seen the worst movie ever, and it hurts me to say that. As a big fan of indie cinema, gay or otherwise, I had high hopes. After a few minutes of the movie, however, the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or another century. His performance and the dialogue he was forced to take led me to the unusual step of stopping the DVD in their track. Hours later, when I had enough courage to push the play button again, it was no better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the sheriff and his racist comics, the film has an attractive cast that I feel genuinely sorry for having such a lousy script. The idea behind the film is good - the lynching of gay men in the "New South" in the same way as black men in the Old South, leaving "foreign fruits" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> We might have had a movie with an accomplished writer and director. Instead, we get fake detective work, platitudes about homosexuality and a clich√© with a good white guy trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism is still flourishing. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the backwoods of Louisana, who has forced the black children to get to the back of the bus. But this city is a cartoon, and it's hard to believe what you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are a few subplots in a feeble attempt to make the main character three-dimensional, but for the most part, they also fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For the really masochistic scene, the DVD contains some deleted scenes that you run as a cover. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first movie I think writers / directors have to pass a test and get a license before they can make a movie. I would be happy to see some of the actors in better films, but I would be hard pressed to see anything different from this director.
