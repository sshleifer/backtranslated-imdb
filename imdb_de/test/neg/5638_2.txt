Come on now. How did all these talented actors get into this mess? Was it a kind of blackmail / betting situation? Vinnie, you're a muscle man. Be that what you were born for. <br /> <br /> The hot tub scene? The Scrabble scene? I expected the sound of the "needle being pulled over the plate" to be heard at every point. <br /> <br /> And what was he going to do with the priceless Dickens manuscript? Let's see, I'm drunk in a bar, why not pull out the priceless Dickens manuscript? I'll meet some questionable thugs on the edge of the Thames. Why do not you take my precious Dickens manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. Avoid.
