There is nothing good to say about this film. Read the Revolution for Hell or any of his other writings. Abbie was often dismissed as the clown prince of the '60s, but he was a man of ideas who used his wisdom, humor and pop culture and extravagant personality to draw attention to his ideas. The media too often focus on the man, not the ideas, and that's the problem of this movie as well. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this strip is like a National Enquirer version of Abbie. He deserves better. If you do not know Abbie or his time, this movie will not help. <br /> <br /> This movie is lying. I give a zero. <br /> <br />
