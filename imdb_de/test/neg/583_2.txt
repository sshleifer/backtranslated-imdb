OUR GANG had a chance at a feature film in its 22-year history, and this was the best thing that could be done? It's boring, forced and pointless, and I have to disrespect the other poster in this movie with respect. The remake of LITTLE RASCALS was better in 1994. Almost everything is possible. The children are subordinated to the civil war processes; It does not feel like a OUR GANG movie at all, but like a humorless, second-rate Shirley Temple clone.
