Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is absolutely terrible. The dialogue is so bad that half the time it sounds like improvisation. The new storyline makes me believe that they took the book and a couple of papers with them, threw them into a blender, and used what came out for the script. It's a shame for the book and independent films. The only reason I managed to go all the way through the movie was my hope that it would get better. Unfortunately, it only got worse and reached a really delayed conclusion. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that EVERYTHING about the movie is bad. The CG is acceptable, in a kind of "reboot" of the 1990s, which I suppose was what they wanted. And I suppose you can not go wrong if people are cut in half and blood gushes everywhere.
