Allegedly the "true story" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, who also sponsored Columbus' expedition), shows the film the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, Archduke Philipp of Austria, Known as "The Handsome" (and was played in a rather uncomplicated way by the Italian Daniele Liotti, who prefers buttery and meaty here). This is a timid famous story of the late 15th, early 16th century. Intrigue, betrayal and corsage. It drips destructive pleasure from beginning to end. But while La Reine Margot manages to entertain cruel sensuality and ruthless, breakneck intrigues that stand out, Juana La Loca simply does not prevail. It just feels like a big soap opera with under-average, lazy or over-the-top acting. Liotti looks positively bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title role ?? but to be fair, can she mature into a real talent? It just seems too difficult to switch back and move all the way from two-dimensional, cool-looking to foul teenage hysterics. Some of the supporting actors are OK, except for Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pin-up, luscious and beautiful, but really not an "actress" to talk about. In fact, I could not bring myself to worry about any character, nor did I feel negative about one of the supposed villains. What a waste of a considerable film budget! Unfortunately, this film is so rhetorical and deja-vu and nods to other films of the genre rather than to its source material - the story - for inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical age has earned a far superior filmmaker to evoke it.
