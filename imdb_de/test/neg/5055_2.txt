I heard that this movie is bad. They even warned me it was awful, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still saw him when he aired on national television. Watching movies by Kevin Williamson means tormenting! His scenarios are not funny, definitely not scary and last but not least creative. Mrs. Tingle's lesson breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series "Dawson's Creek" and is probably intended for the same audience. Before the credits even started, 5 people already wanted a hug and said that they were scary 'I love you sentence'. It does not get any better, because the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop / rock and the action is ultra-thin. Three students about to graduate are cheated by the worst teacher in the school. Every high school has a teacher, you know? To save her skin, they try to persuade Mrs. Tingle that her intention was not to cheat, but this attempt is terribly wrong. The typical high school humor is completely lost to me, the overdose of emotions is pitiful and the acting (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is disgusting. I am sure that Katie Holmes can act? is this a fact that proves its role in `the poison '? but she urgently needs to stop accepting chubby girl roles. As I said, the only positive comments are the brilliant casting of Helen Mirren as a shrew. It's like Kathleen Turner in 'Serial Mom'! The role fits in perfectly with her and you can not imagine anyone else playing her. Apart from that, this is avoidable teenage nonsense.
