I am sorry that I could not be more expressive in my summary, but these two words seemed to perfectly describe the film. This is not only a bad movie, but also a bad movie with bad acting and an action that is insignificant to most viewers. <br /> <br /> Just see it for a naked Rebecca De Mornay, attached to a chain link fence and moaning with 'ecstasy'; supposedly "erotic", but actually weird. <br /> <br />
