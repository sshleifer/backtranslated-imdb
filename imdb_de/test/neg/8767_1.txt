This movie was awful. They could not fast forward enough to reach the end of this movie. It took up to the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally hit the eject button in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain movies together. At the beginning, the spectacle was terrible. I realize that the main characters came from the cast of survivors, but you would think any TV experience would have given them a bit more talent. The other major problem of the film was the camping visual effects and the poor film quality. In the film defense, the theme of the show was well-intentioned and the story was fine.
