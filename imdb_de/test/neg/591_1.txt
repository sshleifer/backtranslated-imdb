I did that and I lost two and a half hours of my life, which I can never regain. I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can not appreciate "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography and great directing. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not belong. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this movie is that it's so awfully slow that its audience is bored to death. On the other hand, dialogue sequences are too fast and there are not enough explanations to let people who did not read the book know what's going on (My mother was compassionate to me and explained everything before I saw it). Would she have been killed to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me put it together for you: (Spoiler everywhere) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes you will be treated to a black screen with no music and wait for the actual movie to begin. <br /> <br /> In the following one and a half minutes you will see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. As if the audience could not fix the scene if it had not seen the hiring shot three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are spent on the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight even more, bang things with a bone. Presumably, these are prehistoric men whose development is influenced by the singing of the monolith. Not that you could see it if you had not read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we come into space. Just to submit to the slow-moving Blue Danube Waltz for twelve minutes (a fairly nimble waltz, as I understand it, but here it feels absolutely distressing). Finally, we get a harmless dialogue and a rather cryptic explanation that the government is not letting people land on the moon. We'll be wondering for another fourteen minutes about Blue Danube and the turning of ships and neat anti-gravity camera tricks. <br /> <br /> Next comes four minutes when a ship is driven over the surface of the moon to dock at a space station. In a following boardroom scene we get a bit more exposure. Then we are outside again and drive at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed and fills our ears again with this terrible ringing (I had no idea that this was a real piece of music!). The monolith makes its little light show and then the action jumps forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes to see the ship to Jupiter. By that time, my brain had turned into mush. Could it be slower? Perhaps it is "realistic" to present it as such, but we still do not need to see five or six different shots of it to capture the concept of its "realism." Let me tell you about this "realism". I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and would like to see people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed by the sound of his damn breath! I should take care of this character, feel when he dies! Instead, I waited for blissful silence no matter how it came. Anyway, now we come to the most interesting part of the movie - the part with HAL. Forget Dave, the wooden stick protagonist. The real star of the show is the cold-impersonal, reckless, ruthless, merciless villain of a computer. He is great. And the sequence "Open the Pod book doors" is wonderful. But it is too short. And it does not take long for the director to go too long again. <br /> <br /> Four minutes until HAL dies. And he is dying. Slow, painful, with every minute of her intelligence slipping, her voice slowing and slowing down, she sings "Daisy, Daisy," all with a soft and steady hiss that gets as annoying as the heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brain melting and dripping from my ears! Nothing for seven full minutes except a guy whipping the psychedelic version of space travel with a three-time cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why pull it out so long? Unless he wanted LSD users to be psychotic and have flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain the end, mostly because I did not quite understand it myself. Presumably he's in an alien research lab, and they teach him deep and profound things as he watches as he gets older and older, and then they send him back to Earth as a kind of cosmic celestial body. None of this occurs in the movie. Everything you know is just a series of images without a purpose or a plot. A big part of the movie felt that way. <br /> <br /> When I first tried to watch this movie, I gave up half. The second time I suffered from this sore apology for a movie, I wanted to help my sister with the sequences to see how long they lasted. It is so boring. <br /> <br /> Call this crappy movie "Art" if you want. I would not have seen more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I never again submit to this kind of suffering.
