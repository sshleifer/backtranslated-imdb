You know, as you get older, you somehow think that the movies you were younger than you might have been due to your youth and inexperience. For example, when I saw The Godfather at the age of 14, I found it boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and learned to appreciate great movies. <br /> <br /> So I rented last night at my request with my girlfriend Dirty Dancing as she loved it at 14 and I hated it at the same age. But I hoped because I was young and stupid at 14, this might be a new experience for me. So I sat down to her and hoped to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after seeing Dirty Dancing, I feel an injury. I feel like someone has seized my soul and stolen two hours of my life from viewing this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick Swayze plays a 20-year-old, but he looks like he's 35. And the premise of the movie is that he seduces a minor teenager and woo her with his dance moves. Really scary. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is a clich√© conspiracy in which the type of "wrong side of the tracks" and the "rich girl" accidentally fall in love. Her romance, of course, is fueled by the fact that the "rich girl" can not dance a treat. Therefore, the "poor hero" teaches them in a week to become a trained dancer for the big end of the holiday show or the like. <br /> <br /> But you guessed it: the disapproving father enters and forbids them to see each other, and the film becomes secret meetings with dance lessons and hobby. All this culminates in the final scene, in which the entire resort gathers around the two young lovers, while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35-year-old dancer as his daughter's new husband. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend whimpered in the end when she admitted she remembered the movie. I did not squeeze it, but I smiled a bit and put the godfather Part II in the DVD player.
