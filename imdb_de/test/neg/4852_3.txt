I've always been waiting for this movie to improve, but that too is the worst escapist film: a candyfloss sweetie that sinks under the weight of its own lumbering self-importance. The pace is staggering like a legionary stranded in the Sahara. Since there is no good dialogue, the appealing stars have no choice but to look good in white linen. Irons plays another money-maker who had a touch of sunshine. Kaas is a pleasing singer, but not a great actress. Fortunately, the script does not often ask them to step away from the jazz club's microphone. All the enviably relaxed, pretty, superfluous characters alternately alternate with tired refinements. The whole exercise looks like an endlessly long Ralph Lauren ad. <br /> <br /> If you are over forty years old and you think that Francophilia is the key to sophistication, you can consider this piece of cardboard to be a baguette. If you liked this movie, you probably felt smart because you appreciated Godard's esteemed Ã‰loge de l'amour, and you may have even survived Le Divorce without frightening yourself.
