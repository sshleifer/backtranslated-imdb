The premise is interesting and the cast does the best she can, but the script and directorial work are so minor that it's not surprising that this film was buried - which is appropriate given the script. When I saw that, I could not decide what was worse, the script or the direction. The actors are exaggerated, the art direction looks like a Disney movie, the music is thoughtful and the feeling so sweet that it gives the audience cavities. It is a bad attempt to imitate Four Weddings and a Funeral. If you want to see a comedy that is as flat as a pancake, and how poorly the story can turn a story into a cavity sweetie, this is a good thing to watch.
