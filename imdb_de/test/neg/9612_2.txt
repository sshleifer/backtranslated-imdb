I will not be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey trying to cope with a new stepbrother, Derek, and his noisy, rough family as she gradually infers her princess standards br /> In Season 1 was the story actually interesting. I liked Casey because she was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was good-natured and deep. I felt bad when she was molested by her new stepbrother in her new school. She was a perfectionist but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and she's met a nice guy who's now a friend of Derek's idiots. The season captured the true excitement the title of the show sought to conquer. Now I can not say that the series really went downhill, because the story is sometimes interesting, but I'm now with Derek instead of Casey. Well, there are hardly any interactions between the two siblings. When they interact with each other, that's just short. Oh, and I do not want Dasey fans in my face. People, that is INCEST, even if they are step-siblings. My tolerance can only go so far, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek has become more sensitive as an antagonist over time, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikely than before. I like the younger kids getting more airtime, but the parents are even more baffled than before. But that's not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we have to see everything from Casey's point of view, with lame, nauseating background music. It has become thicker and flatter over time. In one episode, she started to cry and wanted her boyfriend to become more chivalrous, so she deliberately laid food on herself and accused Derek. Well, what happened to a strong, independent feminist? I did not watch much in the fourth season, but I've heard that she's dating a guy named Truman, who's an asshole and arrogant. Oh, I remember this fencing. She constantly reminds him that she does not like him, crazy, because he is "sloppy" by a sword, and finally joins him because she can "control" him. What the hell? Why should you ever go with such a guy? In the first season, Casey would have beaten him ... no matter. Or, maybe that would have been my reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. Not that that's a bad thing, but I think she fell on her head in one of her exercises. And in a prom episode, she cried because she could not find the "dress in her dreams" and was not completely satisfied until she became a prom queen. One thing I've noticed is that Casey always tries to say her life, no matter how bad Casey is her thing (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some sort of revenge, people love her all), etc.) Derek is still pretty immature, but I see that he really matured. I do not understand why many people hate Sally. She seems nice, and it's good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than "playing in the field." He also treats Edwin a bit better and is a good brother for Marti. Really, the show is so-so Now you become a "fashionable teenage queen" that you can see everywhere on TV. But it was good as long as it lasted.
