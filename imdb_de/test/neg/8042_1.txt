Schieder has a semi credible role as President of the United States, while Maria Conchita Alonzo is politically correct as Vice President. The movie just stinks. With so many storylines in play, it's a wonder they stick to the movie he was shot on. This movie is hbo schedules until late at night and is not worth watching. After 10 minutes, ask yourself why it was written. After 40 minutes, you wonder why you see it. Save yourself the trouble and watch a repeat of Hee Haw or something. Everything is better than this Klunker.
