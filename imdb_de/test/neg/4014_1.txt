I only saw the minimum wage episode, but I have no intention of seeing the others. How can that be? Morgan begins to complain theatrically about his terrible situation, which lives off the minimum wage at the beginning of the episode, and the complaint never ceases. Ever. Fortunately for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And to top it off, go to the cinema and buy bottled water for 2.50 euros and then go to a restaurant to eat all the time, while of course * drumroll * complained of being poor. <br /> <br /> I do not care if the other episodes are better or not. Nobody should be forced to look at this crap.
