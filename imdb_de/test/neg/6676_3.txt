Contrary to what a reviewer said, this is NOT a rip-off from Magnum Force. In this one Lieutenant Hal Holbrook put together his own little team of Academy Newcomers to send repeat offenders. In Extreme Justice, this operation has the sanction of the higher LAPD states. To what extent they approve of the exact methods is questionable. <br /> <br /> This Special Investigations Squad seems to be the sanctuary of the LAPD. Those who have forgotten their first duty are protection and service. That's why Scott Glenn thinks Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than enough beef on Internal Affairs for excessive use of force, is perfect for the team. <br /> <br /> What should have made him run away from Phillips is the fact that he has a nice relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. This has certainly thrown me in this movie. They would think Lou was the last man he would recruit for his team. They aim to prosecute offenders, waiting to catch them. Then it's the season. Extreme Justice went out of their way to make a point. It would not have hurt to wait for a group of bank robbers to finish the raid and bring them outside. No citizen was injured when the citizens of Coffeyville did this to the Daltons. Or wait until three rapists have finished the work before moving in. We should believe that here. <br /> <br /> And frankly, I could not buy it. Many good players are really wasted in this game.
