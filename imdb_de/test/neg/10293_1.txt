I went to the cinema to watch a preview of the movie without knowing it. When I recognized the name of Jennifer Lynch and saw the 18 certificate, I realized that it might be disturbing. In fact, I found the movie as a farce. I giggled in disbelief through parts of it. Acting is cruel - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous twitching face. I'm almost ashamed of the actors, because the script does not give them a chance for credible character interaction. After a shocking incident (there's plenty of "trying" in this movie and shocking the viewer), two characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was over the top or thought it would be wise if it was really obvious! The appearance of the little girl named Stephanie was the best thing about the movie. Silent and intense. I really can not recommend this movie to anyone. It is violent without meaning, ridiculous characters, bad drama, bad writing and simple stupid.
