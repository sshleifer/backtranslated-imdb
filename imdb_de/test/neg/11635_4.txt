1. Seen 29.07.2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): The fast-paced, frantic animation effort of the feature animation group by Ted Turner plays a lot like TV cartoons and leaves much to be desired in the sympathetic area, but definitely has characters extremely unlikely villains. I'm not even sure why the kids like this movie because there's so much evidence of old movie stars kids know little or nothing about. Mediocre efforts at best, though they rave about the box, compared to the efforts of Disney like Aladdin and Lion King. Do not be fooled - there is no comparison between history and quality.
