If you know something about evolution, you do not even have to see the movie to say "fake". "It has never been refuted" is also a weak argument. To say that the universe was created by a huge hippo can not be refuted. But to be honest, it seems like the only people who think they're the same people are opening the email attachments of people they do not know or giving their bank records to a guy in Zambia. No bone from primates was found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why reputable scientists do not study this. The same argument applies to the Loch Ness monsters, the spirits and the god.
