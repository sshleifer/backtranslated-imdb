<br /> <br /> Several years ago, I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard that it should be a great movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a B-movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. (Maybe they did not have enough money for that?). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you should watch it three times. The first, only and last time !!!
