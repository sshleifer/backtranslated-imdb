- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** - <br /> <br /> Five Fingers will not be another remake of "The Interview". Apart from the rigors of physical torture, this never adds to his predecessor's achievements in terms of suspense, conspiracy or performance. In fact, Five Fingers never gets close to his level. <br /> <br /> What I found particularly painful was not the torture, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) did his ordeal. For me, it seemed that Philippe was trying hard to get his accent right, and this made his performance an amateur that even pushed down the performance of an otherwise big Colm Meaney. The accent of Phillipe, which is far from anything Dutch, sounded more like Eastern Europeans. <br /> <br /> Besides the acting of Philippi (which, to my surprise, changed quite a bit from the end of the poor to the end), it is about looking back on the hackneyed Dutch countryside. (If these scenes were shown in Switzerland, they would have let the Cast cheese eat on mountain tops with endless pastures and grazing cows with expensive timepieces). Scenery aside: the way these flashbacks propel the storyline did not work for me at all. As a result, it was served like french fries on a drive-in and the build up of tension to a flatline. <br /> <br /> Granted, the movie became more enjoyable as Phillipe behaved better, but I could not help getting annoyed now and again with scenes that were just too implausible. For example: <br /> <br /> ************************************************* ************************************************** This is followed only by the brutal severance of another finger. Why wash the guy if he is tortured? And cutting off that last finger seemed like the title of the strip anyway, I mean, he practically begged for him to be cut off. Did not make sense? <br /> <br /> ************ Endspoiler <br /> <br /> What was staying at the end, was the performance of Fishburn, who was still at it turned out to be brilliant Actors, but also with the best part of the script. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just much better to see "The Interview" with this other matrix symbol: Hugo Weaving. And if you do, I am confident that you will not feel this post as unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
