Oddly enough, it's Fred MacMurray who plays the more "screwy" role in this screwball comedy. Carole Lombard shows an outstanding performance that combines lighter moments with drama and seriousness. <br /> <br /> As always, Fred MacMurray is a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of him, he is not so attractive, and he does not have the style and the verve to play this very Cary Grant-like role. Ralph Bellamy has been brought back to life as a friend by his relationship with Lombard's character. One wonders why her character does not want his gentle soothing love instead of the almost certain fate of MacMurray's inability. But that's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image is almost working, but misses the target, mainly due to the power of MacMurray. It would have been nice to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely believable and sympathetic. MacMurray is stiff and wants you to keep him at arm's length.
