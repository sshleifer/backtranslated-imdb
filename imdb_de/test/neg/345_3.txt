I think it's safe to say that if you really only watch standard box office movies or produce premium productions, this movie will not bother you because you'll hate it. If you're too critical a movie fan, do not worry. If you love sci-fi movies and you do not care about the capacity to take a look at the future, you will be entertained easily. It's very obvious that the budget for this was super super low, but what they did with the money is worth a blow to the back. Some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were awful, but it's obvious they had good support from a computer point of view because the planetary scenes and the alien imagery were very resourceful. The dialogue is really funny, but not very bad. As for the story, I'm not so sure what actually happened to tell you the truth.
