**** Contains Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I made sure that this show finally comes, so that I can see her. I recorded it so I could watch it several times and there is something about this show that really bothers me! <br /> <br /> I recognize that this is a TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, a channel I despise. Because it was made for television, I can ignore the huge storylines. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both very talented actors, definitely did not make the most of their abilities. I can overlook the fact that Don Diamont's character was so clich√©d that when you saw him, you knew he was the villain. I can even overcome the obvious flaw in the timeline (she's raped during her winter break, and over a year later she has the baby of it.) <br /> <br /> The most important thing I can not get past this is: There are two lawsuits against custody of the child. In the first trial, custody is awarded to the child's father because it is "better educated, has a college degree, and has a full-time job." In the second trial, the verdict is reversed, as the judge believes that there is a lack of evidence that Emma (RLC's character) is an inappropriate mother, and custody should not be taken by the main caregiver and someone without prior interaction with the police to be passed child. <br /> <br /> The problem is that nowhere in these trials is the fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and got her pregnant. Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Would not that be considered if the judge chooses him for custody because he is a "mature adult"? Mature adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> It's not the worst cable movie you'll ever see, but it's not a great show either. ** out ****
