Right ... So you have a dam, tons of water (that really seems to be flowing very slowly) and a small town just below the path of destruction. Throw a profitable glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and angry architect and his son, and then add a weak plot and bad acting. All in all, if you look at this movie from a point of view of paying customers ... I would feel extremely averse to pay-per-view movies. If you want a laugh ... then you really have to see this movie.
