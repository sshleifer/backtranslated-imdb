This must be the most horrible piece of crap that I have ever seen. By comparison, Mel Brooks films are Oscar-worthy. Jim VanBebber has to be publicly slapped if you try to give it out as ANY form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> While some say that this film is in the low-budget genre of such classics as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Night of the Living Dead", the production value is out of the question, it's VanBebber's ability The casting is regrettable, for the role of Charlie he must have selected the first actor with beard and long hair, it does not matter that this actor's hair was half on his back (Manson is never over This actor spoke in a terrible monotony, without a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies had lent to her portrayals of Manson The actor selected for "Tex" Watson had curly blond hair instead straight dark hair, a fact that everyone knows who has shown even the faintest interest in the Manson Fall, he looks like one n Minnesota farmer in Little House on the Prairie. The actress, who plays Susan Atkins, has a wider butt than Oprahs. While those familiar with the family know that "Clem" was a bit retarded, so did the actors who portrayed him. As bellicose as on a chaplinesque, it was like watching an old vaudevile act. Instead of looking Sharon Tate like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like bloated, alcoholic trailer waste. VanBebber speeds up filming in some places for artistic effects, but this technique has not come in handy since The Munsters. The credits list all known family members, but we never get acquainted with the majority of them, and those with whom we are familiar do not know who they are sometimes. <br /> <br /> Facts are also destroyed in this movie. "Lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice. Abagail Folger had no throat left. Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the Himnan murder? Patricia Krenwinkel has never had a "Dorothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most amazing aspect of this movie is what the modern freaks had to do with this movie. Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo? What was your problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they involved, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Holy Mackerel, I could go on and on, but the place prevents it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this junk as your hand is too busy scratching your head as you repeatedly say, "What the hell?"
