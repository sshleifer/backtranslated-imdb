I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before watching this movie. The first hour was OK, though I wondered why everything was focused on Chicago and why nobody had reported weather anomalies from outside the US. Individual forces of nature (of this order of magnitude) are unthinkable. But after the first 60 minutes, the film continues like an infinite story. The script is awful. As for the actors, very bad choice. Only people set to panic stick to their roles. But I have to admit that this movie has good 'special effects'. If you borrowed it on a DVD and want to watch the movie despite the reviews, you can play it at the maximum speed your player allows!
