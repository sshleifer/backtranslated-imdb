Usually I like those stupid / no brain activity movies, but that was just too stupid. There were too many clich√©s and the plot did not really make much sense. There were many loose ends and the end was extremely bad and abrupt. We did not even see if the big master plan works. We only have to see how the protagonist sobbed over his dead, the professor (who died of stupidity (see below)). One scene particularly annoyed me. Why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his tank when he wanted to manually bypass the dam? And if they only had oxygen tanks containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why did not he bring two or three? Then he would have survived ?? that was damn stupid. The movie is pretty full of such stupid things. I can not recommend it at all.
