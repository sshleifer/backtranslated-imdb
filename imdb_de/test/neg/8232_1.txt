This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther, who wears metal tooth replacement, bites people on the neck and walks around and rattles like a chicken without hitting his arms. He also believes he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> Sounds bizarre, right? Well, the more bizarre and funny the person is, the better. The more Gore, the better and so on. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the board deciding if it wants to liberate this madman from his institution. You mention that he created some dentures in prison that bite people on his neck. He also craps like a chicken and thinks he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had such a patient, I would never release him. <br /> <br /> First, Luther goes to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away. Then he sneaks into the backseat of a women's car and she drives all the way to her house. <br /> <br /> While at home, Luther ties the woman to the bed. When the daughter of the wife and her daughter's friend come home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, a policeman comes to the front door and asks for the mother. You can clearly see that the daughter is scared and crying, but the officer always asks if everything is alright. She replies that everything is alright. The officer finally gets into his car and leaves. If I saw a woman crying and looking scared all the time, at least I'd like to go indoors to do a little research. <br /> <br /> The end is stupid too. While the woman is in the barn, she begins to chuckle and excites Luther excitedly, so that he runs around and beats his arms and claps like a madman. She finally shoots him and sits there for only a minute, before finally chuckling a bit more. <br /> <br /> Then the credits will roll. <br /> <br /> This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen! NOTHING happens in the house of the woman! NOTHING! <br /> <br /> I sometimes like fighting movies, but this one really got me bored. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star of 10. Good idea, bad direction!
