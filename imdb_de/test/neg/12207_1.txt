This version of David Copperfield is terrible from beginning to end. I knew we wanted to spend a lavish evening when Attenborough and Olivier, who were pretty stupid, put it together as two bad guys. Then it went downhill. Aunt Betsy was adequate but did not have the eccentric flair she was known for. Worst of all was the manufacturer's decision for Uriah. This was the version of the music room of this character, which Roland Young has already played admirably. And what was all that selfish fear of David. Dickens must have turned in his grave to see his favorite child turn into an eyebrow crying in his beer.
