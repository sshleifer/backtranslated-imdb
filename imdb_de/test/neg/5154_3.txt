My mother took me to this movie when I was about seven years old, thirty years ago. She had no idea that a family movie would be so violent. My clearest memory was the boy's father's painful face when he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. This picture has haunted me for weeks. I had learned that I lived in a world where one person could sting my father at any time. How could I stop her? How could my father protect himself? You must realize that this sting for a seven-year-old is not a fantasy. It is as real as witnessing an actual event and has no place in the innocent mind of a child. It is sad that we still do not understand how the violence of our children affects both our children and our society. If only parents would protect their children from violent images with the same force as they protect them from images of nudity and sex.
