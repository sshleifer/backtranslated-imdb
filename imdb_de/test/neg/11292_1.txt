The only reason I did not fall asleep during the movie is that the seats were not that comfortable. Hannibal is boring> boring> boring and boring !!! This movie is just awful, not because of violence or graphic mutilations. In that sense, it's actually pretty tame. The story moves at the speed of a sluggish snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just called this one. The music score is also very annoying. This is particularly noticeable, since there is so little going on in the film. It looks good, but that's no reason to see it. By the way, I mentioned that it is boring. <br /> <br />
