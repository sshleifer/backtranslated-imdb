Historical films always require freedom - there are conversations in which no one really knew what was said, the customs are understandable to the modern public, and so on, but historical films about actual historical personalities should be at least a minimum of history. This movie is not. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises a murderer who sneaks into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, "I do not remember that I sent room service." The most important entertainment value lies in its wickedness; I recommended my local video story to put them on the shelf "Turkeys".
