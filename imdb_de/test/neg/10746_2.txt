I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to Showtime's great horror anthology series, but this was by far the worst. It is really too bad. Part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, selection of starting materials. Why Joe did not just write an original, I do not know. Instead, we get this soapbox episode, in which the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, and everything. In the end I just wondered if it could get any worse and I will not ruin it. It got worse. What a stinker from such a talented creative team. Skip this and buy the John Carpenter instead. It manages to reconcile all elements: horror, humor, character, vision and fun. Homecoming is about as funny as a bear that empties you in your sleep.
