I am sorry to say that these movies were one of the biggest disappointments of the year. After one of the biggest disappointments in the history of movie monsters, one might think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plotline was completely enforced, the dialogue was so bad that the movie might have been better at mute, and the action was invented and was far from the heart's content of any monster's original films. The best thing about AVP Requiem is indeed the trailer that, as you walk through the movie, realizes that almost every death and every really cool shot in the movie has already been shown in the trailer, which reveals little and leaves little excitement his. I gave the movie an extra star because it made the hot woman look almost naked. The movie ran like a sci-fi monster party in color and number, which also helped that nothing was surprising as it happened, because it had been seen a thousand times. The main problem with these two films is that the creators thought that posting the films in our time would be more interesting to us, as if they might one day happen to us. However, when people released the arcade game back then, it did make them feel like they were somehow in a superior futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy timeline, which allowed for a suspension of unbelief. Here, the future films must be inspired. To be honest, killing a waitress who was killed by the ALIEN we've all feared since childhood does not really matter to us. Let us bring the series back to its roots. Learn from the former masters and do not mess with a successful formula by trying to make a "bold new vision". The originals loved us for a reason, we want to see that again. The end is the actual WTF moment of the whole movie, * SPOILER * after the big climax. The survivors are ambushed by special ops soldiers who justify their terrible deeds with the note 'We obey orders' and then take a penny and start treating everyone nicely and are turned into saviors. After the long retreat with a survivor looking ominously at the sky, we cut off the most bizarre cliffhanger I've ever seen, with characters you've never seen in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) By Fineness Slapping the face, they reveal that there will be another movie with a hint of a plot line that would make the original film of a sci-fi channel blush and snub his nose. So if you have to choose between this movie and other activities on Earth, skip the movie and do the other task instead.
