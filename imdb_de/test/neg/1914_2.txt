I saw this on cable because I was a big fan of Leelee. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. They are not interested in any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who is an idiot in the movie and steals Josh Hartnett's longtime girlfriend. If the author knew what he was doing, the film would have followed the tried-and-true formula of screwing Hartnett and Leelee as a friend trapped in a bad relationship that saved her from Klein. But Hartnett is a really cool guy who shows a lot of emotion and love for Leelee. <br /> <br /> You then hate Leelee for cheating Hartnett with Klein, who is a jerk and really stubborn to anyone in the city trying to help him. <br /> <br /> It's also really belligerent, and the characters do everything but walk around in the kitchen and sync lips, use hairbrushes and spoons, and fake microphones (though they're very close). <br /> <br /> What a terrible horrible movie. They also do not care what happens in the end, because the director never lets you worry about the characters.
