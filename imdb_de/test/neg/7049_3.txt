Prior to the days of the home video, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy "Kill or Cure" - if known at all - was known only because some sequences were included in Robert Youngson's compilation film "Laurel and Hardy's Laughing." Youngson knew what he was doing: the best gimmicks in 'Kill or Cure' were kept intact in his compilation, while the rest of this slightly witty comedy stayed on Youngson's cutting room. Laurel portrays a commercial traveler who denounced a patent drug called Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: This name is the funniest joke in this movie that does not say much. I would like to point out that this film dates from 1923, the prohibition period. During Prohibition, many Americans acquired patent medicine when it had (um!) "Medical" properties. If Knox-All contains alcohol, Stan's job in this film is less desperate than the one he and Ollie made famous in Big Business and sold Christmas trees in the summer. Too bad for this movie, that it is not nearly as funny as "Big Business". <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but he does not hear him in this silent movie) having a lively sales talk with a man who seems to pay attention to it ... until we find out that they are standing in front of a deaf and dumb institution and this man is deaf. A haughty woman emerges from the gates: Stan quickly tries to grab her attention by waving his fingers at her. Of course she is not deaf and promptly hits him with her umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, NOT because it affects the deaf (the deaf are not the joke), but because it upsets the widespread misunderstanding among listeners that they can communicate with the deaf simply by randomly wiggling their fingers and playing charades without really learning the highly complex grammar of sign language. <br /> <br /> A spinner in this movie has a canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino). Allow a man to hide behind an object that is narrower than his body. I've seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies, but "Kill or Cure" is, I think, the earliest movie I've ever seen. Stan Laurel, An undervalued actor who does a bit of a physical business worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, conveying his emotions - and a change in his behavior - as he walks away from the camera. Nevertheless, Laurel never really became a first-class comedian until he teamed up with Oliver Hardy to form a great comedy team. "Kill or Cure" rated barely 3 out of 10 points.
