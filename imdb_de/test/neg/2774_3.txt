This is a cheap looking movie! A stripper is repeatedly attacked and raped by zombies, and nobody believes her. She goes to the police, who also rapes her. She eventually finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies, and they lead the zombies back to The Zombie Master. The fact that Stephanie Beaton plays the lead role as a stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
