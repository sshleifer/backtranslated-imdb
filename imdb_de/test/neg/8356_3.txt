I have a question for the authors and producers of "Prozac Nation": What is the cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and writer. But this is not a story of success, just one of self-destruction as we watch Liz bring misery to life when everyone comes in contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible causes of Liz's misfortune. But none of these superficial explanations is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the film, it might have been helpful to assume that Liz has to take responsibility for her life and problems. There was no light on what the film in "The United States of Depression" represented as an end-to-end problem. Throughout history, Liz has had a caring therapist (Anne Heche), a caring roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boyfriend (Jason Biggs), and a troubled but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In a key scene of the film, Liz lies in a hospital bed watching the resolution of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Rather than equate Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for her recovery and recovery. This movie reminded me of a generic "victim" movie movie the Lifetime Network. An excellent cast was wasted, especially on the serious performance of Christina Ricci. The real Elizabeth Wurtzel apparently found the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film did not offer us the slightest insight into their courageous mind.
