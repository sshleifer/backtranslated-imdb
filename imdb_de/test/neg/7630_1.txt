I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" in film history, but of course I was wrong. I had no disappointment that this movie would be good. Unfortunately it was worse than I expected. The worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and terrible that you can not believe it until it actually happens.
