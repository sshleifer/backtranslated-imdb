Compared to director Kevin Connor's ARABIAN ADVENTURE, this is a masterpiece. That does not say much. AT THE EARTH'S CORE is indeed a stupid fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who seems to be strong - and some other actors (whom I do not know) dig with a giant digger called "Iron Mole" to the very core of the earth - just to find out that the inside of the earth is pink and populated by monkey-like creatures that have enslaved humans. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys through telepathy, and we can see that he blinks his eyes in close-up throughout the movie. Most importantly, Cushing and what his name is, meet lovable Caroline Munro in the underground caverns. And here's what I really have against this little movie: Why, why, when Munro is in a movie, does she only get about 5 minutes of screen time? MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, GOLDEN JOURNEY OF SINBAD - IN THE SPY THAT LOVED ME - it's always in the background! How can Kevin Connor think we'd rather hear Peter Cushing's fake accent and look at a ridiculous monkey man whose voice sounds like a scratched CD, rather than staring at the beautiful Munro? I do not understand it Please, someone is leading a movie in which this English brunette is constantly on view!
