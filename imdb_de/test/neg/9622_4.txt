I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I'm an avid movie viewer and hobby filmmaker. As I talked to friends for lunch, MirrorMask might be my biggest disappointment in the movie of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film has missed its mark. Humor was tried several times during the film. It makes you laugh. Instead of making you laugh, you feel empty. The jokes reminded one of the last Star Wars movies. You were not funny if you were not five years old. And the spectacle felt similarly awful. I saw actors acting in front of a blue screen. And I believed it. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty artwork? And although the script is perfectly workable and the special effects are beautiful, it has no heart and fails miserably. I left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater. I felt whole and miserable and still did not get the sour taste out of my mouth. I love independent movie. I encourage people to watch independent films to support them. But not this movie. This movie should not have been done. At least not like that. Why did the director miss the marks so clearly? They were clearly furnished? Not just the humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were badly terminated and delivered. It was like the movie was walking on three legs instead of four legs. His steps are impractical and do not miss any time. And it could fall over with the least impact? Do not see this movie I do not care who you are. It is not worth your time.
