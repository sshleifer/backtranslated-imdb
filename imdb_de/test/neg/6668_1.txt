I felt that I had to add a comment after seeing the other comment breathless. I was seen as a child by my unknown parents to watch this movie and was expecting a normal, funny, funny comedy by Norman Wisdom. Instead, you get this bleak British sex comedy of the worst kind, in which Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger who aims to descend with as many "birds" as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and played, no pretage of a script beyond the worst kind of double insult and very vague hints of "naughtiness". And everything seems to be on this grainy special feature, reserved for British low-budget films from the 1960s to the 1970s. The only amazing thing is the annoying catchy theme that still pops up in my head after over 30 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene, Norman is naked too - looking across the sand and frozen. I think anyway - at this point my mother pulled me out of the cinema. I saw it again many years later, and you remember, it was still dark. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or have an interest in the little man and his career, you will apply that. 10-foot bargepole rule. Believe me, you do not have to see Norman Wisdom's back.
