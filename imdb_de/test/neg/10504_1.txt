This movie was pathetic. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were bad. If you have a life, you will not see this movie because you want to kill yourself. This movie totally kills Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie ... or trilogy I should say). <br /> <br /> I do not care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I've seen 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely this movie is really bad. I do not really know why my family is still watching it ... oh wait, yes I do. They laugh almost incessantly about the stupid action, dialogue and action.
