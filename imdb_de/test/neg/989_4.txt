Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I got this with a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the Galactic Railroad. I expected to discover crazy stories and abductions of an eccentric man and his inspirations for such bizarre material. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and Chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. It's certainly nothing to write home about and not nearly as good as NOTGR. Leave this hole alone. If you need to see it, rent it or find it in a convenient location. Do not pay the top dollar.
