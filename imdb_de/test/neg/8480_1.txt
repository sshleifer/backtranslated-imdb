This movie was not necessary, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, I found really entertaining, mainly because Jim Carrey began losing his touch, and Cameron Diaz was good, "Smoooooookin!" 'Nuff said. So why do a sequel / prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey would not do it should be an indication that it was not earned to be created. But then they just make mistakes after mistakes. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man allowed to breathe? The writing and the story: terrible. Why would I ever want to see a baby with a mask? Why should I want to see it fly? Je? HOW EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA ?! Acting is despicable, in fact, almost everything about this film. I try to stay calm, or IMDb will probably not let me. Conclusion: Do not watch this garbage. Get the original, see how well Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey made his career earlier, and laugh. Do not waste a second of your time on it.
