(Lightweight spoilers here) <br /> <br /> Stealing Sinatra is half a slapstick comedy about fool kidnappers, foolish victims, and a few other side stories that take some time. <br /> <br /> In this movie you will see some bad performances. The drama is forced and the humor makes no sense. Whether you watch the kidnappers threatening the victim who does not shut up, or the father of a victim who mentions the criminal's death threat with "Care for some tea?" Responds, none of it is credible. This fits comfortably in the category "MÃ¶chteabe-Film". <br /> <br /> You will also hear a repetitive stupid music track throughout the movie. It's pretty unprofessional and does not add anything. It's really just a sad attempt to make a painless, listless movie look a bit funny. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look past all this and undo a lot of doubt, you may be entertained by the movie's appropriate plot. <br /> <br /> I chose 4/10.
