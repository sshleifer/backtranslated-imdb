I did not expect a classic, but at least a funny movie. There were only a few scenes that made you laugh, but not anymore. Do not be afraid, it's full of American teen slasher stereotypes and you can guess what's going to happen easily. <br /> <br /> But it talks a lot about an older student at a Turkish high school. Pressure of Student Selection Exam (OSS) This 3-hour exam determines which university you study at, and you think about the exam when a ghost is after you and not exaggerated. The movie is bad. Do not waste your time to see it.
