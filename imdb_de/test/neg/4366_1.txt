Killjoy 2 has a fantastic song about how clowns are usually nice and funny, but Killjoy is a killer. I can not remember the song in the first movie, but when vocalist Olimpia Fernandez sings 'Killjoy, yeah Killjoy 2', it sounds like the 2 could be added for this terrible sequel. The movie is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. This time around, the cast, including the normally acclaimed Debbie Rochon, has given up trying and director Tammi Sutton creates no suspense and just presents a boring and stable movie. Full moon images produced this during their "Urban" phase, none of which was very good, but not as bad as here.
