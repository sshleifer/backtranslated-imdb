You know the old saw of a train accident? The one of them, how you can not look away? This movie is not so good. The only reason you're still there is that you brought your kids and you can not leave them alone in the theater. You could take a nap. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should never work in the movie after delivering this terrible garbage. He manages to include a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and make him a robotic, insecure actor in this production. <br /> <br /> I did not have much hope for this movie, I admit. If it was not the only family movie, I could take my son for Christmas, my wife and I would not have left. God, I wish we could go back in time and stay. I leaned over to my wife about ten minutes ago to tell her what a stinker I thought, but she hit me all the way. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding. It is lazy. Only the great work of David Cross saves this rating from a single star. <br /> <br /> The story is annoying, insulting and stupid, as one might expect for a movie in this genre (though the recent "The Curious George" was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). Acting is mostly bad. The decision to "update" the Chipmunks songs for today's audience was at best inadvisable and bad at best. It does not work. <br /> <br /> The chipmunks of yore were smart, mischievous and smart. These chipmunks are stupid, something mean, horrible and surprising, in need of uselessness. <br /> <br /> Either as a retrospective, as a tribute or as a completely new production, this movie completely fails The last straw? My son could not wait to leave. Instead, spend your money to hire Curious George.
