I found code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a film, but found that it did not work. Code 46 lacked thought and structure, and the plot did not go well. I thought that Tim Robbins character was not well developed, for example. I thought there should have been more information and thoughts in his family life, and it should not be completely ignored as I felt it. When they first violated a code, it was thought that they should not know that they were genetically linked, but all the technology was available to them. He took her fingerprint and genetic details as he examined the fraud. I've been waiting for something to happen and for the story to develop, and it never did. I felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating, but turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 was trying to be smart and in the end it lacked imagination. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
