What is the meaning of this movie? It starts out as a movie, then changes the title, cheats us a resolution for this movie, and ends up as another movie that is nothing more than a pale, pale imitation of so many other Schlock horror flicks you've ever seen , The overall impression is in every way confusion and much hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, directed by Rodriguez, two guys who have shown talent but now believe their own hype and assume that everything they do is good because they did it. But it does not work that way. You are only good while you continue to do good things. There are so many questions to ask: What are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing in such senseless filth? Clooney makes a fascinating evil in the beginning? completely ruthless and efficient? and it would have been interesting to see where that would go. Of course we never do that. And the clooney of the vampire movie changes to a completely different character. That's not smart or funny, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks uncomfortable through and through and no wonder. Did nobody in the studio look at the script before this project was approved? Tarantino is extremely unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he assume that we would find rape, cruel murder, and the slaughter of a harmless hostage amusing)? At every level? except the technical ?? This movie stinks. Avoid.
