Even to say that this movie is Sebastien's best work, just say everything you need to know about the man. Sebastien is a miserable, stupid, at best not amusing, but highly popular presenter on French television. If watching one of his shows is just torture for any normal educated person, his first movie (and let's just hope) turned out to be even worse. Sebastien's apology for the rape (the victim falls in love with her assailant) is not only out of place, but simply unacceptable. I urge you not to look at this image (or any of Sebastien's future features), you would only lose your time Sebastien !!!
