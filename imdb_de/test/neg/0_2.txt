Once again, Mr. Costner has pulled out a movie for longer than necessary. Apart from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are only a few, none of the characters interested me. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is recognized early and then forgotten much later. At that time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a cocky Ashton Kutcher. The problem is, he's a kid who thinks he's better than anyone around him and shows no signs of a crowded closet. His only obstacle seems to be Costner. Finally, when we've passed half that stinker far, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's spirits. We are told why Kutcher is the best, with no previous idea or premonition. No magic here, it was all I could do to save an hour.
