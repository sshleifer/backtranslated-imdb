I understand the purpose of the director is to tell stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to depict passing time (the few joggers who first jog together rather than jogging with a buggy (sic!), as the man alone ...) and to link the "adventures" of the characters (last scene when the girl climbs a mountain, sees the big black on another cliff and then sees the boat with her former employer and "Oh, one Boat! ") Were terrible. At the same time, I liked the way he represented the middle class, even excessively. I think it's a lousy movie. If you want to see it, do it as a film student and try to see technical issues and issues. It will help a lot.
