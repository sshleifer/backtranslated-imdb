Our story: Two US Navy deep-sea divers look for silver coins hidden under the sea off the Philippine coast. Our proof: extremely boring entertainment without a plot. Jim Brown is wasted, provided he helped produce this 70s war turkey. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor thanked us especially for their contributions! BOMB WAY !!!
