I originally wrote what was a sarcastic, devastating review of this pathetic bitch, but every time I submitted the review, I received "This word contains a very long word that is not legal", even words that were not misspelled , were classified as wrong. <br /> <br /> Now the word that was judged too long was never identified. After numerous attempts to eliminate words, I finally got the suspicion that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and automatically rejects certain words. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself. But after all the longest words had been eliminated, the same message was repeated over and over again, and even words that were not judged to be misspelled were suddenly considered wrong! <br /> <br /> The police are everywhere.
