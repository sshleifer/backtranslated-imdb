I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked funny. The idea of ​​someone making a cheesy '50s monster movie would have been worth a few laughs, but this title is just boring. First of all, there is almost no froggg in the entire movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit for more than 75 minutes of lame drama and dialogue to get some glimpses of the Froggg pulling up a naked bros. Why? In addition, the film lacks any kind of plot. I mean, give me something that's a bit more interesting than just a few talking heads. I wanted to see some hot girls looking for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cute girls being dragged out of hopeless rescue to their hiding place (Creature from the Black Lagoon), the Froggg is going on a murder rush or maybe flees from a stupid trap. Something exciting! Gosh, have fun, be creative! Who wants to move through endless and exhausting dialogue scenes in a creature movie? My advice to the filmmakers: Go on, your concepts are good, but your implementation needs to be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and the most important thing ... put more creatures in a creature movie !!!
