Martin Lawrence is not a funny man in Runteldat. He just has too much in his head and is too crazy, which disturbs his pun early in the game. He tries to make fun of critics, which amounts to it. Then he goes to pretty primitive sexual jokes about smokers with throat cancer and from there it just goes downhill. 3.10
