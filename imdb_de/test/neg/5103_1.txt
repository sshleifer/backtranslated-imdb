The film itself is just a compilation of scenes that are not inherent to anyone outside Russia. I can not deny that some of the pictures and techniques were quite revolutionary at that time (shot 1928), but the problem with the movie is that it is of no interest to the intellectual or ordinary person. We're just looking at an arranged form of images ranging from a one-armed man with a horse to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is awkward, accidental and completely unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum that interested the viewer, but it would not, although the director's method is quite ingenious to students involved in hallucinogenic drugs or a student from pre-Tarkovskian cinema.
