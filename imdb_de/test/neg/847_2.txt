I was really looking forward to this movie. After reading some reviews before the release, it sounded like a really beautiful movie, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz, and John Hurt.). <br /> <br /> It could have been all these things, BUT it's so boring that I challenge almost everyone to sit around and keep the attention. Cage's attempt to speak Italian accent is embarrassing too. He's such a good actor that I was scared every time he spoke in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Disappointing" seems to be the word most used by reviewers here to describe this film, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I think it did not take long A word to find out how bad this movie was because Cage's accent did not go well.
