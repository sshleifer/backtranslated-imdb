Watched this movie on a Saturday Mine with a friend. The theater was about 70% occupied. <br /> <br /> Although there are many funny lines, it's more of a drama / tension with humor scattered about it. Robin Williams does a decent job, as does Laura Linney. Lewis Black is a fan of the Daily Show. Christopher Walken also shows a good performance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly and stays that way for about thirty minutes. Then the suspense part starts and starts to keep you a little nervous during the rest of the movie. Tension in a supposed comedy movie? I know that like everyone else here, I had a bit of a struggle with it. A character would crack a joke during a suspense sequence, and you would only hear a laugh or two in the theater. All in all, after the movie was over, there was some applause. Some people definitely enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie four out of ten because I believe that the comedy aspect in a suspense / drama movie and the actors' performances does not work well, albeit not bad, only decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie is not what was advertised.
