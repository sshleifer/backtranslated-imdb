The great Yul Brynner, who won an Oscar and starred in blockbuster films such as The Ten Commandments, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot films like Sartana and so on. In fact, I regret. You should feel sorry that he did his best to bring out this idiotic thing. Gone were the days when Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson surrounded Eli Wallach in "The Magnificent Seven" and walked around under the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. It is sometimes difficult to live from being an actor.
