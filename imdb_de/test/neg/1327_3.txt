One would think that the authors would have a script with the incredible backdrop of World War II Stalingrad. Nope. There is NO story here! It's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by miserable, hopeless and meaningless dialogues. <br /> <br /> A bunch of Germans march around and shoot and shoot. Slowly, there are fewer Germans running around, shooting and being shot. Then there are no Germans who can march, shoot and shoot. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
