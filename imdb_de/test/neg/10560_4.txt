As a professional poker dealer, I've found this movie hard to watch for over 25 years. Too unreal It seems like the producers of this movie either did little or no research or simply did not care. The card tricks are something you would never see in a real poker game. Common sense right? It was also full of film cuts during the tricks. Who could not do that? The cheating was amateur causes. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high limit game using open deck cards? Would you sit in a game where players (constantly) shove their chips into the middle of a pot, meddle them and then just verbalize how much they bet? COME ON ! I gave him a 4, because the twists and turns might be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game, it will be quite painful. Next time they should use real players and get insight into the right course of action. OUCH!!!
