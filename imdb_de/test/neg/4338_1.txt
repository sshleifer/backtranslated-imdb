Do not pay attention to the rave reviews of this movie here. It's the worst movie of Van Damme and one of the worst I've ever seen. It would appeal to someone who has no depth and who demands nothing more than fire and explosions to be entertained. <br /> <br /> The direction of Peter Hyams made me realize that Peter is not a director, but he is very good at shooting explosions and the like. However, films also need other elements. For example, a story. This one had none. This could explain the awfulness of some of Mr. Hyams' recent films, barely better than this one, really. <br /> <br /> You do not wonder how some people ever got stuck behind a camera.
