Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's gorgeous smiles and sultry glances all over the movie, but unfortunately they are the only two things worth watching. If we were to look theoretically for the narrative, the plot is thin and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she does not add the spark she has put into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. Since Dark Angel, Alba seems to be a feast for the eyes (but a feast for the eyes!), And it's the only reason to put her in movies. <br /> <br /> The concept of the sleeping dictionary is stupid and implausible, with little character development (or character for that matter), to take the 109 minutes of running with this world. Despite the short running time of the films, it is still too long and too tedious. <br /> <br /> It seems a shame that talent like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer and Bob Hoskins are wasted with a threadbare narrative Hardly a pulse. This film seriously misses a trick, an exotic backdrop, a more than capable cast, with engaging cinematography and a chance to take advantage of the themes and dualistic concepts of 'civilization'. But there is little narrative of which one can not speak, no drama, no meaning, we look at a love story, rather a story of lust and women who gladly pleases men without question. Let's face it, if Jessica Alba allowed you to sleep freely with her, do you seriously think you could concentrate on learning a tribal language? Therein lies the great problem, both in the abolition of unbelief and in what the female characters are limited and reduced. Take, for example, the fact that Jessica Alba's character experiences the mental and physical distress of pregnancy and the birth of her forbidden love, but all we see is that in a minute she looks beautiful and curvy, then sweet and curvy, It's a sad thing to watch a movie with promises that is not close to its potential. I could write endlessly about the mistakes of the movies, but it hurts me to do that. The film looks good, the premise could have been made into a beautiful movie, but unfortunately it should not be.
