I really tried to like this movie about a doctor who has the potential to have a new life with a young woman if he can accept the death of his wife. I suppose this was a weird light romantic comedy, but the subject is a little uncomfortable for me. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, I found that the dialogue, despite its basis, was too much of a stage play. A novel and even the mediocre acting was embarrassing, especially seen by the young lead Vincent Spano. <br /> <br /> I tried to catch up with the movies of the eighties that I missed in that decade. It was my favorite that nostalgia fans from the Eighties seem to focus on the same core canon of films that usually feature the bellows actors and actresses and neglect the other films like Creator that have fallen through the cracks. But with this feature, I have to say that I can understand it. Not all of these eighties films were magical and the creator is proof of that.
