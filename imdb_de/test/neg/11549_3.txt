Granted, I agreed to it, hoping to see James Brolin with beefcakes. Unfortunately, there was only one at the beginning, and the rest of the movie was very tame and made little sense. <br /> <br /> The story is about Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose long-standing marriage is beginning to grow old. Nick, a successful businessman, focuses on the work until he neglects Julie. She tries to fill the gap by going back to school. Julie's yearning for the passion she and Nick had at the beginning of their marriage begins to form in the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for a few minutes, causing them to burn breakfast and mislaid their husband's papers. At first she fantasizes about her husband, but as the movie progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men and encounters with random strangers she encounters. This culminates in her carrying out her fantasies with devastating consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> That could have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so boring that you wonder why it bothered at all. Characters are not developed. Motives are not explained. Background information is not given. It is not explored how Julie got to the point where she could not control herself, and there is no explanation for how she will do it in the future. The end product is a jumbled mess that's as confusing as Julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The acting is a mixed bag. Donna Mills as Julie gets on well with the material she's received, though her constant self-pity gets sharper after a while. James Brolin pretends to read his lines of cue cards, and even his anger at his wife's unfaithfulness is hard to come by; he shows so little passion for the subject. The supporting roles are largely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Disappointing treatment of a potentially interesting story. More is a pity, because it does not even offer the eye candy that it has promised.
