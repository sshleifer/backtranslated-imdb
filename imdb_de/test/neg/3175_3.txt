For me, this is not a good TV show, neither animated nor different. However, it is annoying to some extent. There are several reasons for this, in no particular order. First the intro of one of the most pointless, and annoying characters, Batmite. This character has no sense of the show, maybe as a funny relief, but it does not work out that way. Farther up, Joker thought. It would be really ridiculous to have his character let go with this ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence. Talk about repetitive. This gets old very fast ... I do not think the actor had the right actor to express the character, in the end they made Robin look like a complete dork. Apart from these problems, the show is not that bad. But these problems are big enough to drastically lower the sympathy factor, a 3/10.
