Terrible, a waste of time. There is no inventory or waste value in this. See better amateur films made in film clubs by 10 to 12-year-old kids. <br /> <br /> How do you spoil movies about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to put some vampire / sadomasochism fans together in one room and just turn it around. <br /> <br /> Could not find anything good about the movie. There was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. A few overweight Goths who touch each other can not be called a sex scene. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Well, graveyard was nice, but you should shoot a vampire movie during the dark. <br /> <br /> Purpose was probably good: make a trash movie in the spirit of Ed Wood. The problem is that you can not make a bad movie on purpose. It takes talent and effort to make a "real" movie. Maybe Ed Wood had money, but he had trouble. These guys were missing everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
