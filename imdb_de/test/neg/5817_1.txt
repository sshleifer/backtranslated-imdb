I'm a big lover of really bad B movies. And I especially love alien / scifi movies. I say, the cheaper, the more cheesy and the better. A low budget and a funny idea make most of the bad B movies fun, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the casual ad lib actors. First, there is no real action, it's all a kind of "comedy" (if you can call it that). The "comedy" in this movie is more about characters who essentially say, "Look at me, I'm in this crazy situation, is not that funny?", But it's just pathetic because there's nothing anyone does that's funny. There are no comedy skills and no daring plot to carry all the unimaginable scenarios through this crappy crap. <br /> <br /> The bad comedy and the lack of something comic is made worse only by the bad ad-lib actors, actors always say stupid things (maybe they are looking for keywords, maybe all are so bad ), really unattractive women who are played as hot women, and people who meddle in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> There was a middle-aged actor at the end of the film who I knew had some acting skills and was somehow convincing in his role. He was as inappropriate as a solid BM in a weekend-detox bathroom. Corey Feldman was filmed for a total of about 3 minutes (luckily we did not have to accept him any longer), and he was filmed on location - probably outside his apartment on the way somewhere. He said some really unfunny things about aliens and sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain remembering) you will lose if you look at this garbage, avoid it. If you take a lot of drugs, such as Adam Sandler's comedy (and have no standards whatsoever), and are considered mentally slow, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think the people who raved about it have to work for Troma or something. I can not believe that people can be so lame that they really enjoy this movie. (Do drugs really spoil your judgment so much?)
