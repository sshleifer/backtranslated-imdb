After the Hooo Hoo Indian head son number one, the frontier worker Bruce Bennett (as Daniel Boone) initially seems to be as if he wanted to be quiet. but he really wants to make friends with the natives. When the sad Indian chief Lon Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) loses his first son, it becomes more difficult to dispel misunderstandings. Apparently, this was Republic Pictures' attempt to do "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" what Disney Studio had done with "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Border" (1955). <br /> <br /> The "Dan'l Boone", a song that was whistled and sung in a car by a group of kids, did not follow Fess Parker's "Davy Crockett" on the hit parade. Singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) does not play the title song (maybe wise). He sings "Long Green Valley" and makes a good impression as a blond friend of Boone's daughter. But the Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the most valuable player of the film. In a cute scene, Mr. Fernandez reminds Mr. Young of the name of the character ("Susannah") he is supposed to be in love with. <br /> <br /> Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10/5/56) Ismael Rodr√≠guez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Faron Young, Freddy Fernandez
