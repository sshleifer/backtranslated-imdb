Okay, of course, I'm a fan of the low-budget horror that comes along with the occasional garbage that even the die-hard fan of Campy-Flicks can not bear to witness ... TRANCERS 6 by director DEMONICUS's Jay Woelfel. <br /> <br /> First of all, the TRANCERS series that Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures launched in the mid-80s is basically the franchise that Tim Thomerson and his outstanding portrayal are due to Trancer Hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and behold, due to the sinking budget of the Full Moon features (which, despite people's statements, actually brought very high quality features like HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson did not return for the sixth time. <br /> <br /> The fullmoon writer Courtney Joyner returns and provides another below-average screenplay, the Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks that are extremely badly inserted) has a different hairstyle than ever, when he is shown, and something "shemp" lying on a table) that goes down the line in his daughter's body. Well, from now on you have "Jo Deth" like Jack ... but it's a shame they really do not have the same screen presence as Jack Deth. <br /> <br /> The movie, shot on 16mm, is simply an embarrassment to the name TRANCERS ... there is no insult to Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you, that you really want to jump from timing and make a TRANCERS movie, but with a bit more time (though filmed since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br However, check out the Full Moon DVD, which is a double feature on the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last 10 Plus Full Moon features. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would probably have liked it If you did not have the name TRANCERS, you can learn more about it, but like everything else, you can judge it by another person's opinion and have to find out for yourself!
