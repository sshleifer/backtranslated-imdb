It's so bad that I can not tear myself away. I keep asking myself, "Why?" "Why?" With every scene. <br /> <br /> There's no continuity, but if you want to make a very open-minded gay movie with a fetishistic attitude to Big Boy, Big Boys, Big Boys, Big Flows, then you do not have to worry about things take care of action or character. I am amazed and very worried that the CAG looks very much like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to equate a Pryor look in such a horrible movie. But I can not tear myself away. This movie is the first movie I ever reviewed. So it's phenomenally bad and bizarre. It motivated me to join this site. I counted 50 main characters. If I were stoned, I could follow that, but as I am, I feel like I am in an infinite dream, in which it is always 1988, and we were the biggest cock in the world.
