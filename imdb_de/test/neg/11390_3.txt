A clever, crossdresser little boy succeeds in spite of an unconventional and dysfunctional education on the Spelling Bee Circle. Shirley MacLaine has directed and played the role of the child's grandmother, and it's always fascinating that longtime actors have the opportunity to make a film, the material they're drawn to, and the actors they work with , The only person occupied in "Bruno" is MacLaine. The child actors seem to have been chosen for their sparkle and cuteness, and MacLaine, who is soft-hearted, keeps her close-ups intolerable for long periods of time. Nothing about these cherubs seems to be natural, not the lines that fall out of their mouth unconsciously or the interaction they have with adults or even with each other. As the boy's angry father, poor Gary Sinise hovers in apparent shame around the edges, always with a tormented expression. Towards the end of the film, MacLaine transforms the whole thing into a passion play with embracing scenes and even concludes that the boy is hugging the pope in Rome! Another ungodly treatise by a talented actress who became a director who, just like Sally Field and her movie "Beautiful," can not stop blinking and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for childhood shtick and innocence as a punchline. The kids in this cast roll their eyes, crack open comments and use big words - but when a grumpy kid calls our little hero "gay," MacLaine's grandma challenges him to beat the boy (in front of the media!). How is that for progress? * from ****
