It was stupid. Similar to an Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were a few funny parts, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> I liked some actors. <br /> <br /> There were some Sat night Live the people in the movie. But I would not recommend it, unless there is nothing better. And it was still better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
