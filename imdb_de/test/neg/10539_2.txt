As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who are not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music that emphasizes rap, and of course, a hot-looking, crazy chick in leather without hips, and we stop us from getting half the money to earn . Why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films? The FBI picks up two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the first inmate of the prison has unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> First-class acting, especially in every scene where the good guys are in for a tragedy. But seriously, the director has tried and has given the film a modern, hard edge as best he could. Since he went to the well too often, HALF PAST DEAD gets bored too fast. What else can you do if the inmates just hang around and the hostages keep asking what motivates the main damage? A thoughtless action movie that means little, if not "a-ight".
