This film is about the painful journey of a young man to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and unpretentious. It does not rely on hot sex scenes to attract viewers. The plot sometimes seems incoherent and disconnected, and some events are not properly explained. But I can understand it, because this film is a collection of memories that are very personal to the director. The subplot about his sister and mother probably does not have to exist in the movie, but I can safely imagine that these are very important events in his life. <br /> <br /> The film's low budget is clearly visible. It is a pity that the sound effects are bad. The narrative and some dialogues (especially the scene in class with the French teacher) have so much echo that it is difficult to understand what has been said. The ambient noise, notable traffic noise, is also recorded throughout the movie. When one scene changes to another, the traffic noise changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not entertaining, but it certainly is an enlightening diary of a young man's journey to embrace his sexuality.
