The worst movie I have ever seen. I still do not understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen are up to. Maybe they had bills to pay ... The best and most cultured part happens during a flashback that takes us during World War II, when a Nazi officer hid his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of a typical serial killing life! It seems to be directed at the beginning of the 80s, but then appears as New Beattle ... Amazing! This film was staged in 2001 ... I'm pretty sure it took less than two weeks. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife had applied for divorce after seeing the picture and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to being the man under the yellow baseball cap. Pathetic!
