A woman in love with her husband (he is suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She was in a fertility clinic - like the lover she takes - and both know how artificial insemination works. Instead of using the method used every year by thousands of people around the world (the 5 euro turkey bastard), they engage in coitus. We also have to believe that while the immigrant is in love with his fianc√©, he does not suggest the obvious alternative to sexual intercourse. Although this is a business arrangement, the first time she pulls out all her clothes with her sperm donor as if it were a seduction. Besides, her husband does not notice when $ 30,000 disappears from her bank accounts. Does this all seem to demand more willing suspension of unbelief than most Hollywoods? Far brought in all points.
