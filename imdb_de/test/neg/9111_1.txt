***** At the end of the film, I reveal two "twists". Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason. ***** <br /> <br /> Oh my god, that's bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest actors of the present, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realized that someone so pathetic in the end like Steve Guttenberg would never try to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean in his life. Instead, he is killed in a way that ended up looking like a wonderful turn of the good guy who was supposed to be killed by Bean, but was actually his boss and faked his own death. Do not worry. I did not ruin anything for you. The acting itself is spectacular, with Guttenberg's patented Hey-can-do-on-Chuck-Norris-face star star dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth. In addition to an action that I could have written while being tortured and hung upside down, with both hands cut off, there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that the virus flees in a moment when it just looks wrong , At another moment, Steve Guttenberg bravely runs around with him, throws, crashes and abuses this "virus" that has the unmistakable look of a collection of those little soaps you put in your bath. My last word? If you're suicidal and feel like you're laughing maniacally about something that should be a bad comedy, it's no worse, next record it on channel 5 at midnight and burn it if you find that I actually tell the truth.
