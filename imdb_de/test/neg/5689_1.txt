OK, please believe me when I say that this is a horrible scary science fiction movie. This is so bad that much of the film turns out to be unintentional surrealism and is absolutely 100% a waste of time. Terrible, but somehow deeply inglorious. I saw this as a double film with "Recon 2020: The Massacre of Caprini" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior movie, that does not say much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so complicated that it is impossible to follow. The narrative is cryptic, often nonsensical, seemingly endless and exhausting. Half of the movie is literally double scenes of the female lead, which looks like Brian Bosworth walking through the desert. The movie actually starts pretty cool, but then it crashes in Pooptown and worsens by the minute. Absolutely terrible and really an absurdistic endurance test.
