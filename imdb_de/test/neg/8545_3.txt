The city of men is terribly disappointed after being carried away by the city of GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline. Instead, predictability is straightforward with the obvious attempts of manipulating the audience by a shallow, overbearing production and sales team. This story felt like a juicy soap opera, not a dark indie function as it should have been. This happens when traders try to find a wider audience at the expense of a gripping story and characters (ridiculous shots of the Rio coast, etc.). I really do not care what happened to the characters in this movie - they were all so two-dimensional. In short, sad waste of potential that should have been a hit after the exceptionally inspired CITY OF GOD. Boo!
