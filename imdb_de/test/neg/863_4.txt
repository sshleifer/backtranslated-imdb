I saw this movie on Late Night TV. I saw the opening credits and thought that looks good. I was very wrong. Although it was not unbearably bad (there were some funny and tender moments), there was no sense of cohesion. <br /> <br /> It started well enough with Kathy Bates's character, who had some sort of mid-life crisis when her husband leaves her her singing idol is being murdered. But Kathy has been playing these dissatisfied women for so long - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, it was the unsuspecting script that was going everywhere. It was as if the writers had thought of what we would do next. The script also felt very good. <br /> <br /> Some others who posted comments on this movie wondered why it did not get a movie release. I think the main reason was to avoid embarrassment and the critics had killed it. <br /> <br /> After I said it all, I thought that the little girl Maudie was playing was fantastic and had stolen the film, not to mention how beautiful she is.
