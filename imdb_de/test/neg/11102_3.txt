My blurry childhood memories have echoed the cult series of Belphégor in the French 60s ... so I really wanted to see the big screen adaptation. I should have kept my money and taken a walk in the Louvre. The idea of ​​the scenario is still very fitting and interesting (the Fantom of Le Louvre), but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues are always hesitating between French irony and serious "American business" without achieving either, without sounding the same. <br/> <br/> Acting leaves something to be desired and special effects are poor compared to what you might expect (low budget)?). <br /> <br /> What's left of all this? Not much outside some good shots of Paris ... which is rarely a disappointment. Belphégor was worth more than that. <br /> <br />
