As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades, I was thrilled when I had the opportunity to see his latest movie on the big screen with the man himself. Unfortunately, "Man with the Screaming Brain" itself was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Set in Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday Night original films - "Man with the Screaming Brain" is a curious mix of B-50s horror, body-conscious comedy, violent revenge and exaggerated slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does not make sense, well, it does not "Man with the Screaming Brain." Campbell is a CEO of a pharmaceutical company that visits Bulgaria with his strange wife to inexplicably invest in the semi-finished subway system of the former communist country. The two meet with a former KGB agent who became a taxi driver, and all three eventually find their deaths from a vengeful gypsy woman. A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his stupid assistant (Ted Raimi) who have developed a technique to enable non-rejection tissue transplants, steal bodies, and place part of the taxi driver's brain in Campbell's damaged skull. They also place his wife's brain in a robot body that they happen to have on hand. Campbell flees, and with a hastily reshaped skull and the taxi driver's voice - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - echoes in his head, sets out to find and kill the gypsy. (His robotic wife does the same.) <br /> <br /> But first, Steve Martin tries to imitate Lily Tomlin's "All of Me" as Campbell's two personalities fight for supremacy over dinner in the restaurant. Just as he played his own evil hand in "Evil Dead II", Campbell is adept at making his body inhabited by more than one ghost. <br /> <br /> Sometimes "Screaming" comes next Another Steve Martin movie "The Man with Two Brains", which also portrays a stupid approach to the science fiction clich√©s of the 50s. However, it is too hard for a too small result, and Ted Raimi's half-comprehensible Bulgarian fool, who has too much time on the screen, gets it twice. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) <br /> <br /> In the end, it's neither unheard of (or funny) enough to satisfy it as a parody, nor is it serious enough to enjoy B-film pastes. I was glad that Campbell had already finished the screening when I was afraid to say, "Oh, Bruce, that was really ... something." <br /> <br /> Maybe the best praise I can give as a film is that at least the pictures stick to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
