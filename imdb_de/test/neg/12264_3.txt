This movie follows a very similar storyboard like The Warriors, but with less intensity and rather bad acting, which is nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> The story is generally not that bad and is based on a small Australian gang trying to leave the city if one of their members is framed for raping another gang's girl. They then have to fight their way through the streets while being pursued by several rival gangs. One might assume that the authors have taken out and rewrote a page from The Warriors, but as mentioned above - with not nearly as much intensity. <br /> <br /> Acting as a whole is not very good In my opinion, and it is obvious that in many cases they actually act. However, the fight scenes make up for it, but the bad sound effects that accompany them bring them to a standstill. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing on Once Were Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good story, bad acting, nothing to write home about.
