"Kicked in the Head" is all about the Corrigan character, a twenty-man looking for himself, and his involvement with a handful of bizarre characters. This thin and ambiguous story written by Corrigan has a make-it-as-you-go feel and a script that smells like an uninspired, low-budget indie. Nevertheless, and some annoying scenes from the Hindenburg scene, the film has an unconventional, quirky charm that can appeal to people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but for some, maybe fun. (D +)
