First, what's really great about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors I really like, and right now he is one of them. He has an amazing ability to personify characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Very good music at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a Nine in its own world, unable to walk. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I only score 3 out of 10 for certain mistakes: <br /> <br /> - Terrible second part. It seems that the director was very interested in creating something new, but despite the effort, it was really boring. <br /> <br /> - Very annoying character Melissa. I could not stand the scenes with her - d. H. It was always annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with the American woman. <br /> <br /> - Terrible explanation of the numbers. The director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story. Excuse me, Koalas? brr ... terrible! <br /> <br /> This film had great potential. The shooting is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> See it only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds or have plenty of time.
