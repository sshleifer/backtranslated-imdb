This film contained all the ingredients for a good adventure movie, but showed incompetence on almost every level. <br /> <br /> The presence of Roger Moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be more than mediocre, because Moore always has lead roles and he can not act. But in this movie Ian Holm and Lee Marvin were also there, and he was based on a Wilbur Smith book, so I thought I would give him a chance if I saw the DVD for sale in the bargain market ... <br / > <br /> It was a mistake. The opening scene seemed to begin in the middle of a roll, and the sound suddenly seemed as if the first second of the soundtrack had been cut off. The scene featured a dreadnought with a German crew at sea. This bad editing was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me watching. The special effects were good, and the crew wore the right uniforms and spoke in German, suggesting that the director had at least paid attention to historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I kept watching, then Moore appeared and my opinion was confirmed. Bad drama, clich√©d lines, stereotyped cinematography and cheap humor ... but worst of all is the attempt to combine the carefree feeling of the film with serious drama and tragedy. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The movie ends so suddenly and as badly as it started. in the middle of a roll.
