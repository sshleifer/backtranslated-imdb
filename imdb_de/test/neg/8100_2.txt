Bela Lugosi is a real puzzle. In the early 1930s he was at the top of the world after performing in Dracula. Nevertheless, he repeatedly made bad decisions regarding his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his drinking had a role or he was just crazy. Still, he ruined his reputation by appearing in just about every movie - from excellent horror movies (like THE RAVEN) to big-budget movies (like NINOTCHKA) to grade Z movies for the cheapest and humblest studios. Interestingly enough, although he had agreed to shoot this horrible film, he refused the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN. As for the film, it is a very stupid propaganda film from the Second World War, which contained a stupid plot and a miserable cut. Lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs - not bad at all. But in the end, we find out that he's an NS plastic surgeon himself, and all the Americans he killed were actually Japanese. The funniest part of it is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before turning them into American men. If the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But in all other close-ups they all look very western - many with bald heads !! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suppose the plot has to be rewritten, and that could explain the obvious mistake. Or it could be only low production values ​​and edits. In fact, at the beginning of the film they show a street scene in the city, and all cars (around 1942) are old model T Ford's - obviously out of stock !!! The bottom line is the movie is bad, but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, it's hard to laugh at the inability to laugh. Just let it fall asleep.
