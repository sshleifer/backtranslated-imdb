What a horrible movie! It perfectly represents the state of degeneration of French society, in which the most elemental respect for healthy values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The plot is nonsense, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely flat and uninteresting. The direction and the cinematography are to say the least bad and little inspired. Catherine Deneuve is as bad an actress as she has always been, even though she was led by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the normally good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems to be completely submerged in a sea of ​​vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. I can not help but draw a parallel to James Iyvy's "Le Divorce," with its thoughtful depiction of French and American customs, its outstanding cinematography, and its stellar stellar art. After seeing "Le Divorce," you can feel a sense of empathy with the French, regardless of their weaknesses. "Belle-Maman" leaves only a disgusting contempt for his morally bankrupt and unsuspecting protagonists.
