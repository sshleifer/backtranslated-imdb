I wrote this as a two-part review. Part two has spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, this is not about sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L. A. You know, the one where everyone is a racist, and race is always the topic in everyone's mind. Run. <br /> <br /> It's as if the movie has a form of turret syndrome where running is the constant theme. Run. Racist. Racism. Race relations. Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis filmed a film that incorporated the structure of Magnolia to show the separation of individuals tangentially connected, and then screwed racism into America in a 1'53 "mental vomit. RACE: In the 24 hours, we have 7 stories that are all connected and running, and in the first hour people say ridiculous things and do absurd things to really be about racism in America. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate is the comic relief. Too bad that the first half of their story comes directly from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction.RACISM Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section, in which Rather Be Cool The characters of race and racism are talking about being able to talk about foot massages and religion. <br /> <br /> The other good thing is the Mexican history when the Mexicans talk with their daughter He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from him bullets. Decent writing, but that's just because the writers had daughters and know what they would say in their place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. The Hindi does not seem like a realism. The scene in which he tries to fix the lock and the Mexican tells him that he needs a new door is short and stupid. Why should someone behave like that? Is this realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk of The Doom Generation. "Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly." If I ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot down and his disembodied head starts to cough. <br /> <br /> I did not mention that I ran over a paragraph. RUN. RACISM. Race for the sun. Better. Then there's the black man who wants to get white, Matt Dillon, who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe, who looks pretty and does nothing, and several other bad actors who badly deal with bad dialogues. If Matt Dillon bothers the black producer's wife, can I help if I pull myself together? Can Philippe help me the second time he estimates how he wrote down his partner for racism? The movie is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST I'll tell you. Well, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Cut, aside from an allusion to Matt Dillon, who has actually been trying to be decent job , Who was paid, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Do not see it if you do not feel preached about racism in society through a bad and unrealistic screenplay by two white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with you have real society, in any form or form. <br /> <br /> D- <br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes all the storylines in the first half ... and spits them out in some sort redeeming, final style. The world is a kind of accidental coincidence. And it's actually one of the worst ways to do that. <br /> <br /> Take the Magnolia from 1999. People have not been connected to each other over and over again. They were only connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who has done something that you knew someone else was involved with. Crash brings this packaging to a serious extreme. <br /> <br /> The stories are lined up so everyone meets again. Are there only 5 LAPD troops? Do not these people work weird? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift and an early shift the next day? And why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Would not it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been someone we had not followed all day? Like Phillippe, he just picks up a random hitchhiker and freaks out. Everyone would freak out. <br /> <br /> In the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It left me and made me dirty. Not that the Hindi had shot the daughter, but that they had created a beautiful touching scene and then it would have been the direct cause of the tearing of the people. It really blew me away. The authors, not the scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and absolutely not announced. The coincidences are far too numerous and require an extreme suspension of unbelief. Unlike Magnolia, which had a mild connection, it had compounds on compounds that were so exaggerated. The only good thing about the second half was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. She does not die. She should ... have. I cheered when she fell. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is that it pulls a Magnolia. Not only in structure, but it has a montage above the song In the Deep, where everyone is depressed. Magnolia picked this up and commented it postmodern, singing all the characters to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. It's hard to comment on a movie that's not going to be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. <br /> <br /> A lot of wasted time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Total: F ---
