Hello, today I watched this movie because of the average (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it was worth a look. Also the comments here were pretty good, but after watching this movie, I quickly realize that this movie is not close to 5.6 anyway! It's just boring. You can describe the film in a few words, it's just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I do not know why people still like these movies or why they choose such movies better than a 1-3 in IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> Many people who arrive from or drive / drive from somewhere. They somehow meet strangers on their journey, but maybe they are just nice, so hang out with them. Then, a very important scene for any horror movie "Oh, my phone is not working Oh, mine too ... is weird, but we do not need it, so enjoy our ride ..." uhhhhh, our stranger is a strange psychopath better, we all sit back and scream for a while, until he starts cutting parts of us or killing some of us. After a while, the pile of victims gets a weapon or a chance to escape the helm. They never even think about running away or even killing the psychopath if they had the chance to just talk about what to do until the psychopath gets his gun back with a handful of the standard tricks they've had in these films and all run back as usual ... screaming ... killing more ... oh, and in the end it gets really exciting, sometimes the villain wins, sometimes some of the victims can escape the wow's awesome movies. OK, if I'd never seen a movie of this kind, I'd say it's a movie to watch, but if anyone has ever seen a movie of this kind, it should be boring It's a waste of time, because almost everything is in the movie. You know it before you even see it, because every time it's like the normal horror movie shematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there? Horror Movie Maker 2.0? You can just pull some adjustment buttons and get the new movie Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers.
