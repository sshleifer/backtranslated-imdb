This movie really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show you is just one side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and psychological abuse of Indian children that this movie does not show. <br /> <br /> "Indian Parents" owe the following: a. Destruction of the individuality of the children by becoming dependent on their parents very early on. Such children grow up only when they look physically but stay children. With everything provided to you by their great Indian parents, your children do not automatically feel the need to work or learn the basics of human communication with others except their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Indian parents trying to prevent their children from making friends, going out or preventing them from doing anything that makes them develop into adults. <br /> <br /> The reason they do that is the same selfishness. Indian parents "expect" that their children take care of them when they get old. You save no savings and once you reach the age of 50 ... They scream LAUD ... We are old now and that is why we have relied on your children since we have done the GREAT SERVICE to bring you to this world and take care of yourself and make you intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents, aged 50, have lost body and health and are financially unsure. Most feel that they NEVER have to take care of themselves, as they "expect" their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> In the West, the opposite happens. People start planning their retirement at the age of 20, and when they retire, they are financially secure. Indian parents make NOTHING because they have, as I said, brought the children into the world and what better investment is that in the world? <br /> <br /> I am a victim of my Indian parents (I am sure there are innumerable other Indian children like me) who have grown up physically but still struggle with their own life at THEIR OWN and they still have annoying 50-year-olds who scream loudly for HELP all the time. <br /> <br /> This film shows only one side of the story ... UTTER piece JUNK
