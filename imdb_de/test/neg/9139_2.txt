After enjoying Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and see which direction he had gone. Seldom has a movie met its predecessors so spectacularly and lost its way. Although it seeks to portray "civilized warfare" in the form of sport, science, commerce, and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the cohesive themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but wars have one goal in mind, and this film had little structure and unclear goals. Naqoyqatsi is flawed because he is a chaotic mix of images that do little to develop his theme. On the positive side, it has wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of the wars of the last century. Naqoyqatsi is also so lonely that I had to remind myself several times that I did not see any advertising for the American lifestyle. Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "war on terror". In the presentation of "Sport as a War", the prominent team logos ensured that the USA were presented as the winner. Therefore, it missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports around the world and show that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilized warfare. Apart from the newsreel, the footage seemed to have been shot on the borders of New York on a budget, and in the rest of the world, "life as a war" was barely recognized. The Gallery of Faces (wax figures) was just an indication of the existence of important people outside the United States. The makers missed the point that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> The Philip Glass soundtrack sounded much like any other Philip Glass score I've heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and at best can be described as an "inoffensive" neither adding nor chaotic images distracted.
