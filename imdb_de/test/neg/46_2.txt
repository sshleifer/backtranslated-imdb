Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in a "screaming teenage" cliché horror with a rather peculiar tempo. In a sense, Acolytes is very successful, but in many ways the film fails miserably. Overall, Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of the youth of endless horror movies like Cabin Fever. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and countless other movies in which unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex, running around, screaming and being plucked one by one from some kind of monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced by pride, retribution, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from imminent death and despair, but failed due to their own demons. In the end, you felt that there were no (and maybe none) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, the film also affects the observance of a leader or authority. This was used in the direct sense, if the main character would become like the serial killer, and was also used less directly throughout the movie. A central figure is followed by a recurring theme throughout the film. Through all this, the filmmakers have also built a lot of cliché, which in my opinion was intended and also gave the film a unique blend of depth as a superficiality that I found fascinating. This may inadvertently work well with the characters, who are at first glance very shallow, but as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that they are quite complex, at least the two male protagonists. Technically, the film has many problems. The cinematography, which is usually highly regarded, I find rather sophomoric and überstylisiert and use too rigid 2/3 approaches. Many transitions I felt were also overstylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also overstretched. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and relying solely on misinformation to achieve a rather curious ending that was poorly resolved and left viewers confused. Methods to reach their climax are cheap and poorly prepared, the motivations are unclear, and the main issues remain unbound in the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a labyrinth of inferior technical execution, overstylized imagery, unclear motifs, dull and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists and turns that are only missing or complete false information is maintained. If the movie performed better, the case would have been excellent. Acolyte, however, in my opinion receives only two stars.
