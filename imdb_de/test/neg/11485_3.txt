"The Shining" has wit, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. Ausentes, however, has none of these things; though it borrows from its classic predecessor; That is, a man is hacking through a door and a woman is running around shrieking while holding a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, "Ausentes" is a work that resonates with a unique lack of genius. It's great, weird, terrible; The Spice Girls movie looks like a work of art of crucial importance. "Ausentes" is the story of a family moving into a residential complex in the suburbs. Everything is fine with the world. You will live in peace and quiet. You will quietly move away from the old streets of the old city. But no. Ariadna Gill's figure Julia begins to feel frightened by the things that insist on poking through empty supermarkets and closing doors at night; and her husband Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, changes in a moment from a relaxed family man to an unshaven, unshaven madman who injects Julia with a drug to keep her under his abrupt circumstances. Molla, respected as an actress, is absolutely terrible. Funny and not threatening, he just can not put off a threatening expression. He just came out as a bar-dunking ball who drank too much. Is there something that can redeem this movie? No. The script is cluttered, the plot does not exist and the cast has no value. Totally without tension and full of moments of fear, "Ausentes" is an exercise that does not make you a psychological thriller. It is ridiculous and exaggerated, but it is worth a watch as one of the most funniest films of recent years.
