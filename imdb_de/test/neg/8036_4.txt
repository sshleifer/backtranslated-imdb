This late effort by Freda is a modern gothic thriller (70s), which, however, offers little thrill. Surely it's not a horribly bad movie, it just has the feeling that many of Freda's later films are of someone who gave up when he saw the first newspaper. It starts off well, almost giallo as if in sound, then it goes into a gothic territory with a decent (if awful clich√©d) playground. Then Freda suddenly seems to have lost interest in the movie and we only get longer shots of Camille Keaton and burning candles. About an hour into the movie, we get a violent climax with decent special effects. It follows a slow outro with a very obvious twist ending (if it should be a twist at all?). And throw a few half-hearted explanatory scenes along and you have a tragic ceremony. So it has some of its qualities. But then suddenly it stumbles and crashes in front of you. Too bad. <br /> <br /> By the way, stay away from the SHAROMA DVD, a useless opaque Pan & Scan edition that kills what could be a good visual experience.
