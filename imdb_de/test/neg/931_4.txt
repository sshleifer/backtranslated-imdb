First there was Tsui Harks To Warriors (2001), who is visually groundbreaking, but lacking in the acting and writing departments, now this movie is visually almost as good as To (though no longer groundbreaking), but is even worse in the acting and writing department. It is really sad that there seems to be a lack of acting and writing talent in the HK film industry. I think you have to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues in the film really are. It's like a couple of delinquent kids talking in the street, it's so bad. To make matters worse, actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent children and can not act even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this movie is meant to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HK, but are HD kids really so brain-dead that they can understand nothing but adolescent and vulgar acting / writing? If this is the case, I am ashamed to come out of HK. <br /> <br /> I wish HK makers would learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee and finally make a film that is both visually stunning and competent and mature in the acting and writing department. And stop using young singers / idols / heartbreakers as an actor as they can not perform like many other fans in HK!
