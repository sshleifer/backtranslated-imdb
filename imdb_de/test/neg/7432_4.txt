Mainly a biography of the lustful doctor "Robert Merivel" (Robert Downey), who finds his way around the Royal Palace in the first half of the film and then helps the oppressed in the second half, mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan) <br /> <br /> The GOOD - Fantastic decorations (such as the sumptuous Royal Palace) and costumes make this a visual treat. The language is also very tame. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant offer interesting support. <br /> <br /> The BAD - After 50-60 minutes, this movie just gets boring. It was urgent to give a spark after an hour, but the opposite is the case: it keeps on going. The script certainly needed a much needed "restore," shall we say? The movie looks good, but it takes two hours to endure ... too long.
