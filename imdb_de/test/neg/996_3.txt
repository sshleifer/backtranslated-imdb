Black and white satire of an advertising agency Madison Avenue, which is taken over by blacks. They are headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who is determined to change things. However, he proves to be even worse than his white predecessors. This is about as original as it gets. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969, but it seems stupid today. The jokes are either not funny (the president is a dwarf, how funny is that?), Cruel or obvious, and the movie is full of unlikely characters. It's done in a very experimental way, making it even harder to take or understand. The movie is getting more and more bizarre and surreal. The end comes out of nowhere. Worse, with the exception of Johnson, ALL is bad at acting. Antonio Fargas (regular in these films) is particularly annoying as an Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (in bright colors) are amusing and here and there is a rare good line. I've heard that this is a cult classic, but that's more interesting as well. Skip it ... unless you are in experimental movies of the 1960s.
