Garden State has to be one of the most creative and demanding movies of all time. The plot is a simple act in which a young man returns home after the death of his mother and discovers love. But in reality, the plot is not important. What is important for Zach Braff - author, director and star? is that he is able to disassociate all necessary features of an "indie" or "arty" movie from the plot. We are therefore presented with endless cute and bizarre characters and scenes that do not exist for plot or character development purposes, just to give the film some artistic credibility (Ã  la Wes Anderson - hopefully Braff). Unfortunately and somewhat amazing, Braff not only misled many on IMDb, but also some critics who should have known better. Of course, Braff's casual use of the bizarre alone does not make Garden State a bad movie. What really makes Garden State a stinker is Braff's script. He just does not have the writing skills to take this movie with him and the dialogue and characterization are miserable. Braff often has to resort to dull objects and symbolism in order to achieve what he can not achieve by writing. The deafness of the Braff character, for example, shows in his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can not be incorporated into the plot and must therefore take place in the dream!), Later he is beaten back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss (Life = bottomless abyss, very clever Mr. Braff). These two scenes must be among the most ridiculous and subtle ever to be seen on a movie screen. On the positive side, despite the lack of material for the cast (with which I work), acting is scriptable) and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as a love interest - a character so poorly written and implausible that she does Hardly more than a pointless doll that shapes Braff into his fantasy woman. <br /> <br /> Braff apparently took 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write a bad script - he's really incompetent!). So hopefully it'll be some time before he makes another movie.
