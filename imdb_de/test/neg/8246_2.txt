This film is so predictable if you know the modern American dream: Do not worry, be a loser and then suddenly ... whoah! You are a genius and a disgusting one, and the world kisses the ground on which you go. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, all the other smart people are losers. They know nothing and are bitter when our Wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what problems? They are so difficult, but these professors can analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Every film has something good anyway, and Robin Williams is in this movie.
