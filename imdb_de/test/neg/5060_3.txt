After writing and producing the last six years before, Luc Besson returns to Angel-A. I'm a big fan of Léon and liked the prospect of a French black and white movie from the same guy. André is a liar and a gambling addict who owes money to almost every shark shark Paris. Unable to repay his debts and tired of being held above the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decides to kill himself. He does this simultaneously with a mysterious woman he wants to rescue. Determined to thank him, she begins to help him repair his own life. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some laughs that are consistently good. The visuals are pretty nice and work well with the sights of Paris. But that's it. That's all the movie has to offer. And these two facets can not stop the stream of horrible film unleashing the movie. Although I can not blame the main character (but his disagreements are near), the eponymous one is scary. A horrible screen presence and bitter annoying. The plot itself is ridiculously contradictory and sometimes bizarrely stupid, especially the end; An end that brought to a halt the young salvation created by the scenes in front of it. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic, and too horrible to be "that bad, it's funny." The general premise of the film might have had potential, but is brutally slaughtered by the infinite realization of its ideas. The movie was really a job and I had to scream all the way through the screen. <br /> <br /> Massively and immeasurably flawed, Angel-A is just bad. Although it is sometimes fun to create dialogues at rare intervals, it is clear that this film is nothing more than disgusting.
