Hey, do you remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What was that for a while. I would say the book of life was when it really went downhill, but I will say that at least it went uphill from here. A movie that looks like it was filmed on a cell phone would not be a bad thing if it had an interesting story and an interesting dialogue. But unfortunately they are missing, along with Hartley's frugal, quirky dialogue. In its place is a boring exposition on issues of the Christian end age and a banal story of a modern Jesus in a dilemma, packed in a modern world where everyone tries to come from a Hal Hartley movie. While it picks up a little in the second half, it's never pleasant or particularly sensible. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
