Shwaas may have a good story, but the director has no talent. He does not know when to stop. When history asks people to act confused, there are scenes in which people imitate the act of confusion for ten minutes. If the story demands a bit of backstory, there are ten-minute scenes of Konkan's Green. If the story calls for a kid who throws tantrums, then you have the idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the extreme close-ups, so you can count the nasal hair of the people. There are films that should be seen on a big screen, this film should be seen on a 13-inch TV. Even Amruta Subhash, who plays Asavari, is the worst actress I've seen in a long time. A Normal Man Should Do It Practice overclocking for years to achieve what makes it so effortless. <br /> <br /> I only give 4/10 because the subject is different and the story is not bad. The fact that a film like Shwaas comes to it India's entry to the Oscars does not tell the volumes about the state of Indian cinema, but about the state of the Indian judges' commissions: A film is not good, just because its object is artistic.
