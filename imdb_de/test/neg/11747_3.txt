Do not be fooled that this is a remake, as THE TIME MACHINE's remake this year is based on an earlier movie. It's not that because that's a pointless return movie. That said, the director used the original camera script, which was filmed similar to the remake of THE GET AWAY a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt is made to embellish or restructure the original script. It is certainly not a Hitchcock), in fact I could even say that the Costumes could be the same because the private eye wears a pork cake hat. Did not they go out of fashion in the late 1960s? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Avoid
