That was bad enough. I really hope that there is no sequel. Maybe you're giving away some of the plot to let you know it's open to the possibility, but no, that's not it. <br /> <br /> This movie is really not special. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> There were some hot women in her, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to see people. PG-13, definitely not R. That also says the Slasher aspects were less spectacular. Only the shovel on the head was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame Scare Fare.
