Asmali Konak has become one of the best television series in Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a broad base, with rating records continuously broken. Personally, I do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor), but I think the numbers speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much anyone sees can destroy such a conspiracy. The film has been able to oversee every lineage history of the series for years. Not only that, the cultural flaws were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene where family members danced (Greek style) and plates that are nowhere to be found in Turkish culture. The stand-alone film must not be a continuation of the TV series to be viewed as. However, this theory results in a significant decline. The commercialization of the film was to continue where the series left off and complete the series once and for all. In that sense, I and everyone I know would have requested reimbursement and agreed to stand outside the theater to warn other victims.
