This puddle of deposited lover stole every Soviet movie of significance and failed miserably. I had an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the particular flaws of the Russian Orthodox Church (though this comment comes from a person of faith). Even the excellent cinematography did not inspire me. I spent his most beautiful moments very conscious of the masterpieces that he mimicked badly. I would not recommend the film unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of communism, and the saints of the Seventy. It's a meaningless film out of (and over) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me.
