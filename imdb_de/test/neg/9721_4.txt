I feel really bad when I want to review this movie because I wish I had seen it as just a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but unfortunately they lose the great idea of ​​translating on screen. The story follows four (five) adolescents who are the offspring of the families That started the city of Ipswitch, a survivor of the Salem witch trials. They are also part of the secret sect called "The Covenant". Their power must be used sparingly, as it degrades their life force in small quantities and makes them very addictive. Theoretically, this would lead to a pretty good action sci-fi movie or at least an interesting teen movie. <br /> <br /> But there were just too many blatant falls that did not allow this movie to reach its fullest potential. The drama was not good, the soundtrack was mediocre and we found many unnecessary synchronization issues. The biggest problem is certainly the bad editing job. The movie has little to no coherent flow and lets you fight to keep a mental timeline or pace. <br /> <br /> The movie has its moments, but was a bit disappointing overall. <br /> <br /> A funny 4/10
