This was not a very good movie, the acting was pretty stinky and the effects were mostly bad. But there were some funny moments, but most of them should not be funny. The funniest part of the movie for me was the part where a kid in a wheelchair crashes out (that's not the funny part.) What kind of person do you think I am? The brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny that he stumbles and really about acting I had to rewind it several times so I could laugh a little bit more. So if you are looking for something that you can rent, but do not seem to find it, find something, check this and see the current part.
