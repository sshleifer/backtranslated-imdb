Honestly, I'm not that impressed, it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very incoherent way, what kind it loses, its full meaning, and the ability to fascinate. This movie could be done in another way with an excellent result. The story is just so interesting, but somehow I'm not fascinated by watching. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not an amateur movie, rather the opposite and some scenes are really emotional. The actors and actresses do a good job, and the director does, but there is something that is so unfinished throughout the movie that I can not quite put my finger on it. If you might have met the characters more, the "clutter" of the movie could be better clarified and bring more "action" into the movie as it moved slowly from time to time.
