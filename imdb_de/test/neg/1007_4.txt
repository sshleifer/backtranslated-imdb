I was disappointed with the third movie in the "Death Wish" series and would not recommend it, unless you are really excited about Bronson. He is his ordinary self in this, maybe a little easier than in the others; The rest of the cast is good if you watch a movie of the week on TV - the whole movie has the production value of a bad episode of the A-team and I like the escapism fun of a show like the A-team, but not on the big one Screen, even if it is an action film that does not claim to be too sophisticated. It takes awhile for the movie to run, and when it finally does, it gets out of hand and becomes ridiculous. The plot is something of an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson seems to be like a fish out of the water with the majority of senior citizens, and the gun game is so out of control that you're not even pleased by Bronson's revenge on the bad guys Guys. Skip this and continue with the fourth installment, which I can highly recommend.
