I suspected that I hated it, I did. Everything was wrong. It was like they were filming another book. Granted, the location and the houses were lovely (if not a bit miscast - yes, even the house was wrong for their parts). Keira was too modern, boring and honestly I found it uncomfortable to watch her. If everyone saw Darcy as a sex god, the writer regarded him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and stupid (he should not be), and the Bennetts were proven to be penniless, and for unknown reasons, peasants were incorrect and ridiculous. The idea of ​​Mr. Bennett putting on the door in his nightwear with the rest of the family in underwear, in the middle of the night, is stupid. They had servants. Mr Collins was not disgusting and greasy, just stupid and disgusting. Georgina Darcy was ugly and old, and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress. What! As if! It is historically inaccurate and even the end is unsatisfactory. I could go on for days. I hated it so much that it not only had nothing to do with the book, but I fear that for many people it will be their first experience with this great novel, and it will give them the worst idea of ​​it. The BBC version is so superior that it is not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to her memory. In short, if you need to see it, make sure you've read the book first or seen the BBC version. Otherwise, you will be guided on the deceived path to the fact that it is what it is not!
