Nevertheless, "The House of Adam" should be a gay mainstream movie; Anthony (John Shaw), who is curious about gays and is a big sweet guy, and Adam (Jared Cadwell), who is openly gay, and a close second look; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, convincing and nude lovemaking (sorry, no frontal) between Anthony and Adam. 41 minutes into the movie (which alone may be enough for many of us) - despite everything (to which I (thumbs-up), "The House of Adam" is a horrible movie of almost all other film production standards.) A big thumbs down. <br /> <br /> Shaw's and Cadwell's acting skills are either sophomoric or they really suffer from the bad script, directing and editing, or rather lacking, but their love scene is compelling and may have more to do with it That they're really intertwined, considering the rest of their script and acting. His filming skills are off the wall. <br /> <br /> Well, the script and the lack of it is a thumbs-down. Overall, with only the slightest exception, the drama is the thumbs down for Shaw and Cadwell, with Alexis Karriker as Nina perhaps being the best, aside from the limitations mentioned above The distance of the worst and most unbearable spectacle was far from Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Antonia's father, who had not even in primary school acting quality. It really is a colossal casting error. <br /> <br /> The actors playing the new cabin owners are also making really bad nominations. <br /> <br /> If only the production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been something else altogether. The trailer presents well-made clips of scenes that led me to rent the movie at all. That and the hope that this gay-oriented film was supposedly prominently played and promoted at gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a big thumbs down. <br /> <br /> Is it worth to buy / rent and watch? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the nude love scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really like watching bad movies.
