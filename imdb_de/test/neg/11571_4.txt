Twenty-eight years before September 11, there was another September 11, which was an important date in the history of Chile, South America, and the world. This was the day that a bloody coup broke out in Chile in 1973. Salvador Allende, the first Marxist president to be democratically elected anywhere in the world, ended the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the forces attacked the presidential palace. Unfortunately, this film is too biased and too nostalgic in the face of All-Star rule to be an objective rendition of the man and his place in history. Times were uneasy and Allende was a controversial figure in the history of his country and around the world. Although he was democratically elected, his policy plunged Chile into an economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship, followed by repression and grave violations of human rights, but he was also an ally of Castro, who saw in his policy a different path to the revolution. We will never know if he has succeeded in building a socialist and yet democratic society. The authors of the film occupy a completely pro-position, there is neither an opinion nor a point of view, which tries to explain the other side, to answer questions, such as the question of why the middle class has opposed him or how his democratic views could match his support or be supported by Castro. The tone of the comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the story must wait in the future for a more balanced and objective film or book.
