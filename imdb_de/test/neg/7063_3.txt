Nobody will confuse THE SQUALL with a good movie, but it's certainly a memorable movie. As soon as you record Myrna Loy's performance as Nubi, the hot-blooded gypsy girl, you'll probably never forget the experience. When this movie was filmed, exotic exotic Miss Loy was still cast as a foreign vixen, often Asian and usually scary. It is certainly a feast for the eyes here. It seems her skin was dark and her hair was curly. In most scenes she is barefoot and wears little more than a skirt and a loose-fitting blouse, while in a scene she wears only a patterned towel. I suppose I'm focusing on Miss Loy's looks, because she's by far the best, if not the only, reason to listen to that creaking antiquity and go on. You certainly will not be attracted by the dialogue, which is hopeless. In a typical passage, Nubi looks out the window at the departing caravan and grows poetic: "Always the Gypsies sing it, weird and sad, when the great sun burns the breath of fire and the pale moon looks behind a cloud and breathe the air cold like death, they sing. "Poetic or what? Lovers of purple prose have a day outdoors. But I wonder if Miss Loy prefers not to remember her involvement in this project in her later years. <br /> <br /> Like so many early conversations, this was an adaptation to Broadway's recent success. The stage version was opened in November 1926 at the 48th Street Theater and ran for over a year. The play set off a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have a dislike for characters speaking dialect or pidgin English. Mr. Benchley, uncomfortably writhing through the first part of the show, loudly repeated anecdote. The Spanish village environment (for some reason moved to a Hungarian village because of the film) gave the actors room to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience reached its limits when a door burst open during a family evening and an actress, who was disguised as a gypsy woman stormed into the room and shouted "Help! Help! He pinches me!" She threw herself at the feet of the landlady and shouted: "I Nubi, I am a good girl, I am staying here!" At this point, Mr. Benchley got up and announced to his companion, "Me Bobby, I mean boy, I'm leaving now," and left the theater. The movie version offers plenty of examples of unintentional humor, but never comes close to Benchley's level. The melodramatic conspiracy affects the Lajos family: Father Joseph, Mother Mary, and Son Paul, a student at nearby college. We would regard this wealthy family as "upper middle class" as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is abruptly turmoiled when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their house is conquered by Ja, Nubi das nubile gypsy girl. She comes to her door during the storm of the title - symbolizing stormy emotions. The girl flees from an abusive relationship and asks for refuge. After considering the matter, the Lajos family agrees to hide them from their angry lover who appears shortly thereafter but is turned away. Nubi becomes a servant in the household. Kindness motivates the family's decision to accept her, but soon after Nubi has done little good, he has repaid her by seducing every sick man nearby, beginning with the servant of the Lajos, Peter, and then moving on to work up to son Paul. Nubi breaks Paul's relationship with his fiancée Irma (played by Loretta Young, still a teenager), gets him to leave school, and asks him to buy her jewelry, saving Lena (ZaSu Pitts) 's savings Family steals. Lena is still grieving for the loss of her own fiancé Peter, who was seduced by Nubi and thrown away when she turned to Paul. Ultimately, Nubi has the family father Joseph in the sights, and I think if the term would have been longer, she would also Uncle Dani, Maria, the village priest and God knows who else would have been. <br /> <br /> I suppose it goes without saying that a scenario like this is easily suitable for parodies, but THE SQUALL has the indisputable fascination of a daily soap for the first half: we watch the Bad Girl like the men cast a spell over people and confusions like an irresistible force of nature (almost like a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But as the acts of looting on the camping fun fade, the fun fades. In the later scenes, Nubi is less stressed and the focus changes to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while these people become a real burden. In particular, the son behaves like an absolute heel, but the parents never acknowledge this or face their own mistakes. Everything we are told is Nubi's fault that no jerk. The men of the occupation are boring. Apart from Miss Loy, ZaSu Pitts is the only actress who can perform in talkies. The mother of Lajos's household is played by Alice Joyce, a long-time, silent star, who was not in her element with her speaking roles and retired shortly thereafter. Loretta Young's fresh beauty contrasts beautifully with Nubi's dark fascination, but her line readings are so awkward that they are somehow lovable. No, there's only one reason to watch this movie, and that's Nubi herself. I can not think of any other actress who could have played this stupid role and performed half as well. However, I am not an objective observer. I am desperately in love with Myrna Loy and will observe her in everything, including THE SQUALL.
