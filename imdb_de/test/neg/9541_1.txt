If a copy of this film falls into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I'm a big fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of bad, but there's no letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of frozen puke. This movie even surpasses the "so bad is good" phase and goes straight to "so bad that your world seems a little less significant once you've seen it." <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what's more annoying: .1. The fact that the people who wrote this, their political satire (I use the term very, very, very easy) for me, was funny enough to film. They could find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this trash for obviously little or no money. That someone thought it would be a good idea to pick up this crap for distribution on a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I were a weaker man, I would most likely have had grapefruit spoons in my eyes and then stopped. I blindly threw myself into death in oncoming traffic after seeing this. It looks like I'm alive, but the experience always scares me.
