Why did I have to go and buy (yes buy!)? JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ??? Maybe it was an outbreak of temporary mental disorders? But I suspect it's because I somehow enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a dumb but funny horror comedy that had some good effects from Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back of the sequel was this beautiful picture of this guy who was impaled by this huge icicle (which came out of his mouth with lots of blood and everything). So I thought: if it's just as idiotic as the first one and some nice splatter / gore in it, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> Let me first say that the film deserves a lot because it has an incredibly insane and backward action. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that produces mutant killer baby snowballs that can only be killed or injured by bananas ??? As much as I like the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all, while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (apparently shot on a real movie), this sequel has the look and feel of a third soap opera. It has that way to smooth shot-on-video look. The lighting is just awful (bright white dots for the day and silly colors like blue and green at night). Acting ... well, do not even go there. The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (this Jamaican man was just idiotic and said "man" after each sentence) and when it comes to the killer snowman's voice, all I could think of is a seventh-rate Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY The best joke was a guy who asks, "Why are you talking to your watch?" And the best scene was undoubtedly the scene in which this beautiful Asian chick came out of nowhere Oh well, and this little scene about the credits with the two Japanese guys on a miniature ship that was badly named made me laugh too, but the worst thing about this movie was Where was the gore splatter action everyone is talking about? There have been many occasions to show decent bloody killings, many people have been killed in an original way, but all outside the Screen. As I've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice settings for a head blast, a crushed body, outspoken eyes, torn tongues, ... but at crucial moments, the editor cuts some blood off the floor or squirts nothing at all. This front shot of the British man who was skewered (from the back of the DVD) was not even in the movie. I just saw this particular murder filmed from the back (which means I did not see Sh! T!). I have been waiting for the whole movie, and then I see nothing?!?! What a failure! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? That would be a pity, because only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs to bloody porridge just did not cut it off for me. Speaking of snowballs: They were very bad. They made MUNCHIES state-of-the-art "animatronics". But I think that was the point. At some point, the special effects crew even turned to a ridiculously bad CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. It is best not to see it, because this strip is just too bad (okay, I laughed with it because it got worse and worse). Just stay with the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be alright (just keep in mind it's a pretty stupid horror comedy, but fun in itself). <br /> <br /> It's funny, but a writer Director Michael Cooney must somehow have realized that after JACK FROST 2 he was a pretty bad director and then focused on writing. It turned out that he wrote two pretty good thriller scripts for THE I INSIDE (with Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (with John Cusack). The man seems to have a bit of talent. <br /> <br /> Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest possible rating. So I say a point for the naked Asian baby doing the skinny dipping, and a point for the snowball babies, who are completely left behind. Keep it up, Mr. Cooney!
