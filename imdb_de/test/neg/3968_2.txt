This movie was made by my mother, my mother, who worked in a charity business. She gave it to us along with a lot of other unknown cassettes. The movie itself is a bit of garbage. There are a few notable pieces that you have to laugh about when your girlfriend drills his head, but in general the movie is bland. Interestingly enough, when I saw the trailer for "The Island", I noticed the similarities. Clonus was perhaps the inspiration for this movie? All in all, you should not look at this movie because it is boring and boring. When we were 16, we liked it so much that we named our band after that. Another sign that the movie is a bit crappy, is not the footage on the back of the video ball really showing in the movie? strange
