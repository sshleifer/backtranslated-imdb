Not me .. If that mattered, I could kick a dog in the ass and that's why this movie does not work for me. If I was against the alien or Jason .. Or ... hell, I do not know. ANY OTHER HORROR FILM ANTAGONIST, then there would be no contest, and I would let my ass pass without divine intervention. A horror movie works because it puts people in a situation where there is a creature, a person, a being, a being, or something else that is more powerful or imaginative or more intelligent than they are, and then people think 'well, what happens when that happens to me 'and you get scared - and that's why it's a terrible idea for a story. I can not imagine being terrorized by a dog, so I'm not scared.
