In Chicago, four electricians, led by Dean (Richard Grieco), come to an old building to turn off the power. They accidentally activate a portal and enter another dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants. The group meets survivors, led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse), and finds the inventor of the portal, dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They team up and try to rebuild a portal to bring them home. "Webs" is an observable plagiarism of "sliders", only worse. Most of the dialogues seem to be written by a person who has not completed elementary school yet. Moreover, the story is illogical and seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if stealing a car is very funny. The face of Richard Grieco looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and is terrible. If the viewer shuts his brain down, he may like this memorable television movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Na Teia do Terror" ("In the Web of Terror")
