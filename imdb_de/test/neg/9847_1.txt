This film attempts to capture the naive idealism that many young teenage girls have to have fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, and more. Therefore, they have failed to build a decent history around them. I could not follow any point in this story and no reason why I should care. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an exploration of pedophilia. Basically, it's about a girl in love with her sister and her sister in love with the idea of ​​"men." While the latter tries her love of men, the former tries to reclaim her sister through "equality." <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the reality is similar to an amateur pornographer (no sexual substance).
