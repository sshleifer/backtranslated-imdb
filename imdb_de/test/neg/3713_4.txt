I love Juan Piquer-Simón! He's my absolute favorite movie director, and has spent his entire career fully exploiting every successful contemporary trend in the horror and fantasy genres. After the big hit "Superman" JP made his own and funny "Supersonic Man", he chose the violent Slasher movie madness with the insane "Pieces" and surpassed with "The Return of ET", the unofficial and almost ridiculous successor of Spielberg SF -Blockbuster. "The Rift" is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies like "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six". From start to finish you can enjoy yourself by discovering all the stolen ideas and shameless rip-offs of these (and other) classics. As a completely new and fancy submarine disappears near the deep Dannekin Rift, a second mission is sent aboard with submarine designer Wick Hayes to find out what really happened to Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cave where the government is secretly experimenting with mutant marine animals. The monsters are quite aggressive, but there is also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members ... "The Rift" is an unforgettable movie, but he still has some ingenious ?? although very dodgy ?? Monster models. Fans of blood and blood will not complain, because the animal attacks are pretty cruel and merciless. Acting is very wooden, though many of the cast names are definitely better. It is advisable that you simply enjoy the clichés and gory effects in "The Rift", because if you think about the script, you will find that it makes absolutely no sense.
