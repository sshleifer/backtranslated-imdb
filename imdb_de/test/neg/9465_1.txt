After the death of a plastic surgeon's wife, he receives his hunchbacked assistant to help her revive her with various parts of other girls who are still young. This movie wants to be a Hersel Gordon Lewis guy, but fails miserably. Acting is beyond bad, the gore effects are disgusting (no, not in the good way), the plot almost nonexistent and no fun. Skip it. You want to know how incompetent it is? At one point, you can actually see a movie slateboard. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Candy Furr will be topless and back in a flashback <br /> <br /> My Rating: F <br /> <DVD Extras: Commentary with Jeffrey Hogue and Cynthia Soroka, A second post "How to Make a Doll"; Alternative title sequence with Hershel Gordon Lewis Intro; 2 shorts ("Quest of the Perfect Woman" and "Maniac Hospital"); Cover art gallery with music of the dead Elvi; Pendant for "Dr. Black Mr. Hyde", "Boots and the Preacher"; "The Doctor and the Playgirls", "The Cruel Couple"; "Wizard of Gore"; "Terrible Dr Orlof"; "Crazy World of Doctor Morgus"; "Proffessor Lust", "Monstrosity"; "Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico"; and "I, Marquis DeSade" <br /> <br /> Easter Eggs: Movie Trailers; a scene from "Just for the Hell of It"; and a trailer for "ax"
