Hilarious !! I swore that Ed Wood wrote this. Awful. I loved every frame. Bad movie lover, that's your trophy! I will see it again. Words can not explain how entertaining this movie is. The career of Pare must come to an end, but I really believe that he is going in the direction of Leslie Nielson. He was perfect for that. Terrible, just awful !! You will love it!! Get friends, lots of beer and you have the time of your life. It's an MST3000 party waiting to happen. Enjoy!! The rent is worth it !! They like the "Colombo-type" pop and the cartoon coroner. The evil will make you laugh on the floor. He's also in another pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good there. I do not know what the budget was, but they will get it back because this movie will be the best unwanted comedy of the year.
