I'm really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). It's full of bad lines, bad drama, bad slapstick, etc. I never thought I'd see worse shows than the deliberately poorly played scenes at the beginning of UHF, but that's it. And just when you think that it can not possibly get worse, it does! Again and again! You could have seen that in a theater? It was not free on TV! My 4 year old and 1 year old liked some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never there.
