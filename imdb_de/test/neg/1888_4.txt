It is proof that filmmakers and their financiers, who treat their audience with contempt, are not a new phenomenon since it was made back in the 1940s and HOUSE OF Dracula is a prime example. You'd think a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster that the producer dictated to the scriptwriter would make all three appear in one scene. They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, when they had a second bite of the cherry, they blew again with HOUSE OF Dracula. Losing a chance is a misfortune to lose two smells of cynical money. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that the producers are not worried. Larry Talbot reappears, although he was shown in the previous film to die, which sums up the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows what a bad script it is, and we are treated with terrible complications like Talbot's condition, healed by a special plant species that softens his skull. I think screenwriter Edward T Lowe could have tempered his skull when he came up with this kind of director, Erie C Kenton. He can not improve the script and throws in a few wrenches of his own. Talbot, for example, is startled when he sees Dr. Nobleman on a car takes, but happens to watch as nobleman climbs a wall and jumps to the courtyard. One can not help but think that Talbot's reaction shots were accidentally switched in the editing phase. Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies but has not had a great career outside of them. Maybe it's because he's not a good actor and does the worst kind of acting here - being very wooden. It's not entirely his fault, because all the characters are pretty awful dialogues and all are pretty wooden, in part due to Kenton's lackluster directing. HOUSE OF Dracula feels millions of miles away from James Whale in 1931 and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note in the end. Ironically, however, Universal decided to do another film to end her franchise with a horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello
