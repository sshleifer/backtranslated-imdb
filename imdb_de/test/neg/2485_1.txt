I've seen this movie on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago, even though I was a little boy who is hard of hearing. I did not have a subtitle decoder back then (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what's going on. It was not my fault that I saw the animated film meant for girls. My dad rented the video to show it to my other younger sister. <br /> <br /> A decade later and I rented the video (for 50 cents) to see again, with the subtitles turned on. My memories of this movie have been destroyed by none other than a WRETCHED SCRIPT. I've seen a lot of badly written movies (like COOL AS ICE and JASON TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY), but I've never seen (or heard) such dialogues that were just so bad that they were flooded with enough awkwardness to make the head laugh hysterically and scream at the pain of enduring the torture when you sit through this movie. Despite good plot and intriguing story concepts, the screen script must be one of the worst ever written. The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a scriptwriter, professional, or otherwise. I can not believe that they would even allow the terrible screenplay ever to produce a movie like this. Have the Japanese producers read the script, in broken English or translated, before they know what they are getting into? Even crap like G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The Movie have redeeming values ​​compared to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of 80s animations or just a nostalgic trip, BEWARE OF RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR DIEB! It does not matter if you were thrilled or traumatized by the sloppy animated film with a vile script, or you did not see the movie STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. The film should be viewed with caution to learn how NOT to write a bad script!
