I have not seen and heard the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning. <br /> <br /> I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia and the US etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to mention: <br /> <br /> In the German dubbing throughout the movie all Russians speak Russian accent. Americans speak "High German" (without accent)! I have never heard such stupidity! Besides, that's boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond movie.
