To call this film catastrophe is an understatement. I do not know where to start! However, I have questions and many. I would like to know who came up with this script? Who gave them money to shoot this movie? Who was responsible for the casting and the costume? They should all be sued! I saw this movie in the catalog of my local library and thought, "Hey, great!" I had just seen the two FOG films that Hollywood had produced, and then I realized that Bollywood had a version. Unknown to me that it would turn out to be a total crapfest! <br /> <br /> Dhund - The Fog is a movie about four friends (actually only one of them, but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by the 1st wife from India World, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director will save you no expense if you know this. The script even claims that she (the name of the person is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai eyes, Kareena Kapoor lips and Rani Mukherjee hair. Feel free, if you want, at least at this point you have not seen the movie, as opposed to poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> Anyway, Simran will one day receive a death threat from an uncle of the contestant who tells her to quit the contest so his niece would have a better chance of winning. Simran's boyfriend does not allow this, and so she takes part in the contest and wins, causing her former classmate Tanya's chapped cocaine-snooping uncle to come after her, but with the help of her cousin Kran, Simran drowns the culprit, and they both challenge It's tough, but they eventually come to do it Where the body is hidden is only released to show that the corpse is missing, creating a mystery between Whodunit and Where -is-it. When the movie is over, the movie successfully steals scenes from "I know what you did last summer I still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder wrote episodes and not m ention, Columbo and Sco oby doo! shameless, i tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and issues within the movie include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. A lightly clothed Simran answers three times the phone calls from her would-be killer showing the camera that she drops the phone from the phone, but the phone can ring again each time and pick it up to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Tanya tries to kill herself because she does not win the beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times prettier, did not try to commit suicide when she did not win Miss India. <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, the kids who pick up the ball dropped into the pool will conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive. And the ball disappears too. <br /> <br /> 4. The killer's cliched contact lenses change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, but when his body reappears, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. Nobody who dies in the movie is mourned (weird, especially for the Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the filthy, dark pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions, and miraculously the pool turns into Olympic size and is clean and clear as the day. <br /> <br /> 7. Sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm, song and dance number about growing up. That would have been cool for a bachelor party, but they were celebrating the victory of Simran! Hello!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal can not properly lip or lip. But do not blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the movie was choreographed, it was like telling the actors to show up and do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> 10. The movie was as if there was no script. Either that or the director was up and drunk when he filmed this trash! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's photo was published in a journal without her consent, she flew to the police department to arrest the photographers, but she receives death threats and never disturbs the police. <br /> <br /> Just to name a few. Of course. This film was a painful experience for me and I recommend everyone to skip it by any means that is necessary and possible. Bollywood should be ashamed of this kind of filmmaking.
