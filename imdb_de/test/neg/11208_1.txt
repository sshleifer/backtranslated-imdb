I have seen this movie as a real ninjas movie for many years, but after learning more about this culture, I can only think that this is just another karate movie. A black Shinobi and some weapons make no ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warriors in Japan because they are trained in all walks of life to survive what kills any attempt to stop them. This movie is not about a ninja warrior, it's just about a clown trying to be something he can not even understand.
