My parents borrowed a lot of horror movies as a child. We loved to see them, even if they were bad to have fun. This was such a movie, hard to review, since I only saw it once as a kid, but it's not something I want to find again, so I can do a more detailed review. In the story dies an old horror actor legend. I remember that he acted like an excessive Vincent Price without being sympathetic and stylish. He commits murders and dies, but what is that? Is the movie over? No, because some children for some reason catch the body and prepare for a fun night, where they are killed by the ham from outside the tomb. I remember that the murders after the first couple were nothing special and I remember that this movie was rather disappointing. It seemed like a good premise, but it simply could not deliver the goods, as more cool kills were needed and this super-horror actor had to contribute a bit to his repertoire.
