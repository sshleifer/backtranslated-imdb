The movie from 1980 is not the movie available from Something Weird Video in "Driver's Scare Films Vol. 5". For one thing, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has on this CD an earlier version (1972) of the movie made in b & w for WLWT Television Channel 5 in Cincinnati. Either way, this movie is notorious. Unlike most other motion pictures, however, this was for television and television. This is the level of carnage depressed. It is still a rather cruel exercise in the exploitation of bloody death for an alleged pedagogical purpose. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember that this thing is shown every year around the completion time on Channel 5. If you're looking for a movie that sets the tone of this unique American movie phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is typically grumpy, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, melodramatic. Whether it really influenced the driving of a teenager, you can only guess.
