I like this movie and have looked at my copy twice since I purchased it a few weeks ago. But you have to see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I have not checked the dates yet, but I'll bet that this movie came later, and certainly at about the same time as the Collier and Walt Disney popularizations of The Vision of Space Flight are by W. Promoted by Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to be factually correct and scientific. While certain ideas (eg, stage amplifiers) are conveyed approximately correctly, other things are weirdly wrong. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket rises to a height and then turns ninety degrees to get into space ... as if to reach a staircase and turn to the landing! Then we are told that by turning in the direction of the Earth's rotation, the overall speed of the ship is correspondingly increased. <br /> <br /> This is a funny misunderstanding about what really happens. Most launch centers are as close as possible to the equator, where the earth and everything on its surface turns at a speed of about a thousand miles an hour, including all rockets that fly into space, in an easterly direction (like the rotation of the planet)). Once the ship moves west in space, its speed would be higher relative to the Earth's surface, but it would not add to the actual speed of the vehicle. In this movie called "air speed"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers are only in free fall when they are several thousand kilometers from Earth, outside the gravitational field of the planets. Again weird wrong. Most manned spacecraft fly no higher than a few hundred miles, but as long as they travel (and their contents including the crew) at a sufficient speed that their momentum balances outward the train of gravity inward, they will do so in the orbit free fall. Of course, you have to drive far enough away from the earth, and even a slow object will glide well outside of Earth's gravity, but to leave Earth orbit outside (eg towards the Moon), you need a "escape velocity" of about twenty-one thousand reach miles per hour. By definition, the vehicle has already reached "orbital speed" (and "weightlessness"). <br /> <br /> But the movie has a lot more hilarious stuff than this one. Someone decided it would be more fun if he missed the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up when he realized that they had accidentally gone to Mars! The captain then smiles to the effect that this must have been a divine intervention! At this point, every claim to scientificity is torn into small pieces like confetti and thrown into the wind in the joyous dance of an increasingly caricatured plot. <br /> <br /> The power of a movie like this is indeed illustrated "how far we have come". Not least in the attitude to women. The patronizing fool heaped upon the female crew member is both hilarious and shocking. To think that such settings were so recently "normal". <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very entertaining. Late at night, lights are bustling from the perspective of the days before, when they actually took place. An antidote to the cold routine of space flight as it emerged in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end. It is both courageous and shocking for a film of this vintage and this character.
