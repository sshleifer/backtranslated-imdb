Alright, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were very fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy that you should develop. The computer did not tell you every step of your mission, you could hike and explore. <br /> <br /> That's the first thing wrong with RL. Everything you do is under a schedule and is controlled by other people. I mean, should not you as a leader tell people how to deal with each mission? <br /> <br /> And when we talk about missions, why are you doing the original trilogy of completely made-up crap? No matter. <br /> <br /> I was so waiting for this game when I heard that Empire Strikes Back was flying through the asteroid field. I think everyone who is a fan of the movies wanted to do that. So give it to you. It's the dumbest level in the game. You begin with a flight through the asteroid field with ties that chase you, and your ultimate goal is to continue in the field while shooting the ties. You have to kill them all to get ahead. Hey, do you remember how many Han killed when he was in the field? None, they all had poor flight skills compared to him. I just wanted to dodge the asteroid as they approached me, but instead I must use my automatic targeting weapons to kill ties behind me. That was the biggest disappointment you can not control. During the flight everything is slow. Everything except the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most agile ship in the fleet. But, oh, did not Han say the hawk was? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Finally you are in the battle of Endor. Here's the ultimate level, you have to destroy the Death Star, everyone's first instinct is to pick the Falcon and be the leader. But of course you get there and have to do stupid preselected strategies, like finding the ties (not to mention decryption). This is impossible in the falcon, if you have discovered a group, the frigate is destroyed. The only way to get past this part is to pick the A-Wing. Then you have to attack the Star Destroyers and that's a really stupid task. This game gives you the feeling of being the only one who defends the Rebel Alliance. <br /> <br /> After you have frustrated this "fun" fight, come to the Death Star. And here you may think 'yay! I can destroy the Death Star, and like in the asteroid field, you have to do something boring while you barely pass the tunnels of impending demise. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you. Do you remember the return of the Jedi? It's so stupid, because if you pick the hawk, you die because you're not manoeuvrable enough. But if you select the X-wing, you have to lock and unlock its S-slides over and over again. So it's a choice either to kill the bad guys or to reach Lando, who does not seem to know how to maneuver him. So die in the process. <br /> <br /> The bonus levels are not even worth the goal as each level becomes increasingly frustrating. I feel the way I did when I saw the new three movies that are upset and need to kill something. Lucky for me, there is Smash Bros Melee. <br /> <br /> I hope with the Wii you will get something much better and the original trilogy level is fully utilized. I will sell this game the first chance I get.
