First and foremost, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director of all time. Coleman Francis deserves this title. I present Exhibit B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the movie has no problems. Bela Lugosi was completely foreign and came across odd lines. Poor Bela looked like he was not sure what happened sometimes. The drama was subtly made of wood, though it was no worse than a Universal B period. The long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was completely bizarre. more like a vaguely threatening deer movie than a dream sequence. The Alan / Ann story, the film's supposed original focus, has a big impact on quality. No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever made. At least for part of this film he was able to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried this on Night Train To Mundo Fine (aka Red Zone Cuba), it ended in chaos. Glen or Glenda can be seen at least without the help of the robot.
