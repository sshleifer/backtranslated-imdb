As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara like Vivien Leigh and Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All others are pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exception. One thing I really could not overcome was that Joanne has brown eyes. The green eyes were the best feature of Scarlett's beautiful appearance, and in this sequel she was robbed of it. <br /> <br /> The movie and the book had several lulls. The new characters were not so memorable and I forgot who was who. I felt like she was going to Ireland, absolutely nothing. It could be that I'm only eleven years old, but I did not see any change in her attitude until the last sentence, 10 minutes, when Rhett told her she was an adult. If Rhett had not told her that, I never would have thought that her attitude had changed. She loved Cat, her baby. She likes this child best because she had it with Rhett, her only beloved husband. However, if you've read "Gone with the Wind," you'd find that kids do not make a difference in Scarlet's world. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it seemed to me that there was too much going on without Rhett. Everyone's just interested in whether Rhett and Scarlett come together again, and Scarlett has taken far too long to achieve that. It's virtually nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but what is not it? If you've read the novel, you'll like that better than the movie. <br /> <br /> I would just watch it, just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind, whether it's worth it or not. It can not satisfy you completely, but it will take you part of the way there.
