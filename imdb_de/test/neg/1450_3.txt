Pluses: Mary Boland is as always delighted (I never get tired, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). TOILET. The short role of Fields is fun, even if the famous pool table scene is a bit welcome, as it seems to take ten minutes. The typical lunatics of the film for this time are great. Also a nod to the wonderfully grounded host of Alison Skipworth; I would like to see more of her (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another person who deserves high praise). <br /> <br /> Minus: Gracie Allen. An irritating, listless presence whose anger remained unrivaled until the rise of Adam Sandler. This almost falsetto nasality with an accent of unknown background is getting old in its very first scene. This is the first of the Burns Allen movies I've seen, and while I (as a big classic comedy fan) try to do at least one movie with every big comedy star, this is definitely a team I'm into will not come back again. Their timing and their interpretation of the material is completely over. An incredibly mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: An OK comedy, but the gags are few. After an hour, you can assume that this is not a Hollywood comedy class A. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
