Sigh. I am amazed when I see how a short film receives attention and tasks and so on. I saw this movie at a festival before the filmmaker caught his eye and immediately forgot about it. It was a bit annoying to see how it gets the Grinch Who Stole Christmas Heart Gag along with the narrative, the often-seen set design, the lame Tim Burton style, and the story of nowhere to go. And we had the "joke" that the Crows were shot the first time with the 45, alright? <br /> <br /> But I think what's really unacceptable is that it even gets its basic concept out of a 1999 comic book called LENORE, THE NICE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any fast internet search will show. I mean, what is it? Then they set up a Hollywood contract and open the doors to a filmmaker in Canada? "Shake your head," as Don Cherry might say.
