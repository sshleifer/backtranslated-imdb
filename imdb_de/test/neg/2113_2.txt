If I were British, I would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence. A special department protection agent who can not defend against a sick, unarmed and untrained attacker? The Home Office sends a single "science advisor" to investigate a possible Tier 4 biological hazard, and that the "counselor" does not feel like even wearing a mask and gloves? Completely unprotected London police officers working side by side with technicians in biohazard suits? The "counselor" and his bodyguard who carries the cave of a sociopathic doctor who experimented with subjects without support? Puh-Lee! One wonders if the producers could not afford to hire technical advisors, or if they for some reason deliberately chose to portray clients as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has neither medicine nor law enforcement, rolled her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode I was discouraged; Now that I've seen two episodes, I give up.
