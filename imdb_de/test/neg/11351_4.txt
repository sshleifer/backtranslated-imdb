Incident on and off a mountain road is Don Coscarelli's contribution to Mick Garris's Masters of Horror Series. Coscarelli is known to be the man behind cult gems like the Phantasm Series and the irresistibly funny Bubba Ho-Tep. But he does not bring any of the qualities that made these films great to this TV episode. The plot is a mill run that follows the routine idea that an innocent man is being chased by a madman. This time it is a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head butt, she encounters a white-faced madman. The whole sequence of the chases is really ridiculous. The young lady keeps stopping to set traps. Only for the maniac seconds later, and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband. with lines like "expect the unexpected". The only real highlight for me was the presence of Phantasm's Tall Man, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli tries his best to implement as many horror images as possible. with things like a rotten corpse of a dead baby - but because it's so stupid on the whole, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode of the series and the first one I saw. I really hope you feel better.
