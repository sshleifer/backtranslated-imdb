My brain screamed, "Why are you watching, turn it off and go to bed!" But Couch Potatoness won and I looked to the foreseeable end. I think if it's Bruce Campbell, I have to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to complain about a low-budget movie because of its low budget. Films that prove a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce had their start with such a movie, but they did not seem to learn from Sam that it took more than making a movie to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's also sad because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70s and 80s, I just can not believe that films that are so bad are still being made. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
