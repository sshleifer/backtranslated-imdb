The movie starts with a lot of voice-over, a bad sign. Then it just slides downhill with stupid and intelligence-insulting scenes involving trappers and Indians. However, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain people dance on a high alpine meadow. Meanwhile, the cheerful Indians sit around and watch them. It's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in Blazing Saddles. This comparison has a slight error. "Across the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
