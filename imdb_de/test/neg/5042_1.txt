The acting was shallow (at least none of the actors sounded like they got the script in the morning) and the movie and sound quality reminded me of the bombing movie of the 70s of the week. The only thing that told me that it was indeed not a '70s movie of the week was the reference to DNA testing. But for me as Eastern Orthodox, the most inappropriate thing about this .... movie ..... was the total Roman of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you would never know that in this film: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known if I had not seen the actor play the Irish pub keeper Michael Sullivan in Star Trek: Voyager's "Fairhaven" episodes. The bishop wore Roman vestments (and not even Orthodox bishops wear their robes for the record, unless they say the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). One of the only non-roman utensils I saw was the 3-bar cross on the door of the church, and even then I had to squeeze my eyes to see it. The first reviewer said the producers had done their research. If that's true, they've upset the religious aspect of the movie.
