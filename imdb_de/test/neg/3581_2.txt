I do not know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. Since the remake of "Body Snatchers" he seems to have lost it. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" are still two of the best films of the 90s: charges against a decade that went awry. With films like "R Xmas" (whatever that means) and "New Rose Hotel," he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters. This movie has NO LIFE. While he achieves outstanding performances by his actors in all his projects, the result of this mix of ideas simply does not shake. Whatever the point is - that the new kind of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other upper middle class New Yawkuh - gets lost in the thoughtless numbness and boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at the 4-plex in downtown Los Angeles. In the lobby I was surprised at buying tickets and pleased that he was filled with a large, racially mixed group of men and women of their twenties and thirties. Then they started the theater, but it was "8 Mile" and not "R Xmas"! The theater with "R Xmas" (remember, this was the opening night!) Had a total of 4 people who saw it, me, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
