I would like to say that I went into this film with too high expectations. I thought it would be funny because it was the successor to Bruce Almighty, who was really funny, and Steve Carell, who is an excellent comedian, but the boy who holds the stuff is the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is being advertised as a sequel, but it really has nothing to do with the original, since Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell are the only characters reinterpreting their roles, but Steve's character is completely different 'He's not the idiot he was in first here, he's a nice guy. The story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> All involved actors (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very shitty cameo) have talent, but none of them seem to use it and it Looks like the movie is just for the money. <br /> <br /> Now the plot is obviously shaped by Noah's story, but there are so many wrong things I do not know where to start. I think the big problem is that in the environment where Evan thinks he's crazy for all the things that happen to him, in two days he makes a huge white beard, he gets help from animals around the world, which he builds a huge arc in a few weeks, in real life people would not taunt this guy afterwards, they would say he is the new Noah. <br /> <br /> Also the special effects are good, but what the hell? is the biggest movie ever filmed in Evan Almighty? Do you really need to waste such good special effects as a filler for this crappy movie? Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy, since he stayed away from three of the worst sequels, Son of the, he ever did, Mask, Stupid and Dumber and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a huge disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
