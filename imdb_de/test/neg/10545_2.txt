The first poison film was dark, bloody and intoxicating. This movie is inhumane battles to jazz music, not a real horror and the worst poison mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice. Characters from Part 1 reappear from actors who look NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), the names of the characters change (Claire or Sara?). It lacks all the brutal violence, the dark humor and the political impropriety of the first film. If there was no nudity, this film could have been rated as PG. Really lame. Although I'm a huge fan of Part 1, I can not stand it.
