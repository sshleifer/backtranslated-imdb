Another film from the Swedish hinterland, which is always in the north. If black people are shown this way, it would scream to racism and for good reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a farce and you should laugh about the "clever" farce clich√©s. But it is usually boring. A gangster comedy with the evil Russians (as always) and the evil (and stupid) Finns. And of course, the strangest is the Norwegian, according to Stockholm prejudice. Andreas Wilson is the only one trying to make a performance that reminds us of reality. That's not funny. That's not even exciting. A burlesque, too raw to interest you in any way.
