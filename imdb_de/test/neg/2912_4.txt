Let's get tough is one of the films people probably regret years later when they shot. This story of East End Kids is full of terrible, racist Jap talks and jokes and describes how the kids want to join the military to defeat the Japs. Since they are too young, they decide to cleanse the city of these sneaky Japs. They find one, throw fruit on it (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls out a short sword to threaten them! The cops say he should stop annoying him! He is only Chinese! He is on our side! When the kids apologize, the Chinese is dead! It's all part of this huge Jap and German Spy ring! The children make sure that this is stopped at all costs! I am sure that this was all right when it was made (1942), but now you realize that this is clearly a product of its time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. Funny how the East End kids have a black kid in the group, and he's not spared. Gee Whiz.
