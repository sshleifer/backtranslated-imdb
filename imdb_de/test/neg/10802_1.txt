But at least that movie deserves what it deserves - it's being sent to the Satellite of Love to be heard by Mike, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester on "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" To be ridiculed. "Soultaker" is one of the long-forgotten, forgotten movies that are so bad that you will have nightmares or depression later in life. Although the film is not that old, it is still a very forgotten film. Without the intelligent minds of "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film would not only have made it appear as if it had never been made, but the movie would not be much enjoyed by us moviegoers. <br /> <br /> In real life: This movie is really bad. In the satellite of love: This movie is excellent!
