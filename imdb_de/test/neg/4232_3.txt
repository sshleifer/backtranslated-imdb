A trio is sitting at a restaurant table staring silently into space. Later, they lean on a rail and look across the English Channel to England. A man works repeatedly in his garden with a hoe, only his head and torso are visible on the canvas. A man and a woman are watching another man peeing against a stone wall. Each of these still takes about a full minute. There is absolutely no information transmitted that could not be given to us in about a quarter of the time. The editor must have slept half. I know, I was. <br /> <br /> The film was opened with an amazing shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead corpse. A ravine rises. Then the policeman (Scot) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and starts to come along. The case is forgotten for the next half hour while Scotsman and his friends exchange atypical insults with each other and with strangers. Finally, the thread of the case is picked up again, but it runs slowly, almost aimlessly, following the already established style pattern. <br /> <br /> In movies like this, the location creates a kind of atmosphere that can offset the stupidity of the story, but not here. The houses of the French village are connected in long rows. The fa√ßades of the house come directly to the sidewalk without steps. The fronts show virtually no decoration and are hardly distinguishable. The flat fields are without characteristics. What could have been one of the more interesting episodes - a visit to a stone fortress on the coast - drills the trio until they begin to behave like fools and are asked to leave. <br /> <br /> The acting is minimal. Nobody seems to be particularly anxious to say something. No jokes are made. Nothing is amusing. The cop has an almost as interesting face as Randy Quaid's. The baby, a tall, strong blonde, looks like a kind of putter on steroids that the East Germans used at the Olympics. I sat through more than an hour before giving it up. Maybe I'll crack it another time. If I have not missed something or end up turning into a disturbed Monty Python routine, I do not think you'll get much out of it by hiring.
