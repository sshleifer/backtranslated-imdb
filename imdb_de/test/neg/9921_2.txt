This was a dirty and bleak mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes something like this - some celebrities are murdered and a homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to a subterranean lesbian society, and she befriends a group member who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, she is naturally horny and fascinated (which reveals a lot about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). Surprisingly, none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and anxious. Ellen Barkin performs well as a lead detective, and Julian Sands, as a cross-dressing psychiatrist, makes unwanted laughs.
