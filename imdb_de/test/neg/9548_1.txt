* Criticism mentions spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely make user comments, but this is a movie that I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks, and its mediocre rating of 6½ stars is probably too high for such a pulp. The Bone Collector is not the same caliber at all as the movie "Silence of the Lambs" or "Seven", though his advertisement claims this. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow - I halfway left halfway and came back to the same scene with exactly the same character and no progression (I'm referring to the part about Angelina Jolie's character Denzel discusses the hands of one Cut off corpse). The movie is not scary at all, but he tries to compensate for it with a love legplan, though Angelina Jolie's sexy character and Denzel Washington's character. Of course, you get something similar to the relationship between mentor and student, as seen in the Brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling. However, this also lacks any effectiveness, and I personally was in favor of the villain killing Denzel to avoid chuckling between the two. With such a crappy movie, I'd half expected a turn or a spectacular situation to end up giving the film some credits that produced mediocre films like Arlington Road and Scream. Anyone who has attended grade 4 can see how the end is solved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's rear window). The cliché that the killer had explained his motives was not imaginative enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that I spit latte across the screen. Esoterically, I even think that the murderer's intent was completely lost when Denzel happily recovered from his loss via the proverbial 'chess game' and caught his animal project Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of movies With original ideas and really dynamic concepts (like me), you will not appreciate this movie. If you have not seen a single movie in your life and want to catch up on any Hollywood cliché ever born (the nocturnal knock on a window other than the killer, the ridiculous serial killer to investigate the relationship between the investigators, the terrible woman who is trying to get along in a male-dominated workforce (SOTL), see this movie ... but even then it's too slow and you'll be bored.
