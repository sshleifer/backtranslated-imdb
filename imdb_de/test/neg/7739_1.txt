Every boy learns the lesson at some point, just because a girl looks good does not mean she's good. Well, let me tell you, at the age of 19, what we have learned. It's hard to say what's worse: Kathy Ireland's acting skills or her ultra-high voice; the one who sounds like a screeching mouse on helium and scrapes his tiny claws on a blackboard. With an incomprehensible act in space with dwarves wanting to have Kathy's bones for some obscure reason, this movie is simply wrong on so many levels. If there was ever a candidate for a revival of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, that would be the case.
