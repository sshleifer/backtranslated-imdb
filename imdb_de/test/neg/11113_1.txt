Just on the sci-fi channel UK, on ​​5 July, it was ****. Shame on JRD! Maybe he was bored for a week! He can not be to LOTR. I think he was not to blame. Mr. Sheppird was. I parked after 50 minutes, could not stand it. The CGI ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5 foot bat. Who financed this project? I think the whole thing must have cost $ 250. Avoid at all costs, do not think about buying the DVD when they release one, I can not imagine that they would spend dollars making a DVD. Let's hope someone makes a decent chupra movie and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was okay, poor Lance. It's a shame for a big studio and direct risk, no superhero movies anymore!
