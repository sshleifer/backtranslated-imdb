Director / Actor Dutcher indulges in this look-at-me movie, in which he seeks to gain worldwide acceptance for the otherwise very optimistic world of Mormon missionaries. Part of the acting is fair. However, some roles are unrealistic, ie, the ominous (and not the paternal) mission president, etc. The film gives a fair view of how some missionaries struggle with their faith, but the actual missionary program that they claim to represent is far from over his concept away from being optimistic, coherent and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this movie is Dutcher's self-inspiration. The movie is slow and boring, and the filming and script look like a college project.
