On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he received his first starring role in this love affair. First, you should realize that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair in the later decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two following remakes. It is not half as good as any of these films. <br /> <br /> In fact, Bogey is billed second by Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress to Hale Hamilton. That's quite a shock for Mackaill. She sees a career in show business as an income opportunity. Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aerospace engineer designing an ultimate aircraft engine and looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do that, and she likes what she sees in Bogey. <br /> <br /> Given the cynical roles that Bogart later turned into a specialty, it is somewhat disturbing to see him as this highly moral and self-righteous character in a love affair. The part does not wear well on him. The love affair is the average second program of the B program, nothing special.
