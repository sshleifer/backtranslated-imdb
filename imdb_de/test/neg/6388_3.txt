Maybe it's unfair for me to review this movie because I went long before the end. This is strange because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night's Dream many years ago when I saw him on stage Twerp with the Shakespearean name Calista Flockhart and Michelle Feiffer in a giant shell. Well, I suppose you could say it should be a comedy - but if the scenery is funny and the actors are not, then I would say we have a bad movie in our hands ...
