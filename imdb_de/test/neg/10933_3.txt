My husband wanted to watch this movie because the report in the newspaper said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, I do not like Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I have to agree. But not for conventional reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that have to be seen late at night, if you do not want to see something that really needs to be thought of, but do not want to go to bed. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a really nice villain. She is not the best actress, in fact she is not even good, but she is perfect for this role in this movie. Everyone else varies from pine to oak, including the somewhat disconcerting boy who appears as pinocchio. SPOILER: The end goes a step or two too far, with the clich√© not quite dead, with a roar, you still get a moment and then there's a shot of Pinocchio with his frozen wooden grin making you wonder if she's invite you to chill out or just forget that the make-up contains Botox. Still, it's a fun eighty minutes, and though it's a bad movie, you have to miss the humor gene so you do not enjoy it a bit. Do not pay for it, but if you're in such an apathetic glowing mood, then this is just right.
