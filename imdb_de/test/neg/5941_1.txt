I loved this movie! It is the best parody of Russian cinema so far. Who else but Sokurov could gloss over Tarkovsky so brilliantly. You thought, "stalker" is slow? Step on the plate. "Mat i Syn" makes "Stalker" look like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". You should not miss this movie! There is no excuse - even if you lead a busy life, you can still enjoy this movie to the fullest by holding down the fast-forward button on your VCR. Sokurov gave us the first full-length feature film that can be estimated in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I think the next big masterpiece of form will come when someone has the vision and the courage to exhibit a movie that consists of No sound or picture - 45 minutes black, silent screen (did not already examined in "In The Soup"?). <br /> <br /> Apparently, the filmmaker (and his fans) have forgotten that "Motion" is the first word of "movie." <br /> <br /> !!! IMPORTANT SPOILERS Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> If you want to reach the height of genius that this film has achieved, here is a step by step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some motifs and a correspondingly picturesque landscape (think of Tuscany!) If you need inspiration, take a look at some luxury car or perfume ads. Make about 3 rolls of film. <br /> < br /> 4. Photoshop to play the results with saturation, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now get out your movie camera, film 40 of the best pictures and let your "actors" theirs Murmuring Lines Off Screen Do not worry about writing it in advance - just let the actors say what they want ( Lines like "Would you like to have a drink?" And "Let's eat something" are really all you need to fill up about 8 minutes). If you can not think of enough dialogue - no problem! Just let them repeat what they say a few times. If that's still not enough, let the camera still run. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! Static images are compressed to zero using standard MPEG encoding - a 73-minute movie would likely be 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.
