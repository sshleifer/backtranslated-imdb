Kasparov vs. Undoubtedly, Deep Blue is a fascinating story, but I do not think you would know if you watch this movie. I think it's focusing too much on the conspiracy theory that cheated on IBM ... and what does that theory refer to? The idea that the computer eventually made a move that looked "human". I am not a chess grandmaster or computer scientist. And while I do not doubt that the train looked human, it does not seem impossible to me that the most powerful computer ever to play chess could make a startling move ... or that such a machine could beat Even a genius like Kasparov. The film gets far too much from this theory and not enough from the personalities of the people involved ... that could have led to a much more interesting story. The direction also depends too much on the notions of a senselessly whispered narrative and the imagery of an eighteenth-century chess game machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy fortune tellers you see at carnival. The story was also slowed down by many blank shots of Kasparov revisiting "The Crime Scene". I do not doubt that Kasparov and the chess community found IBM's behavior annoying, but I do not think it's anything else than other big companies. At the end of the movie, you feel like Kasparov is a huge crybaby and Deep Blue programmers are either victims or cheaters. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he would have had to put forward much more evidence. In fact, more evidence would have been a good idea at all. The whole thing left a sour taste in the mouth.
