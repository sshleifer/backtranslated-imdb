Unlike some reviews written here, I did not hate this movie. It's a movie THAT COULD MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS. Not Oscar material, true, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good catch and a good line. Granted, this movie was badly written. And TERRIBLY directed and produced. I mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of the opening sequence? It seems like the producers have seen American Beauty a few times too many times and thought I'll use that in an action movie! I thought the movie was not played so badly. Wesley Snipes has done a credible job, moving in a bad direction. And as soon as this movie reached the production room, it got even worse. I think the lead actress had the same problems. Some of the other actors were suspicious, yes, but it was a cheap movie. Again, I would say that the director's job is to figure that out and correct it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I would agree with the first review I've read that this movie is not worth watching. Or maybe it's worth seeing if you're a film student and want to see what NOT to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and that gives him praise.
