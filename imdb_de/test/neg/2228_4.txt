Anyone who criticizes The Sopranos for their stereotypical portrayals of Italians have not seen anything until they get a good look at this Cornball gangster movie, which focuses on a family so irritating that they are almost robbed. > <br /> The parents in this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - one with a brat and a mischievous-cute guy - are unbearable, while their older, useless son and daughter Pollyanna are competitive for contempt audience. But the grandfather of all is, well, the grandfather. As played by Chic Sale (in "Dag-nabbit!" Mode), he serves as the film's moral compass and throws in a lot of diatribes about "Dang, Dirty Aliens." If these are the good guys, it's no wonder the performers of the time, the villains, became the big stars. <br /> <br /> Not that there are any outstanding performances among the criminal actors, but at least they are looking forward to you better than the scraping Leeds family. The incompetent police officers are not even given enough time to keep screwing things down. Only Walter Huston as district attorney raises the clich√© of tidy material in his futile attempts to give these fools a certain steadfastness. This is a very popular formula that silences the witness and does not twitch in the portrayal of the harsh life of the underworld, but there is just simply better and less xenophobic examples in the genre.
