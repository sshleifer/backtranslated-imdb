This diluted snoring for 2.5 hours seems to be one of the poorest excuses for an adjustment. With a budget enabling a stunning location for shooting locations in Greece, the funds might have been better spent creating a coherent script with character development and motivations that are clearly outlined. Especially as the bill had the trouble to do so already. The depictions lacked passion and focus, so the viewer debated whether he should even care about the demise of the protagonists. highlighting another point - the main character of the original work, prospero, is not so named in this rendition, though the names of most other characters are used. Enchantment and magic are also missing in this piece. In fact, all the aspects that triggered the stage version of "the storm" full of amazement and intrigue were completely sucked from this intricate version of a selfish, pompous ass that can not figure out how to take care of the blur of its wealth and his power. All in all a faint effort and a brutally bad imitation of the intended inspiration.
