My summary refers to the fact that this movie has 1479 votes - just under 21 to put it on IMDb's infamous bottom 100 list - the 100 lowest-rated movies on the site. With a rather sparse score of just 1.8, this would put the movie at around 38 # 46 on the list - speak of a very dubious performance! My score of 3 is not that bad - but it brings the movie much closer to the dreaded list. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, he plays the once-cute Aaron Carter - another prepackaged and memorable pop star of the 1990s. When he first broke into the scene, he was a sweet kid with some songs that addressed Pre-Teens and Tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs, looks and image have been meticulously cared for by marketers and created and executed the trick - resulting in a considerable sales of albums. Unfortunately sales were down in 2005 and Carter had reached his difficult phase in life - something that ALL children of his age will eventually have to cope with. To put it simply, he is no longer sweet in this film and is in a very difficult stage of life. I'm assuming that he's a beautiful young man ... but in "Popstar" he's not the heart-beating he once was. Here he is just normal ... a death sentence for a child in his position as a "pop sensation". Interestingly, the film has some appearances from other ex-teen heartbeats from the past few decades - including roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two men who also know what it's like to disappear out of the limelight. Cassidy has managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after fame was a joke. Hopefully, Carter will be off to Cassidy in the future, and luckily he has managed to avoid the negative advertising and the appearance of ex-pop idols. I was not so enthusiastic about the movie, but I wish him all the best in this department. It is not his fault that he was plastered on radio and television from the beginning to the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Carter does not have to straighten out - he plays a pop star. Although he has earned millions and is worshiped by girls, he does not have "everything." He is pretty dense - mainly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides not to visit him at home, forcing him to go to public school. The problem, though, is that he's pretty phobic when taking tests ... and creating school grades at school is difficult. So he comes up with the idea to find a clever girl who would of course be obliged to help him in school. He selects the cute, but bookish Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt for this scheme to work. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this action is not bad and could even work. However, it seems to be an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon sitcom. Sure, it's predictable and you KNOW that the formula means that at some point it will experience its conspiracy and be hurt AND eventually it will find that it actually takes care of you AND be a true couple by the end of the movie. But with good acting and expert guidance, this might be worth a visit for his teenage fans, as predictability is not always bad. And it turned out that this was not exactly the place where the plot went, but it was awfully close. <br /> <br /> There are some good things I liked about the movie. It was very nice to see Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens play Jane's grandparents - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. The 1970s movie TV star Andrew Stevens also appeared in the movie - it was nice to see him again - though a part of me hated him because he looks so great after all these years and I always have something from my 45s See years! He did a good job and it was nice to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As for Carter, with his many previous experiences on television, he was not surprisingly pretty good. Although his relationship with Jane did not seem very credible, he and Mrs. Austin did their best. The movie was not great, but they tried, and I think most of the problems with the movie were in writing - it could have worked much better with a better and less formal plot. In addition, the overall "testophobia" angle seemed pretty elaborate ... and rather insignificant. Who cares if a mega millionaire star is worried about school testing ?! Overall, not a lazy movie, as the current review would mean, although there is not much here to attract a broad audience. People who loved Carter will probably enjoy the movie. Older people will probably be less interested than really young people who probably have not heard of him yet. For them there is no nostalgia value in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett gives advice to Aaron. I felt like screaming "Do not listen !!" but not!
