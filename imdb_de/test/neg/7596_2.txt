This was a failure in many ways. The film locations in Ireland, although sometimes pretty, can not save this uninspired movie. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul are not interesting characters when the couple, trying to get their marriage back on track and inherit a persecuted villa, are not interesting characters. At the end of the movie, Paul gets incredibly annoyed and you wish she'd just shut up and shut up, as it looks like she's screaming like it's just been an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning ladies and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing, naked body. Although the woman is doing quite well, she does not do anything storyal. It is believed that the production team had to fill up for a short period of time and just put in some padding and a little T and A. The CGI effects are also cartoonish and the rival of the fiery final rival, Roger Corman, much earlier The far superior movie The Fall Of The House Of Usher in all its inefficient cheapness. Any attempt of true tension and tension, and as a result of chills, is thrown out of the window in this cheap bust. If you like pictures of Ireland, you can find something here, but you would be better off renting or buying a travelogue. Skip this unless you are non-discriminatory and think the action is secondary. Rent another low-budget ghost story (if you can find it) titled The Woman In Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. This was a missed opportunity.
