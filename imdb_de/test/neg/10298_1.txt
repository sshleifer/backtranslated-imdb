I do not know what today's moviegoers expect, but after 68 years watching a movie .. (Well, maybe I did not see a lot of movies in the first 9-10 years, so I'm 58 years watching movies), not bored with tears Attacked by constant obscenity (any other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented for no other purpose than to show blood spatter and crush body parts. Surveillance is one of those films made by people who have NO fantasy, little or no talent, the total inability to combine scenes, and the unreasonable ability to keep a scene going for a long time. That anyone would ever think that this would be a worthwhile movie if Hollywood trash is not anymore. As a combat veteran, I have seen violence, blood and blood in many forms, and films like We were Soldiers are about as violent as a movie, but it has a redeeming value. The monitoring must have been conceived by people in drug-induced anesthesia, without writing skills, without management training, without experience in film work and without any contact with reality. Just a stupid movie about two serial killers pretending to be FBI agents and setting up a scenario to kill stupid police, etc. An expensive piece of rubbish that only an idiot might like ...
