This was really the most painful experience I've had in a movie theater for quite some time. I will refrain from light criticism such as "maudlin" or "historically inaccurate" or "shit of horses", as our sympathies would then easily come across these words. If a director wants to make a grandiose love epic, then do it for heaven's sake. MAKE A REAL DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC! Why should we deal with such ridiculously unconvincing harlequin romance novels and such boring substitutions between characters who are less important to us when the decisive battle takes place on Canadian soil? And for the pompous people who think, "Well, this story has to center the characters!" Well, you are wrong, absolutely wrong.
