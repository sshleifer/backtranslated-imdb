J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... crap, crap, ... <br /> Mega-Crap There is a tribute (un / intended) to the Coen brothers ... bad made. <br /> There is no real mystery about the plot. <br /> <br /> The performance of Diaz is completely uninspired. <br /> <br /> The quirky characters do not really work. <br /> <br /> There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I love black comedy, but this movie is not funny. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it was not like that > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / > There are many movies in this genre that are much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> I hope you find this review helpful.
