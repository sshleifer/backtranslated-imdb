The film story seems to have come from a disconnected dream. There is not enough realism to arouse the viewer's interest. The Vermont Farm scene was a failed opportunity to show how farms were set up and farm families lived, which would have been interesting and entertaining. There was little or no research into whiskey trading in bootlegging at the time. The costumes of the Canadians looked like something out of the French Revolution, absolutely incredible. The violin playing was good and out of time, but Chris' movements during the alleged game were incredible. The owl's appearance was a never-told riddle and the train vanishing in the air was too much. I could not understand how a live trout was frozen in the ice and why two men in the wild would release the trout without food, a good source of food.
