This movie looked like it came out for some reason. By no means a well-made movie. So incredible! The scenes in which the President (Holbrook) was in the city center and walked among the people were a farce. There is no chance that the ordinary people in this situation will be within 30 meters of the President in real life. If it was not for blood and worldliness, it was filmed like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (president) talents have never been realized in this film. Shatner's acting is okay. The production values ​​in this film leave something to be desired. Overall, I think most people are better off not wasting time watching this issue.
