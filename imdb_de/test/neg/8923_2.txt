I usually spend almost as much time writing reviews as I do the movie, but with Today You Die, I feel like this is a criminal waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So here's a five-minute talk about how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> In the mid 80's there was a time when a look from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs. a full, dark look could knock you off your feet. If he actually caught you, he'd grab you like a branch. <br /> <br /> Although he is still able to inflict significant damage, he can not look today. He has gone to seed and just does not know when to stop. He walks as though he's thrown in the pants, but still manages to look stuffy, and he has gained weight. His characteristic long ponytail has disappeared, but his hair still looks stupid. How this man continues to work in the film industry is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Today, You Die is the usual Seagal mix of bone-fending battles, car accidents, gun battles and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles through the boring writing and delivers his lines without enthusiasm or credibility. In this third-rate action movie, he plays Harlan Banks, a thief trying to go straight ahead, who is involved in a $ 20,000,000 raid. He gets caught, goes to jail, escapes and seeks revenge. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good chases and gun battles poking through the boring stuff (of which there are many), but reading other comments in IMDb has shown that they were actually better borrowed from other films. Seagal is also very doubled in this case. <br /> <br /> Seagal becomes one of the most terrifying performances of his career - and that says something, considering that in some of his films only 'acting' acts recent efforts. The weirdest thing is his totally embarrassing attempt at Ebonics (African American street singing). 'I da man, fo' sho 'no, actually Steven, you sound like an ass! With a ridiculous script and plotting lines that go nowhere, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. And the last moment that Harlan Banks rescues a children's home from closure is enough to blow chunks. Damn, I just looked at the clock. I enjoyed destroying that steaming pile so much that I left my five minutes far behind me. It's time to post this comment and look at something decent.
