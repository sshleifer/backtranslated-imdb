This morning I unexpectedly remembered that this movie existed. I thought, "Oh yes, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, right?" This is all the more surprising as I recall the controversy surrounding this film (the advocacy group for the visually impaired said it was depressing). I even saw this movie on the opening day because I'm a fan of both Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, and thought it would be an excellent choice for Mr. Magoo. I even remember the animated opening credits because I thought they were pretty amusing. <br /> <br /> But after that everything is completely empty. I think it's a pretty sad statement about any movie that he's so lame, so bland and so completely without merit that you can not remember EVERYTHING. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known to appear in world-class comedies, but I've seen him in "Spy Hard" in "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3". None of these movies was great, but at least I remember * something *. Mr. Magoo, however, is a complete blank. <br /> <br /> I wonder now if all the controversy surrounding the movie was not really created by the studio it was produced in, hoping to at least generate some slight interest in an otherwise totally worthless one Movie.
