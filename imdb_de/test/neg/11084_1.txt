The movie looks like this: Run around, run around, kill someone, freak out a lot and then one of the groups calls "Pull it together" or "Just calm down!" Repeat this as often as there are signs. In between, enjoy a blank black screen. These are not fast but for several seconds. I've always thought about what a waste of film was every time it happened - yes, it happens more than once, if you can believe it. <br /> <br /> I notice that others mentioned "Blair Witch" and that reminded me of the way the camera was bubbling, but this film is extreme. Each time the characters move, the camera jumps. Sometimes so much that you can not think about what you see, it brings us to the light, in some areas too dark. I try to make us feel like we're in a cave, but Helllloo ... I look Watch a movie here, it would be nice to see you. <br /> <br /> Then there is the end. I actually shouted loudly, "Are you kidding me?!" (I also looked alone). Stupid stupid. I think the end was the sheer effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us with so-called "twist" after such a long time of boredom. At this point in the movie you could have seen the "monster" when it came to his nose, and it would be a downside to a "turn". Really terrible. You were warned.
