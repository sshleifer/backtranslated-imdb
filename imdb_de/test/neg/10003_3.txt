Brass pictures (films are not an appropriate word for it) are a bit brassic. Their seductive visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high quality TV commercials. But unfortunately brass images are feature films with the aim of entertaining viewers for over two hours! They fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather softer and spongier than earthy erotic character. Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of meaningless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian War of Independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th to the 20th century, to be precise, there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the ragged costume of the partisans. But it's just a showcase, the historical context is completely irrelevant. Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls in love with the amoral SS man who always wears too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well educated Italian actress and well above the material. Her multiple facial expressions (boredom, disgust, joy, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to see this picture and are worth two stars. She endures this basically dirty stuff with an amazing dignity. I wish some really good parts would come along. She really deserves it.
