"Committed," as in Heather Graham, who has pledged to save her husband / wife, and then becomes committed to it in a psychiatric ward when this is not the case: what a clever, clever use of words. <br /> <br /> One of these senseless wool films are philosophical films in which the narrative is a series of oh-so-wise observations bordering on poetry ('90s club poetry, better known as' Chit-Chique -Poetry"). Oh, it's so je-ne-sais-quoi ... Written / directed (or "auteured") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are), this is a pointless, lethargic-led road movie full of New Old spiritualistic nonsense and characters that should be interesting, but only seen or dull. The Latinos in this film, as part of the poor urban minority, are typically glorified in their mystic-obsessed primitivism as a "mentally superior" people, which is the "highlight" of the political correctness of this film. <br /> <br The whole thing is lifeless and stops being only when occasional good performers appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, who is one of the best examples of why nepotism equals first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a lean, ugly idiot walking sleepily through his lines, almost as if he were expressing her in a half-awake quasi-dream, with that faint voice, one of the weakest male voices I've ever heard in my life. (He must have gone to Tobey Maguire's Lethargy School Of Acting.) To speak to this idiot in EVERYTHING, he speaks volumes about EVERY movie; So Lisa Krueger is a talentless waste of space. We also have this idiot who had the lead role in the MST3K fake "werewolf"; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Look at his ridiculous accent and the silent speech.
