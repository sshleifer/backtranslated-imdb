The movie was disappointing. I saw it with Bernadette Peters on Broadway and she was outstanding. Perhaps, while she holds herself at the end of her musical career, she brings her desperation into the role that she flaunts, reinvents, and triumphs into her own. Bettes' song is always belted, always flat, and he does not lack the ability to show her acting skills. To be entertaining, this performance was squandered for stronger leadership and a stronger cast so that the others would be remembered in bed's absence. Another criticism: She always smiles directly into the camera when she starts to sing! I know it's a music theater, but please leave some grace - Middler can not perform like Liza or Streisand in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
