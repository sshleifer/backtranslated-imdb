"Hero and the Terror" is a pretty boring thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable conspiracy and ... boring. For a thriller, I found that this movie was slow to its miserable climax, as it only seemed to drag on until Chuck's baby was born ... and then he drags himself to the end, which I barely remember although I only saw the movie ten minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 - for the first 10 to 20 minutes.
