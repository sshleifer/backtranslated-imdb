I have to admit right away that I have not seen the whole movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers summarize this nicely. It was poorly designed. Badly written Badly traded. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire movie, apparently synchronized, sounded like a garage. There was a voluminous echo in the words that served to bring the bad dialogue to a standstill. And hang. And hang. Even a film produced for television would have to recognize this. <br /> <br /> And the idea that other dimensions differ by color saturation went out in the 80s, folks.
