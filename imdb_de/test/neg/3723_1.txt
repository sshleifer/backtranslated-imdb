WARNING! SPOILER! This movie is absolute crap. It is not a conversation. I can not describe the words to describe the disgust I felt in the end. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie about the scum of society. Throughout the movie, I've always been waiting for it to get better. Did not do it instead it got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie as bad as this one, I always try to find at least one good thing. In this case, it proved impossible. I have nothing good to say. How bad did it get? Well, here's an example: In the end, Dan Akroyd suffocates Vincent D'Onofrio and kills him while Reeves and Diaz watch! This is not a conversation!
