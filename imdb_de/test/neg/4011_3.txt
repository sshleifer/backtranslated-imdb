I saw the last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most famous or worst director of all time. This show, despite its "starpower", is by no means compulsory, and its political insights that I, as a proud liberals, in no way agree with, are flat and clumsy and, despite everything, seem to have been torn from the headlines of USA Today it comes from the mouth of a man who is as appreciated as Mario Cuomo. The drama itself is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny. The only interesting points are really to see how the New Yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and a crew to put together a show that always insists on has cult status from 1988. Sometimes it seems like Altmans The only way to let the cinema speak The art of having all your actors speak at once feels depressing, as if they were a stranger to a wedding.
