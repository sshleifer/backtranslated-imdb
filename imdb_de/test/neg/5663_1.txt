Have you ever gone to Youtube? Well, the final question is YES. See the boatloads of ICarly and Nickelodeon? No clear answer. <br /> <br /> Many people think that ICarly is a boring and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on Earth. I've seen many of the many reviews that swing ICarly in the head, and some give him a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for the little ones, but the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> If you did not read the last review, there are reasons 1-8: # 1: Stery Types # 2: Goofed-up drama # 3: Everything is Stupid (Taco Truck for example) # 4: Carly thinks she's nice, but she's mean # 5: Anyone who has passed the drinking age is stupid # 6: Sam is short but strong? # 7: No real companies # 8: Middle teachers <br /> <br /> # 9: The web show uses 3DFX. Just check the webshow for what I mean. # 10: The web show also spills personal information. # 11: Almost every famous thing is offended. Icarly insults the Japanese breed Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man, just to name a few. # 12: There are too many recurring jokes (Sams meat obsession, Freddy's computer, Gibby takes off his shirt, etc.). # 13: The video games based on the show are shitty. # 14: Freddy has a lack of masculinity. Why? It will be unoriginal. # 15: The show is aimed at a female audience. I also hate shows that are aimed at a male audience, so I prefer that Icarly is for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: The excessive use of salmon traces. <br /> <br /> Part 3 is coming in early spring! Just in time for spring break!
