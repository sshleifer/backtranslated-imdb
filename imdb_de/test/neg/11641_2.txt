Why are not there good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Housed in a Japanese prison camp during World War II, we have Jim Brown as a hero accepting a hysterically incredible racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way. The Japanese officer brews Jim Brown's nose. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie any of these actors ever did. Clich√©s are not only in abundance, but they dominate this movie. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best thing about the movie, maybe because it has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> It's even hard to sit back and enjoy some pointless fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism he tries to convey. And believe me, I lived in the seventies, and we thought crap like this was just as stupid at the time. It was never popular.
