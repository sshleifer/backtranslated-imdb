For those of you who have never heard of the movie (which I suspect are many lucky people who have not), I'll summarize it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the title character of Leland, who also serves as the narrator of the film (a la Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations of life). Leland goes to jail for stabbing a backward child, and the movie tries to figure out why he did it. He seems to be a nice boy (though not mentally absent) and is portrayed by Gosling with complete nonviolence, anger or aggression (and if you wait for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie, don.) Do not waste yours Time - it's not a kind of movie. Once in a juvenile detention center, Leland goes to lessons with Pearl Madison, skilfully portrayed by Don Cheadle (who is capable of nothing but quality, even in bad movies). Pearl tries to decode the mystery of Leland to find out how such a child can do such a thing, and he could later write a book about it (besides being a junior prison teacher, Pearl is also an aspiring writer). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving narrative behind the film, as their talks reveal the past of Leland to the public. To call it a central focus, however, would mean that this snaking film had one. It does not. The United States of Leland has an impressive cast that impacts the film. It seems as if author / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (do not worry that you've heard nothing from him, he's never done anything) had to give each character a personal story arc and a personality flaw to make the actors do it to play . Most of these features and stories are stereotyped and most are underdeveloped and unresolved. I'll try to tear her down here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the slain retarded boy (I love.) As the movie always called the child "retarded", never "mentally disabled" (this part made me laugh inside brought), they seem to have a cold relationship, since all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema must be cold. Her other two children are Michelle Williams, who seems to be an aspiring actress who just wants to attend college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same troubled teenage archetype she always plays, this time with a heroin addiction. Malone was also the friend of Leland, who gives him the connection to his victim. Williams's friend, who was orphaned and lived with the family and is a baseball player who wants to go to the same college as his girlfriend, is played by Chris Klein. In the end, he does more with his character than any other bit player, and sometimes manages to steal the movie. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who for some reason always seems to be sad. Kevin Spacey (also the executive producer) is Leland's cold and absent father, a famous writer. At some point, Sherilyn Fenn will turn up to wrestle Leland - if you even care about it. Oh yes, and there's an ex-drug trafficker, a couple of co-workers, and a co-worker with Pearl, with whom he has a relationship with his long-distance friend (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if all the summary and character break took so long. If it was meaningless and boring, then in the 108 minutes I watched the movie, you learned a bit about what I did. But the unruly cast of overwrought stereotypes is the lesser crime of this film. The biggest thing is that the whole exercise is completely pointless. We do not get a fascinating look into a troubled mind, we do not get an effective explanation, we do not get much of everything. Given that it was so shitty, I'll spoil your end, so you'll never have to see it: Leland stung the delay, because all that Leland could see in the world was sadness and Corky (or like that the name of the victim, the sadness in his eyes, it's like the worst emo band in the world that made an album and titled "The world is sad, so I killed a retard." Oh and Leland ends up dying in a sequence that is so incredibly contingent on incredible coincidences that it would have ruined the film if the film had not already shit, and of course it will die in the end because that made the movie so deep br /> <br /> I give the film 2 stars because the actors did a pretty good job with the junk they got, and the scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting on some levels to formulate himself However, one has to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts, Kiddo.
