If you've seen this movie, you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who knew they would copy Terminator 2? The difference between the two film industries is that Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood 100 thousand (average). That's the problem with this movie. If you want to create a movie in T2 style, do it right. The director added a fake fantasy story about a reincarnated serpent declaring his long-lost girl (in the previous birth) dead by two men, but the blame is 10 people. She is suddenly reincarnated into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people who blame her for her death. Not to mention that the reincarnated contortionist or villain has superpowers. He can turn into anything, he can fly, disappear, firepower, wind power, you name it, he has it. He even bazooker and survives the T1000 style. You're probably wondering how he survives. It is best not to ask, and it is best not to waste time and money on this film. It's best to forget that this movie even came out. I find it a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a nonsensical plot.
