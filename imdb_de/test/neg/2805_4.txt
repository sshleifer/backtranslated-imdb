I expected a comedy about the NVA, but this is a parody. It shows the eastern national army in a light that is inappropriate and definitely not true. <br /> <br /> You can make a comedy about anything, as long as the underlying facts do not change. Even a comedy about the German concentration camp is possible, as Roberto Benigni has shown with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". <br /> <br /> The movie NVA would be an "OK" comedy as the jokes are OK overall. Nothing special - not funny, but enough to live with. <br /> <br /> The point is that the movie is making a farce and a parody about the NVA. A death machine that was ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE along with her boyfriend RED ARMY. An institution that did everything to get the most out of their soldiers. An army that invaded the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march in Poland as well to destroy the SOLIDARNOSC. You can not make a movie without showing the slightest evil, or would you make a parody about a concentration camp, Guantanamo or 9/11? Osama bin Laden as a funny guy show? 90 minutes through a funny Osama in an Afghan Taliban camp where he makes jokes and trains his soldiers would be comparable to what this film does to the NVA!
