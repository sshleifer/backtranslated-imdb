Attention: this may include SPOILER !! <br /> <br /> First of all, I watch a lot of Lifetime Movies and realize that they are just that ... Lifetime Movies. Some are great, some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the latter category. It actually started with some potential ... A single, divorced, hard working mother (who gets unemployed at 2am) interrupts a man who drives home from work and let's just say he does not take it well. The persecution begins immediately with the placing of calls and escalates to her house, which is broken into her house and completely destroyed. So she goes to her mother for the night and the next morning the car blows up her mother. This seems to be a nuisance to our hero, who is busy doing underwear and shopping for jewelry !!! So the police took her and her son to a local motel for storage and what's Mom doing? She goes to work leaving the boy alone in a foreign motel room at night and asks him to order a PIZZA !!! I could not believe it Then it gets really stupid! And the end just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad, because it seemed to have possibilities.
