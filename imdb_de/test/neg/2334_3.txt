How long do we still have to stick to this erroneous belief that if a director has done a great, groundbreaking work, all future work "can not be so bad, after all, he did it." <Br /> <br /> The Mulholland Drive is a typical example and is indeed a genuine trash. The performances are excellent, especially by Watts and Theroux, but a good movie they do not necessarily do. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that merely producing a movie works only when it surprises the audience. If the audience expects the film to make no sense, the film must have some substance to interest the audience. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the murder mystery set up with lots of twists and red pegs and then ... plop! The story becomes a swamp of bizarre halucinations and pointless sections. Knowing how confused the film became, Methink's Lynch threw the lesbian and masturbation scenes in front of the audience to keep the male onlookers from getting up and walking. <br /> <br /> I was surrounded by lynchophiles who had no idea what was going on, but I had the theater comment on the "layers and layers" of Lynch's film making. Excuse me, but these people are the same idiots who stand in art galleries staring at white painted canvases in which they comment on "the artist's courage in painting such a bold piece of work." <br/> made because (a) Lynch is acting on his previous work; and (b) because people are convinced that an incomprehensible film is art and must therefore be good. I asked a number of the lynchophiles what they really liked in the movie, and the only answer I got that was not a broad "shift" was that they liked it when the "chicks were taking their kit". <BR /> Nuff said.
