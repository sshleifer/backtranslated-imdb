OK, I'm 26, so I went through all the hype of the action heroes of the 80s, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme, and the rest of the guys were my heroes from my childhood. They fought the bad guys and shot dozens of bullets out of a round one;) I saw the commercial of this movie on TV a few days ago - Chuck Norris threw some fireballs from his fingers. WHOA! "That's an absolute must!" I said. And it really was like that. Only much worse. It's very difficult to see the entire movie - filled with religious thoughts, ridiculous, zombie-like monsters serving Satan, all the idea of ​​a conspiracy being portrayed in a forgotten community representing all humanity - a load of Christian fundamentalists wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, not even in the movies, but it lacks taste, almost everything that is common sense is missing. Come on, Chuck Norris plays an ANGEL. Whose job is it to look after a small town where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damned straightforward and boring, not to mention their stupidity (yes, it's no stupidity anymore, we're talking about stupidity like ... like a backward kidnapping), making a horrible movie as a whole, as far as I'm concerned for the older ones People think People are very much devoted to the Catholic Church, because young audiences laugh at almost every scene. Technically it's wrong, the effects are worse than the ones you saw in TV shows in the early 90's. The action seems VERY stupid, actors could easily be exchanged for cardboard stands without mentioning the music, as far as I've heard played on a childish toy piano. I've seen a lot of movies, even the worst (from the IMDb list below), like 'Space Mutiny' or 'Manos - Hands of Fate'. But I think nothing compares to this ridiculous, horrible, terribly restrained quasi. A film that introduces me to some of the films by pupils and not the regular production. Avoid it. At all costs avoid it. There's nothing to laugh about. Chuck Norris has officially ended his film career.
