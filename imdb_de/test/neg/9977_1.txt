I'm almost ashamed to see CALIGULA twice. Production problems are almost too numerous to mention. The script is below average (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to ignore it). The direction is worse. The film consists for the most part of long shots, in which close-ups are inserted with cross sections of mostly non-erotic porn (obviously more common in the "uncut" version). The cinematography is particularly unsurpassed and gives the entire production a cheap, washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate stage designs. The film should have looked much better. The overall concept of placing a name actor in a film that would easily have been an X-rated film (Guccione called it "paganography") becomes thin after the first hour after the departure of Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud. Obviously Bob Guccione wasted a lot of money on that, but it all seems to be a big waste. If you want a better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, then check out the BBC production of I, CLAUDIUS, from the mid-'79s ... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look elsewhere ,
