Of all the directors who ever sat behind a camera, Wellman could break your heart faster than anyone else. Even Ford. But that's one of his worst. Even he seemed to know, probably from his Jejune treatment, not much about a bonanza or a big valley. <br /> <br /> There is a moment, however, a typical Wellman coming out of nowhere to shake you, the death of Gable's Indian wife. She's gone to give her baby some water, and WHAM is immediately killed by an arrow. No warning. Nada <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinemas. Especially after spending an entire hour of love for the lady in a juicy western. Of course, the treatment of her is apparently burdened with Wellman's utter indifference to the film. Nevertheless, it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.
