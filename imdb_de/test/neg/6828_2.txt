"How many people know about it?" ... "Let it stay that way!" I wonder if at least some new dialogues can be made or not? The movie is a really bad copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably half-asleep this movie. The way he looks cold-blooded at Richard Gere's face when they meet near the port ... oh my god! scared me to hell. I do not know why he kills Major Koslova and her comrades. Another thing I could not understand was the poison solution he put on the car (what was that in the world?). <br /> <br /> The movie action is confused and the climax boring. Another funny thing was how the Russian was killed in the club. I fell laughing from my chair when I saw this scene. And what was that gay guy? What purpose did he have? I think the movie is too fast to be easy to understand. You really have to think about what the director had in mind. LOL. <br /> <br /> And the best scene was after all Richard Gere, who tried to keep the column between two fast-moving trains. must have made someone loose, if he does not come into contact with the pillar.
