I live in Mexico City, so for every garbage that comes from all those stupid Mexican filmmakers, I have to suffer from the followers. You want to admire a Mexican for great movies? Take a look at Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone) or Alfonso Cuar√≥n (though I really do not like his films, but I respect them). Mexican filmmakers often produce the most gruesome garbage ever (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, and American Visa), but this is one of the lowest scores in Mexican films ever. If you respect your brain, avoid this piece at all costs. It would be smarter to watch a video of a wedding or to see Britney's reality show. This has more IQ than anyone in this "movie".
