A conspiracy that is incredible. However, one has to admit that the main actors play their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And that is how it is supposed to be. It is not their fault that the author seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Hats off to a really smart performance by Joanna Kerns. She proves that only if she is not on the side, a role can not be taken. And that makes them enthusiastic. Good for you. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Christine Elise, who is said to be little more than confused and weepy, but goes well beyond what the script demands. <br /> <br /> And also Grant Show. A graduate of daytime and main time soaps (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). He is always versatile and undervalued. Its main drawback seems to be its impossible-to-ignore good looks. He is a robust, well grounded actor who is capable of more than he normally has the opportunity to do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is basically a showcase. <br /> <br /> The direction It is appropriate and the screenplay is, as I have suggested, quite idiotic. <br /> <br /> Watch this video to see three star performers enjoying some of the much needed sceneries. It is fun.
