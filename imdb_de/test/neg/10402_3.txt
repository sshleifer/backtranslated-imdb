Fear and longing are of particular interest to Kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this presumptuous gossip trap for signs of its still great size. Kubrick was right to make sure the film was not shown or available as a legitimate video. He thought it was embarrassing and amateurish, and he was right in his assessment. This is a weak and boring movie - at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "Barry Lyndon"! - Yet it is of historical interest and has its real exciting moments. It's a hard-to-find movie (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), though that may change as Kubrick's estate gives in and releases on video. Only recommended for Kubrick fans.
