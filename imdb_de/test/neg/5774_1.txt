And unfortunately me too. ANY is a film that needs a bad pun, as its slogan or title should be banned from the $ 2.00 levy, but we decided to try a second bad movie for the movie night. We had a winner in "House of the Dead" - join in if you want to make a ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> A witch jumped into the water after being set on fire by Mr. Miner. A guy has made a dump in the forest. And the same guy has bought a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. I do not remember much anymore. The last third of the film was completely bland and we all waited until the end in agony.
