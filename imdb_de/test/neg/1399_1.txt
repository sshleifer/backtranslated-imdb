This is one of the most ridiculous westerns Hollywood has ever made. Gary Cooper plays "Reb Hollister," a former Confederate officer wanted by law. He meets an idiot named Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, a US marshal with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancé Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tony's father, has many husbands, but they do not seem to be able to keep an eye on his livestock, which is regularly roared by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, has funded the loan on Robles' property, which made things completely absurd. He even has the power to request mortgage payments before they are due, simply because he feels like it. <br /> <br /> Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can not fight since he was just a marshal he could visit his fiancé Tonia. (Just another example of more conspiracy, assuming you just have to pass a written test to get this job, wait a minute, this guy can not pass the written test.) He changes identity with Reb Hollister, of course, an accomplished shooter. Reb takes the liberty to greet Weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's # 1, is in best form here as Reb. Before the movie is finished, he not only takes on Weatherby's job, he also steals his fiancee, and Ruth Roman as Tonia falls so hard on him and so fast that she draws little more than half from the tramp Leif Erickson before the movies over. <br /> <br /> There is no trace of plot credibility throughout the movie, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the movie is a breeze. And Cooper's character is a complete heel. The film also features Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow's Girl, a beautiful and talented actress who unfortunately wastes her chances by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I strongly recommend that you give this up here.
