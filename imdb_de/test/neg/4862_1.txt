Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang all had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as Callow Naif on Wall Street or Sutherland as a cynical Korean war surgeon in MASH? Waterston and Lang both had successful TV and film careers (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc.). So, what on earth would one of those good actors do in such a stink bomb? Shadow Conspiracy's plan for a coup in Washington is not that bad, unoriginal, maybe, but not so bad. Surely it has been done (Seven Days in May - a good movie!), But with a few minor changes it could still have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Shadow Conspiracy is the execution. At the beginning of the film Sheen, a political strategist extreme, a ridiculous and implausible conflict triggers a potential public relations campaign by blackmailing a congressman. Later, a gunplay with Lang's mute hitman, which rips apart half of what was supposed to be Georgetown, is declared in the news as "gang wars". Has anyone remotely connected to this movie ever lived in Washington for a day? Sheen is about 20 years too young, far too young to be so high in a White House administration. Sheen's answer, to avert a political crisis, is so full of false machismo that he looks as if he had attended the drama school of David Hasselhoff. When did the last time Georgetown spread? We're talking about a section in Washington where citizens voted against a subway stop so they can maintain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would have been unbearable without the fast-forward button. I recorded it a year ago from HBO and then made three separate visits to go through. <br /> <br /> In summary: Do not buy this movie. Do not lend this movie. If you see it at Blockbuster, run away as fast as you can.
