Small spoilers <br /> <br /> First, I must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all of civilization, and women are in the making of babies. It's absolutely unbelievable how well the plot is formulated to hit those two points, like a golden gavel. Basically, everything annoyed me about this movie. The casual sexism, the character whose sole feature came from Texas, the mysterious decision to die Marsorange, and of course the faulty science of everything. Then the screaming Martian, as if she had just realized that she was blind? What was that? I will, however, acknowledge it. The fifties spat out something darker. But not much...
