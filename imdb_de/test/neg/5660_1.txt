First Off Acting is so awful, except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her own show she should have with Drake and Josh. The only person I like except Spencer is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$ He joined Carlys Crews @ $$ and I liked it <br /> <br /> The episode I hate very much is imyourbigesstfan I hate it that the young Icaly fan she almost let me kill was a fake is a good word to describe this Let's all go back to Doug Nick Version Just please do not pay attention I hate Icarly Oh Even Nathan Kress is a wannabee Fredie Highmore
