I only rated "Airport '79" with two stars because it's a really lousy movie. Nobody who has anything to do with it deserves any praise (except Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role). This does not mean that the movie is not worth watching. It is helpful if you have a buzz, but this is not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really seems an early version of "Airplane!" Each scene has a build-up and a payout, and the scenes tap sequentially as if they were completely disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, the crew and the plane can go on, no matter what. You are a news reporter and a stranger is murdered in your apartment in your presence? The hitman then chases you on your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can fly to Paris early in the morning ... you do not need to involve the police. Her aircraft evades an unmanned "drone rocket," four heat-seeking missiles, and a cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter. Drum rolls, an unmanned dive and a crash net landing without thrust reversal are carried out. No problem, the mechanics control the oil and get you in a few hours on the way. It is really funny. <br /> <br /> And I admit that there is a bit of anarchist coming out of me, when the passengers are not paying attention to the caretakers. The highlight is when the Companion Jimmie Walker says he needs to play his saxophone (God spares me before a flight sitting in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before the start. Jimmie basically says "no". Later in the flight, the saxophone is damaged, and Jimmie appears on the next flight half with another saxophone, which he can not put away. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (A passenger actually obeys the flight attendant, but when Charo is told that she can not fly her dog, she leaves the plane, of course because you can not see her ass and her breasts while she's sitting.) <br /> <br /> In summary, a horrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and performers deserve no recognition for it, as they were probably completely unintentional.
