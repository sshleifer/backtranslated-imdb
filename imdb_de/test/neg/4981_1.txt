I remember watching the very first Underdog trailer last March. I also remember the time when I smiled so lightly. Sure, it was a cheesy idea, but I really thought, at the time the concept could work, the hell it could not be worse than the disappointing cats and dogs, right? Then in December and I suddenly remembered the movie, realizing how likely it was that the movie sucked. The fact that he had been delayed in the UK made it inevitable that it would be terrible for the movie to be good. Nevertheless, I swallowed my feelings and looked at the film with a friend today. When I stepped on my screen, I was hurt. It was the first time I saw a movie with a friend and the only two of them were on screen! I did not know what I wanted to endure. It's really horrible when you look at it. Imagine how bad you could think of this movie, and then get ready for an even worse movie. So pathetic is the movie. Although it aims to entertain children, it seems to be an embarrassing mess that offends children rather than allowing them to enjoy the movie. The thing can not be helped by the fact that the story is more than dull, acting is generally bad and the movie just feels like an overly tired, boring Saturday cartoon! After five minutes of thinking the film might be passable, the movie suddenly seems to die and limps toward the already signed finale. I'm just amazed that the movie was ever released, it's an embarrassment for Disney. Even more frightening is the fact that the end leaves room for a sequel! <br /> <br /> So let's go into acting (Cracks Knuckles). Okay, let me be honest Jason Lee is decent, his voice fits the canine, and if he'd gotten a decent script, he might have done the performance. With such a dodgy script, however, he seems only to bother. In many ways, it reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield. Murray did what he could, but what he had was not enough to make it passable. Then we come to the human actors and the majority of the atrocities. Alex Neuberger plays the friend of Underdog, Jack. My biggest concern is that everyone takes him seriously at the audition. The scene in which he can fly with Underdog is perhaps the worst scene of recent years, just because he plays so badly. I did not even think he was a real person. Part of me is still convinced that he is a robot made especially for the film! James Belushi seems to be half-dead in the movie, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines, he just seems to wander around the set, waiting to become relevant to the plot, which the authors end up trying to do, but in one Fall a bad way, it's ridiculous. Luckily Peter Dinklage is the redeeming factor of the movie, he's great as a dr. Barsinister and seems to have a laugh in the role. He steals every scene he's in right now, though it's hardly difficult sharing his screen time with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the cast is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she has to end her acting career right now! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails dramatically when it comes to a fun scene. If the funniest scene is that Underdog bites a can and makes dog food explode everywhere, knowing that something is drastically wrong. This could easily be ignored if the movie had a decent action or a good story. Unfortunately, the movie is even worse on both counts. The effects are so unfavorable that every scene in which Underdog flies, just seems absurd and the dog uses his powers so little, that one often forgets that he has superpowers. What's the point of making a movie about a super dog when the damned dog never seems awesome? The last fight is also embarrassing, just because it's nothing for ten minutes, the dog is flying, other stuff is happening, some stuff is being thrown around, all of this is irrelevant as this stuff happens for the sake of the action. The script is dodgy at best, and terribly horrible at worst. If someone says, "Look, it's an airplane, no, it's a bird, no, it's a frog ...", yes, you read that right, I just wanted to break out there and then into tears. Actually, I wanted to go out, because he was forced to see if it could get deeper somewhere, this is happening towards the end, so it's not grateful. <br /> <br /> Overall, Underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 this early time and is actually as bad as last year's Epic Movie. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans is coming here soon and I expect it to get worse. In case you did not get the point of my review, avoid the movie at all costs. If you want to watch a movie with a dog, look at Cats and Dogs, buy a real dog, if you do not see it!
