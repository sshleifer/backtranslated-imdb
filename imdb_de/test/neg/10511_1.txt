It's 2005, my friends ... a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. So, why can not we see a movie that's a bit more elaborate than this cheesy low-budget movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies rock my socks, but this one ... it's almost as if it's awful. Just ... not ... watch. I can overlook the lack of special effects and computer-generated scenes when the drama itself was at least good. I feel like a little kid who has produced the whole movie. There is not even an original plotline. Vampire Assassin itself is a big plot hole in an attempt to mock oneself. Can anyone tell me if this was conceived as a comedy movie and I just did not know it? I wonder what the sequel holds for us who loved the first part so much?
