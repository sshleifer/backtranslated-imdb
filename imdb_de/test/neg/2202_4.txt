Okay ... she's on the boat with this guy, realizes that he wants to kill her, hits him down and then finds out why he's dating her, this disc that killed her colleague. So what would a reasonable person do? Maybe you'll comfort him over the head again to make sure he's really out there? Ties him ?? Look, Sandra Schatz, you have the chance to escape, as long as the guy is out so long. Until you know how long it will take you to escape, make sure that he is unable to follow you. I hate these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely complicated and too unbelievable to be interesting.
