There are bad movies, horrible films, and then there's a tiny, rare movie body that is so terribly bad that even if it's seen once, the sheer terror makes it impossible to forget it even decades later , It's just such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was really good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the cigar-maker of the "tough guy" of the original, was somehow promoted to flight captain, and after the Concorde rocket attack (do not ask), he resorts to stunts like firing a light gun out of the cockpit window, though (presumably) was flown on Mach 2, performing the wild high-G evasive maneuvers that would have demolished the wings of a real plane, no matter how the passengers operate! But the absolute worst part of the movie, at least for avid aviation fans like me, is that this cruelty was one of the coolest, sexiest and technologically most remarkable planes ever to fly. The Concorde (or just "Concorde" as their pilots refer to it) was far better off. This abomination is the equivalent of taking a first-rate beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting her in a "Porky's" episode. Fortunately, the release of the always funny "Airplane!" The following year brought the entire "Airport" franchise to a well deserved halt, as anyone who even thought of a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike. <br /> <br /> 1/10
