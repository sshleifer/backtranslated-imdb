"I have not laughed so hard since grandma got stuck in the Wringer," says one of the heads in this hilarious quasi-parody of all those Val Lewton and George A. Romero Walking Dead movies we love (or abhor ) depending on personal taste) over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young actor couple plays a scary joke on the rest of the troupe after visiting a cemetery island on a spooky night. Their artistic director, Alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life through a highly stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> Far too much screen time is out of place. The amateur dialogue contains lame jokes, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler comments (and Alan can not stop this irritating laughter ... way too much!). Once the action sets in (which comes close to ending this movie), it's worth it to wait. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a TV station that was on late night television and ran movies that were very similar ... Only this one scared me at the age of 13 ... but then Again, you might laugh your way through to the bitter end ... ... which is probably the reason that nowadays only a few people wear striped hipscreens.
