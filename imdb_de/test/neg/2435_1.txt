Usually I do not write reviews. Actually, I do not write reviews. This movie was so cruel that it really inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality tries to be a carefree and naughty teen comedy when it comes to the usual falling. Virginity, boys, and so forth, besides the main character, apparently becomes her perfect boy, whom she has created with the help of a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? Well it is not. Acting is the half-hearted and most horrible I've ever seen. The unfortunate thing is that they seem to really support the script and the movie, which probably explains why I've never seen them in a memorable production ever since. I did not bother to learn the names of the actors or their characters. The Lading Lady does not charm or enchant you and you are not interested in her. The male friend of the lead actress shows no compassion, even if the script screams loudly for you to have pity on him. The only increase he will get out of you is extreme anger and sudden violence. The only reasonably decent actor was the blonde lead actor who, despite his miserably weak role, really gave everything he could, which was not much given such terrible work. I will not even talk about the terrible spectacle that is the "bad guys" of the conspiracy. But what kind of a plot? <br /> <br /> I saw how this film unfolded in disbelief, as I had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the stupid audacity to write, produce, play and do such a screenplay conduct . I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I watched such a troubled example of the movie was the incredulous laughter that came out of us when cohesion, logic, class, and even powerless action were ignored within half an hour of the movie. I have no idea why anyone wanted to violate the film industry by making it available to the public. This is a joke of a movie and should best be accumulated in warehouses for the remainder of eternity. 1/2 of 10. If that.
