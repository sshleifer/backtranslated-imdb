I saw Heaven's Gate recently. After watching this 3 hour 40 minute western that is not western, I read Steven Bach's book. After watching all the events and the movie itself, I still think that this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that if someone asks you to look at it, you are actually trying to bore you to death. If you can enjoy that self-indulgent thought of a really bad movie, I have to ask why. Although this is no reason to hate it, it is from a historical perspective. There are plans to talk about a situation in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. The former cattle bards just wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed that they were all vermin. They think you just do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because then at least something would happen. Everyone in the movie talks about things that happen and it's never shown. After having sat through this huge waste of time, ask yourself how anyone could actually make a 4-hour epic in which nothing happens. Oh, and by the way, the Johnson County War was not a war, it never happened. In fact, the Johnson County War meant it almost happened, in effect 2 people died. I can not warn you enough about this movie. However, if you, like me, have the idea of ​​watching a movie that has ruined careers and offered United Artists for sale, that sounds like an interesting case to study. Then take a look at this terrible, narsisistic film without subtext and lots of photography (which is sometimes irritating)
