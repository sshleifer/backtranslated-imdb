Absolutely nothing is to save on all this garbage, and the only thing worse than seeing this movie is to see it in English lessons. This is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It totally ignores and contradicts all the topics it presents, so the story is really boring. Thankfully, the 80s are over and goddamn, whatever man was born as "James Bond III".
