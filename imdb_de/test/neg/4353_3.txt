Ironically, The Big Knife, a film about the downsides of the Hollywood film industry, is much more like a movie than a movie. Apart from a few very short exposure scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the hero of the movie played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants to leave his contract with his studio due to his lack of redeeming qualities in his films. His resurrected wife (Ida Lupino) is fed up with the studio, not to mention her husband. For both the boss of the studio (Rod Steiger) is unfortunately a real bastard. He has blackmailed material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it is only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This film is, I do not repeat, not a film noir. It is rather an exceptionally theatrical living room melodrama. The plot runs at a snail's pace and is so complicated and confusing that it stands in violent disharmony with the static setting and the carefully constructed blocking of the actual scenes. The acting is in extreme cases revised and changes sharply between histrionics and softer, but no less clumsy, stubborn inserts that are supposed to have a poignant effect and act as pretentious chatter, especially in the hands of the jarring Miscast Palance. Aldrich obviously chose a stylized "something," but I doubt he even knew what it was, and the audience will certainly never do it. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that there are movies and plays are very different media. What may have worked in one piece did not seem so obvious or plausible in the film. The result? A big waste of time. There is little to enjoy here.
