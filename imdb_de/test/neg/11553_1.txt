It is inconceivable to me how EVERYONE could enjoy this movie or have laughed. I would say it's the worst movie I've seen in years, and I see a lot of them. Maybe I forgot Junior High? It's also very hard to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels who performed such a brilliant performance of George Washington in The Crossing. Apparently, since he did Dumber, he went into the tank. Can you believe that he wrote and directed this trash himself?
