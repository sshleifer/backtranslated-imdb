"Congo" is based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, which I think lacked Crichton's usual charm, intelligent characters and punch. I'm sorry to say, but the same goes for the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple moral story warns. A megalomaniac C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) Sends His Son to Dangerous African Congo in search of a diamond source that is large and pure enough to act as a powerful laser communications transmitter (or laser weapon?). When contact with his son and team is lost, his daughter-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA employee and computer geek, is sent to them. On her quest, she is accompanied by Gie Whiz gadgets and some eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh) and a nutty Indiana Jones guy looking for King Solomon's Mines (Tim Curry) After some narrow escapes from ground-to-air missiles and African wildlife, they all discover that what we want most is the cause of our decline. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie were she's not talented: Dylan Walsh looks like a miserable crybaby at the end, Ernie Hudson does not convince (is it any wonder he has starred in TV movies?) and Laura Linney is nothing special For sure, the only talented actors in the film say so had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an ever entertaining actor (though he is sometimes drawn to life because he is constantly on his "Rocky Horror Picture" day e is remembered). <br /> <This film also had some other issues, including terrible directional style, cheesy dialogues, and a downright boring storyline that was completely confused compared to Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Not even Stan Winston's creature effects saved this movie from catastrophe. I am deeply disappointed with this movie. There was not even a Campy quality she could use. It was just horrible, cheesy, boring, and ridiculous, and proves to be one of the worst Crichton book-to-film productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 star - John Ulmer
