SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (United States: The Hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Stereo SR <br /> < After a series of bizarre and seemingly independent "suicides", an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) asks for the help of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes the victims made a posthypnotic suggestion. However, her subsequent research reveals an even darker work force associated with a young girl (Miho Kanno) whose life was adversely affected by sadistic abuse ... <br /> <br /> Based on a novel by Keisuke Matsuoka, this dense The plotted mystery refers to a variety of sources (Italian gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some of the images show a more immediate impact in climatic showdown: The recent commercial success of Hideo Nakata's RING (1998). Despite all its ambitions, SAIMIN is a routine potboiler that stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening (the "suicides" are particularly impressive despite some weak CGI effects), though director Masayuki Ochiai - who wrote the script with Yasushi Fukuda - suggests proceedings extended finale in which the amazing secrets of the narrative are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of the novel video game PARASITE EVE (1997), in which Inagaki (a member of the Japanese pop band SMAP) also starred, and while SAIMIN reproduces the film's strong visual appeal, it falls short like a drama, and most characters are mere ciphers that undermine the plot's emotional gain. What a pity, because the last half hour is triggered by a series of dynamic set pieces - especially a concert hall sequence in which Dvorak's symphony "New World" is transformed into a murderous instrument! - and Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. Those lured by the bloody carnage may be disappointed - the movie is long on atmospheres and short on splashes. <br /> <br /> Performances vary due to scripts limitations, but Kanno (TOMIE) is excellent As a young woman suffering from a multiple personality disorder - as the subtitles on the audited print assure us - is not considered in Japan practicable disease recognized! - The victim of a stupid television hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), a prime suspect in the murders. Inagaki is uninspired in a one-dimensional role and is constantly staged by Utsui, a veteran performer whose career goes back to the "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series of the fifties. <br /> <br /> (Japanese dialogue)
