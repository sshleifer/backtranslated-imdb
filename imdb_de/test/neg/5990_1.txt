I do not think I saw such a horror movie, hell, I do not think I ever saw such a horror movie. Acting alone was enough to make you flinch. The bad acting went far beyond the horror movie. It was just awful. And have you checked these terrible special effects? When the demon (who looked more like a cheap doll) came out of the wall, I could not say if I was scared or laughing my ass. As a big fan of the horror genre, this movie was more than slightly disappointing. I could not help but notice that the director is from Portland, OR, which happens to be my own hometown. I have to say, I am deeply ashamed. If I could, I would rate this movie negatively.
