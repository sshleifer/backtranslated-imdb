This film is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest reputation) who set off to a small fort to take over a recently abandoned uncle property in which they want to start a business. Upon arrival in a nearby town they realize that nobody will go there (although it is only 15 miles away), so they go. When they arrive there, they realize that there are no soldiers, but a large number of people who have taken over the fort and are building a small town nearby. They soon realize that something is wrong here and that Fort McMillan (Fort Doom, as the locals call it) gets into serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead of going into the storyline, I'll make some comments on the things I've noticed about the movie. First of all, acting is very shallow, few people seem to be genuine enough to believe in it. My first was bad acting, but in the end I looked at some outtakes and these people were alive. So my only thought is how the director wanted it. In addition to the bad acting, I have a big problem where people do not respond properly to certain circumstances. For example, suppose no one would take them to Fort McMillan for any price, even though it is only 15 miles away. However, when we arrive at the fort, we will find that it is well looked after by a decent population, all of whom must be cared for by someone, not to mention the post office, etc. It is to take place in 1867, but we can see that A railway wagon has electric lights (at least they are not on) and a locomotive engine at least 30 years later that was not so popular at the time. There are also places where you can see paved asphalt road (and maybe a car at a certain point, did not bother looking back) and other anachronistic items. If they had followed the rules of the "world" and allowed the actors to be actors, she might have gotten a 4 from me, rather than the 2 I gave her, and they still circumscribed her about four times, which might be even better would have been.
