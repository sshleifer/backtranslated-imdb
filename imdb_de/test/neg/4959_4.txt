For budget reasons, $ 2.5 million is not very much if you look at the animatronics, the puppetry in this movie. That alone is the reason for the 9-week shooting. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was hoping to see it when it came out and recently got it on DVD. My main problem is that it's just not funny, it's better than Tenacious D, which does not have funny bones in the body. However, this was a really disappointing movie. Trevor Matthews is a very powerful performer but his acting is shit! Rachel Skarsten gives a potentially irritating and not funny idea that I've ever seen. The only really big star is David Scott, whose artwork is fantastic for the monsters! His special effects are the main reason why this movie is worth seeing, he loved the Cyclops and the Troll, and the Prof Monster was straight out of the Henson library. <br /> <br /> If you see that, it's not the biggest waste of time, but if you're looking for a great horror comedy trump ... do not mind.
