As I leafed through the canal, I came to a canal 124. It is an urban canal. I saw this movie and decided to give it a try. I almost became a mass murderer through this movie. I have made home videos and they are Oscar-quality compared to this huge mass of Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the spectacle was absolutely relentlessly bad. I'd rather look at Star Crystal ... Holy Cow, maybe that's not a good example. The main question I have about this film is: Was it a moral film? The reason why I ask is because there was a line in which this lady in a wheelchair says, "I would have been a different gear statistics." After hearing this line, I went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife to sting anyone who dared to watch this movie. But it made some sense and I just switched channels to see the man with the Afro paint. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, we do not recommend this option if you have short fuses or a bad case of Tourette
