This is a really silly task of failure - about as bad as Hepburn, who plays a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The main character playing Hepburn is a combination of grandma from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady because Bogart at least played no hillbilly - he was just surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds like it's coming straight out of a Li'l-Abner strip! However, the problems do not really end with the outrageous casting, because the plot is completely messed up and the "love story" could hurt the head. For no reason whatsoever, Robert Young falls for this Ozark Bobcat. Was it her lovely personality that won his heart? I doubt it, because she really seemed to be struggling and fond of fighting as a fiery "Spitfire", after whom the movie was named, and scrappin and hollerin! Was it her feminine charm? Without make-up and fashion that looked like they were designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt that was the case. To top it off, in the end Ralph Bellamy somehow fell for her, even if it does not really make sense again. <br /> <br /> Well, here are two city fishermen. for a grubby, not female beast, played by Mrs. Hepburn - now that's a recipe for a good movie!
