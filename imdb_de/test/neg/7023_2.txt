This is a horrible movie, and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible. For one thing, it's ugly, with the trendy 70s style that seemed to be a good idea at the time, but can now spot a film from that era as a product of the 1970s. The film contains the story and the songs that made the stage version of the musical a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But most of all, the film is shit because of the poor performance of Lucille Ball, who is thought to make something out of this larger-than-life character, if anyone could. She strolls through the movie like a frightened actress choking on her opening night, and the movie sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, of whom I bet he was weird in the best friend role on stage, can not breathe life into this stinker. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
