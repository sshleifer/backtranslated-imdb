"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is sad because it obviously tries to succeed, and obviously has no chance to make it obviously because of the lack of a clear sense. An insane failure of the Irish Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief, who loves to outsmart the cops and turn his competition into a kind of folk hero. This movie is slightly amusing when it tries to be funny, a little more than boring it is interesting and forgetful sentimental or poignant or lovable, although it also addresses these qualities. "Ordinary Decent Criminal" has a clumsy script, a naive directing, the execution of journeymen, thin stories, bad casting, mediocre acting and is finally lost in itself and sinks into a swamp of hopeless mediocrity. Pass this on. (D)
