Making a movie for under 1 million may be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant, but it does not do anything for the audience. The balance would have been nice, but the viewing experience was bad. <br /> <br /> What an Irish movie will be a triumph is when people realize that production values ​​and the script can not be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people spend the energy to put together a movie when the quality of production is worse than at a low-quality TV show. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the conspiracy were addressed in another review on this site and I completely agree with what was written. What I would like to add is that the movie pervaded the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. The film would have benefited from either going in the direction of a straightforward comedy or a social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the movie was rash, thematically underdeveloped and visually out of line with the standard. On the positive side, the performances and the music were very good.
