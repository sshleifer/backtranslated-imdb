"The new hope of Romanian cinema" ... if this is the new hope, I really would not like to see the rescuing hero of such a prolific cinema (that is, Romanian cinema). Seriously, where should I start? 1. The shitty scenario: kidding, that's not even credible, let alone the high stupidity. 2. The direction: In which direction? This film should have had at least a psychological tension, as they have decided to make the movie as trashy as possible. Oky, I admit Radu Muntean is not a Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could go on), but at least the least amount of work would have been appreciated. 3. The language: Oky, I do not understand why (almost) every single Romanian director thinks that making the movie as miserable and obscene as possible makes you have art. I have nothing against explicit language or poor picture quality as long as the end result is worth it. Not in this case. There is nothing to comment on, since everything the movie wants to say has been told a thousand times, the characters are far too thin to be memorable. This film relies only on self-induced emotions, on the "we must" hype. Someone has been found to have been murdered so that "WE MUST" feel sad, anxious or panic, someone has been through this and the "WE MUST" feel in a certain way. That's nonsense. Because a movie is a fiction, nothing is really something here. So the only true emotions are the ones you discover when you go deep into the world (that's the movie). <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
