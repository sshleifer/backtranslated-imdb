What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but also the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, a George Segal vehicle from decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the influence of Jim Carrey will not only star in, but make that tired, ugly, pointless apology for a comedy. He could take the comedy to a whole new level, instead going for what he sees as a safe territory. Money, money, money, christmas. But I am sure that this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it unpleasant because I felt that way. I was aware that I was trying desperately to be funny on the screen. And fails miserably. It could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect mirror comedy of the time after Enron, but no, that would be too high, too risky. Pity!
