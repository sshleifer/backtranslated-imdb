When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5oo in a local store, I should have warned enough that this movie did not meet the usual standards of David Selznick Productions. With a cast of names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard, I was looking forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said, it is a strange mix of plot and scenes that are not entirely convincing. However, I am so glad that I have seen this movie, as I now have the memorable saying: "Never let the semen stop you from enjoying the watermelon." live by This should summarize the lives of all people. Pick these seeds, spit them or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon life.
