My wife and I never got into the movie. We thought it was a way too slow and too many subtitles. I knew that they needed them for Vietnam, but it took too long for us to get out of Asia better. It never did that they had a difficult time to get to America, but I wanted him to look for his father and place. Not in the end, but build a relationship. I mention that it was slllloooowww movie to feel good, not sad in the end. I know that they do not do a lot of good movies these days. I think action movies are the only ones you can watch. I rented a lot from Netflix and now blockbuster, maybe 20% worth seeing. I do not pinch on realism or facts, but on a movie that is fun and makes you feel good. Gary
