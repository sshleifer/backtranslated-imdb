This movie is shit. The problem was not the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of great shows. But the script was terrible! Most of the time it seemed to be just a framework in which Steve Carrell could perform his improvisation. And that's what he does best, but it simply did not work out here. The script was hard to follow, the story was nonsense and the scenes were random and lacked direction. Also, much of the action was extremely thoughtful and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it so much! I'm shocked to see so many glowing reviews for this stinker here on the IMDb. Of course, the movie producers get people to write a lot of positive reviews about their films and to refill the entries in the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them with the negative reviews, it is pretty clear what real reviews are from normal users. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that just did not work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I'll tell you that I never laughed when I saw this movie. Yes, I had a few light moments, a few giggles, but no real laughter. Nothing that I noticed. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alarm! A ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands tied to the plane and he went to the bathroom to escape. He uses his special Swiss army knife ... but instead of just using THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE, he tries to PROTECT the binding with his miniature crossbow. And as the crossbow repeatedly shoots into him (almost ejects his EYE) with small arrows, Max does not give up or tries out the blade instead ... no, he shoots only with the crossbow on himself. What did he really expect from this crossbow? It seemed to be the worst option of the knife to remove the bond. It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that make up this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, badly motivated and made out of pure nonsense. And that was really distracting. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big disappointment and I recommend you to avoid it. A note to the IMDb: You should do something about these false assessments that leave people. This will affect the authenticity of the website.
