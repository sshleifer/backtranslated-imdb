An ex-informer from East Germany ends up in Mexico as a spy of a student group in 1971, in which she falls in love with one of the activists. This is Mexico's first co-production with Germany, and although there is a good picture of the ideals that marked and continue to mark the youth (at least for the CGH), so many finishes are a bit bland as they relate to the inner dilemmas it is dark brown (Noethem) like the passion of his ideals that Adela feels (Campomanes), as soon as they divine her, in the case of him, I want to think of the language barrier; and with her due to lack of experience. Reason why, in the end, there is no concrete identification with any of them, which could lead to films that even served as a document, such as Red Dawn, becoming another film; However, I would like to make it clear that many of the assistants in the room were upset with the director, which tells me that they are not so young or my ideals have changed.
