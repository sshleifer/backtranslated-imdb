Why would someone shoot such a movie? Why would someone invest in such a movie? Why would someone in the film business work on a movie like this? Why should any theater show such a movie? Why would any TV station show such a movie? Why should a critic check a movie like this? Why would anyone see such a movie? Why should not the authors / producers / directors of a film like this one be examined in thought? Sometimes there are films that are so bad that they are good. This is a movie that is so horrible that it is terrible. IMDb really needs to introduce a "0" or even a minus scale to embrace works of this dreadful presumption.
