This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who survived the only crash of an Allied reconnaissance plane in Belgium in January 1944, is quite chaotic. The title makes you think that this is mainly a story about the Belgian armed resistance groups, but this only seems to be a backdrop to substantiate a stupid love story between Ted and Claire, the woman Ted absorbs a dedicated resistance member, but it is Claire who, in the absence of Henri and against his will, decides to give Ted refuge. At the heart of the story is the recall of the recorder at the shutdown level, which contains navigation codes and the locations of targets. But in the opening scene, we see Belgians plundering the plane, including resistance members. Why did not they pick up the valuable items at this time instead of waiting for the Nazis to guard the plane? The whole affair of relocating Ted from the area was conducted with secret instructions and codewords, if the transaction could have been just a simple exchange. The lumbering music tries to put a strain on this lazier undertaking. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the movie is how the love relationship between Ted and Claire develops. First, Claire devotes herself to the care of Ted from near death, and as Ted begins to recover, she becomes physically involved (while Henri comfortably resists). Julie Ormond does a passable job as Claire, but she has a French accent that I often could not understand. Her answers sometimes seemed a bit weak - when she was informed of the hanging deaths of several city members, she reacted as if she had just been told that the local grocery store had no peaches. As Ted, Bill Paxton seems to be reciting his lines; His performance is so uninspired that it is embarrassing. A true American pilot could prove such a flat personality, but does not make the cinema convincing. I did not feel any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic thing is the way Ted and Claire behave like lovers on vacation. Maybe sexual liberation is understandable from such difficult situations, but forgetting the seriousness of the situation is hard to fathom. First, Ted is taken to an attic room and Claire is worried that he even comes into the house. But as things develop, he not only comes in, he dances with Claire to loud music, enters the adjoining stable to play a baseball game with a local boy, and finally goes to a nearby town with Claire <br /> The boy seems most committed to his role, but is undermined by the script. He has the uncanny ability to participate in crucial events without being noticed. And when he delivers lines like: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen anyone hang out, they look like the ones who dance, but they can not find the floor." <br /> <br /> You feel like the writer is talking, not a thirteen-year-old boy. By the way, there are scenes that show that the Nazis are pretty bad guys. <br /> <br /> If you compare this movie with the brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" about the Polish resistance or the equally outstanding "Lacombe, Lucien" on the French resistance, you realize what a really dark affair this is.
