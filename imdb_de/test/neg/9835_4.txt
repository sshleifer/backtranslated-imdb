The Girl in Lovers Lane is a weird little low-budget movie. On its surface, the film tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix (Brett Halsey), who spends his time looking for a young kid named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl Carrie (Joyce Meadows) with the Bix who likes to look for him. Nothing is overly interesting (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix brings trouble to Danny, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes before the movie, when Carrie is murdered. Her father charges Bix, pulls him out of a jail cell and almost kills him to death. Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix. <br /> <br /> By the time I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought I might have read more about Bix and Danny's relationship than was really there, but I see now that I'm not alone. It was clear to me early on that Bix and Danny had more relationships than you normally see in a movie from 1959. The homosexual relationship of this relationship, though never expressed openly, is still apparent. Her living and sleeping arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to commit herself to Carrie, and the phone call in the end when Danny tells his parents he's "yelling a friend home." , are some examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there is more in their relationship than appears at first glance: I am sure that they exist, but I can not imagine films from the 50s, the gays screaming as loud as this one. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, I have no other way to express it. It is boring. As I already wrote, not much happens for 90% of the runtime. The characters are boring and the actors are not good enough to sparks on The Girl in Lovers Lane. The only exception is Jack Elam. His crazy Jesse is the only character interesting enough to be seen. Elam had an eerie idiot! But I think so The biggest problem I had with the movie was the motivation and logic of the characters. Carrie is kille d and Bix is ​​accused immediately? What about crazy Jesse, who has probably persecuted Carrie all her life? Anyone want to ask Jesse where he was that night? Her dad saw him molesting Carrie in the restaurant, but he never thinks that miserable Jesse could have anything to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic. And what about Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse on the lapel and that's all it takes to force a confession on Jesse? Really tough guy, right? Why should he confess so easily? And after he confessed, does not anyone think he's going to grab him? It's awfully nice of Jesse to just stay and not run away. In any other reality he would never have bothered and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions of the characters is something I do not want to do. Overall, I give The Girl in Lovers Lane 4/10.
