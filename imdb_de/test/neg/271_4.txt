The people who hit this movie were looking for being as cool and smooth as the first one, which is not. This movie should be the complete opposite of Ocean's 11. This has been said by many actors and also by director Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, though lacking a gripping plot, is beaten because it was different from what people wanted. If released before Ocean's 11, it would be understood much differently, not as a failed sequel. The problem with sequels is that people start with a pre-set idea of ​​what it should be and have many expectations. You should be open-minded in this movie and do not expect it to be "Ocean's 11" again.
