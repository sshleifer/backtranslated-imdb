A cute girl (yes, Ditzy is about as complex as her character) does not answer no and does strange things to bring her husband back. It's too far-fetched to be credible when such threadbare characters go through the motions. But not far-fetched to be intriguing in the way that said to be John Malkovich. That's how boring it gets. <br /> <br /> sv
