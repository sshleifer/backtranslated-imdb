I'm just throwing in this review to show that I'm not crazy. I like a lot of work by Wynorski - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall and Against the Law are fast paced and very enjoyable - just to prove I'm 'I'm not blind, I have to do that with Shannon Tweed' Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or so "mention these are the lousy ones - I have nothing against extensive sex sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural If you look, you can not help but stare at them - which may be the desired effect, but I did not enjoy it staring at them - and several members of this cast seem to be depressed or disinterested - The "erotic thriller" was the worst thing to do with low-budget flicks and thankfully that their day has more or less done.
