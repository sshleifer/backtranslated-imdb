This movie belongs to the bottom of tailoring. For one, the opening sequence does not highlight the theme associated with "gait". If it was not, then at least they had this part right. Secondly ... what about all the look to the left and then to the right ??? They even do it in synchronous style. Nowhere did I see a member of a rival crew go to a bar, look for someone who looked from the outside, as if he were carrying everything and a bag of chips at a Barbie, without even being confronted, let alone being confronted come '. I wasted money on the rental and am glad that I did not buy the DVD myself. <br /> <br /> If this was done by College students (T.A.F.E), they at least gave it to the old Australian attempt. Good luck next time.
