Talk about boring snoring. This biker movie in 3rd Prize made me sleep as soon as the opening credits appeared on the screen. The shame is that the performers included many good actors, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen, and William Forsythe. This is essentially the story of a former beret (Henriksen) of the US Army trying to Getting someone to liberate a horsepower town from a group of scary motorcyclists is at the school level. Sad to see Academy Award winner Kennedy was seen in such a comedown of his superb performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you can not sleep at night, this is a perfect movie video to borrow .......... you will sleep in no time!
