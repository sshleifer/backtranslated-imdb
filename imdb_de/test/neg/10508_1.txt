DO NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely funny. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. Sometimes we have actually discussed whether that was deliberately so bad, but we are pretty sure that is not the case. Characters appear out of nowhere as if they were already established, the scenery is constantly moving to this storehouse, and the vampire assassin ends up having about 6 enemy clashes before coming to the head vampire. You will also be able to enjoy the only face of the vampire assassin, as he never changes his facial expression despite his obvious attempts. So if you want to watch a movie that makes you laugh, then I recommend this movie as long as you keep it open. Do not expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it will be even worse. I really want to buy this movie and put it on my selection of comedy movies. Right next to Anchorman.
