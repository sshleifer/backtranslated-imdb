I've seen hundreds of kung fu movies and heard something good about this movie, so I decided to give it a try. What I saw was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel that the director in Hong Kong wants to have every type of muscle power in this movie. Everyone works up to stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had some courtesy. This film has only half-developed men screaming in every scene, and stupid women who have no self-esteem. The character of the narrator should have been killed so much for sucking ... she really did not deserve to live to the end. The entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible drama, bad direction and bad action. You should have just renamed this movie "The stupid one-armed caveman with a blade". "Here's a question ... why do some directors use short shots for action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors Every scene was tight and fast without any kind of flow cut in. The film tried so hard to show the intensity but it almost became ridiculous, please stay away from this movie if you have a taste in kung fu movies or any taste in movies.
