I can not believe that I sat through this waste of time. I was just too fascinated by how unimaginably bad it was that I could not move. It reminded me of the feeling when you can not take your eyes off a horrible car crash or the rotting carcass of a cow. You can not help but look, but afterwards you feel sick and sick. <br /> <br /> Let me explain in more detail: "Plan 9 from the space" is not a bad movie, for example. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. They are both terrible to see, but they both have some qualities and at least they have the power to grab the "off" button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" of the sci-fi classic left me crying on my couch, trying desperately to clarify why such scripts are filmed, why anyone remembers the original classic and if I could continue my normal life without my own, suddenly longing for peace and quiet of death. <br /> <br /> Although death, as I realized, would not provide terrible memories of that pile of crap, as the poor souls in hell are likely to be forced to watch it over and over again for eternity ...
