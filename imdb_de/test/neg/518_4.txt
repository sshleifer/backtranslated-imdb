"Submerged" is definitely NOT the "worst movie ever". It has its weaknesses, such as borrowed material, crazy script, and nonexistent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some good points. Acting is surprisingly good, there are many familiar faces that you probably know if you're a B-movie fan like me. <br /> <br /> I was very happy that Brent Huff played one of the heroes, I know him mainly for his 80s action movies, and I have to admit he's not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson have limited screen time, but are credible in their field. The "eye candy" in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both of whom look very sexy and mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds a bit more background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately, Coolio is the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place. He does not behave at all, talks like he did not even read the script, and because he's a badass at the beginning of the movie, he's shot like a weakling an hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> Summarize this film - this is not a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can overcome the special effects (so many guns, so much fire and not a single wound on anyone), Coolio's annoying performance, and Airport 77's recycled material, you'll like this straightforward device.
