Oh, boy, it's another comet that hits Earth. Within a year or two, Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys, and various other stupid movies with rap stars in them, you might think people burned out on this concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping that it could not be terrible: Dennis Hopper was finally there, and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and many other esteemed actors, Hopper has a penchant for showing up in horrible movies. Not only that, he seems to prepare for it by visiting forgotten actions. His performance in Tychus is so horrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else to say about this garbage unless you plummet In the terrestrial movies look at Deep Impact and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys. Forget the others together. This one is really down on the stack.
