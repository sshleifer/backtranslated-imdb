Once a month I invite a few friends to a "Retarded Movie Night". We look forward to films that are either so bad that they are funny or films that know that they have no action and only show a lot of chests. Last night we had the misfortune to have Zombie Planet as one of our films. Cinematography is similar to what we are used to, but acting was a different story. The lead role is played by a Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie-Wanna-Be who could not play a role in a high school role, let alone a LOW BUDGET horror movie. Our indecisive hero, who could not say whether he wanted to be this scene or a whimpering coward, was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 years that I had to stop earlier during a retarded movie movie night. It had the potential of size with a BIG twist of the standard zombie infection, but they took a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. Personally, I would not recommend it to any of my friends. However, it is regrettable that last night I invited a few to endure 80% of this film with me.
