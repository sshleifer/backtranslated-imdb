Pretty lousy successor to the novel Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian is an adult and is played by the spooky Stephen McHattie. After Rosemary (played here by Patty Duke) has been eliminated, a witches' convent, once again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, prepares Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and macabre years older than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-infatuating thriller full of vocals, lots of candles, and Ruth Gordon, who also seeks to be dark and evil. Gordon is the only remnant of the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and a very pounding Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets and takes over the late Sidney Blackmer. The newcomer McHattie is the only salvation of the film. He is very outlandish and looks really scary without doing anything. The music of Charles Bernstein is appropriately scary, but so overused, it seems intrusive and ineffective. O'Steen, who edited the earlier Polanski masterpiece, shows no flair or subtlety.
