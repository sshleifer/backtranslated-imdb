This movie starts at A and never quite reaches B. His title promises far more than the movie delivers. It is superficial and filled with the usual clich√©s of a story in which a man questions his sexuality. The people are pleasant, even the obligatory Flamboyant type. The lead role (Kevin McKidd) excels insofar as there is a reason to act at all. Simon Callow, who plays a horny straight, is always worth a look, and he's the only reason to stay with the movie. The garbage about his men's group "Meditations" or whatever it is, becomes extremely tiring in a short time. They seem to have been thrown into the film's mild mix. The same remark applies to a really strange and unconvincing camping trip. Do not worry about stopping the tape so you can get a snack. Let this thing run. You will miss nothing. The character of Hugo Weaving is superfluous. He appears in a sequence with one of the smaller derivatives and does not hit the rest at all. The result of this sequence is not explained, and Hugo's real estate businesses have nothing to do with the story. The film is in the end a total disappointment, as there is no resolution. The thing is simply hidden and we are sent to the credits. This is an interlude without structure.
