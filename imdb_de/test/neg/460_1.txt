Alien was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. They've all done a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst alien copy. Because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell all the bad things in this movie.) The movie was not very long and that's a very good thing (you can Do not laugh because it's too serious ... that's a bad thing, because in almost every B-Series sci-fi movie, you can laugh all the time, but sometimes it can be terrific when you see that stupidity just look at Alien or Event Horizon ... these are much better !!! I give 1 out of 5 points.
