I think Purvis starts making a gay "Gone With The Wind". If so, sorry, day, it did not happen. It also did not happen as a gay "sexploitation" strip. I am probably confused. What are we trying to do here? As much as I want to, I just can not get to where those characters are a bit dear to me. This film is effective to get a sense of the decadence that lives in the South. it does not help me to explain, enlighten, or promote my understanding of a gay relationship or the conflict the protagonist is struggling with.
