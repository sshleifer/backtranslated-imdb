I am not sure if this film could be the same as the first one, even though it had the original seven (despite the fact that four were killed). It just does not have the spark and the chemistry. All the actors look tired and look like they're just taking the steps to get their paychecks. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Yul Brynner in the original movie is "great", but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel. When he starred in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (in the same black pants, in the same shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and presence as Chris Adams of 1960. It's nothing 1966 strips, so it's worth seeing on cable.
