Leaders Leo Gorcey (as Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are under pressure as usual. After unsuccessfully trying to sell their old Jalopie, the boys seek help from the local bank. There the hapless Huntz Hall (as property) photographed the pretty photographer Teala Loring (as Cathy Smith). But since the shot was hit during a robbery, Mr. Hall looks like the main suspect. With buddies Bobby Jordan (as Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (as Whitey) and David Gorcey (as Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to clear Hall and collect the $ 1,000 bonus. "Bowery Bombshell" goes through the moves, with Ms. Loring as a major asset. Bobby Jordan
