This German horror movie has to be one of the strangest I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of a link between child abuse and vampirism, but it is based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb because he was repeatedly beaten by his father. He also has a doll fetish, but I can not figure out where that came from. His colleagues experience and annoy him terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day a mild accountant arrives, at night he breaks into cemeteries and burial places and drinks the blood of dead girls. Of course, they are all attractive, otherwise we would not care that he usually tears her clothes to the waist. He finally kills, and that's what gets him. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow, as Werner Pochath never talks and only donates blood.
