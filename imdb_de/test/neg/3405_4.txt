I'm in Waverly Hills and saw Death Tunnel The Movie first. It could not have been much worse. Then I heard that the documentary came out and was excited to think, since it was a documentary, it would be more serious and would not have the terrible special effects. So should be a documentary. Waverly Hills does not need help with stupid effects, it's just the way it is. Tours cost $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for an overnight 8-hour per person study, minimum group of 10 for an overnight visit. The tours must be scheduled in advance. Great place for the Ghost Hunter!
