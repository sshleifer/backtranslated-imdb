It is a shame that someone who is so revered by many children and parents, sits down in this exploitative, skip-combed crest. I often wonder if Mr. Wisdom in his later years looked back with pride on his apology for a movie. At least Sally Geeson had the decency to retire to do something valuable after she'd appeared in that cheap garbage. A cameo from a long-forgotten pop called The Pretty Things can not save the movie from its awfulness. Instead, if you want 60's nostalgia to invest in "Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush," play Barry Evans and Sally's sister Judy instead.
