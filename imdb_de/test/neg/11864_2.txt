This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I could barely stay awake. The drama and action were terrible. I like B-movies, but this movie has nothing that could make me laugh or think. OK, in the beginning there were two or three funny moments, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10 points. If you really want to see it, look at the first 10 minutes. After that you will be more and more disappointed while the movie is playing.
