Long ago, in the early 1980s, a late-night television program "Friday" came to ABC, which tried to steal NBC's worst offer "Saturday Night Live". It did not, but it brought some vile sketches and semi-talented "comedians" into the world. Like Mark Blankenfield. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to "Jekyll and Hyde ... Together Again". Which is somewhat repugnant. Blankenfield is as subtle as a bench full of Whoopee pillows leaving after communion. And about as tasteful. This is just his drugged druggist figure that he played in the ill-fated "Friday" show, which stretched to length. And if you did not like him there, why read this report? <br /> <br /> Every time more than one or two authors write a film, that's a bad sign. Then, when it comes to stupid jokes that would throw you off any improvisation stage in the Western Hemisphere and replace gags with coarse-out, things can only get worse Louis Stevenson's story? To make such a good idea as a sitcom from Poe's "Fall of the House Usher". Apart from a few (very few) gags that give a slight grin, this whole movie is an exercise in wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities. <br /> <br /> No wonder the original author Stevenson turned in his grave. Which more attentive a rating could you give yourself? <br /> <br /> No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, he should have known better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" from this.
