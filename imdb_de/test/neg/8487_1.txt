Well, I had the chance to see this movie the other day. I did not know what to expect, as I have never seen the trailer and such a thing. However, what I did discover when I first watched the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I've ever had. > <br /> I wish I could give this movie a rating of 0. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as it went into the party scene, I just wanted to enter a coma, it was really bad. The actors had no direction, there was no real story. I read some reviews that say it's good to have a little kid talking for 90 minutes, and so on, but why should we expose kids to this kind of movie? It has bad humor, rude and rough comedy and focuses on bad special effects to fill 80% of its time. I'm sure some people in Hollywood will be out for the bombs on the streets. <br /> <br /> How can 39 people give this movie a 10? I mean, anyone who gives this movie either a 10 can have a mental problem and or works for the film company. This movie should average 1.5 / 10 instead of 2.3 / 10 due to the people who rated it 10. Really sad.
