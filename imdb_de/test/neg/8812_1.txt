Why do I have to pay praise for ten minutes each time I mention this movie to someone? I've come to the conclusion that every movie that has a twist is considered a "genius" by anyone who looks at it. Did that really become the movie? Or is it that every time someone says "Wow, that's so cool", everyone agrees with them and has no opinion of their own? How this film rated at 7.5 is generally a shame for the film industry. It's also been another movie that "needs" two sequels to it, so I'll have to hear about that terrible franchise for a while longer. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie and why it is so bad. The original concept is actually not so bad, because there is no good serial killer movie for some time. The writing for this film is as horrible as the execution. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but that should not change the story or the writing. The actors could not be worse off trying to scare us off this killer or just watching this movie. So you go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever they are) are wasted because HIS CHARACTER is VALUABLE. Why was he even in this movie? What in the end was his whole fight turned out to be useless and misleading for what the audience believes. This of course is the intention of the filmmakers, but there could not have been a better way without looking at the garbage. And then comes the "big" twist (was this the third or fourth?) And the entire audience is shocked and goes out of the theater as if it were a kind of masterpiece. Sure, the movie makes people talk about the plot and what does not, but that was not the only flaw in the movie. The direction was trying to be too creative with what it was working with, and the Flashback sequences were used merely as a shocking effect. After watching this movie, go back and review the movie, you'll soon understand why it does not deserve the praise it receives. If you have not already done so, you can find an amazing serial killer movie in Se7en. That's what this movie wanted to be. I've got more quarrels about this movie than likely others and will continue to oppose it. Please support this franchise not only for you, but for me and everyone else. Hollywood has to find a good horror movie instead of making 1,000 remakes, sequels, and "shock" factor movies (like these). Oh yes, the saw 2-day line sounds really promising: "Oh yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet!! Blood, that must be his right? Give me a break. Excuse everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, eye-catching directing, and bad acting do not make a good movie.
