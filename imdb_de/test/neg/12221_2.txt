I did not care much, it seemed too much for a documentary. In addition, the filmmakers seemed to direct me to certain characters, and yet I was totally disliked by the protagonist for showing me what he wanted from him. This movie disappointed me because of the story and the people were interesting, but the movie was flattened because the cut was edited so snappy that there was not enough time for the viewer to understand each scene. The developments in the story were glossed over instead of showing the men in boxers or other stuff that happened to happen to the story they were telling. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you skip this one and just read up to this story.
