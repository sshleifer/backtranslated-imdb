I tried. God knows, I tried to like this Swiss cheese of a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some of which were big enough to drive a horse-drawn carriage. The spectacle was generally balanced and the characters were so adorable that they regretted that they died like recently-sprayed cockroaches and dispersed to die of their cruel death. Overall, it was not really scary. After all, we have seen creepy fast-moving figures in the background since "The Brood" as / and it was then just a little scary. This movie has never solved the basic plot points, and that's the author's job. Of course, one would expect the director to pick up on the fact that history makes no sense. Who was the secret room behind the wardrobe? Why did not the bloodthirsty mind die when it received the nails prescribed by the book they had read before? Why did the computer say "game over" to Frankie's character, even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I do not really feel comfortable recommending this movie because you feel like you were wasting your time, and in truly scary moments, there was not enough profit.
