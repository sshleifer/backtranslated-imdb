In the third episode of "Left Behind", the creators did not want to bring any kind of CONTINUITY into the plot. Although all weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations, World War III suddenly begins with a snap of the finger. Within a few seconds, the ex-lover of one of the main protagonists breaks from a passionate seduction to a pronounced hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any direction. <br /> <br /> But above all, this movie is really an ironic zone. After accepting Jesus as his Savior, the President of the United States immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
