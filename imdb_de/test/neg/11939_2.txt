I'm not going to waste my time on in-depth analysis, I'm just going to say that I'm extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones has made the mistake of starring in this absurd, nonsensical nonsense full of clich√©s that are boring to death , mindless, pathetic attempt in filmmaking! There is no point in finding the positive sides of the film, because overall it is poor in every respect and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is so uncompromisingly drawn into the stereotypes that she has absolutely no chance to even show 1% of her talent ! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, even if you spend the night at home and starring on the wall !!!
