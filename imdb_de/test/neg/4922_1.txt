Movies just do not get worse. Terrible plot, awful temporal, pathetic characters and effects, and yes, this uses "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the guys: nothing, this movie is a horrible, rundown, few scenes that could be great but you get nothing but build without delivery. <br /> <br /> This movie does not appeal to anyone, terrible movie, it was bad; Plot, drama, B taste, special effects and everything else. Plus no nudity or eroticism for guys or girls.
