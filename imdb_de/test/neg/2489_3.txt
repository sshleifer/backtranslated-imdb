There is no real story, the film looks more like a fly on the wall than a real movie, so that this piece in itself can be a spoiler. A youthful drama about 3 young Singaporean children (very similar to the UK) playing tails, running with gangs, fighting, offending people on the street, doing tattoos, doing nothing, etc., etc. They generally introduce themselves to be tough and to call challenging rap songs into the camera. Filmed in MTV style, fast cuts, crazy camera settings, close-ups and animation interludes. In the original languages ​​of Mandarin and Hokkien, the dialogue may have been sharper than in the subtitles, and I do not doubt that some of the contemporary references in Singapore come across Western minds and the cultural and political context, unless you are familiar with them Singapore. This kind of teen movie may be a first for Singapore, but was previously made in other Western countries, for example La Haine (1995).
