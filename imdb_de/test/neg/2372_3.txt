This is a comedy version of "Strangers on a Train". It works pretty well. I am a tough student, so the 3-rating is mostly reflected in the characters and the plot. The services are all very good. Of course, the two stars DeVito and Crystal shine the most. Every performer is good enough to play it. The comedy is working at a level just before slapstick. DeVito signs work best when corrupted. His character, portrayed as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he was published and praised as much as most hacks. His character would have a great agent and several incentives in real life. The characters are one-dimensional, which is okay in the comedy. But the character of crystals is not very well written. His desire to kill the "Moma" suddenly makes no sense at all. It looks like a pathetic attempt at humor. The pitiful attempts are not too often and the movie is doing pretty well.
