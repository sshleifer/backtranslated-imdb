It seems that every two or three years since 1982, we have been getting a movie claiming to be "The Next Officer and a Gentleman." There is still no film that lives up to this claim, and this movie is no different. <br /> <br /> We get the usual scenes from OAAG ("I want you, DOR"), gives the instructor Richard Gere character is an overdose of exercises hoping that he will stop the exercise Character comes back for the girl, the Gere character realizes the teacher is great, etc.) and this movie is as predictable as the sunrise in the east terrible failure at the top. Costner plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you can really feel his limited acting skills here. Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character, just a miscast with acting abilities barely above Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is that the two main characters are so unbelievably one-dimensional that they are never so insistent. They either care about something and when Kutcher's character finally turns around (just like Gere in OAAG), then just go "What?" The film does not leave any plot point in sight and never seems to end, as if to say, "Oh, wait, we forgot to end the girlfriend story, or what happens after he finishes the story, or the other six plot points in the movie ... "What's even more confusing is the great" reviews "I see here. The opinions of the public are always amazing to me.
