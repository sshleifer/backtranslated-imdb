Susan unintentionally stumbles upon a drug smuggling ring while her broker gets an empty hoop while he drives her to a house. The leader of the drug ring, Mongo (who has only a week to go to retirement), believes he knows a lot more than this bubbly blonde actually tries to make sure she does not tell anyone, and starts one of the most bone-in films I sat through it. <br /> <br /> All the actors in this movie can not act in the least. Susan makes a rather ineffective hero for most of the film (she would never flee several times, if not, apparently everyone in the movie wants to have sex with her) and she only goes on the offensive minutes of the strip in the last 20 years. When she does, she spits out a generic line, "I've had enough," preaching about her sister. This thought crossed my mind several times when I saw this. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
