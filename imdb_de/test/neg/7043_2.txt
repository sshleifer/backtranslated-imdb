If you have plenty of time to kill, and the DVD was provided to you by your friend for free, it may still take a lot of courage to watch this movie, which does not have a good script or good humor on this matter. <br /> <br /> At the show front, Imran is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran. In this movie, Paresh Rawal was good at comedy. <br /> <br /> The story centers around a college campus where Imran is a bad boy. Tushar is the good guy. You pretend to be the opposite of nature, and so the story goes on ..... <br /> <br /> Just look at it if you have nothing to do and the movie is on your local cable TV ,
