*** Minor Plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a weakness for Wayne Crawford. I know little about him, but he seems to have a lot of enthusiasm to make up for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs several tasks - from the rulers, directors, producers and scriptwriters - and deals with storylines from the basement. Nevertheless, the end product usually makes entertaining fun for the non-demanding. <br /> <br /> In "The Evil Below", Crawford is described as the superior captain of a dilapidated charter boat such as Bogart in 'To Have & Have Not' - but the similarities between the films end here. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene in which two divers seek a wreck before being attacked by an invisible creature, the beginning of 'Jaws 2'. The wreck turns out to be that of "El Diablo", which perished centuries ago. The ship was occupied by heretic priests fleeing from Spain with a cargo of stolen church treasures. This allows the introduction of various connections to supernatural powers, with both Lucifer and The Armageddon getting a glimpse. The title of the film refers to this sunken devil ship and not to a vicious marine creature. The movie has (and there are many) fun to see and be competent. You can not help but watch a movie that copies the famous beach scene in "From Here to Eternity" and the last line of "Casablanca" in the last 5 minutes.
