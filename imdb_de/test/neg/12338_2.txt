Downhill Racer is essentially a movie that can only be seen for the grandiose ski scenes. Although there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier trying to form the US Olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why he should even care about him. Gene Hackman adds nicely in an early performance, but this is a movie that could be seen with the sound off and it would not make much of a difference.
