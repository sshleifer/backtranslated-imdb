This film essentially uses spousal rape as one of the major comedic devices. Now I shut it off when he literally tied her to the bed and raped her, but I can not really imagine how that ultimately turned into something lovable and funny. Not only did this film waste a wonderful cast and it was always listless, it was actually quite brutally disturbing and misogynist. How many people find it for a sweet family stripe is inexplicable to me. "I really enjoyed these apricots last night," is not a funny joke, knowing that it forces an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hope that she will eventually love it. To see a pointy Tom masturbating, is not a family fun. To be honest, I feel worse off because I've seen half of that scary comedy, and am totally surprised by these positive reviews.
