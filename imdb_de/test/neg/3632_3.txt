First of all, I would like to clarify a common misconception: It is not unrealistic that the school Zoey visits gives students laptops. In my school, the 7th and 7th grade classes have to own Apple Macbooks (this will be paid in the entrance fee). Continue This show is very annoying. It has boring, predictable conspiracies and bad behavior. In the show, the "girl power" is often raised to a new high, with girls beating boys in everything they try. That's not the worst thing. The worst part is that girls are still portrayed as concentrating on their personal appearance and screaming whenever they are happy. Except for the one smart girl portrayed as a freak obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this show is very addictive. I do not know why, but it is so. Although the last season was so awful, it brought stereotypes, boring conspiracies, and bad drama to extremes that I did not think were achievable.
