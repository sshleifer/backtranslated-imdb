This comment is meant primarily as a warning to those who might attract the title due to their (temporarily) high user rating, which I honestly find puzzling. The reasons why I did not like this title are the following: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have had some doubts as to whether he should make a Jackie-chan type or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, the film falls between two stools in terms of genre, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel each other instead of forming a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The motives and behavior of the characters are incoherent and unconvincing. Unfortunately, psychological truth and logic are missing. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd pouring. I do not blame the actors because it's hard to create a compelling character by acting alone when the script has a straightforward logic. But why is there an obvious age difference of about 15 years between the two main actors, whose age in the film can not differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the movie was bad entertainment mainly because of point 2. If you do not find a character to sympathize with, it is difficult to follow the story with interest. When you finally know what happened to the main protagonist, it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some movies are not only entertaining, they also make you think. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder if the thought the director was trying to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be completely healthy and sexy. I can not put any other construction on the end. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie is full of completely unnecessary violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose. The goals can be different and I do not want to go into this broad topic. Let me just say that I have nothing against violence in movies like "Saving Private Ryan," "The Passion of Christ," or "The Pulp Fiction." In "Oldboy", the scenes of torture and suffering are longer and more graphically (or acoustically). What for? I dont know. Personally, I can not get any satisfaction from seeing teeth being pulled with a hammer, or hearing a man cut off his tongue with a pair of scissors and then see how he chooses to sting his own blood, etc. The movie recalls urinate me a little on Japanese porn manga, who fixate on incest and young Asian girl panties, and the like. It seems that there is a minority who actually enjoys these kinds of things. If you are one of them, this movie may be considered enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this movie as entertainment or food for thought. Where it is not stupid, it is disgusting. Do not waste your time.
