There is an inherent problem in commenting or reviewing a movie like this. I remember feeling the same way after not liking dogma. If you do not like a movie that is strange and controversial, like Mulholland Dr., you are seen as "not understood". Of course, for those who have already seen this movie, you know that the whole point is not there anyway. <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that the unique and sympathetic aspect of this film is a dream. as quality has. In other words, the plot is not structured like other films. At Mulholland It looks more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who deteriorated to the last second for his art project. It does not make sense, it should not be, but I know it should be a TV show first. Apparently, Lynch had a pile of unused movies and decided to meddle with some new things. You will find that towards the end nudity, sex and bad language increase. Everything he did not shoot for television. <br /> <br /> For a better movie that is not told in a traditional, linear way, rent The Thin Red Line from 1998. That was a great movie, that's not it. <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
