I agree that this movie is too presumptuous and it's not easy to know where it's going. I've been teaching literature and film for many years, and I think this film is one of the top rated, as in some of the previous reviews here. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (My Mother Smile) in his honor - a jewel of the film! <br /> <br /> Did he try to beat Fellinis 81/2 here ???? The scene with the dogs, which was also pointed out, is absurd and exaggerated? just an example. Others would take up too much space, and some reviewers have already noticed. All in all a very frustrating and annoying experience!
