From the title, the tagline, the plot summary on the DVD, etc. I awaited some epic, with the historical fiction and the romance that would inspire you; That's what they did in Last of the Mohicans, for example, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I had too high standards for this movie and did not give it a fair chance. But the landscape was barely alright (how could they come up with anything better when dealing with such landscapes?), The two lovers had no chemistry at all and the plot was so predictable that it felt like it was Designed in five minutes by a twelve-year-old - and not very resourceful. Nouvelle-France is a love story in an eventful historical age. But the story of Nouvelle-France is hardly a marginal note, and the love story is banal and can not bring the viewer dramatically to worry about the fate of the lovers. Surprisingly, the only good thing about the film came from something completely unexpected and unknown: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine, and her children (one of course, one adopted). If they had just focused on their family and forgotten the love story, it would have been a much better movie. The parents of Marie-Loup should have had more time for screening and character development. Politics in the UK should have been more than a three-minute scene that had little connection to the rest. The lazy villain would either have to be more developed or removed completely from the script (why are actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs hired to abuse them so much?) Poor work overall.
