The introduction to the local sports team is to bring the newcomers to the corn fields and guess what? There is a scarecrow killing people there. Only one of the newcomers survives, but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow kills everyone involved in succession. What is the secret of scarecrows? Will they find out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. The sound is fine, but the picture is really trite. The plot / script is really shitty and is pretty pathetic and not logical. Acting is really bad and sometimes just ridiculous. I can not really say much about the special effects, because there are not that many, but the few that exist, ranging from bad to fair (for a low budget). There's some nudity, and that's probably the only thing worth watching in the movie (that is, if you're a horny teenager, if not, then leave the movie all together). Another complete waste of time and money, so you do not see it. Also goes for fans of Hack'n'slash.
