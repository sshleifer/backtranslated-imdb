Remember the awful war movies your grandmother forced to see on your old VHS recorder about 25 years ago? "The Fallen" is just a badly done remake of these movies! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible and all together make an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also awfully slow! Very slowly! I tried to sleep while I watched, but I could not do it because I had nightmares about it. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie! It is so bad! Ten lines are a lot, so I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Press the eject button NOW and you will not regret it!
