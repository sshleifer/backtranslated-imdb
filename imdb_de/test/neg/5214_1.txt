(Chances are, I'll spoil precious plot points when I write this, and because I can not figure out what you think is a precious plot point, and do not really care if you think about this movie If you learn such things, I suggest you jump straight to the next review.) You know, the cult movies that are dropped on "cult" do not bother me. And people who believe in it can go there and get fed up with the "reality". I mean, is it too much to ask that the obviously pseudo-Christian propaganda films are being submitted to the other special interest films? <br /> <br /> I could not have been more baffled if Pat Robertson made a pornographic film. (Or would that be "flubbergasted"?) <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that there was a tremendously insufficient number of kicks and punches. It was bad enough that the same story was always made in a much better way. It was bad enough that it was not put under special interest and other cult movies. It was bad enough that it gets somehow nodding because it is "realistic" as if we were living in the world where cities are ruled by "Debbil" and the really deep and evil evil that is NOT done by humans - usually in the NAME of the religions based on the God of Abraham. It was bad enough to just shut down the thing because people complained so loud it was awful. No, the worst part was when one of our guests got up after we finally made it. Turn off the damn thing and say, "I'd like to see something that's really violent or pornographic, just to get it out of my head Preferably both, if you have it. " And we just had her MET.
