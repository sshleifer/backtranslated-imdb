Leon Errol plays his double role as Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping brilliantly, but I can not find the series "Mexican Spitfire" so good, because they all tend to produce false identities, and that these are telegraphed in advance. Errol is funny as the clogged Lord Epping, but I would have wished much more joke and much less repetition. <br /> <br />
