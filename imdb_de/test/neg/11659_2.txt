I can only express the feeling that has already been expressed by some other commentators. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a windbreaker's Luv's) is totally unconvincing. You can address it in two ways: (1) A pithy, realistic movie that gets juicy; or (2) a juicy ABC after school special featuring obscenity, violence and cruelty to animals. Either way, it just does not fly, right? Why did it receive so much praise then? As others have already suggested, it receives the "consensus" from the West. Show us images of poverty to stand against our fluffy, double-width theater seats and 44-ounce coke, and we'll applaud in a heartbeat. But do not forget to coat it with sweets, because the bitter pill of reality (as tempting as it is) would be hard to swallow so many awards and accolades, especially if there are far more credible cinematographic works. All I can say is: Beware of any film that gets prizes (Hollywood Oscars = Curved, Syrup-like Trilobes, Cannes Film Festival = Beardless, Prophecyless). To find the real gems, you have to work hard.
