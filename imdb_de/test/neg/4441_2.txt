The earlier review is pretty much what Altman did NOT have with this movie. I have not seen it since its first release, but I rarely spent two hours in a theater and felt so miserable and disappointed with how I was with this movie. If a presumptuous community theater tried a sci-fi version of an Ingmar Bergman movie, it might look like that. I can not bring myself to give something that has made Altman a "1", but this is probably the low point of a career that has had remarkable ups and downs. I would have left, but as a paid film critic I could not. (Think about it the next time you envy movie critics.)
