I have never seen the first Killjoy movie and have never heard of it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local blockbuster and pick it up and look at the back. Performers Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon. Well, since I'm the huge Troma fan, there's no way to rent this movie. How can it be that these two are bad? Oh, how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can not keep this excuse of a movie from being as bad as it really is. To be honest, Trent stinks as Killjoy, though this is probably more the fault of the authors, who gave him some of the worst one-liners in the history of the movie. Debbie delivers a solid performance, but it's not enough. The killings are terrible, as are the gore effects. For example, look at when the guy is supposed to be impaled on something. To end it, the end is one of the worst I've ever seen in film history. The movie does not even work on such a bad level. Avoid clapping. <br /> <br /> 2/10
