I only bought this DVD because it was dirt cheap and interesting in its own way ("special" meaning "lagged behind"). The film turned out to be pretty uninteresting - boring camerawork, nothing that drives the story, and of course acting is terrible. It was not even "bad" in a camping way - it was just bad. There are actually a handful of great dialogue lines, but for the most part it's uncomfortable and weak. All I could think about when looking at it was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was undergoing a major overhaul (if written by someone who really understood the drug culture) and if some decent actors were cast. I would not recommend "Weekend With the Babysitter" unless you are planning a movie career and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
