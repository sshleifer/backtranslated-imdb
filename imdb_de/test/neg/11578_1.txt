I'm watching this movie and do not hesitate to check it now. The spectacle is ridiculous. Half of the cast must be retired porn actors, and when you step on porn, you can imagine the quality of acting. <br /> <br /> The graphics are different than anything I've ever seen. I think there are more puppet shows with more credibility. They can not even afford a blank space for the weapons they shoot at the pathetic apology for monsters. Maybe I should also realize how incredibly impressed I am with the number of "bullets" that can hold their pistols. <br /> <br /> When I am asked to summarize the film, I would say that someone shook up a group of complete no-hopers at the local County Fair, knocking them on an island, adding unnecessarily intense music and a 6-year-old perform the processing. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not formulate a possible explanation as to why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and costs $ 6 from my local video library for a day. If anything, I have had the advantage of knowing that I am much smarter than any of the parties involved in this film. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew, Captain, I wish I knew ...
