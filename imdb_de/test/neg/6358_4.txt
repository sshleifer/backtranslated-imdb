* Spoiler - sorry! * The first word that came to my mind when watching the movie is 'Gremlins'. It's the only critters movie I've seen from the four films, but I enjoyed it. It was not too complicated, as I had not seen the last two, but I thought it would still be a pretty good movie. <br /> Critters starts with a man, his son, and his daughter on their way to vacation (although it turns out they are ending up at home - which I do not know what to do) The girl meets a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and goes to a nearby forest. They meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful about the creatures. He seems a bit psychotic and if I was in that situation, I would not talk to him. The animals steal a ride on the car of the girl and the boy and land in their flat thing. They hide in the basement and kill this lazy fool. Then they almost kill this fat woman and the girl's father. They are chased higher and higher in the apartment until they hide in the attic. The critters eat things in the kitchen (parody of the Gremlins kitchen scene ???!) And I can not remember (not a good thing), but I'm sure they have to go back for something / someone. Anyway, they come out and saved. The psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two creatures, he is told he can not because they are at risk, and sends them home. <br /> <br /> Lazy guy died because there were some annoying characters that I personally killed. It's an exciting, exciting movie that's worth seeing. However, if you are looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend the Gremlins movies. We are sorry!
