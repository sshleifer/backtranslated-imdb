(Spoiler ahead!) The same exact representation from this movie was made before. It was made in Ferris Buellers Day Off! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays sick. His gullible parents believe him. His sister knows he fakes but she still has to go to school! She is angry. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. When his parents return home, he is ill again and his parents have never heard of the party. I like immaturity better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
