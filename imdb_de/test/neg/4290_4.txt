Renowned Western author Budd Boetticher is extremely saddened with this choppy history of police and cops suffering from a strong lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have renounced the probationary and to have opted for the first setting, as Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming gave little effort into their roles and delivered lines flat and without energy. <br /> <br /> Friendly employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works as an insider at a bank job that is going badly and killing his wife. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the detective's wife who killed him. Hundreds of police are mobilized to prevent him from coming to the place of residence of the intended person who has been transferred to another location. However, in the final moments of the movies, we might be standing behind the victim (behind the victim), who somehow had the impression of taking a bus back to the house was a reasonable move), while a company watched policemen and was disputing what action should be taken. Sound absurd? You should see it. That's all and much more. <br /> <br /> Lucien Ballard's camera work does a decent job of revitalizing the suburbs with Noir, but editing is lewd and informal, and it loses its suspense and tempo. As Poole, Wendell Corey is the best that has allowed him to evoke great sympathy when switching from gentle soul to murderer. Apart from these attributes, Killer fails uniformly in construction and execution, which makes his message clear. Go Western Old Budd.
