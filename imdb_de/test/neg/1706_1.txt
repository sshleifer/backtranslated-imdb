This is a movie that revolves around two puzzles (which I have now demystified). <br /> <br /> Did the filmmakers understand the concept of "parody" before bombing the audience with bombs throughout the movie? Parody is when a reproduction tries to deride, comment or pay homage to the original work through self-deprecating humor. In other words, there should be reasons to parody such works, and they should be wise in any case. I have not seen anything in the movie. I've seen some terrible 10-second jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I was drunk last night, saw Survivors and had this brain for a DVD release, I want you on board without reading the script ... because I'd like to direct this movie without one! "<br /> <br /> And here's the second puzzle: Eric Roberts career. I always thought Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now I realize that he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career he had). After watching this movie, it would have been obviously better for him if he had opted for established adult films, the higher budget, ... more intense ... scenes and roles, better acting and directing, a more elaborate and captivating plot lines and reject a much wider audience than this B-movie (C-movie?).
