I've seen some awful book-to-film adaptations in my time, but this one surpasses them all! The bizarrely unattractive cast has a negative effect on the story, which in itself does not correspond to the book. Mr. Tilney does not look good; As for Catherine Morland, a rat-like performance makes this heroine hard to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is not like the Aphrodite you read about in the original text, and James Morland does not appear in the movie much enough to make the viewer understand his important role in the story. As others have pointed out, this novel was meant to drive the gothicity that prevailed to Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft horror" movie is designed and should be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen will show up in her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed with this terrible interpretation of what a joke should be.
