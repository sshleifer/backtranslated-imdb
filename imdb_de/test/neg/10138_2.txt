Reba is a very stupid show. You can pretty much predict everything that is happening right now. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a figure. A show like this should at least have someone who resembles a real person. I think Barbra Jean represents a backward person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show and she's still stupid. Everyone is stupid! That's my opinion about Reba. Since I've said everything I can say about this show, I'll just pick up the next lines of text by saying what I'm saying right now and do it until there are 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.
