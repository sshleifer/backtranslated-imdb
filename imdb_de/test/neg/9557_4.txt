The film was due to be released in 2002 and was much anticipated due to the promos, but was released in 2003 after the producer died. <br /> <br /> The movie is partly good, but overall it's not great <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are fine, but the other scenes are not well made. <br /> <br /> The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood, and although this was planned before release, the originality has been lost <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria disappointed with KACHCHE DAAGE overall <br /> < br /> Music is good, but too many songs were late and his acting looks boring. Rani is good. Sonali is good too
