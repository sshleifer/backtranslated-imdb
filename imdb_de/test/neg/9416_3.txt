Mario Van Peebles attempts to follow the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who takes AWOL to save himself, even if the government does not put it down. Therefore, Van Peebles protects the villagers from the village rebel forces and defeats an improved version of himself in this disappointing movie. This blatant rip-off from Universal Soldier (which is way more fun than that) simply can not go anywhere. The main problem is that the movie is so incredibly sluggish. Van Peebles is just waiting around and there just is not enough ass kicking to justify a visit. On the other hand, the film is somewhat similar to a competent version of R.O.T.O.R, even though this horribly bad movie was hilarious, this movie only occasionally laughs in its ridiculously unconvincing action sequences. As with R.O.T.O.R, it makes no sense in his narrative and basically the movie is incredibly boring. In addition, the bad guys are disappointingly weak and the film basically requires an active action scenario because the material is too boring. Solo is a very weak movie in every way. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Poor)
