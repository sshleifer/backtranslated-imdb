Family Guy. When the show first aired, it was fresh, original, and actually pretty funny. Now I stopped to look at it. It has become one of the worst shows on TV, combining comic and witty jokes and the hope that any joke with the word "slut" can be funny. Seth Macfarlane seems to be having problems with himself, and he is obviously responding to the 13-year-old boy audience. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand how something that started so funny is so different from anything else that plunges into this terrible mess of a "comedy" show. I have seriously heard better one-liners from a pud-comic. <br /> <br /> It's really sad to see great shows fail, and watch how it goes on. Either Seth Macfarlane has stopped trying or he thinks this show is weird the way it is. <br /> <br /> Either way, God help us. <br /> <br /> I hate this show and will do it dancing an Irish jig when it's finally canceled.
