***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really awful. This woman deceives her employers from the beginning and then tears them apart selfishly. In the end, you can see her doing a job she had learned from the father of her "pupil". I put the student in quotation marks because the governess never really seems to teach the child anything. She seems to hate her and can not bear to be near her. I was sorry for the little girl who just wanted to be loved, except that it was understandable that she would say things to attract attention with the governess who hated her student and manipulated and betrayed her employers. I just could not do it. This was not the story of a self-made woman, but it was a window in the head of a human being who used other people at every opportunity without thinking of other people outside of his family. I did not like the governess! That was a really horrible movie. I only paid a dollar for it, but even that was too much!
