The third and final big movie, taken from the very popular ITV sitcom of the early '70s, is HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES as tough and rough as the previous two efforts, and three and a half decades later, from a point of view, it really is It is amazing that only one film was produced in this series. <br /> <br /> What makes the story all about is the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and grumpy autocratic Inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) following their layoffs from their regular bus depot jobs , They find all work in similar positions in a summer camp with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins) joining it. <br /> <br /> British cinema enjoyed a deserved and respectable reputation for high quality in the 1960s, but much of it was due to US financial support and guidance, which unfortunately ended in the early 1970s , After that, notable native titles (including GET CARTER) were found to have very few excitions) were as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and British cinema went the way of cheaper, sloppier and witty sex comedies (The CONFESSIONS series, COME PLAY WITH ME ) and weak, elongated celluloid versions of various television broadcasts. mostly sitcoms (this is one of many vile examples). Only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE were quite respectable in this respect, and the bizarre success of the first ON THE BUSES movie (it was the biggest blockbuster of 1971, thoughtless to think of now!) Led to two more sequels. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the TV series itself had a joyous, mature, non-PC vulgarity that was reasonably bearable in a half-hour sitcom form, but stretched to three times the length, taxed them the patience beyond belief. It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS has produced this effort, as it literally resembles a horror movie, with ancient puns, hackneyed, badly timed slapstick, and horrible, lazy production values. <br /> <br /> A chance to send the cheese up to the UK holiday camp is completely wasted here in favor of the above items, and it's extremely bizarre, if not cruel, to see that the obvious 50 year-old Varney and the boring Grant, who just has something, young women are barely in their early twenties while they are constantly laughing at their own bravos and lame jokes. The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (of STEPTOE AND SON), who gifted the older woman ugly, also does not help and even though the movie lasts about 1 and a half an hour it draws to an endlessly depressing degree. Fortunately, this was the last movie in this gruesome film trilogy, and the TV series itself ended around the same time, followed by a sequel in 1975 (DO NOT DRINK THE WATER, shot at by critics all around) and was ignored by the audience). Most of the major players involved had not been seen much after that, but Bob Grant was the worst affected for many years by other mental problems, Commi A sad coda for a sitcom that was one of the most popular of her time (she did not age too well) and should have stayed that way, instead of the three financially successful, but artistically hopeless big-screen hybrids that diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of its TV counterpart. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: two and a half out of ten.
