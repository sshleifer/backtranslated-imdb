I initially focused on Paranormal State because I find (more or less) the paranormal search genre interesting, if not at all. <br /> <br /> I really like Ghost Hunters because over half of their investigation leads to being totally debunked and find Most Haunted hilarious with its use of middle-aged and frumpy British women with Paris Hilton Day Glo eyes who are terrified / demonic presence faint and all are recorded in a beautiful night vision green. Paranormal state has nothing of this appeal. It feels like cobbled together from "leads" rejected by Ghost Hunters. The episodes ranged from trailer garbage families and single mothers with emo teenagers sitting around and frightening to an "interview" with a 5-year-old girl about the monster living in his room (the monster goes to RAWRRR, we are told ). All of these people are calling for a college club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his enormous ego. He leads his troop around with doe-eyed coeds, except when a case is classified as "too extreme," and orders them to stay in the HAHAHA hotel. Leave it to the professionals, ie yourself. <br /> <br /> The ignorant comedy of this show is all about how gullible the participants are. Ryan tells how he was hunted down, followed by a demon he met for the first time when the Catholic Church recruited him to assist in one case. I'm sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do that, they do not need Quiznos' Tag Shift Manager to fix their 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is awful, A & E for bankrolling pity This stupidity trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal shows. It's almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and charismatic that it's worth the effort to watch the show long enough to make fun of it.
