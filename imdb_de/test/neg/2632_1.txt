This movie was so bad, I could not even watch the end. Milo's voice was too low and I could not understand what he was saying, as well as a few lines from Kendra. And where did he get all these wedding dresses from? it was very impractical. The movie could not go into more detail about Milo's drowning and how he got drunk. Jeter and his practice ridiculed. All in all, I was disappointed that I could not rate this film as zero, because when I rated it as one, I felt I praised it undeservedly.
