Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie, you have to see it, I think. It contains all those "scary parts where nothing happens", "the nerd who is not actually killed", "the boys and girls who come together and survive", "an old child fear" and so on ... I can go on , I wanted to watch this movie because I taught the mix of a video game and a movie. I think I was wrong. What makes the movie more bearable? It is only 1 hour and 17 minutes. So if you get bored, this might be a good idea, even if I'm rather bored. Why not see it absolutely? Frankie Munitz aka Malcolm is a nerd-type just irritating. I could beat that guy and it's so sad he did not die earlier and in the end he even comes back. See something else!
