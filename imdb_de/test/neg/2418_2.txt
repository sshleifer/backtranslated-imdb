Where should I start? This movie is very entertaining if you do not know the wonderful rugby game yet. But if you live outside the US and follow the game, it's ridiculous. Various rugby traditions such as the "Haka", which is preformed by the New Zealand "All Blacks" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and was abused and presented by the author. The film itself is pretty well directed, but it's the bad script and the overall performance that leave it hard. The consideration is based on a real story, it has many clich√©s in the plot. I would strongly suggest that any American who is interested in rugby watch this movie and then see on youtube what rugby is, since the rugby shown in this movie is as distorted and distorted as it is really is.
