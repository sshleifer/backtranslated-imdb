Soultaker was written by Vivian Schilling. It also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what role Soultaker will play in this film. <br /> <br /> Next, the college-age young people are preparing for a summer party appropriately called "Summerfest." In this film, the class struggle is omnipresent throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class and the boys are from about the middle or lower grade. Class roles, for some reason, seem to play a role in the film, which is not really clear or relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> At the Summerfest, we learn more about the obvious class struggles, why Zach is not so encouraged to meet Natalie. Soultaker also appears, apparently his boss is the Angel of Death. Here D'Zar's character shows who should die and who should be taken by souls. It has also been shown that Soultaker will have a character conflict with Natalie and how he deals with her because of someone in his past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie is excluded from her ride to the Summerfest and Zach is convinced to drive her home with them. On the way home, Soultaker takes an active role, causing them to collapse horribly at high speeds. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story surrounds the Soultaker who collects the souls of the dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie try to outwit them. He should return to their bodies so they can live on. The class and character conflicts are in history, but are never really brought to the fore or solved. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to take some of the drama towards the end of the drama, there is a lot of hunting and running that is really boring. It is not really acceptable, and it would have been nice if it had been handled differently, perhaps to increase the drama, but not to bore the public. <br /> <br /> The story and the drama are decent. The soundtrack is fine and even the production values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar does a good job as Angel of Death in his brief appearance on the screen. Joe Estevez is okay, but his role sometimes seems a bit flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job as Natalie, though she may have played a bit more in a few scenes. <br /> <br /> This may sound funny, but this film could definitely have benefited from a senseless nudity. Vivian teases us a bit, but that was not enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a pretty serious attempt to make a movie. The results are worthwhile. Just do not expect perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
