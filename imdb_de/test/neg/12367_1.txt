Get your camcorder, your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door, who throws boiling water at raccoons; and you have a movie! Well, the guys thought anyway. It was so bad that I can not remember the majority, except for flashbacks that are like someone who toured in Nam. Despite the really crazy title, terrible quality, terrible actor and clich√©, I think this movie is not the worst I've ever seen. I save this slot for everything with Steven Seagal, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Dam. If you're out of options when it comes to finding new horror movies that you have not seen (like I already did) 1,000 times and you're debating it, I'd still skip that. it had absolutely no redeeming qualities. This apparent serial killer thriller was a feeble, shitty attempt at a steady B-movie. If you're really lucky, the Wal-Mart could be $ 4.50. but I doubt it very much.
