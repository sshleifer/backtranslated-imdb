Do not be misled. This is NOT a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and hires them all: the good and the terrible. Yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it's basically an artistic fart-like exercise in existentialist fear, which is a long way to say it's boring. If you've been working hard all day and want to spend a few hours talking, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" has inexpensive special effects, mediocre drama and somber dialogues. All of this is understandable in a low-budget and indie movie, and I can forgive such shortcomings as long as a movie has a fun story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" hardly has a story. Moreover, acting is not as ridiculously bad as it does not exist. All the actors seem to have studied at the Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would she have been killed to show emotions? (And no, screaming does not match the feeling). The one character who actually had a bit of fun was killed first. Granted, there was another character that kept my interest short. He looked and behaved as if Kyle McLachlan was channeling Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a little detail: film is a VISUAL medium. This means that you illuminate your scenes so well that the viewer can actually see what's going on. All those artistic jumps and close-ups might have been cool at the time, but all they did was watch the movie terrible and confusing. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear way. Just take a look at George Romero's low-budget Night of the Living Dead to see how it works. And I know these people had a small budget, but if you can not hire the equipment and technicians to make the dialogue audible, just make a silent movie (then these wooden faces of Buster Keaton actually work). <br /> <br /> I'll say that for the movie: The zombies were scary. Unlike most zombie movies, where the undead are shown in all their decaying fame, the zombies here are just bloody, bloody faces, the bigger the better. It actually worked to make it more like us and therefore scary. That's why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that "Rise of the Undead", despite all its shortcomings, does not offend your intelligence. The filmmakers wanted to do a smart, scary original movie, and it's a shame they failed so miserably. If they could just go without the extravagant editing, buy a few extra light bulbs that could boost dialogue and find a real story that actually goes somewhere, they have the talent to do something really good. <BR /> <br /> Trust me, do not waste your time on Rise of the Undead.
