In the dusty town of Furlough, Texas, an animal kills cattle and the locals. When teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, her friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), her Mexican-American friend Miguel Gonzalez (Jimmy Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) realize that a Mexican Werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and they are planning a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is a whimsical crap and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: The script is ridiculous, with some of the most frightening lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". The amateurish acting seems to be a joke of high school students or a high school. The "special effects" are cruel and extremely bad, and the "werewolf" is the cheapest I've ever seen. Ed Wood films are cult, but this "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is garbage. In the end, Jill says nobody can resist their teats (actually the most beautiful in this movie). But I think the right quote should be, "No man (or woman) can refuse to see this movie to the end." I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be, and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I believe that most viewers will stop in less than 20 minutes. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("A Mexican Werewolf in Texas")
