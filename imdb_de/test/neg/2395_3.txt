The love and human remains of Denys Arcand is a hideously wretched film, as it is completely different from the kind of films he has made during his career. Making another film is not a bothering affair A movie by a master is completely out of tune, then it's a really bad event. The movie starts with a good grade as tension is created. In the course of the film, what is shown is just a senseless attempt to create something meaningful, as Arcand shows us half a dozen strange, quirky characters whose lives are intertwined. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequences here. Even more annoying is the feeling of guilt that relates to the characters who are unsure about their feelings for each other and their sexuality. Such a movie would be interesting for some who want to see another Denys Arcand movie All in all, there certainly would not be many buyers for this movie.
