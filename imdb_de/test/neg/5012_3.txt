This movie is supposed to be a comedy. So where did all the laughs go? Forgetting to bring them to the version I was looking at. As a football film, it is mildly entertaining mud, with no apparent sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is just not funny. He's also annoying, so "you're a winner" part. For most of the season, it was just the last two games, and the last game meant nothing, since they were not in the playoffs. What's the point? Do they celebrate mediocrity? I do not see it. If anyone knows, let me know. Anyway, this movie is not great or not very good. I give the movie 3 *
