When I saw this movie three years ago, I thought it illustrated many of the features found in Singapore's art-house films: slow, with a minimum of plot and dialogue, depending on the film composition, for it to work. <Br /> <br /> During the time of the local movie stars, the inability to appreciate "Be With Me" is synonymous with moving "Citizen Kane" or one of Ozu's last films. I have no idea how "Be With Me" has reached such high points in Singapore's cinematic consciousness, but I always feel that Khoo's "12 Storeys" is a better movie, even though the latter does not have as good a cinematographer as Adrian Tan, Khoos DP for "Be with Me". "12 Storeys" has a story that better suits most Singaporeans, and also has bite, something that "Be With Me" does not have aloof sadness. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is basically just a trio of stories assembled into a film by Khoo and his screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. It is a guard who falls in love with a girl whom he sees only in the distance. two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of the deafblind Teresa Chan. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is very well received by Tan with a varicam camera. The film compositions are masterful. The movie is almost silent and has almost no dialogue. Characters move in an unrealistic way, but almost as if they were models under the guidance of a director, who almost always look into the screen and feel emotional: either loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, the characters do not act against each other. This kind of movie has been seen many times: in Tsai Ming-liang's films, in Khoo's protégé Royston Tan "4:30" and elsewhere. Unfortunately, I do not like its slowness (essentially less plot) and the use of a Lento piano soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The criticism of "Be With Me" seems to almost negate the inspiring story behind it, that of Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf and yet leads a fulfilling life, but I'm afraid this movie does me not much. I'm ready to compliment Chan's steadfast and courageous march in life and Tan's impressive cinematography. However, to treat the same subject with more flesh (without the other two boring and distracting subplots), try Werner Herzog's Land of Silence and Darkness "(1971).
