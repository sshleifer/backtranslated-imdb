overvalued, poorly written, badly traded. did the academy even see that? I do not think so. the political content guaranteed him an Oscar nomination - indo-pak border - a little boy, terrorism. Everything related to the word "terrorist" attracts attention in this world after 9/11. It's like Holocaust films that guarantee an Oscar nomination regardless of their merit. <br /> <br /> and please Cinematography does not mean taking pictures of landscapes that are beautiful in the first place. You must be a lazy shooter to make the desert pretty. At least this did not win the Oscar. at least they understood that correctly. would have been a travesty.
