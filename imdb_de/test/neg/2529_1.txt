I can not believe it Was it crazy to do a film about Connecticut in Southern California? For God's sake, there are palm trees everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, a man says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws down a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut has no "Herald" but "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND THE GREENWICH TIMES". (See the newspaper Stamford, Connecticut). Maybe the filmmakers should have researched a bit, I mean, my God, at least to say the name of the newspaper correctly or to film in places that at least look like Connecticut.
