The role of Buddy Ackerman is not an issue for Kevin Spacey. He has played many other, better films of this version. That's a blessing, because it gives his performance a certain resonance, without which the buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all the other characters in this senseless little farce. The script leaves little time for the development of actions or characters, similar to a pornographic film in its hurry to get to the "good things". The difference is that the "good stuff" here is not the people who delight each other but inflict pain, making it appropriate for young adults. <br /> <br /> Of course there is nothing wrong with a porno film if you want to look at people in sex, and I think there is nothing wrong with "swimming with sharks" when you want to observe the physical to undergo emotional and mental torture. But if you are looking for impressive satire, interesting characters, or anything else that even tries to occupy more than your bitterest passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
