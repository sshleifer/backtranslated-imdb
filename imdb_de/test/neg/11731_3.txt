The first criticism I've seen in IMDB is that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins in that role. I wonder if he saw the original. It's hard to review psycho if you do not know how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a hero who is not very likable and is not killed much in the movie, and a villain who's scary but feels good for him. Add some graphic violence and you have a blueprint for some of the Slasher Films of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> Where is this movie going wrong? Let's start with the casting. Anne Heche is doing well as Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is completely wrong. For one thing, he looks too young. Second, he has no idea how to play the role. His nervous laugh reminds me that Ron Howard was trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he does, I scream! The original film, even for those who know all about it, still makes you uncomfortable about the influence of the mother on Norman and makes her a real stand-alone character. How about the shower scene? When I finally saw the film from 1960 on a big screen, I was surprised how much I was able to scare me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes unbelievably shrill and loud and goes on towards fear as Danny Elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. This shower scene only serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and a beautiful colored blood. Which brings us to the choice to film in color. Did not work. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with the remake of classic films, which seems to be barely working. Some may consider this a noble experiment, but if Gus Van Sant could not add anything to the film, he should have left it alone
