Countless historical and cultural mistakes 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jewish man named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) A brilliant detective was released by the little intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers !! That was funny. (4) Hitler and his top guns watched a movie in downtown Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt outperformed and it was painful to watch him. (6) Mr. QT rewrites the story: "Hitler was killed in a theater? Really!" The funny thing is that the people "and I mean stupid people" of this conspiracy will actually believe. <br /> <br /> And finally, everyone can tell me how this movie made it among the 250 best movies of all time !!! Pity, shame, shame, still wondering, how can anyone like this movie.
