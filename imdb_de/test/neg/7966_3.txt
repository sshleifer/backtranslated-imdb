There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a seriously talented director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and can still be regarded highly today. This list might include the 39 Steps, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, Dizziness, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt and some other movies. <br /> <br /> However, "suspicion" is not aging well at all and is really so unsurpassed that it seems to me that it was probably a bad movie even after 1941. The list of scenes that work well could be listed on a matchbook with a crayon. The script is casual and ridiculous most of the time, but acting seems to be so wooden and borderline it's almost unbelievable. Joan Fontaine tries to support things, but she's on a slippery slope and Cary Grant does not offer much support. His acting is sometimes so bad that I have seen better performances in high school or theater experience classes in college where a chemical engineer is for the first time acting without formal training. After about 30 minutes If you watch this movie, you can grab the DVD case in the dark to see if you've accidentally purchased a special edition version that has been cobbled together without editing. <br /> <br /> The topic is serious, but the film has a stupid and banal feeling that just seems so inappropriate that you become numb in surprise. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" is basically incomparable and another very, very overvalued BAD.
