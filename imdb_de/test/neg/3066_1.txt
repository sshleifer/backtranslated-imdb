I rented this pile of sewage hoping for some good laughs. With a title like "Zombie Bikers of Detroit" and with Dead Alive productions on the front page, you would think that this could be a funny / cruel movie, but no. This is the worst movie I have ever seen (and yes, I have seen all the films of the Police Academy). The story (that's a joke in itself) and the dialogue are cruel. The make-up of the so-called zombies looks like they've used one of those two-dollar sets that can be bought like a zombie kit from K-Mart. I'd Hate to Watch Beverly Hills 90210 Listen to the Backstreet Boys and get whipped by a 400-pound birthday card novelty card, than to sit another minute of that pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I could make a better movie with $ 3, some popsicles and a slinky. I feel like I have been taken 90 minutes of my life and taken to the land of Suckdom. I know that marking the Dead Alive production does not guarantee a great movie, but you expect you to be worth your money (elephant dung) was that it was not titled "Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh". I feel for Detroit people who have wasted their hard earned money on this money. Unless you were lobotomized? Do not you buy, rent, if you have to? But ??. You will regret it.
