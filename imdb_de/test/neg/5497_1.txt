A movie that is so stupid should never see the light of day. Acting is lame, violence is just about everywhere, the creeping end is just stupid. Squad. No one has ever seen him, not even the men he met. So he and a beautiful woman are on the run to be the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. Squad before they find her. <br /> <br /> Then the movie goes on to romance, rifle shooting and voodoo. Well, hell, how did Voodoo get involved? Never watch this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me !!!!!!!!
