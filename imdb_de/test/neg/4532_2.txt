This is a poorly written and badly directed short film, pure and simple. What's interesting and lets me keep watching was the production value. Recorded on video, it appears with a bad script and a bad direction, one would think it would have a terrible production value. The viewer expects that when he sees a movie that is horrible and taped on video. BUT not in this case, they spent some money and it shows up. It makes me very mild to see what would come next, just to see! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst short film I've ever seen looked like it was a big budget Hollywood, even though it was shot in some sort of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the amount of money they spent on a rather impressive set design, it would have been nicer to see a better story with a good direction. But how can we expect new filmmakers, if not Hollywood?
