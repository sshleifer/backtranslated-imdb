For a horror movie, this is criminally boring. A few memorable, gruesome parts can not balance a really bad script. Coherence is barely achieved, and the film relentlessly trumps its one basic idea (a killer cat) until it repeats itself, and things are compounded by the constant use of strokes from the cat's point of view.
