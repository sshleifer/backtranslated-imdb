"Curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece that a fan of the Halloween series has to deal with. After a very disappointing crash in Halloween 5, the series reached an almost ebbic plot, with a stupid degeneration in witchcraft and a youthful cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "Curse of Michael Myers" increases blood and blood use, but actually breaks the integrity of the series. It's a pity, as this is the final movie for Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good moments on the screen (precious moments if you're a fan of the series), as the now very aged and "very retired doctor" is called. Unfortunately, he died before the film was completed, and it is very obvious that the original climatic scene of the stories was never realized. Halloween 6 feels more like a TV movie from the start than the Block Buster horror movie that started in 1978. All loyal Halloween alumni should demand more from this film. ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance have earned more.
