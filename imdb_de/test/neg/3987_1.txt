This should take place in the "Bible Belt" of Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there and was a kid in the time shown in the movie, it just did not seem to be true! The accents were everywhere - everything except County Antrim / Derry. The church was not like anyone I've ever seen. "The Church of God" is a Pentecostal community, but the film was certainly not a Pentecostal community! The senior minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican) - and no C. of I. would call himself "The Church of God". The minister was often referred to as a "reverend" - they may do so in some parts of the world, but I never heard it while living in the area. The ministers were addressed as "Mr. ......". <br /> <br /> This film was very poorly researched and staffed - quite typical of Irish cinema - annoying! A movie can have a great storyline, but if it does not look authentic, it's garbage.
