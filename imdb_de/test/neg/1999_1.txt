That was sci-fi last weekend and I had to try it. After all ... it was science fiction with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could go wrong with this B-movie? <br /> <br /> Much. <br /> <br /> First of all, it can not even be classified as a "B-movie" I would put it in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this movie does not even live up to its expectations. Most of the money they spent was contact lenses for the vampires. Second, the casting was horrible. Yes, it was a clever move to occupy Udo Kier as captain of the Demeter ... but the director obviously could not even get Kier to remember his lines. The casting of Eleniak in a vampire movie is also a smart move, because it means that a lot of horny guys will buy / rent / record this strip to see how she gets seduced by a vampire. But the director, author and producer has screwed up too. Granted, they've taken some money from the poor, unhappy souls who love seeing vampire movies with hot women ... but no one will remember that movie in two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third, trifles that only underline the laziness in this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross a "crucifix," and when Mina is put in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that her "chest" is nothing more than a cushion. Oh, and another thing: why did you choose the George Hamilton-type Dracula instead of something that looks pretty scary? Does George Hamilton have an overwhelming impact on our future? Why did not all those who saw Dracula laugh at him for his makeup? <br /> <br /> Waste of time. Also with a TiVo remote control in the hand.
