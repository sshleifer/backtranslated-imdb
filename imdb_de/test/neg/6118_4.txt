1993 was a turnaround in the WWE, but for these Wrestlemania they decided to turn back the clock when Hulk Hogan returned with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who was out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990. <br /> <br /> This was not a great event. Only two games had a real build, and the whole thing seemed to be hectic. The action in the ring was not great and the turn at the end, which I'll talk about later, was not really the shattering moment the WWE hoped. <br /> <br /> This memorable night began with Shawn Micheals defending his intercontinental championship against undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a couple of times that had led to the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by Michaels' former manager and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels retained his title and went straight into his feud with Marty Janetty, who had been put back only for Wrestlemania. I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Next, the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) saw the headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) defeated by Scott after Scott met with the Frankensteiner Samu. Good game. <br /> <br /> The clown needed the help of another clown to win his match against Crush. A second Doink distracted Crush when he had complete control and allowed Doink to get the pin and win. Doink was an entertaining gimmick character who was getting old pretty fast. Razor Ramon easily defeated returning Bob Backlund in the next game. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the first in our double home event. When Hulk Hogan's Mega Maniacs team and Brutus Beefcake, with their recently shot good Jimmy Hart in their corner, hit Harts former buddies Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a pretty sketchy ending. Beefcake had, as mentioned, a parachute accident requiring complete facial surgery and had overgrown the match with a face mask. Shyster tore off his mask and beat beefcake into mush. The referee went downstairs, Hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster. Then Hart, who wore a referee shirt, counted the three. Another ref came to the end and lifted the decision. The winners of Money Inc were explained by DQ. <br /> <br /> Next, we met Lex Luger or the Narcissist because he was also known at the time he defeated Mr. Perfect. This match came about because Luger was led by former Perfect Bobby Heenan manager. When he was pinned, his feet were perfect, but the referee missed it. The Undertaker won a lackluster DQ victory in a pretty bad match against the Giant Gonzales. The Undertaker had won the honorary title of Gonzales manager Harvey Wippleman in 1992, and Taker had defeated his great monster Kamala in the Survivor Series. Wippleman vowed revenge and attacked the Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Taker and cost him the match. Gonzales dominated the Undertaker in this match, but was in for strangling Taker with chloroform. Funny ending to a bad match. <br /> <br /> This brought us to our main event when WWE champion Bret Hart, who was seriously challenged for the first time as a champion, put his title against Mr. Fuji's unstoppable monster yokozuna on the line. Yokozuna controlled the early steps, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had yokozuna in the sniper, he would surely give in and Hart would establish himself as a heroic hero after defeating the great monster. But Fuji had other ideas: he had thrown salt into Hart's face and made the Canadian helpless when yokozuna got the pin. <br /> <br /> What a downer. But wait, here comes Hulk Hogan. He checks Hart if he's okay. Suddenly, Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE title. Hogan accepted. Fuji throws salt at Hogan, but hits yokozuna instead. Hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. What have I just seen? And so most fans thought on the night we saw that Hart had either established himself as a giant killer, or yokozuna as an unstoppable monster, instead we saw Hulk Hogan win a meaningless title. A title he would not defend for three months. In fact, this was the only game Hogan had played for the WWE in June 1993 before the King of the Ring PPV.
