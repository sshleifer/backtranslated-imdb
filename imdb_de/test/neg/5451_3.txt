I wish it was "Last Dumb Thriller". But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical and often annoying. You want to be so desperately taken seriously, but what can you take seriously with the behavior of a child or the act of a thriller? I saw this special kid - I mean ... Thriller - I understand why critics call it a "Hitchcockian thriller"; You might as well have called it "idiotic" because "Hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (look, if you do not believe me). Even the soundtrack is Old School Hollywood, which is a mistake: it does not fit into a movie of the late 70s and makes it fake. Besides, how dare you steal De Palma's idea of ​​stealing Hitchcock ?! The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed, and her murderers are never an issue. Instead, his former employers follow him first and decide to kill him. Why do you decide to kill him? No explanation. Maybe because the FBI is a dark, dark organization ("X-Files"), which is very happy to shut down its former employees for the sake of the pension fund. Or maybe because it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; Everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor, unsuspecting spectator tries to solve the puzzle by logically assuming that there is a big conspiracy, the killer is actually ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman occupies Scheider's residential district; the one that briefly indicated that she was "spoiled." Why does she persecute Scheider at a time when his wife was murdered and he feels paranoid - being persecuted by his own former employers - and not just a few years earlier or a few years after the woman's murder? A pure Hitchcockian (check the dictionary if you forget what it means) Random. And how about this brilliant motive ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a newlywed 15-year-old virgin in New York and then syphilized by a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of them - tah-dah! - is Scheider's grandfather. As a result, in her spare time, Margolin (among others) played a hooker to kill all descendants of the men who had so cruelly syphilized their once so virgin grandmother. How hitchcockian is that? The finale shamelessly tears off the scene of Mount Rushmore from "North By Northwest," except that the love interest is a killer and she is not saved -kilter dialogue and something not so great acting. Take a look at the stupid and obvious way Napier Scheider follows in the cemetery. Let's not forget the moronic conspiracy device Napier grabbed for his jacket and held his hand very suspicious - but it was not a weapon! How genius! Napier in the Tower: Now there are a number of illogical patterns of behavior. J. Demme was, is and always will be a director with no style, no flair and the man who directed "Philadelphia". Let's give him an Oscar!
