This movie was so bad that I do not know where to start, apparently not with the filmmakers. It starts with a man between the ages of thirty and forty watching TV. The news reports a corn maze open for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God knows what and crashes the salvation of his children who run into a cornfield labyrinth and are somehow linked to this "vision". How do you ask? I do not know, and as I said, the filmmakers do not. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did he get these "visions"? It is never explained, we should just join in. He enters the labyrinth to find his two lost daughters, and twice the girls he seeks run right past him, once they actually meet him. What does he do? Is he chasing after them? He stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just walked by. Do the girls stop? No. They run away and ask, "Was that Dad?" Then someone dressed as a demon jumps on the "star" (the character of the father), whom he beats in a pitiful fight, only to find out that he is a worker in the confused labyrinth. The police are called and after finding the "star" (which is really a bad term), they handcuff him. They tie his hands in front of him, so he can find something to choose the lock with. First, anyone who has ever been arrested knows that the cops tie their hands behind their backs, and secondly, why does this "average person" seem to know how to put the cuffs on? Well, he finally gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a "star" woman triggers the siren in the police car as a distraction. By the way, it is night now, and all the workers who run the labyrinth apparently left after sunset. He left a man in the labyrinth who had attacked one of his workers and two missing children. Considering that it was a slow night, these were the only customers, why not. Besides, the cops seem to have better things to do. By the way, the "star", which is called "Walker", we find out that it is his surname, a name under which his wife even calls him. Somehow he knows something is buried in this corn field labyrinth and starts to dig. I say 'somehow' because I could not figure out why he even started digging. He finds a medallion, what does it mean? Not for someone watching, but for him it's an indication of a crime. Someone killed his children in his "vision," and I think that's what he does, real detective work. He now knows that the maize labyrinth has a murderer he knew was present from the beginning of the film. That's why he's looking for his girls. Every time we see the murderer or the killer's feet, we hear a strange robot sound, like a sci-fi rejection toy that turns a human's voice into a mechanical sound. Why do we hear that sound? Does it have anything to do with ... anything? Who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The culmination of all the bad drama and the bad dialogue was when "Walker" shouted, "Hey you, Mr. Bad Man ... I'll get you." Another time his wife is attacked by the "Bad Man" at the entrance of the corn labyrinth, which, as I have already mentioned, is strangely empty of staff or police. The "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he intends to kill his wife, his children and also him. "Walker" can only with "Hey, Hey!" Reply. before he dropped his phone and ran away. With no one talking at the other end, the killer drops his cell phone, pulls the woman up a few feet and leaves her alone for the rest of the movie, losing the first opportunity to stick to his treats. If this script was not written by a child, I would be surprised. Opps was not. It was written, staged and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he's also done so much of the shitty camerawork where we get random shots of feet running through the muddy labyrinth, and pointless shots of the cornfield that waste 90% of the movie time. In the end, "Walker" uses the cuffs to tie the "Bad Man", who also knows how to pick locks with the same metal object as "Walker". Apparently, many small metal objects are around this corn field. But after the killer insists, he will still kill the children. "Walker" kills the "Bad Man" and everything is right again with the world. In fact, this makes "Walker" a murderer, he killed a man who "allegedly" murdered his own daughters and tried to kill his own. He knows that, not because of the evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a body, nobody knows that guy was in the labyrinth at all. And the medallion? He gives it back to the spirits of the two dead girls. No proof. So he kills a man for no tangible reason. I can not imagine what the filmmakers thought here. It must have been a way to cover up misappropriation of funds for the production company. I would rather watch the Blair Witch Project five times than watch this movie again. The actors should be ashamed. The director / producer / author / cameraman should also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If somebody is in touch with this movie, please answer. What did you think you were doing?
