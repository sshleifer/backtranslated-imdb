The movie begins with a Spiderman parody that is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell from "Drake & Josh", personally I would have given the movie to Josh, who is a lot funnier) and the "Rick Punchers" saying is lifted directly out of the plane, so that the authors obviously already the barrel for ideas for this film searched. Rick's class is on a scientific journey into the Amalgamated Genetics lab and here we meet the first star name of the movie, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG), who plays Dr Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, from which his powers come. <br /> <br /> We meet our next big names at Rick's house, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross from Happy Days) and uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson from Airplane, Police Squad & Naked Gun fame). And we are introduced to Carlson by the Amalgamated Board of Directors (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons), who is then killed very quickly. We've heard that Rick slept for 5 days and gets some cheap, fucking, sexually oriented scenes that catch the attention of the male teenager audience. The scene of Stephen Hawking Lookalike is painful to look at and is really a bad idea that does not work and is not funny from afar. <br /> <br /> We get another Spiderman parody (Rick gets the girl and all the planets) But the movie was about to end right there when Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball that broke her skull and hers Stone would have killed dead. You see Rick's first powers (gripping ability & speed) and then his first rescue, which goes very wrong. We also get an incest reference, which is indeed very bad. We get a flashback and a Batman parody, in which we discover that Rick alone is responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Rick's uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (by Hellboy) as a hospital doctor. We then get an X-Men parody (very bad, because Patrick Stewart is as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by another lookalike. <br /> <br /> We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson) in her costume!). Rick's first outing in his costume (once he has fixed his ability to see it and take a deep breath) is another Batman parody. The youtube interview clip by Tom Cruise is played by another lookalike (and not very good either). There are many modern references such as Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia, all of which show that the movie is playing in the modern age. There is a weak, gay joke (never a good idea) when Jill Aunt Lucille helps at the Thanksgiving dinner and the piss scene is not particularly funny, just infantile. <br /> <br /> The Aunt Fart scene is not terribly funny, just unbelievably childish. Anyone who finds it funny must have a mental age of about 12 years. She is killed and then we have a really bad necrophiliac joke (is not there an issue that these people will not try to get a cheap laugh for?), At their funeral, and the even worse cremation joke. <br /> <br /> We'll get the 2 worst lookalikes in the entire movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you did not know how infantile or stupid that move is, movie is Landers wins the Douchebag Of The Year ". Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl walked past Jill twice in the same direction). Obviously the hourglass is thwarted, Jill is saved from certain death and the only funny scene in the entire movie is the last.
