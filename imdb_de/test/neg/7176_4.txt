I admit that this is not a great movie. It practically screams "low-budget," but strangely, I still liked the movie because it lacked quality, but it was full of energy. It was like the Little Engine That Could and a movie that blended into a movie! <br /> <br /> The film is on a radio network and affects some of its low-level employees - two side boys (one very pushy and brash and the other a kiss) and a new receptionist. All three have visions of Radio Star, but have to settle for the time being with their low jobs. <br /> <br /> In this story, a murder appears that seems out of the blue. I did not know that this was a murder mystery movie and was a bit surprised. Like most B-Mysteries, the cops are Lambrane, and it's up to our intrusive hero (Moran) to save the day. With all this, I found it hard to decide if Moran was unpleasant or adorable. I'm still not sure !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the movie where the "cringe factor" is high. Then the two sides are tried for roles of radio comedians. They appear in Blackface and make an imitation of Amos n 'Andy in the 3rd or 4th movement. Besides being insensitive, it was not funny either. Fortunately, the producer of the show he tried seemed to feel the same way. <br /> <br /> Overall. It's easy to skip this movie and I would not blame you. However, the strange and frenetic pace of the film seemed to offset the artistic flaws of the film, and I'm glad I saw it. A good movie? But one that is still worth a look for fans of old B's. By the way, I may not have a good taste, but I thought that BOTH female vocal divas have really bad voices in spite of how everyone in the movie is fascinated by their warblings. Listen for yourself and let me know what you think. I just could not believe that you could sing in the movie - even if it was just for Monogram Studios.
