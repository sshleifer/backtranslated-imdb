Oh my. Poor Jane must have done the old roll-over-in-the-grave thing. Taking into account the bad production values ​​for the time (1971) and the format (a kind of miniseries) this is baaaaaad. Whatever you do with Austen, the dialogue should sparkle (even in this perhaps most serious work), and the melodrama should be strictly out of bounds. Unfortunately not in this production. When you come to Anne's "Frederick, Frederick, Frederick", you will either laugh or cry. If you not only visually "collect" all existing films from Austen's work, you can skip them. But if you see it, there are little points of comfort: The actresses playing Anne's sisters do a wonderful job with their roles.
