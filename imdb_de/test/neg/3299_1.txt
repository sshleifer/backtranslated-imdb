I saw the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development, boy, I was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show of "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children" was crassly demolished, as they are all similar in plot and general mood. The so-called "Punch Lines" are all repetitive and formulaic, and more, these "Poinches" are not funny at all, to me they are rather crass and rude. The main character Dave Gold looks like a white garbage racket who thinks he's funny and cool, which he is not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said so in the episode "Gaza Strip"). In the episode "Dream Crusher," Hillary wanted to become a singer (but was actually pretty bad), Dave and Vicky then decided to destroy their dreams by telling her that she was sucking. After that, she wanted to become a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard after informing Dave and Vicky and leaving the room, and the two of them started mocking her. In the first episode, Dave said about Hillary's black friend, "Does she really think we'd let her go with this guy, I'd rather drink my own urine," this line has the stupidest line in the history of television. And Dave is always making fun of Larry (his son) as he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and a geek. Let's not forget that he made fun of Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father he should definitely use for his son. Without a doubt, The War at Home is the worst TV show for families. This clearly explains why the show should be canceled as it spreads a racist and homophobic agenda. It's like the show is funny because it's always used in that stupid laugh track when someone says something, but the lines are all a bit forced, idiotic, and pathetically youthful. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the show is terrible The actors, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan, are terrible, horrible actors. Rappaport always has to move his hands when he's in front of the camera. He does this not only on this show, but also while at Boston Public. Sullivan always talks and behaves like a robot (he also did that in "Malcolm in the Middle").} To sum it up, you have all your reasons for being wrong with this show 1.It is unoriginal 2.The acting 3.It's not even funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5.Has lousy script 6.The characters are pathetic and unlikely 7.The dad is a rip-off from Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX needs this Take garbage out of the air, because everything is better than this.
