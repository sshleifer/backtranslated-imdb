This was the movie of a character. The plot was not that hot when she was there, but the characters were interesting and very good natured. The story focuses on the Travis family after the suicide of the eldest son. I say that casually, because the story is mostly about the surviving son and mother, because if the dad wanted to focus on the story, they handled the movie pretty badly. The acting was very good in all areas, especially Emile Hirsch as a surviving, confused son. The characters were all very interesting and I did not mind looking at them late in the movie than just dragging them. <br /> <br /> My big complaint though was the story. The son who killed himself should be the center of the conspiracy. It was not really. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went in all directions. Then they would mention that the son killed himself to remind you that this was the central thread. The other thing was that the big changes of action, of which there were many, were never really explained or built, but simply randomly and often thrown in from the left field. In fairness, the end was very, very cool. However, it was clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (half that was not replenished) was pretty much replaced by the story in the Pearl Jam song Alive. What reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the film allegedly written by someone who killed himself. I could not be the only one who realized that the poem was lifted word for word from the same song. I do not know, this was a movie I was hoping for, and they really dropped the ball.
