What a clunker! <br /> <br /> It MUST have been made for TV or cable. <br /> <br /> Look: Forget the script - forget the bunch of forgotten actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA / NIA / whatever or whoever he (an agent) takes off in an F16 - is shown in a F18 that sparks his courage, and later the plane being shown is an F4 Phantom! Oh, I wish I could be so easygoing. Apart from the male actors (!?) The women are WASPS: blue-eyed and leggy and can finally cry over the heroes. Even if a tight weld could save most of the Cosmoastro nauts, the blonde drops the welding tool. Moron! <br /> <br /> As SF film one in ten. As a film in itself: 1/2 (that's half a point). They should have left the space station and headed for Mars. <br /> <br /> Major raspberries.
