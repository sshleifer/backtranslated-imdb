This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set that disguises itself as a castle, to be exact) that is used as a hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same that you would see from a Cinemax softcore porn, as well as the photography, scenery, lighting and video on which they were filmed. History is a failed attempt at sincerity: There is no easier way to make the audience feel about your characters than to show them experiencing an emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trivial. Do you want an example? A blind girl who listens to a voice band that teaches the Italian words for colors begins to cry, which she will never see. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot to offer, but the monster is pretty cool, pretty scary-looking. And Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of Italian "erotic" films, has a good deal of nudity. However, the Gore leaves much to be desired as well as the acting, even by the experienced Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I only saw two other films by Stuart Gordon: Re-Animator and From In addition, both were outstanding. But I'm not going to be deterred by this little footnote in his career from seeing many of his films anymore.
