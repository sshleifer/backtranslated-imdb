There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing that you have never thought about, nothing that you have never heard before. The story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town, and people's response can be addressed in many ways, and this film has chosen the most demagogic and muddiest. One of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it's neither a movie nor a documentary. The director used the transcriptions of the original interviews and let the actors play as if it were a movie. The result is funny. And finally, in previous comments, I read that people who do not like this movie are anti-gay. I'm pretty sure those comments come from people who think they're tolerant, but do not tolerate other people not liking this movie. This is a funny world.
