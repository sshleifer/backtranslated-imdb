The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film starring Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson at MGM. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and it happened in Brooklyn. And both in Sinatra courted and lost Grayson. I think the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> For the romance maybe, but definitely not for the picture. Sinatra plays in the movies of his forties once again the beautiful little Schnook only in Toreador pants. Sinatra is the son of a man who was a hotel owner during the day, and The Kissing Bandit by night. He left California to complete an apprenticeship and came back to take daddy's place, but only in the hotel business. And where does he learn the hotel industry in Boston? <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Dad's former gang members, who are a little old and punctually led by J. Carrol Naish, want to re-direct the gang. But Frank just is not out for the outlaw life. But he makes a good impression on the governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Someone must have had Sinatra at the MGM to fill him after the bad reviews he received in Miracle of the Bells. Frank's part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But since this was a musical, I think the brain's belief in MGM was that Kathryn Grayson needed to have a singing co-star. <br /> <br /> Actually, the best movie number for them is Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse make a dance specialty that is nice. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing special. In later years, Sinatra would flinch at the mention of The Kissing Bandit, and for good reason.
