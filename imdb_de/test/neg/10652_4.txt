I just bought this movie because I like to donate to Operation Smile, the charity on which the film is based ... but I found writing the film very strange. It does not focus so much on Operation Smile or similar organizations like The Smile Train and their Hercules efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born in third world countries with facial deformities. No, it focuses on a teenage American volunteer, Katie, whose "overprivileged" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who takes her to a doctor so she can have birth control pills before sleeping with her boyfriend. What is this nonsense about birth control to do to tickle the audience? It's 2005. I'd be more surprised if a Malibu teenager had no birth control in 2005 and even if, what is and who cares? In contrast, Katie is the character of Lin in China, a girl with a facial deformity who missed the chance of undergoing surgery last year, and this year she does not want to. None of the characters is written in such a way that the audience can really identify, let alone understand the motives of one of the two girls. On the other hand, the actors adequately try to play the bad hand that the one who wrote this ridiculous screenplay has. The best performer was the gentleman who played Lin's dad, although his dialogue is mainly in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserves to be honored by a much better movie than this one!
