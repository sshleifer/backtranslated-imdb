When I saw this show for the first time on the Cartoon Network, I was uninteresting. Then I read a lot of good news about this show and decided to watch it. The show was so boring. Every episode was predictable. What's more, this show has no logic. Hypersmart girls who go to school and sometimes do stupid things start 99% of the episodes with a monster attacking Townswille, then mayor (he's a fool, he's NOT funny, he's so stupid that I can not Imagine how he became mayor, Professor, yes, it should be the smartest person on this show, but actually ... He even found no difference between Monster and his brother, and the narrator's comments make this show boring too. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and at the end, the animation is also very strange, everything except main characters is shown in an ugly way, and in each series, this series also gives you some lessons in life, and that means they are aimed at small children, but if you look closely, you will find that there is much violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
