I was thrilled with the fresh (pun intended) summary of this movie and looking forward to seeing it. The first pictures introduce some of the characters and the place where the stories take place. the garden allocation. The movie looks fantastic. Colorful and yet simple. Magical and yet genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to find out where the movie is going. We quickly realize that this will be a manipulative, juicy story illustrating a bunch of confused people facing their "nice victims" refugees, and that there will be a happy ending when the exhausted people make the mistake recognize their ways and accept people. <br /> <br /> The characters, especially the prejudices, are very "comic booky". The story focuses mainly on two refugee families. One of them is led by a single mother cruelly played by Diveen Henry. I am saddened to say that any emotion that could have been felt in their struggles was defused by a memorable bad drama. The other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. Everyone is shaken as they travel with containers to this land where his wife and mother died, but most of all the husband suffers. Benedict Wong gives an incredible performance here. At first, his emotions are very subdued, but as the story unfolds, he subtly draws our attention to the inner struggles of his character. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is extremely boring. There were so many options with this movie. There are several characters that you can track, many of which could have potential, but none of them are recognized. Worse, though this movie is not exactly Hollywood, some of the main plot threads on Hollywood B-Class are being solved cheaply. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A likes character B Character B rejects his progress No problem! Let us let character C explain that he loves her, so that we can all have a happy ending. Yawning. <br /> <br /> I really liked the storyline of the asian family. That was well done. Unfortunately, the whole contingent business, the communal aspect, the dynamics of a large cast are all undermined. <br /> <br /> What's left is a movie that is worth very little.
