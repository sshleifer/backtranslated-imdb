This is absolutely the stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera. I can not believe that I was gullible enough to rent this piece of garbage. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but that takes the cake .... ice cream, chips and chips. Omg, I still can not understand how bad this thing was. The acting was a joke ... The plot was not existent ... and the camera work had to be done by a 3-year-old kid. I've never seen a movie that takes so long to go nowhere. I mean, the whole movie could have been shot for less than 30 minutes. I think this guy had some more time in his hand ... (like 3 hours.) And 60 extra bucks in his wallet, and decided one night ... (Hey .. Let's make the dumbest movie ever was done.) And they did just that. Give me a break. I'm going back to the video store to reclaim my money. Anyone else who has looked at this garbage should do the same.
