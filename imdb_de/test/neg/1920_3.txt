Rich against poor. Big city vs. city Town. White collar against blue collar. These things are not original themes in movies. So, if one chooses to include these issues, the situational action should be very original or very good. This one was not. I never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie. Neither convincing nor convincing, it just fell flat. Do not bother, even with a video rental.
