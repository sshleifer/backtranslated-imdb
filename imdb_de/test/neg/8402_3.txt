I've heard that Novo was compared to Memento because both are simply dependent on characters with short-term memory. Well, that's like a comparison of The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th, as both involved a character that killed several people. They could not go further apart. <br /> <br /> Novo deals with a copier in a company that has a short-term memory loss. He is always followed by another gentleman, and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a time man who gets involved with him and may not use him for sex / may. Needless to say, he has a lot of sex on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there is more. There is a boy who encounters the disturbed amnesia man and it is obvious that this boy is more than just meeting him. And there is a notebook that the man always tries to remember important clues. <br /> <br /> I admit, I'm not a stranger to movies. I do not mind reading the subtitles, but it sometimes bothers me that this takes away one of my favorite aspects of a movie: great dialogues. Since they have to translate or I mostly could not understand that, I really believe that they simplify what the characters have to say. This movie was no exception; The dialogue was just fine, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me 98 minutes. Funny, yes, but I do not live in France, so I do not know their likes / dislikes or lifestyles so well. (I think it's acceptable for a father to lie down on the beach with his son and rest, it must be a cultural thing.) Fortunately, it was not more than two hours to see this man again, his past is gradually moving his healing. Because if the "secret" is learned, was that really me? Well, okay, then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend for some decent spectacle, good-looking people and soft porn sexual situations (like every 2-4 minutes), however if you are not into this kind of scene I would use this slow moving and recovered movie leave out wholeheartedly.
