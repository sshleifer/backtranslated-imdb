Three businessmen get involved with three mysterious men in a bar. The three business men revenge themselves, which escalates into murder after murder. Allegedly, the story is the violence that can happen to ordinary people. The details were ignored to advance the story. The acting was inconsistent. The color balance was horrible, though I saw this movie on DVD. The small budget and the tight schedule were obvious. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final firefight.
