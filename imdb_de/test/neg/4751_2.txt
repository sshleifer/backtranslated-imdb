There was a time when the alien series was already a hit with the third part, Alien 3, and promising under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a blockbuster mainly because of its history, the "in peak" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and the director John McTiernan (The Hard). The films "Alien", "Aliens", "Alien 3" and "Predator" were all very successful and caused a stir among general movie fans and sci-fi fans alike. Presumably, Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end of both franchises, but the studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pursue the rumors among the fans and combine the two. Join Paul W. Anderson, Alien V's Predator, and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). The problem was that such profound and revolutionary creations of the sci-fi genre fell into the hands of a primarily mediocre director and now of director newbies, leading to nothing more than profanity embodied in incompetence. As fans of Alien V's Predator Requiem (AVPR) witness, diehard fans get sick that this series could get even worse. <br /> <br /> An example of the deterioration of the film in this series is the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among the fans. The movie begins with an alien leaping onto the Predator ship, splashing out of the predator's chest, growing into a full-grown Predalien and shutting down the Predator ship (which now seems to have far fewer Predators than the end) by Alien vs Predator) and all of this happens while the ship is still in the Earth's atmosphere. Once the ship crashes, AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions. Do not be tempted to use the twists or subversions that were used in the two original films. The tiring action proceeds with laborious steps, interrupted only by the almost rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator. If this starts to get boring, we will either be treated to a seductive blonde in a bikini or a quick gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless series of continuity flaws and holes are drawn with little or no narrative enlightenment, d. H. Members of the public who have outwitted an elite military unit or the Predator who does not comply with the laws established in previous editions. This is a movie that completely disregards its predecessors, breaking some of the most basic rules of a sequel and making you feel like you're trying to establish yourself as a stand-alone feature. Regardless, the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul, and with regard to the other films, even the most basic continuity is lacking. This is exemplified by the film's lavish narrative as it undermines the basic premise of the first alien. Because if the kind had been encountered before, then those in the first alien film would have been more competent and not so badly prepared if they met them. <br /> <br /> On a cinematic note, the movie is almost gloomy, in some places I felt forced to shine a flashlight on the screen, the lighting was so bad. By using such dark and dark effects, the audience may feel like it's being cheated by some of the action? this is ironically its purpose and also points to the budget shortage of the films. As with all sci-fi scenes, a scene usually appears as the most memorable one. In this case, it is probably the hospital impregnation scene, as it relentlessly relies on the themes of the original alien, literally quoting it. The direction is bad, the performance is weak and the script rots. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system for the production of films, in which ideas and techniques are put together by ineffective persons and the finished product is then distributed in cinemas. This is personified by the lack of bloody death scenes and protracted blood struggles because certification does not allow this. a lower certification to reach a larger audience. AVPR was purely for business and nothing more.
