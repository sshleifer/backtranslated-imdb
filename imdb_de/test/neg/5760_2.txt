This film is really SUCKS, REALLY REALLY SUCKS, this movie should be under the bottom 100, but it's so bad that almost no one has seen it so often to vote for it, that at the same time of "Manos - the hands of fate. "I should have him in position 1 (terrible), but the reason why I set him 2 was for Eve, the girl of the city, who besides some scenes of nudity, also thought to vote for 3, but as if they had killed Eve I returned at 2. It's true that movies like this one should not be funded by anyone else, as they did not even make the fame or other productions the main actors, big lie, yeah, the story of a mining mind, the deadly "mansalva" and after theirs Misfortunes have put an end, she reappears because they have shit in the end very ugly. <br /> <br /> FINAL SCORE (VOTE): 2 (for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful Eva)
