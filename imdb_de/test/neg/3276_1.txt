I saw this for sale in my local shop for $ 6 and said, "Hey, an action movie with the guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, led by the guy who did the the Dragon - and that's cheap! " So I bought it. Oops! This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a few doozies. <br /> <br /> You know how films that are intentionally stringent, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? You know how films that are supposed to be serious, but have turned out to be so awful that you have to laugh aloud and have to look at them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's vampires, are pretty cool? This movie, Ironheart, manages to be NOT one of these. I do not know what the filmmakers thought, but it looks like this movie has no time to shoot, no budget for anything, no script to talk about. (While I'm in the script note, I should point out that Bolo Yeung has NO LINES in this movie, the only reason he has to pay the bill is that he's the only actor in the movie that You'll ever see recognition (unless you're a fan of Jackie Chan, in which case you recognize the evil - and you want to call him Giancarlo!).) <br /> <br /> What's sad is this movie is from '92. By that time, T2: Judgment Day had come out, so you know the era of the '80s Campaign was over ... but not quite. After that, you'll think the 1980s Chuck Norris movies, high school comedies and Jason / Freddy sequels were awesome. <br /> <br /> Things to Know: <br /> <br /> 1) Nobody in this movie can trade for beans. The next one you'll get is Richard Norton, who looks appropriately rich and cocky, and Bolo Yeung, who looks appropriately, and ... cocky. Everything else is terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) The martial arts scenes are memorable - there are many instances when white men with lots of muscle take off their shirts, roar, bump Britton Lee, and be kicked by Britton Lee. beaten by Britton Lee, then dropped. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally stinky). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is pathetic too: The guns look like they came from K-Mart's Toy Department, and indeed they shoot with the sound of a capgun. If someone is shot, he hops around a bit and then lies quietly with brown-red liquid on his clothes. Britton Lee seems to be shot in the side, but you do not see it at all, and later in the day you see the wound ... I had paper cuts that were worse than these! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, the girl puts on the wound, then they kiss, then they lie in bed talking about sex. Huh what? The credible development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development are completely overlooked in this film. Do you remember how Bruce Lee's characters did not need sex with someone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) The chase is by far the worst I've ever seen. It looks like the director was sitting at the curb with a handheld camera as the two cars glide along the road, oh, I do not know, about 30 miles an hour? Do not try it at home, kids, these people are professionals! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Really bad writing. Here is a scene for you: Lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but her car is too slow. Until she catchs up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a shootout going on. Lee killed two bad guys, but the third shoots Lee when the girl is nearly run over, so the bad guy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car stops and she can not start it. She tells Lee that she's involved now and she's coming with him. He tells them that they can not leave their car there because the bad guys will track it down to her. She somehow persuades him to decide how to deal with this problem - so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car. (And remember, they have sex later in the night.) Huh?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look closely in more than half of the nightclub recordings, the dancers are not in sync with the music. The dancers too are all too coordinated (in the 80s, apparently, all people in dance clubs had dance lessons). There's a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything but dance. The bouncers tell the people who are struggling to "take it outside" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only bouncy castles that happen to Lee and Stevo are only in the entrance, but with their backs to it! Apparently, if you're a main character of the movie, you can jump straight to the head of the line. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee realizes that he is being persecuted for the first time, but he does not. The second time I will not notice it - though it is the same guy in the same car. However, the girl notices it. Bad guys are persecuted twice, but they never notice. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee worries that the bad guys will track the girl's car back to her, even though they've already seen him where she works twice. The girl leaves her child at work, in the care of a friend, while having sex with Lee. DO NOT learn education from this movie! <br /> <br /> I can not imagine any more problems now ... You have the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not even funny, it's a shame.
