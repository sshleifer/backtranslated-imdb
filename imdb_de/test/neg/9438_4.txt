I know this movie was shown as a kid on local TV, but I can not remember if I saw it or not; to see it now, considering how completely forgotten I still do not know? So I counted it as a first consideration! There were several feature films, a creation of the visionary French writer Jules Verne; These include: 20,000 LEAGEN UNDER THE SEA (1954, with James Mason in the role), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961, Vincent Price), MYSTERIOUS ICELAND (1961, Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE UNDERWATER CITY (1969); Robert Ryan) and THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF CAPTAIN NEMO (1973, Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> In this version, Oscar winner Jose 'Ferrer will be awarded. But even if the premise itself is not half as bad? Nemo, who woke up in the modern era from the animation break of his submarine "The Nautilus", is convinced of all his ingenuity to help the US Navy defeat the megalomaniacal scientist Burgess Meredith. It has easily become one of his most infantile adventures yet! For example: five seconds after the movie, Meredith's assistant? put on a steel mask? says that "the world belongs to us!"); Equally weird are the eager gestures of the similarly designed dwarf whose job it is to fire off the Professor's all-important "Delta Beam" - and what about the android-type henchmen aboard Meredith's ship, who seemingly do not seem to care much about anything ? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer consistently maintains his dignity, but Meredith is an embarrassment (which is virtually a retrace of his penguin characterization from the 1960s BATMAN television series and movies), where the budget is so was scarce? undoubtedly invested in bland production design and inferior special effects, and both obviously influenced by STAR WARS (1977)? apparently they could not even afford him a decent costume (he looks positively idiotic and wears a tie in a submarine)! The side cast includes Mel Ferrer (a saboteur in the style of Joan Fontaine from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE TO THE Bottom of the Sea [1961]), who deals with his namesake within the engine room of The Nautilus "), Lynda Day George (not surprisingly she is the only female figure) and Horst Buchholz (as King of Atlantis - for whatever reason, Nemo is obsessed with finding the famous Lost Continent). <br /> <br /> By the way The film was reduced to a theatrical exhibition mini-series and obviously feels choppy, though you can still tell where one episode ended and another started.
