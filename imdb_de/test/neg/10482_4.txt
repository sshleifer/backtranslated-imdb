Okay, when I bought this movie, I think this must be the ultimate B-movie, the Space Monkey lands on Earth and immediately starts killing people! <br /> <br /> Well, it was almost everything I expected, a typical low budget scifi movie from the 60s. Acting must be the worst thing I've ever seen, especially the girl who plays the lead role, and the girl who played the waitress made me laugh at my ass. <br /> <br /> Why does not "Night Fright" fall into the category "so bad that it's good"? The reason is that some scenes were just too long and boring. For example, the scene where the police searched for footprints in the forest was only a few minutes' walk without purpose. And then the grand finale, people wait about 5 minutes for the monster and when the Space Monkey pops up, he goes crazy in 20 seconds at the end of the movie. Yes, 'Night Fright' is boring, but there were some funny moments. I can recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies like 'Zontar, the thing from Venus' or 'The Swamp of the Swamp Creature'. <br /> <br /> I'm giving 'Night Fright' 4 space monkey slaps of 10.. <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
