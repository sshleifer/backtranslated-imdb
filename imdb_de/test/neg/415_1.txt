At first I loved the book more than the more popular Da Vinci Code, and although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I would ever like to see Angles and Demons again. <br /> <br /> The film is hardly like the book, in fact only the general premise of the story exists. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed from the beginning. In the book, Robert Langdon receives a phone call and a fax from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Who finds the body of the father (can not remember the name) and then asks Langdon to come with the super fast plane ... In the book were the only people who knew about this technology, the father-daughter Team had created and the camerlingo ... In the film, however, a huge team was involved ... so the tension was never there ... how did they find out? <br /> <br /> Omit or rather change The whole part of the story was a grave mistake and in my opinion was a bad movie. He changed everything that happened from then on. When the Camerlingo was confronted in the Pope's locked room, Maximilian Kohler would have been the one. The video was turned from his wheelchair, the commander rushed in to fetch the Camerlingo, but was shot by Olivetti. In the movie it was the Commander in the room, and Olivetti was shot ... was bored and can not really remember the events in the movie) ... <br /> <br /> There was no love interest in Vittoria and Robert and she was not in the book at CERN when he arrived and was actually flown in from her research. In the book, all four Preferratti were killed, but in the movie, the last of them survived the well. In the book, Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue them, and it was them who killed the assassin in the Illuminati Church rather than the Camerlingo movie. The piece in which Robert was under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his Mickey Mouse Watch alarm. OK, in the book we think Langdon stepped out of the helicopter to say that this was a bit stretched out, but in the movie it was important because he had to run back with the movie ... there I did not mention how Vittoria and her adoptive father intervened. This was also important to get to know the character of Vittoria. In all the worse movies I've seen, I would have gone earlier, but my brain went numb and I temporarily lost my legs. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalleal poor try and not one of the best of Ron Howards. In fact, it is a mystery to me how he will work again. I want my money back!!!
