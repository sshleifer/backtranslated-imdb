I was drawn into this film very early, much to my surprise because I did not intend to look at it at all. Now I wish I had not done it. The tension starts well, with the back and forth to death and the question of whether the culprit will confess or be found out or (doable now, though no-no in the old days of filmmaking) get away with it. The conspiracy was made previously - which conspiracy did not do - but the tensions associated with it, and the additional complications and motivations that result from the illicit love affair, provide for an exciting first half. Then the film leaves the hit-and-run to go on a foggy exhibition of two unrequited, suffering loved ones. The two tales of the plot - hit-and-run and unreasonable love - just do not have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters, does not bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The scriptwriter should have selected one or the other representation. At the end of the film, during the film's second funeral, I thought, "Well, what does all this have to do with this hit-and-run?" The filmmakers may find the answer obvious, but I think the movie was done flat and flattened.
