Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off of the movie Amadeus. Personally, I appreciate Amadeus as one of my favorites, not only because it's about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the true story of a musical genius not only remembered for the extensive works of beautiful music, the he produced during his lifetime, but because of his self-destructive nature and his tragic death at the age of 35, during his lifetime practically innocent because of the policies of some people, especially the Italian composer Saliere jealous of him. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka ... because the director has always put most scenes from the movie Amadeus together. I see the worst types of plagiarism in this movie and I'm skeptical of what Bollywood is doing every day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians in the film do not convey a realistic feeling, the film is tasteless, meaningless and totally failed in every way. The only person who works is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how he acts. Otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs. <br /> <br /> The irony is that the movie's first film, when watching the movie, states that all the characters in this movie are fictional and all resemblance to any other player is purely coincidental, which is a blatant lie, because all similarities are very clear and very intentional. I wish I could bring Darshan and Co. to justice not only for copyright infringement but also for mutilation of a fine work of art.
