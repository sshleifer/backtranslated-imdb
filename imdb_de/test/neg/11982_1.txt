Hardly got through the whole movie ... Action is bad, dialogues are even worse. I somehow felt st00pid 4 when I saw it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I fought my way through it. They even messed up the sound. At certain parts of the movie, the background music is so loud that I had to turn down the volume. It would be great if it was a competition who could mess up more. Oh, and PS: I do not know what this guy "Uwe" can do ... I think the movie is bad just because he's the director. I've reviewed the list of his works and this is his first (and probably the last) creation I've seen. <br /> <br />.
