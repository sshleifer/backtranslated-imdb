...The first? Killjoy 1. But here's the review from Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (contains spoiler, so beware reader) <br /> <br /> Oh my god. Oh, my, my, my. I start by telling you that I had no hope that this movie would be good. Considering that Killjoy (the first movie) is undoubtedly the worst film ever made, the sequel had not promised much. <br /> <br /> As expected, he did not stop. <br /> <br /> The deaths were even more lame than in the first movie. There was absolutely no eye candy, and every single prop looked so spotty that I would not be surprised if they had a kindergarten class. Hm, for starters, the movie was not even long. It only took an hour and eight minutes (68 minutes), but the early finish was actually a postponement. That's the only reason this movie was not as bad as the first, because the first one was longer. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not give spoilers in reviews, but I do not do it. I want each one of you to go through the torture if you see this film waste. I will spoil it. Not that there is much to spoil. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY is the pussiest killer of all time. In order to kill all normal serial killers in horror movies, explosions, firebombs, cannons, etc. are required. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A F *** ING GLASS WATER. No lie. In the end, a girl took a cup of water and threw Killjoys face with water. Then Killjoy started shouting and they tried to make it look like his face was melting, carrying dried rubber on his forehead. Then he lay down and the people fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Now let's meet the acting. VERY TERRIBLE. Not even one person was credible in the least. I do not even know what to say, except that they just hired a couple of hobos on the street to get involved in this movie. Seriously, I sincerely doubt that they have spent more than $ 100 total to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of it took place in the woods, which would have cost her nothing to film. The actors did not bother, so it's obvious they probably worked "for free". They had no special effects or nice props and probably used ketchup for the blood. Hell, who am I kidding? They probably did not even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A damned movie shot on a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> For Bob's sake, they could not afford to hire a policeman's uniform. In the end, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says, "Where is he?" and the head woman answers, "He left." Then suddenly a fat, dumb guy with scars on his face pops up and says, "You have a call." The girl answers and says "Oh, hello mom!" and smiles. Then the fat stupid guy passes by and reveals that it is a policeman. However, he wears khaki pants and a regular green shirt with buttons and a lame badge on the front pocket. Damn, it was probably the badge the director got when he was in 3rd grade security patrol. Then they got into a brown blazer and drove off when the credits rolled. They could not even get a police cruiser, so they just got a brown blazer. F ** kin 'lame. Killjoy did not even have the ice cream truck he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is undoubtedly the most extravagant gay slasher of all time. If there was a slasher wearing pink spandex and a rainbow flag, he would NOT be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy is not funny (and believe me, he did NOT try). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is a lame threat posed by one of the offenders. Someone tells a boy not to pass the third grade and the boy answers, "I'll show you the third grade!" threatening. That's the absolute worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show you the third class!" <br /> <br /> This movie does not even work on a "so bad, it's good" level. It's filth. If you have not done something bad and feel so guilty that you want to punish yourself severely, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember; If a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you with gay jokes (and tries to kill you at the same time), just pour some water on him. Case closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL ASSESSMENT: .1 out of 10
