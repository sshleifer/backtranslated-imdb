This is a very VERY bad movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, acting is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not convincing. The dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step of the way you can see comes a mile away. The end is disappointing and there is no tension. The best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason this does not mean a lower voice is that it is a TV movie and I think the budget was low at the beginning. I think the young female fans of Luke Parry will still see this movie, but he did a better job. It's terrible again. Very very terrible. If you have the choice, look at something else.
