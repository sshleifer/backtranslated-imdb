Rob Lowe must have spent all of his budget, but I can not blame him for running the money. Even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Filming, editing, directing, dialogue, sets, make-up, writing, casting (especially the young girl and the mob psychiatrist) and the story were anything but the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Make it available for other rental options, or share vile comments on TV. Dead Silent should be silenced forever.
