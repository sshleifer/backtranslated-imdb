When I saw the preview of this movie on TV for the first time, I thought that this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. I'm not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny as the first scary movie. This was one of many that has been done lately, but not. The humor in this movie was anything but funny and rather boring. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest problem is that they have fun with many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick It, etc. If you're something like me, try to pick any movie instead of paying attention to what's going on in this movie. Even the adult humor in this movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save money and time. Do not rent this movie
