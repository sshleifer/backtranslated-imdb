"The death of a performer on a Broadway stage play brings together a theatrical critic and a police officer as an unlikely criminal-resolution duo, and the dead actor's niece becomes not only the object of our critic's affection but also a prime suspect's death and several other murders "The phantom killer" focuses on the young woman as his next victim, so it's a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer, "reads the DVD sleeve overview. <br /> <br /> The script by Milton Raison puts a small spark in this reasonably priced mystery whodunit. Helpful is Dave O'Brien (as Anthony "Tony" Woolrich) well in the lead role; His ability as an actor seems to be much greater than the productions that occupy him. O'Brien and taxi driver Frank Jenks (as Egbert "Romeo" Egglehoffer) had put together a good detective team from the 1950s. Lead actress Kay Aldridge (as Claudia Moore) and the minor cast are also good. Unfortunately, the story is meandering and anti-climactic. <br /> <br /> **** The Phantom of 42nd Street (02.05.45) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien, Kay Aldridge, Frank Jenks
