Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and the speech were perfect for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed out loud the first 20 minutes of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that the joke got thin. Lil Pimp would be a classic short film sequence of 15 to 20 minutes. Instead, this movie is just a joke that takes far too long. <br /> <br /> Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, has several simple and witty one-liners. Unfortunately, all that the boy's rat is good for is nothing else to the story. Finally, I got as bored with his comments as the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of South Park and other adult-related animations. I also play several online pimp games, so I'm part of stories about pimps. The transition from little boy to little pimp was brilliant; After that, both the story and the dialogue became redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this film five. It pays to pay attention to the great concept and the voice output. Do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed.
