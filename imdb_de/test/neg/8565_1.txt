Well, first apologize for the lame wordplay in the title. I recently searched for movies to rent and saw that. I heard some of it, so I picked it up and looked at the back, and it was a quick report of John Fallon's AKA arrow in the head! At that moment, I thought, "Well, if he likes it, I have to like it!" So I rented it and looked at it last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh, and maybe I'd like to add that I've read a bit about Arrow and it turned out that he gave 1 Â½ of 4 stars. So my expectations for this movie were very high and questionable. Well, once I've looked at it, I agree with Arrow once again (noting that this quote from the review was the only positive thing he said!) Wow, did that movie stink or what? Where do I start, why was it? Well, the movie was so boring in my opinion. Not even the cool gore bits excited me, and if a decapitation does not excite you in a movie, that's bad! I hated the characters very much and from the beginning I could say who would die and who would not. Actually, the movie has proved me wrong in some places, but the worst thing is that a certain character I wanted to die did not die! What the hell? And the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? Did not feel it Obviously he was just there to be a feast for the eyes and to give her a love interest, otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror fan, I should know that sometimes you have to play the "stupid horror movie", otherwise there would not be a big movie, but those here pushed me off! Hello? Why are you in the room of the Killer moons, if you should take care of them? And that was done no less by the supposedly cleverer characters. The phrase ... ah, it would have been alright if it had not been done a billion times and I did not have to put myself through this movie waste to reach that point! My main point: Silly movie, which has absorbed me in a few words of my favorite critic (actually my only favorite critic). Wank!
