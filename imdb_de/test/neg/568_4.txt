A really funny story idea with good actors, but somehow missing. The actors are older, but none of them looked particularly good. They needed a better make-up, photos or something. It was supposed to be a love story, and yet the movie had the rough look of a street movie. I liked the cast, but I think the performances were pretty boring. Here is the weakness of the director. If Ms. Spielberg were directed by Mr. Spielberg, it might have been a much better movie.
