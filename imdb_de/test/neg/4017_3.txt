A pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts quite well, but gets more bizarre and can hardly be swallowed in the process. Rachel Leigh Cook is the only highlight in a tender and sexy performance, but I would recommend this movie only to die-hard fans of the actress.
