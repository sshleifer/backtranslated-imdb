This story had a good plot about four older men sharing a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to avenge the men. This story occasionally got me nodding in the middle of the tiring elevator music and the so-consistent thunderstorms during the movie. But it's worth the wait to find out who the mysterious woman is that plagues the old men in their dreams and interferes in the life of a young man. What I liked most in this film was the tension in which the young woman appears to the men shortly before her death. The special effects were something. Every time I heard her call, I thought, "This face no more." But it was a good movie, I just wish the tempo was not slow or that acting was not so annoying. And what I liked about the movie was the flashback of the 1920s, very authentic and the costumes that were original.
