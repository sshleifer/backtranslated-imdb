A special force of four policemen is showing justice in their own unique way in Los Angeles in the 1950s. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's lead officer, and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Including Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich. An impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is even close to impressive in this film. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, appears dead in a remote area of ​​the city that is currently undergoing development. Our four-man detective group is called, and it is immediately obvious that Nolte's Max Hoover will show a very personal interest in this case. We'll soon find out that not only was Allison well-acquainted with Hoover, but she was also involved in some of the more important military and government types that might have had cause to see her dead. But who exactly was it and why did they want to see this seemingly harmless woman dead? Hoover and the crew set out to search. Sounds like an interesting premise, but unfortunately goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive variety of names, the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Nolte exaggerates, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich appear as cartoons, Penn has little to do and Griffith is boring as it can be. By far the best performance Connelly offers in overly volatile flashback sequences. The dialogue during the movie is forced and wooden. The feeling of a drama that one would expect from a mystery of this kind is completely lacking. There really is nothing dramatic. In fact, for the most part of the picture, nothing seems to happen at all. Instead, we're heading for a pretty ridiculous and unbelievably disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is solved, you might say, "Oh, come on, is that all?" But it gets worse, because after the puzzle is solved, we get a completely ridiculous and absolutely incredible action sequence. And even then we have to continue to suffer, as in the end another terrible, badly functioning, completely unnecessary scene is tackled. And then it is mercifully over. And not a moment too soon.
