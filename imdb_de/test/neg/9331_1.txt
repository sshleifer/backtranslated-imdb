Tyrone Power was lead as Solomon. In the course of the film, however, he died unexpectedly. The studio decided to play Yul Brynner in the lead role and to re-shoot the scenes Power had made. In retrospect, considering how awful this movie was, Power was lucky - as this would have been a terrible way to end his beautiful film career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epics I've seen, this is by far the worst - and that says a lot because Hollywood made many boring biblical stories - so many are wondering if these were born films an atheistic conspiracy !! In fact, the film was so boring that it was rightly included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The Fifty Worst Films Ever". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst thing is how incredibly hard it was! Sure, playing people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents to play Egyptians and Israelis was pretty bad - but at least that made the movie weirdly funny. The Busomie Gina Lollobrigida, who played the role of a woman supposedly from an Ethiopian village, was also terrible, but at least she was beautiful, even if she could not act. That George Sanders was overweight and played such a young role after the Middle Ages was also pretty bad, but at least he had a pretty voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and disgustingly boring was pretty bad, but at least in the credits one has seen the mention of a person as an "orgy-choreographer"! No, the worst thing about this movie is that it was almost two and a half hours, it seemed nine, as if it was so bad and bland! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Saba and Solomon is found only in a few verses in the Old Testament, it is amazing that the film just went on like this. THE BIGGEST HISTORY ALWAYS TOLD was a bit longer, but this movie was based on four Gospels - not a dozen verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the movie is miserable in almost every way (except Gina's split). Even for devoted Christians and Jews, this is an absolutely avoidable movie because it plays so fast and loose with the truth and injects a lot of sex into a biblical movie !!! Terrible in almost every way, it's really a blessing for Tyrone Power that he does not remember that he played in this bloated turkey.
