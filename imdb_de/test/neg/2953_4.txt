This could have been a very good movie, a very interesting look at old traditions and oral history, but it should have been a short topic. As it is, it moves at a snail's pace; Sure, that's part of the life being portrayed, but that was unbearable. I fell asleep watching as they prepared soup. That was a highlight.
