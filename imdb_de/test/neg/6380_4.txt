This show has shown that their true colors are now where the Democrats are in power. In the IQ, it has never led the world, for anyone who believed intelligence was programmed to think in one direction (which is a scary thing). Comedy Central has postponed this and it's getting back to an earlier version when the Democrats took power for some reason - because now, as Democrats mess up as often as Republicans do, Stewart stops making pot-shots. For this reason, the ratings for both this and the spin are falling. Basically, most of the humor is now either lame or lewd Sarah Palin jokes - which all evaluative comedians say now. The facts that support this speak for themselves. The Jay Leno show, which has the same sense of humor, is about to be canceled. The ratings for Letterman & Conan and subsequent shows have dropped. <br /> <br /> So Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is, if one of them starts to crack in the onslaught of Democrats in power, they could hurry up their rating, since the best humor always comes at the expense of those in power. The Bush years have proved that because the ratings for this show & Colbert, & Letterman & Leno were higher there. O'Bama has done one thing, proving that these shows must be prepared to take risks and rip the people in power if they are to thrive. At the moment the Daily Show & Stewart are sagging, but maybe they can be lucky and have chosen Palin as first president of 2012. Then the lame Palin jokes become rating grabbers.
