Yes, I bought stock blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money for this crap. I mean, I did not expect a great movie. After the cover picture, I did not really expect anything big At least, no boobies in the first 3 seconds (I'm not complaining about the boobies ..) I complain, what the hell has to do with anything? This movie should be kept as a joke at home on the handheld camera ... they suck ... why was the blood more brown and rotten than the real blood? I'm telling you, I mean, they were not all color they were just yellow in color, and another thing that made me laugh at this sad apology for a movie was the fact that they were trying to make the clown to be a woman all the time, though it was obviously a shallow black-haired man with short breasts. ..then somebody noticed that the only special effect in this movie was a slowed down jump ... that was also bad and the crossfade effect that you can find on many basic PC programs, like ... Powerpoint ... this film blows
