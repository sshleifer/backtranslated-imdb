French cinema is shit! Down with all these psychotic visions with their my God-I-cultivated outstanding attitudes! Pestilence to imaginary symbolic film language and impenetrable cipher! I do not feel like it anymore! Léos Carax, have you ever considered that a dialogue in a movie can be natural and alive? Maybe I'm too ordinary to understand you? Or was it your job to confirm all the stereotypes of a Frenchman who can have the world? Guillaume the Zu-Guilliotin comes to his house-palace, Mme. Deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "Here I am, sweetheart!" At that moment, I knew she was in the bath and we'll see her lying there soon. Do not get me wrong, I'm not prude, and the incestuous sex scene was the highlight of the movie. But that is in Berlin "Etepetete", which means "être-peut-être", a snobbery, complacent and the worst thing I often see in French films! Another example: She is pretty and willing and looks at herself in a mirror, combs her hair, and her wild bearded, dirty young guru rushes into the room and breathlessly screams: "There is no escape, there is no escape!" Forty years of existencial Sartre and cohorts. What's new, what's exciting? My God, there is this woman and she loves and admires you. What would be more natural if you could be happy with your life? And if not, please explain better why !! Born French means you have to live a life of extravagance, not an escape, is that the point?
