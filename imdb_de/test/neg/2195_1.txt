When, oh when, will Hollyweird write a decent movie all about computers? I can not believe that people actually consider this movie to be a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system can ever survive with this annoying scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen, but if you actually tried for a long time, you would go crazy. <br /> <br /> When it comes to "tracking down" people as they did, it simply can not be done this way. Network security alone would prevent this. The logging of the keystrokes was ridiculous to say the least. <br /> <br /> Regarding the allegedly installed software, no system administrator allows such critical software to be installed on a production system until it is tested, retested, and retested on a sandbag system. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst part of the movie was the "virus". There is no way that a virus that works under one operating system works on another system. And as for a virus that could remove a mainframe, there are a few seconds that simply do not believe the faith. There is no way that an open remote connection has the necessary superuser access to allow the deletion of system files. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I can not bother. <br /> <br /> A porno has a better thought-out plan than this garbage heap.
