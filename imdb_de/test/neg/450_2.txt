Every time I see Larry King live, he issues most softball questions to his guests. He rarely gets useful information because he does not ask the hard questions. This comes from his start on the radio. <br /> <br /> King has established himself on the radio and, in principle, the television format has not changed except that his speaking head is visible. He becomes like a puppy to his guests and the only time he gets really useful information from them is when they volunteer or when a caller of the show actually asks a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is nice, fatherly type of interviewer. This means that if you are considering CNN, he should not have a major end show on a large messaging network. Due to the history of CNN this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Copy (ie cable) New Network was launched by Ted Turner as an alternative to network messaging because it was able to broadcast messages around the clock. At the beginning of the competition, the only television competition was NBC, ABC & CBS. For this reason, CNN copied the format of its competition and achieved respectable ratings. <br /> <br /> This worked well for CNN until they got competing networks that were innovative and delivered better / fresher coverage. In response to the heat of competition, CNN went into denial and stalled its competitors who had just had lunch because CNN wanted to resist change. This did not work very long and their ratings began to decline. <br /> <br /> Now the Copying News Network is trying to re-shape itself by reformulating itself by copying the leading News Network format. Unfortunately, this show is a big part of the problem. It is 21 years old and shows that it is very bad. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that King has to be moved out of Prime Time or scrapped.
