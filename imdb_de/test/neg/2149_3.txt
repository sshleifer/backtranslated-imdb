Hell to Pay was a disappointment. It was not nearly the substance of a B-western movie and should by no means be compared to a fantastic movie like Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the plot was sharp, the soundtrack was over the top and the drama was terrible. Even the pros could have taken lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive about this movie is that it showed some of the nation's best cowboy shooters, but you can see them better in every SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very tempting and the preview is neat, but then it's all over.
