The idea behind Dead Silence is great: The zombie outbreak takes place during a radio show with paranoia. There was so much for this movie. Unfortunately, everything was lost as soon as the zombies appeared. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous and only those who have a passion for gaudy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were sooooo stupid! They ran around, hugging their arms. They looked like a few people putting on a haunted house for elementary school students. <br /> <br /> I know, this is a quick review, but I just do not see the need to invest a lot in this project. It's a stupid movie. You were warned.
