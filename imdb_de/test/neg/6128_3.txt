This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was "la rupture" (1970) (from the novel "The Balloon Man") and it is a pity nobody cares. It's Chabrol's sleeping car and I urge each and every one of his fans to see it. <br /> <br /> "The chocolate" Cobweb was not as strong as a detective story at first. I read it 20 years ago and forgot everything. The movie promises some good things first, but then it disappoints. This is a puzzling Chabrol film containing elements from the heyday (around 1969), and a 1980s Lotta tongue-in-chick stuff, like 'Poulet' au vinaigre ', not a particularly memorable one A part of the disappointment comes from the cast: This is a depressingly bad gathering: Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert reveals herself to be a somewhat limited actress, after all rather vulgar, it worked in "une affaire de They are not supported by the young couple: b Both are boring and inconspicuous - doctors from the past say, for example, Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet (both in "la rupture") were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's unique time Atmosphere at. <br /> <br /> The story itself is indistinguishable: Starting as a kind of "serious" "La vie est un long fleuve tranquille" (besides, a character points to Etienne Chatilli ez 'very funny movie), the film follows as a ridiculous psychological drama. We do not congratulate the boy pianist who, after all she has learned from her evil hostess, has agreed to drive a car on a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> Because Chabrol makes too many movies, he often releases turkeys. If you want to watch one of his films, you should select him among all his things that you can win. <br /> <br /> It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire has finally yielded to leniency. "la rupture" the first Armstrong-filmed average detective story that completely transcended Chabrol- you should do it! ar Audran says, "you have so much money!" Here Chabrol has lost his bite, his strength.
