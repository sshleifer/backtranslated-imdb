In a way, you have to respect Arachnia. It is clearly meant as a tribute to the great error movies of the fifties and the special effects look awful. At least the movie does not contain CGI. On the other hand; You can not respect the movie too much because it's a lot of trash. The spectacle is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen a giant spider blown up; They've all seen each other, so it gets pretty boring pretty fast. The plot follows a group of people who had the misfortune to fall into a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; It's just a house where a man has a giant spider that he used as a circus attraction. At around the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to emerge from the underground. All the characters in this movie are bad cartoons; None of them has anything that resembles a third dimension, and they will soon be bored. You have to feel like the director Brett Piper, because he obviously did not have much to do with this film; But that does not make Arachnia worth it, and overall there are better huge flaw films than these, and that's why Arachnia does not get the seal of approval from me.
