Honestly, I envisioned Han Han Ying and saw her portrayed by an American actress who bears no resemblance to anything Chinese while watching this movie. Why can not Hollywood get Nancy Kwan? At least more faithful to the story ... cos for goodness sake ... Dr. Han Su Ying is Chinese I know I met her in person <br /> <br /> and watched all the cast .... so few Asian faces in a movie about an Asian love story also surprised me <br /> <br /> I think the drama is good, but with no real Asian faces in an Asian love story, the plot is so hackneyed and a whole lot of baloney /> <br /> It's just like another movie I got from 'THE CONQUEROR ' know. Imagine my eyes when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and make things worse. ... how on earth can a man born in MONGOLIAN STEPPES have an Alabama accent? !! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I'm not surprised that one day I will have Dr. and white minnesong show <br /> <br /> Would like to see that <br /> <br /> the whole roof would laugh !!! <br /> <br /> Cheers
