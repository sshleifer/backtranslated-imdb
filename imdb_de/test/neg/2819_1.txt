This movie was absolute garbage. The director and the stars (?) Should be excluded forever from the film production. The paper-thin plot is about a shabby director, played by the shabby director (now acting), who advertises on the Internet for women to play in a snuff film. <br /> <br /> There is no horror at all, the girls look boring and bored, the direction is pointless, the music is out of place (heavy metal in a library scene?) and the lighting is terrible. The director should have redeemed some more aluminum cans and got a script, sober actors, and a few lightbulbs. This is a disgusting, evil, worthless confusion of a movie.
