This film tries to spin the studio era in Hollywood and the customs of the 1950s. Guy Stone is said to be a rock-hudson guy, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher ended up crafting a shrewd, gruesome baritone version of George Hamilton that makes for an uncomfortable character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a depraved person that the public has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses the sweet, handsome young men who share their bed every few hours and then throws them away. Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone, the celibacy lesbian manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director is not sure what to do with her. The mistake lies in the dialogue, which is a bit awkward, and the movie suffers from it. Carrie Preston's Sally owes more to Ellen Greene in The Little Shop of Horrors. Prestons Sally is, as written, good for a laugh, but little else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He can not act and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks. <br /> <br /> Like many new movies, "Straight-Jacket" is a "Dramedy" - a comedy movie that messes up a drama about two-thirds of the way through the movie. And like almost all dramatists, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the film leaves much to be desired. The overuse of the musical soundtrack also leads to distracting clues. <br /> <br /> The film really did not manage to mock something about the 1950s. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain," which perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the rise of sound and the studio mentality of formal movies, "Straight-Jacket" does not do Hollywood well in the 1950s. The dialogue, the sets and the behavior of the key figures are rather unobtrusive than the unwise stereotypes of Hollywood in the 1950s. The same goes for mocking the common customs, social trends and fashions of the entire 1950s. Compare the transformation of Guy's house to the dead satire of the fifties house in Little Shop of Horrors. There is no comparison; "Little Shop" hits the nail on the head, while "Straight-Jacket" does not even know that there is a nail. <br /> <br /> Even motivations seem haphazard. Rick Foster is said to be a principled liberal, but he almost instantly falls in love with a materialist like Guy Stone. Rick is fine because Guy has been closed for many months. However, when it comes time to go to Italy, it comes into conflict for completely unclear reasons. And although Sally seems to have fallen in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick comes out like a gay man from the 1990s, not a gay author of the fifties. In fact, modern morality crushes this film - which should not be the case if homophobia in Hollywood fifties really was a satirical sight. <br /> <br /> There are also many holes in this crappy movie. Saul repeatedly says he'll hand over Freddie Stevens to the government, but never does - and lets out Freddie Guy. Jerry and Saul's conspiracy to make Guy "in" never makes sense and also makes Sally's sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy admitted he was gay, it does not seem to matter and ends up becoming a famous star and playwright anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​manage to save this movie. The camera of Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. Sometimes the movie looks almost like a film piece and not a movie (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is limited to medium shots and the film is incredibly static. Editing by Chris Conlee does not help the movie either. Long scenes that would benefit from the inclusion of close-ups or shifts in perspective remain untrimmed. Whether this is due to lack of reporting or poor editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The film is heavily dependent on Guy's CGI effects created by visual effects by designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks awkward and hokey and is very strikingly amateurish. <br /> <br /> My overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy, the plot is confused, the characterizations wild and unruly are brand, the satire does not exist, the performances are above and beyond the mark and that Comic timing off. It's almost an amateur movie. It's like someone took a high school production and dumped $ 10 million on it.
