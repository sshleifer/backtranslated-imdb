First, the genre of this movie is not a comedy, it's more of a drama. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for the movie and yet they did not get it. As can be seen from some other reviews, there are some nice music in the movie. However, if you want to hear good music, you should take the time to look for some concert recordings with Bon Jovi or MÃ¶tley Crue. It will be more time for the quality A good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
