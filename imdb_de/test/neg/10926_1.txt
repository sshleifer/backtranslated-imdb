One of the commentators on Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove) got it right when he / she said that the movie is really bad, but I take an exception when he / she commented on the animation. <br /> <The animation was not bad because of Macromedia Flash. It was a bad animation because it was wrong. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can create an animation that is as full and flowing as any other Disney movie, and in the wrong hands, it can look just as bad as the Internet from which Lil 'Pimp came and should have stayed there br /> <br /> Studios like Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create wonderful animations with Flash (eg Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's House for Imaginary Friends, Mucha Lucha etc.). <Lil 'Pimp was a poorly designed piece of Tripe that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the features. Roth and his company thought they would make quick money by exploiting a bastard like Lil 'Pimp, and the deception was perpetuated by their producer Amy Pell. The reason for this third-trimester demolition of a cartoon is that none of the executives at Revolution Studios had the pragmatic brains to put Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap aside (they really tried their best, but they had come way overboard) and real authors hired directors and at least one semi-competent manufacturer. They did a good job of hiring some of the best storyboarders, designers and animators in LA, but as Lil 'Pimp demonstrates, you can buy the best sports car on the ground, but if you're an idiot you'll ruin doing that it sure.
