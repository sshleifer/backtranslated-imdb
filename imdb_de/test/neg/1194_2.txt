I saw this movie together with three other Americans and our friend from Manchester at the cinema in Edinbourgh, and we all thought it was a waste of time. We would much rather have spent an hour longer to see the shabby dialogue of Star Wars III playing in the hall than all this. <br /> <br /> When opening with one of the worst jokes I've seen on the big screen for celluloid, it did not start with a bang. Throughout the movie, we felt that the jokes were just too hard. The authors have thought so much about the setup that you could see the joke 2 minutes before. Then it was so lascivious that you could not even smile; I call the giraffe a prime example. <br /> <br /> The plot itself gives me some interesting thoughts that entertain me much more than just what was going on on the screen. I think you could have done much more with this perspective (the two different worlds, the experience of fish and water characters, the confusion and surprise when people try to understand the characters and writers and distinguish them from each other. ) However, too much time is wasted to end this painful plan with as much 'bizarre' and 'stupid' as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say, the characters of the 16th century show that any additional talent of the authors is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who could possibly have made this movie worthy of a 40-minute extra time. but no, it's a full torture movie by unfuniness. <br /> <br /> When we left the theater where VERY little had laughed, I heard the young British couple in a British clash behind me say, "That was pretty good, was not it, you never knew what was coming next. "And the girl answered" yes, quite surprisingly ". and that was it. If that's what comes out of the British when it comes to a comedy: no laughter for 90 minutes, but in the end a tiny bit of communication between two lovers, then this movie is successful. But I believe in more British life than that. <br /> <br /> I have not laughed so much in a comedy movie since American Pie II.
