Stupid Disney movie about a student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. Not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good. Nevertheless, the script is VERY bad ... all the jokes flop and the acting is lousy. Everyone tries to be funny and they are not. A really boring, stupid Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
