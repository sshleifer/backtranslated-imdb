It's just two stars because they put a lot of work into the game to look good. I've played a lot of good and bad games and I think this game has the most boring story I've ever heard. The best thing they could have done is let them skip the conversations (but no, you have to listen to them talk for 10 minutes) and just do the same things over and over again. Climb onto the building, save the citizen, kill a guy. IT IS EVERYTHING THE SAME! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what happened next. I do not even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone responsible for developing the story of Assassin's Creed should be banned from writing another thing for the rest of his life and the same missions again and again! If only one of these two things was good, the game would be worth playing.
