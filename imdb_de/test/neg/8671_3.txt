This was just aired in the US. Others have commented on the fidelity (or lack thereof) of the novel; The BBC version of 1983 is far superior in this and all other points. Given the scope of the novel, he should not have been shortened to 85 minutes. Key sections must be hasty or implied or omitted; There is barely enough time to get into the chronology of events, so character development must be sacrificed: we can not tell much of people what people are, what robs us of what makes Austen so great. </ br> /> One major drawback for me was the cinematography, which I thought was terrible and literally sick. The camera is constantly shooting ultra-close-ups and whirls in circles. Maybe this is OK on a small TV box, but on our 40-inch HD screen, it was so dizzy that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my Dramamine supply was exhausted). Of course this distracts from the rather smooth I-Read-What-What-In-The-Script spectacle (isolated scenes are well done, but not enough to save things). <br /> <br /> Count the Score So far in the Complete JA Sweepstakes: I would rate Northanger Abbey as a success because of superior direction and production values ​​(and the story is better suited for a short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (albeit not comparable to other versions) (with renewed condensation), both well before this attempt I hope that in the two remaining novels in this TV Reader's Digest Jane Austen will get better results. Like others, I'm grateful they left P & P alone!
