I was a big "SNL" fan in the days of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I've tried to see it for the last ten years, I've been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted. Ten years ago, I thought that the show could not possibly survive because she had escaped the sort of humor I could understand, and yet she kept pushing what I always found disconcerting to find his lame humor funny. Whenever I've been in the last ten years, I've never been happy. In fact, I've always been upset because I got up and wasted my time. For me, the absolute low point was a few years ago, when a popular young male actor, I really liked, was the innkeeper. Sometime that evening he played a big star, maybe himself, and in the sketch, the character "Mongo," I think, he played with Chris Kattan, I believe, in the backseat of a car. What followed was that Mongo was forced up and down on the actor's lap, screaming hysterically when he was probably sodomized. The audience laughed with their heads and I shake my head. Amazed that they could be weird from afar, it was amazing that NBC even sent such a thing. In the years since then, I have been trying to openly and openly approach the show, hoping to regain the sly humor that I have venerated for many years. But until a week ago, it has not worked for me yet. Not even close. One exception: during the presidential campaign of 2008, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic and she was the only performer to turn me on. Although these Sarah Palin skits were hysterical, they were not enough to save the remaining 90 minutes and I would always regret not switching it off as soon as I got the familiar "It's Saturday Night !!!" heard.
