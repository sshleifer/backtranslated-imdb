Let me first say that I do not deny the importance of the topic in any way - on the contrary. I'm Pole and I've been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite some time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is in the script, which has too many subplots and characters, none of which is properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; Their stories are intertwined but lacking in meaning. In my opinion, the cast has no chance to prove his abilities. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, who represents Jerzy - the only interesting figure. I wish the story was more focused on him. <br /> <br /> The film lacks emotions. Before I saw it, I thought I was moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact I observed it with a strange sense of detachment, apart from the final execution scene. It is well done, and its placement is interesting and represents a climatic end, although the idea that the Lord's Prayer is recited together by the executed officers is a little far-fetched. The film may not be for those with the historical events described have a pedagogical value, but in my opinion it fails as a work of the cinema.
