Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes were almost bleeding from watching and listening to this horrible movie? My eyes were almost bleeding from the sight of the horrible animation and the threadbare, blank, empty story. My ears were almost bleeding when I heard the songs stop, as if they were being sung by a howler monkey chorus. Then my brain almost melted, because the film lacked intelligence. Every step of the way is formulaic. Talking about animals is one thing, but a penguin who can fly to fulfill their dreams can come true? Please show a little more confidence in the children's intelligence. Aside from Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth's worst.
