The only reason for the FC De Kampioenen is the local popularity. This sitcom has been running for more than 15 years (and still counts). <br /> <br /> It is an amateur soccer team with a focus on "amateur". Each story is about the same topic: a misunderstanding that assumes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions to be resolved in the end. <br /> <br /> The show has been running for over 15 years and production has probably decided to switch to a winning team. This means that the show has undergone minor changes over the years (apart from a few actors who have been replaced (they are almost all left alone rather than being thrown off the show) .The humor has not changed over the years changed and was already outdated when it first aired. <br /> <br /> I think you have to be Flemish to get it, and over 60 years old to enjoy such an old-fashioned TV show.
