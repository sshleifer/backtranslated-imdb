A young couple decides to flee to California. They never reach their destination when they pass the rest area. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on moving to a rest area. When she's ready to leave, she leaves the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared in her car and leaves her on the back roads of Texas with only one abandoned camper to support her company. <br /> <br /> Ruhe Stop is one of the cheap and snappy horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic, you might ask? Well, the three elements you need to become a cult classic are sex, sex, and artistic merit. The rest area has bucket loads, and although I do not want to reveal too much, it contains tons of blood-soaked malice. This movie contains everything from the bad guy who has run a car over the legs of a policeman several times until he uses a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. Sometimes it can be as bloody as a movie can be. It also has a free but quite intimate love scene in the first minutes of the movie. Therefore the gender is covered. Now the hard ?? Does it have an artistic value? You never see the face of the bad guy? You see insights, profiles, shadowy silhouettes. He is a faceless, relentless monster who performs well on the scale of artistic merit alone. The film has very few characters, apart from the main character? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Since she spends much of the film on her own, she can not disclose her thoughts in the course of a conversation, but has to pronounce them aloud, so that we viewers know what she is thinking. Sometimes this can be a bit irritating; However, it is a bold step by the writer (John Shiban) and works for the majority of the film. As an audience knows, it is utterly frightening to be completely alone and isolated from civilization, even if you are not being chased by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> Will Rest Stop be a cult classic? This will probably be the case, because along the bubble, sex life and contentious artistic merit, it also has a lot of chill, an interesting and imaginative plot and causes a lot of screaming on the screen as the main character does a lot of things that you do not Case should do when running in front of a psychotic murderer. (What fun are horror movies when you can not complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
