It is rare to see films that are noticeable in every way, but "Caligula" must surely carry that title. I'm not sure which is more terrible. violence, sexual perversity, acting or conspiracy (or their serious deficiency). The two and a half hours essentially follow the rise of the notorious Roman Caesar "Caligula" to be throne in 37AD, showing the atrocities and perverts he allegedly committed during his time of power. Acting is lifeless and boring - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Since the film directors knew that this film was really missing anything legally interesting, they decided to bring in as many nudity and orgy scenes as possible. But do not be fooled, these scenes do not leave the abomination of this movie. The camera work is modest, dialogues are ridiculous. One has to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such a farce. And then there's the violence .... <br /> <br /> If you're about to get the movie ready. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just by writing), but by disgusting acts of violence that mean nothing but to dismiss the viewer. This is just one goal of this movie. One has to wonder how the creators of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (to name just a few) would inspire everyone. If it ends after two and a half hours late, take nothing out of this movie, except for some disturbing pictures and the knowledge that you may have experienced the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> You have been warned
