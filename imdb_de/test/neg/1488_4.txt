Like many history buffs in western Pennsylvania, I was really looking forward to this acclaimed PBS program produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. But I have to say now that I was a bit disappointed. On the positive side, I believe that this film as a whole did a good job explaining the main themes and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian Wars. In particular, the representation of the view of the Indians was something new and quite interesting, although it was certainly overemphasized for a time. On the positive side, the mix of narrative and action scenes worked well and looked a bit better than many of those typical documentaries, which consisted of "expert" interviews and picture stills (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many of the battles had a somewhat "staged" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all, I was very disappointed and frustrated at how little importance Forbes' successful 1758 campaign had against Fort Duquesne compared to Washington's earlier 1754 and 1740 Braddock failures. I was somewhat unbelieving that Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service most responsible for Forbes's success, was NOT mentioned. Finally, I could not believe that the battle for the 1763 bushel, which began as a repeat of Braddock's defeat, could not be entirely left out, but ended in victory that decided the outcome of the Pontiac War, thanks to Colonel Bouquet's reflections It undoubtedly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.
