I can only assume that this film was a failed experiment. Years ago, it would have been moving pictures accompanied by music. Later it would have been added to Silents. At some point it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This movie must have been a misguided attempt to add a new element to the talking picture. In all emotional scenes, the character remains in dialogue, and his inner thoughts are narrated as they look into the distance or address the camera. This interruption is at least painful. Imagine, these first-class actors try to be too busy while the tale is booming. Painful. I have no idea who had this gimmick, but it was the only time I've ever seen it - and with good reason. In each scene, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wrestle their hands or exaggerate too much. I actually wondered if that was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over several generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed with love, is looking for a reason to live. She has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who adores her - but she takes him for granted. She is attracted to a doctor, played by Clark Gable, but he is selfish and does not care about her. She is content with a weakling who desperately needs her. She only marries him to realize that his family is crazy and that she can never have a child with her. Here comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in the oven to find out later that he still loves her. The child builds trust in his husband, which becomes a success, but it becomes clear that it is really Clark whom she loves. Still confused? Forget the rest, just look at a few episodes of "As the World Turns" and everything becomes clear. <br /> <br /> If you are ever forced to watch this movie, wait for the final scene. The shootings of the actors shame Harold LLoyd. It is not to be overlooked.
