D'Amado's hardcore / horror hybrid does not really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise, with various contemporary vapid types being attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for atomic experiments. The film is usually so slow, the action so bleak and cast off the cast so clearly that one must have sex with each other, that the film is a chore. <br /> <br /> That's too bad, because the movie brings a promising idea. A group of scientists are brought to the atoll by a naval officer in a small ship. The scientists ?? three women and two men? are a fascinating cross section of sexual types that suffer to varying degrees from nymphomania, co-dependence and frigidity. There is even a fascinating ramble through the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops in a brothel to rent from two Caribbean studded Carpathians. The creature itself? a mutilated native islander with a terribly scarred face and an impossible long hiss ?? has some affinities with the old creature from the Black Lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that hovered above postmodern humans since the beginning of the Cold War even though we've retreated into hedonism and relativistic science in the West Porn Holocaust is certainly a movie It shows how the Western population is confronted with the sexual revolution after a sexual monster, but the torpidity with which it unfolds makes the intensity of the idea truly disappointing. There is a promising combination of action shots with POV shots that suggest that the monster (looking at the horror monster from its POV position) is similar to the voyeur in the audience standing between them during sex. beautiful people. "The sight of the monster forcing a beautiful young woman to suck his oversized member definitely throws the ugly fantasies of the target audience in the face, but D'Amato has better developed similar ideas in other films, and porn Holocaust is a potentially violent idea that was disappointed by the execution (even D'Amado's usual cinematographic abilities let him down with boring camera work).
