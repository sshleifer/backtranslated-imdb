I just can not believe that the people who made this movie really took it seriously. The skits on SNL look more real. Everything was ridiculously wrong. The silly shootings, the ridiculous fist fights, the dialogue, the juicy background music and even the blind eye of Bo. If it had been billed as comedy, it would still have made more sense, but it would still be bad. I can only understand this as "entertainment" when you see a room full of stoned college kids watching it like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the stuff you saw on blazing saddles, like Mongo tearing down the horse, or the old lady getting a belly button. Now imagine, the producer wants you to take these scenes seriously, and you get the key points of this disaster.
