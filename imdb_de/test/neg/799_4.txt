In 1976, a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night, a box is put in front of the front door and the next morning the box is cut open to show a key device, which has to be opened with a key. In the late afternoon, a man with terrible scars on his face comes to her door and offers Norma an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that someone in the world the family does not know dies and receives a million dollars in cash when he presses the button. If they do not press, nothing will happen and the offer will be passed on to another. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone about this deal, including their son. The incentive for the family to push the button is compounded by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, will not be accepted into a new job for which he applies, and Norma, a teacher, learns that her faculty resources will be cut. <br/> <br /> The joy of this bizarre is striking The science fiction thriller based on the short story "Button Button" by Richard Matheson will depend on the extent to which they want to accept this ridiculous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic when anchored in the sense of realism in the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko skillfully exploited the state of schizophrenia to justify his excursion into paranormal activities and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of this far superior film, The Box and the thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world is completely implausible. That Norma would also include someone in her house who has almost the same scar as Two-Face by The Dark Knight and believes in this offer seems equally fictional. <br /> <br /> Even if this sounds unlikely, the following is even more absurd: the conspiracy of a person struck by lightning, the possibility of an extraterrestrial life or other godly influence on those situations. Scenes with gateways that open in public libraries, accidental nosebleeds, and thoughtless drones tracking the Lewis family are almost unintentionally funny in their absurdity. To some extent, the film could be described as intriguing to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally smart in his ability to keep our attention through many of the filming techniques. In one scene, Norma teaches a class and is then asked by a stranger boy about her foot. He mocks her because she has four toes missing. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding attended by Norma and Arthur, the same student appears as a waiter and seems to pursue them. However, the ultimate justification for all these weirdness is associated with a sophisticated science-fiction revelation that is implausible and difficult for many to swallow. What is the most disappointing thing about the movie? The button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the originally promised moral implications are lessened for much of the image duration. The end, which can not be corrupted here, reawakens these moral issues, hoping to reflect that of a Greek tragedy. While the similarities can be seen at this point, there is little cause for concern given the improbability of much of the film and the uneven performances. Cameron Diaz's southern accent may be superfluous, but it's surprising that Langella is the most disappointing movie with a very incorruptible character. The mysterious Scarman seems to hide a military base that Dr. Evil is proud. It really is just a shadow of its outstanding performance in Frost / Nixon. For many of the other actors in the film, there is not much to do; In particular, Norma and Arthur could not be considered as characters, but as mouthpieces for Kelly's idea pate. Underdeveloped and short conversations in which Norma sympathizes with Arlington about her deformities, and also when Norma and Arthur wonder if they really know each other, if the button kills one of them, underlines this. <br /> <br /> Since 2001 Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that matches the quality and imagination of Donnie Darko. Although fascinating for a while, this film is too absurd and implausible to fully enjoy it, and would certainly not warrant a multiple view in the face of the film's more illogical revelations. Sci-fi fans may appreciate it a bit more and make their own conclusions, but what Kelly really tries to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is a movie that should have given up this year.
