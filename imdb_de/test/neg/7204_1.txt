As you may remember, I have apparently experienced all three of the Trilogy of Trash, and the first film is the only one that can even be seen remotely. Part two was substandard sewage and this rate is a little better than two, but still a steamy pile of something that I removed from my backyard last Monday. The premise does not make sense, why did the moonshrouds kill this poor old lady, and even in 1921, I think someone would notice a bunch of oily guys where once a sweet little old woman lived. Second, this scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first movie. It's just old clothes and a linen sack. Let's face it, the series is garbage and should be forgotten. THE LOOP!
