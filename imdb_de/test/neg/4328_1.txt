Extremely boring ... I do not care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby is shit ... and do not look, because I mentioned it, except for Warhol's "Empire", it's far more entertaining !! I have seen other Duras films that were much better, so I am amazed at why this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian I had to consider radical works by Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst. In these artists, I still see artistic intent, even quality and a fun aspect in the reproduction of their art. As for "India Song" - it's not even a soft porn - Anias Nin was almost there - G-Rated Slideshow of Sex - and a voice-over that does not refer to the slideshow / movie ..... Crap and not even Campy ... unfortunately only a hole and a waste of 2 hours. To offend the injury, the pressure I saw was faded and scratched to hell !!! (Harvard Film Archive) If I want to see "entertainingly boring," I'll watch Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - hold your head up to the late modern and get bored !! Watch a 70s porn movie where all the good parts are cut out and the sound is toned down. They receive "India Song", but with better cinematography and no annoying music or the screams of the vice consulate.
