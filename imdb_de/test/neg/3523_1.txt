The movie runs on the floor and begins with THREE murders in a row. No action, no characters, no motivation; the second murder takes place off the screen, and the severed head of this victim is actually used to scar the third victim pretty efficiently! This is a highlight. But the Lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with strength; Soon they cover botched dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shoot endless snappy cheating skills in ugly wide-angle settings. Meanwhile, the horror atmosphere of this Betacam production is quickly giving way to an infomercial mood of insurance, and the monumental (and rather endearing) simplicity of the leads keeps things moving in that direction. Investigating Shlub Policeman, Meat Chopper Guy kills, repeats, and reaches its climax early with a memorable finger-in-the-salad gag. Only, how the hell did the fingers get into the salad? And did not the Blood Cult have the intention of collecting the attachments he had cut? If the GORE does not make sense anymore, you know you're in trouble. And without spoiling the great, nonsensical turning point, just take my word: The fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep, cathode tube that destroys the impulse. The basic reaction is to try to leave it behind and get on with your life.
