"The Secret Life" begins with the worst possible narrative intro: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a movie about it ...". Okay, what are you suggesting? That we should not bother to go on, because the movie is not exactly or bloody anyway? And they were right! The movie is not shocking and contains virtually no blood or blood. I think that's mainly because of the low production values ​​and not because Dahmen's crimes are too horrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just a sequence that is repeated over and over again. The young, miserable and mentally disturbed Jeffrey picks up victims (always men because he was a homosexual), kills them, and talks about his intention not to hurt her and how lonely he is. This quickly gets boring and even the admirable performance of the unknown actor Carl Crew can not save this movie from a total dudel. Nevertheless, this version is much better than the presumptuous and hopelessly confused "Dahmer", which was released in 2002.
