Many actors have a variety of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> Then there is Linda Blair. "The exorcist". That's it. <br /> <br /> If you see "Chained Heat" and watch Linda Blair doing it, you have to wonder what, if anything, ran through her head. <br /> <br /> Certainly not, "Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come!" <br /> <br /> Just another woman in jail film, as she was made in the 70's for cheap money. This actually has names that you may recognize. John Vernon plays the Dean ... I mean the warden (with a hot tub in the office, wondering what he told the contractor?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how urgent they are to work need. <br /> <br /> And especially mentionable is our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who attacks poor Blair. To put it this way: Sybil is like Sybil and everything Sybil does is done perfectly. Forget what a horrible movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and one for the attempt to spend Linda Blair as a sex symbol. What could she have (got?)?
