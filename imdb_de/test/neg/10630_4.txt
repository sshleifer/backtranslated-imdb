I am a big Amy Adams fan and have been there for many years. I'm also a big fan of musicals. With these words, this is not a good movie at any level. It's pretty boring and the acting is very bad overall. Amy Adams is uncomfortable looking up with Scott G. Anderson because she plays in a different league when it comes to acting. All performances are very amateurish. The music performances are pleasant, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was included in this movie because he has a great voice, but that's just not the case. He has an average voice and sings on tone, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> I think I can see why Amy Adams made this movie with the vocal element that I wanted. I could rant about other poor elements of this movie, but I'll leave it at that.
