With enough talent and sincerity, this film was designed to make me wish it would get better. Everyone will undoubtedly do their best to be faithful to a fascinating premise, but it is too deep a vision, too drastic an attempt to solve the mental illusion to survive a transition to the screen. It's an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid - the result is confused and slow. I give a 10 for effort, but a 5 in total.
