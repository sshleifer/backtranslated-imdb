When I and my girlfriend visited this movie, we did not know what to expect, but she assured me that the movie had good reviews. So I went with you. We went to the cinema, bought tickets and went to the screen. After a while I sat and waited for the movie to start, nobody went through the door. I was very suspicious, because you usually get at least a few more people in each movie show. The movie started sometime and we sat there. After a while, very few dialogues and very "arty" -like atmospheric scenes, I realized why we were the only people there. It was incoherent with random cuts from the main story to children in a skate park, the story she made herself made no sense. The boy should have committed a crime when he did not. If he did not write a letter to anyone, it is not an answer and you should not feel guilty just because you wrote this letter. This movie did not make sense at all. I have no idea why we did not get our money back through the movie. I tried to give a chance, I think. The film had little concept, and the execution was a shame. The author and the director, and just about everyone else who did the film, should have realized what they were doing and stopped. It's an hour and I'll never come back. I'm sorry for anyone who liked this movie, but ... it's so awful, I mean really, really, really, really bad. Well, at least I never have to suffer again.
