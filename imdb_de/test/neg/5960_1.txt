You want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is it. "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is THE worst movie ever, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst movie of this century. It must also have the distinction of being the absolute worst actor of all time. Eric Alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never made a film other than El Chupacabra. I ask myself why. Obviously, the monster attacks people, but anyone who is attacked moves really slowly and slowly is really stupid. And in this city there are no policemen, only two idiots - hello! Policemen appear first in the scene of the murders, then come the detectives! Apparently the monster attacks only in the backyard of a person and in some abandoned areas at the docks. Or ... that's the only place filmmakers could get access to the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is why IMDb has to allow us to forgive negative stars. This easily earns -10 stars or at least 0. You should allow a 0 rating.
