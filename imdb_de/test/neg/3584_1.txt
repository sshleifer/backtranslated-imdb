Dreadful! Dreadful! Dreadful! Drob, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the kind of film that the Irish film industry should not do. And with the added bonus of a syrup-coated finish. A disgusting example of how talent and originality are bypassed in favor of almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes, the kids are cute. Yes - it almost looks like it was done professionally. But this is filmmaking by numbers, a direct hit and what the director obviously sees as "success" - a movie that complains and despises the audience. It's amazing that the working title would put 3 million pounds in this trash. But then they actually paid for Love. Do not waste your money.
