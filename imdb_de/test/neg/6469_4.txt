This movie was not good. I thought it was a cute Disney movie, just like the original. not correct. it was unpleasant for christina ricci, from whom I expect so much more than what one can only recognize when looking. I think, Doug. Doug has done his best. Anyone older than 5-year-olds is sitting in front of here and they can fall asleep.
