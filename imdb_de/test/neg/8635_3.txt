George Sluizer's The Original Version of The Vanishing aka The Man Who Wanted to Know offers one of the quietest disturbing sociopaths in European cinema and one of the most memorable finals of all time (shamelessly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume 2), but has much more to offer Playing with the chronology and reversing the usual clich√©s of common "Lady - Vanishes" acts also provides excellent characterization and strong, underplayed but convincing performances. Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it comes to the movie remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else would get the chance to ruin his film if he himself was perfectly capable of doing so, but few had can guess how comprehensively he ruins his own work. His career has never recovered from this catastrophic misstep. <br /> <br /> The main culprit is an amazing achievement by Jeff Bridges, thought through to the smallest detail to a truly catastrophic level. A friend who produced one of his first films found that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you prevented him from thinking about what he was doing, and this film is proof of the pudding. Each movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making it look like a rusty clockwork toy, while its voice is a bizarre mix of Tootsie, Latka Gravas of Taxi and a Dalek, all attending lessons at Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a madman running around with an invisible sign over his head and saying, "Please, let me kill you, thank you, for your consideration." But the guilt has to be shared here: none of the performances is good: they often do not look good. Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a desperate man who ends up in a hurry in the head. At the gas station, Nancy Travis freaks heavily and Sandra Bullock makes no objection to his obsession, not that either the director or the writer Todd Graff helped. The script is especially weak. The chronology has been changed To focus on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film, it's even worse that the movie is in a hurry and the life and characters from each scene in its race are draining off to the next one If the mood in the couple's relationship changes, or the seemingly casual but careful determination of the location sensation, we have only a few arguments that give the impression that without them, they are probably better off than the new and improved happy ending dard woman being chased by Natter in the woods Endangerment stuff complete with lame 'let's end with a joke, like a TV cops show' moment? best not to go there? This is an advice that applies to the entire train accident of a movie. Even a frighteningly boring and unimaginative Jerry Goldsmith score can do nothing for this point.
