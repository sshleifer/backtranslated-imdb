After reading the book One of a Kind a week ago, I thought, "This would make a great movie, especially now when people know a bit about poker and poker players." I was totally shocked when I scoured it in the video store last night. I had no idea that anyone had actually made this into a movie. I grabbed it right away and watched with great anticipation. What a big disappointment! <br /> <br /> All the fascinating things about Stu Ungar were flown through quickly, and instead I had a biopic that could have affected anyone. Ungar was perhaps a burned-out idiot, but he was also a brilliant thinker who instinctively read people. That's what made him so fascinating. Why do not you focus on that? <br /> <br /> And talk about diluting the true truth. This guy was absolutely over everything: drugs, women, gambling, hunger, sleep deprivation. He played at dawn from dawn to dawn, missing out on days as he hung in Crack Dens, his body was always emaciated, and whenever he needed money, he could always beat someone who played cards at will. Well, that's a story! Too much time for his childhood and personal relationships (though his relationships with "Vincent" and his daughter were barely touched) and barely anything about his drug use (which was exorbitant)), his insane gambling and his incredible card game skills. <br /> <br /> Probably too late, but I hope somebody does this movie right. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent. The script has nothing interesting to tell him.
