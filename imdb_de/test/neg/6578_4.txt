I like outsiders. So, 12 years after seeing Star Trek V for the first time and thinking it was bizarre bad, I gave it a second clock and hoped that I would find something redemptive that I had missed the first time. <br /> <br /> I do not. <br /> <br /> The writing is half done, and although the quality of acting is initially stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit wobbly), we'll get further into the storyline the stupider it gets , The last quarter of the movie is just ridiculous. Even worse, this was the first ST movie to be released after the Next Generation series was back on TV. The average episode of Next Generation would * ashamed this - including the special effects! What an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The Final Frontier is not totally unhappy - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's way below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one), the only one I can think of a reason because you appreciate the other films more. <br/> <br /> * Unless it's an episode with Troi's mother.
