Terrible, stupid-crazy movie that deals with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Louisiana state seems to be corrupt and incompetent. A member of the college's English department can only sign his name with an X. <br /> <br /> When a senator (Victor Moore) is about to enter the state to investigate, everyone there is blaming innocent but foolish Bob Hope characters. <br /> <br /> Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the role of Maria in 1943, "For whom are the tolls?" Of course the Corrupt officials try with Hope to show pictures of Zorina with Moore to ruin him politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant he insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason she was upset was that it was a kosher restaurant. This is the extent of the humor that is the absolute chaos of a movie. When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he takes James Stewart to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Until then, the film has gone too far for a good response. <br /> <br /> The music and the lyrics are both absolutely terrible. This song, which praises Louisiana and is sung in different ways, is absolutely terrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music of this terrible film?
