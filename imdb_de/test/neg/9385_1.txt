THANK YOU GOD THAT YOU ARE HERE is painful, positively painful. The title is, in a sense, fitting when it addresses the big studio audience that was paid to laugh, as if they were seeing the second coming of the Marx brothers. And trust me, they get paid. <br /> <br /> As creative and infertile as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really believes in this turkey. Rather, I think, THANKS GOD THAT YOU ARE HERE is what all of you get, who have not seen the STUDIO 60 or did not appreciate it. You want to put your nose to caviar, fine. Here you will find some nice alpine products from Menu Foods where you can relax.
