I am very interested in the mostly positive reviews. Although it had some good qualities, I found this movie mostly cumbersome, predictable, and above all, not scary. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actress did a good job in her performance, and the world around her was thoughtful and meaningful. Unfortunately, the film got into a downward spiral from then on. I went into this movie without knowing what it would be like. I did not know anything about the actors, directors, the genre, etc. At some point, my wife remarked, "Is this a scary movie?" Well, I suppose the boiler plate horror movie, full of squealing violins and extended vibrato, can not mean anything else. There did not seem to be much originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment and the second half of the film went deep into the realm of the ridiculous. A movie like this one runs a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer has to decide whether to go on or off this path and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing. For the last 30 minutes I have opted for the latter.
