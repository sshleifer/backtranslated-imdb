I usually do not bother with wasting my time writing commentary on garbage that I almost forget as soon as I see it, but seeing this movie in one of the showcast channels yesterday (346, I think) I decided to make an exception. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that I liked to see Carol Alt, I can not give any reasonable reason why I saw this movie to the end. I am always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in such terrible films, but I think this film would lead to something better. I hope she was right, because of her. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a typical salmon uprising intended only for video, or just a piece of garbage, depending on your viewpoint. While there are a few decent moments of action in this film, they are not as well connected to the story as it is. <br /> <br /> The setup was, as I recall, Carol Alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband, a cop, cheats on her. There was also something about her child who was killed in an accident and she blamed him for it, but before that action went anywhere, she shot and killed him. On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to her door and she takes care of him, and almost immediately her house is besieged by government enthusiasts and mercenaries who want to capture the stranger who seems to have almost superhuman fighting abilities There was some time ago decent entertainment, especially in Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity, and this could have happened again, but this film was disappointed by poor production and a lousy script. <br /> <br /> This film really falls apart when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) who was programmed as a police officer, and after discovering that Carol Alt killed her husband, he tries to kill her! So far the movie has not been very good, but the end really ruins it by trying to turn a humble action thriller into a lumpy Terminator / Robocop wannabe. In the end, the movie was a bit over the top, and the crazy cyborg stretched out poor Carol Alt before finally picking up the dust. What was the point of it? What was the point in this movie? It held my attention and talked for about an hour until it ended when it reminded me that I did not see a first-class movie. It was not really a second-rate movie either. <br /> <br /> The final scenes point to a sequel that I think did not happen, although I did not check it closely for the web. Needless to say, I'm in no hurry to see a sequel to this movie.
