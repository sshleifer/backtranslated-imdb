Fear of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written that were too short for a full-length movie, and then awkwardly put together for this Frankenstein monster is scary. As hard as it is to give the secondary characters a pearl, they are much more sympathetic. Fear of the dark would have reached mediocrity if she had just chosen an approximation and seen through it - and if it had simply made Lucas psychotic and confused, rather than scary and repulsive. I wanted him to be put in an asylum so the rest of the characters could live a normal life.
