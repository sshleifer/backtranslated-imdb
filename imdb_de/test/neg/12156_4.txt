The narrative was clear and concise, but overall, the film never caught my interest - scenes felt flat and uninspired. Ghengis Khan historically had a very interesting / epic life, but the movie could not capture that - instead he focused on little skirmish youth and a love story I think I've seen in a number of other movies disguised. I did not feel sympathy or compassion for the leadership - yes, he had to overcome slavery, but then seemed to easily go to Khan looting, killing, and crossing his way up. The redeeming quality was photography - the landscapes certainly helped the dark atmosphere of the film, unfortunately combined with the grim story - I remained unmoved and disappointed.
