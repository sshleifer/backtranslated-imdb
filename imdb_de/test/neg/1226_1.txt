Was really looking forward to a sequel to Lonesome Dove, but that was total garbage. The cinematography was terrible. Shot too narrow. I almost saw the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. Editing was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad editor. I do not know if McMurtry played the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. Really like Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp, but what did he do with that character in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. It even looked as if it had been recorded on a sound stage with the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove go so wrong? Where was his head .............. Can not say much for acting. It's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful Western that could have been, but rather, as if they were toppling this piece just to get it in the can. I read other reviews and found that others felt the same way. Not even curious about the next few nights, because it would be a waste of time like the first night. <br /> <br /> (2nd post) .............. .... OK, because nothing else was on TV, I have to be honest and admit that I have the last 2 nights from Comanche Moon. And I'll be honest to tell you that I did not make it to the end of the last two episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I have looked closely at the two main characters, and I have been able to identify some behaviors that Steve Zahn did when he represented the character with whom Duval has done such excellent work. So I have to give Zahn credit for it. As for Karl Urban's presentation ... simple dead meat. All I can say is that I was very disappointed just because I cared so much for the original LD ​​and how others ... defended my feelings for a really great Western.
