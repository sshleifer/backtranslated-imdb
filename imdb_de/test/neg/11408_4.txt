I love horror movies and try to give as much appreciation (or sometimes more) to everyone I see as possible, but that's really a push ... Most of the cast was very similar, but hardly any of them could do anything Anyway - but then think again about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... some good make-up, but absolutely ridiculous special effects. All in all, I give 3 out of 10 - and thought about it !!
