The film has so much potential that has not been developed. Mark Hamill shows a good performance and also Bill Paxton. The scenery is beautiful and the ultralight planes are neat. The problem with this movie is that the story is underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. The film makes you almost fall asleep at certain points. I give 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.
