This film promised a lot, so many beautiful and well-playing actors, but with an action that had practically nothing to say. However, so many potentially promising conflicts between family members that could be developed and worked out were all abandoned and not taken into account. There was no story to tell, just a spectacle of drama, technique, beautiful scenes - they were all EMPTY. But even here, the acting was outstanding, so that many of the individual scenes were entertaining, but as you became more and more aware of the lack of basic ideas, the acting lost its meaning. From the promising beginning, you became increasingly disappointed as the non-history continued.
