It really hurts to say it, but this movie was terrible on every level. The blame is not entirely on Van Damme, as you can see he did his best, but let's face it, he's almost fifty. How much more can you ask of him? It is so hard to believe that the same people put together the undisputed 2; This is probably the best (western) martial arts film in years. Everything from plot, dialogue, editing to the overall presentation was terribly composed and in many cases boring and nonsensical. Scott Adkins, whose fight scenes looked more like a demo role, was terribly underutilized and not even the main villain, which is such a pity, because 1) he is more than capable of playing that role and 2) the actual main villain was not only not intimidating, but also pretty annoying. No blame for Van Damme again. I will always be a fan, but avoid this.
