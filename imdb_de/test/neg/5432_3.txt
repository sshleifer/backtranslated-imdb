This was a hugely hyped film before its release, but proved a fool. I have never spoken to a person who has ever liked this movie. I agree: I did not like it either. Maybe it was not so important that it was not a success at the box office, because there were only unappetizing characters in the story. <br /> <br /> For a while there - I do not know if that's still true - I had no idea. In every movie where Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played anything, BUT annoying characters. <br /> <br /> That and a stupid story make this movie a big disappointment, especially given the big buildup. Did the filmmakers really think with such stupid dialogue that this would be a hit?
