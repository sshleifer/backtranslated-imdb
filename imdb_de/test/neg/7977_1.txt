I bought and overpaid this rent for $ 1.99 in Hollywood. I had not expected much, but I thought it would be something to at least be able to fall asleep. I quickly noticed the very faint action, the gross exaggeration of all (nobody talks about this except in cartoons) and the seemingly "let's do it-up-how-we-go-with-direction". I know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed, and I am sure that it has not helped any career. As far as the film reflex of 35 years is concerned, it has now given the ready answer to the question of the worst movie you have ever seen. <br /> <br />
