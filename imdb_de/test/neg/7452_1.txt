I have seen this movie several times, it is certainly one of the cheapest action movies of the eighties. I think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this channel. But if you have big trash, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) are equipped with great mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of them is shot in the leg and his enemies are still stepping into nirvana. This movie is really awful, but it's also a great party tape!
