Larry Bishop directs, writes and directs this softcore porno, plots less biker movie about nothing to do with anything. To call this one of the worst films of 2008, it's nice to be the trash I spent money on in cinemas. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. For the most part, I was so sorry for the girls who probably think they are making a movie, and in fact they are doing porn. They spend four days on set, saying sexual remarks to disgusting old men - thirty years older than them - then take off their clothes and run around naked for the four days they're on set. I can only assume that this was just Larry Bishops. You see shot after shot right on the asses of a girl. Shot after shot of Bishop approaching a random chick and grabbing her most intimate spots as if shaking her hand. How this crap was financed at all, I do not lie. Why Tarantino bears his name is a mystery to me, but he has slowly faded since 1994, so I can not say that I was surprised. After 15 minutes you have the horrible feeling that it's just awful (and I mean awful) movies give you. When you see it in the theaters, the pain you feel increases. After 15 minutes I wanted to cry because I was so stupid and not only wasting my time, but also earning ten dollars. There is not a single Savior, or a moment in the film, that evokes any kind of reaction or any inclination that these people had an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you do not often see naked women, this movie would be for you. If you are eleven years old you will probably like it. You can not even laugh about it, because any idiot who does it laughed at the crap they made. The drama is terrible, the writing is terrible, the production is terrible and the direction is terrible. It's not even worth renting it to see the car accident. Stay away, stay very far away. You should not even read these reviews. I should not even write one.
