As a serious marathon runner, I was seriously disappointed in this movie. Target audience are clearly those who have never run a marathon, or beginners. After the stories of two marathon runners for the first time, a senior, an injured runner, and two elites preparing for the Chicago Marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to a female beginner whose story is for lack of better words, boring. While I enjoyed the brief insights into the training sessions of Deena Kastor, the short history of the Boston Marathon and the marathon in general, I would like to emphasize: These were short !! Seeing how some Joe Runners ran their water bottles on a Saturday and talked about how they see the marathon is not inspirational, and the uninterrupted clich√©s about performance and good-natured laughing runners will make you wish the movie was an hour long shorter. If you are a marathon runner for the first time, this movie may give you the feeling "I can". For everyone else, run away.
