This movie is terrible, I can not even bother to write a review about this junk! I'll just say it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the acting is very bad. The boy who plays the main character really annoys me, he has the same expression on his face throughout the movie. I just want to beat him! Basically, the movie consists of 80% slow motion shots of skateboarders, weird music and total shit. <br /> <br /> Apparently I have to write at least 10 lines of text to make this comment I need a few more lines to say that the main character has one of those faces that you should just beat! <br /> <br /> Meh, I give up .. THIS FILM SUCKS !!!!
