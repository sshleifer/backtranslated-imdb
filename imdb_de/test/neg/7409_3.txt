This is Jonas Quastel's debut as a director and to be honest, shows it. It looks like he's thrown into any kind of camera trick he's learned in film school to try and add a style to a badly written script he helped write! Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others looking for an airplane in the Pacific Northwest where his daughter fell, and also a special machine that his company built and would like to retrieve. The first 5 minutes of the movie are either blurry or blurry or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the mode "Blair Witch" with these recordings and they become very tiring very quickly. And there are also the POV shots that go with Wolfen and Predator. These images are taken from the point of view (POV) of Sasquatch. The cut is sometimes very choppy, because a scene in the middle seems to be moving. I've heard that this movie was shot in about 12 days, and I suppose it just rebooted instead of "starting at one" without stopping, and edited the scene together. And the rest of the movie is hidden from one scene to another. There are so many scenes that are hidden that I lost the count. Now the nude scene with Andrea Roth. It is not her. You can easily see that it is a double body. And you know you see a bad "B" movie when in the middle of the Pacific Northwest a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And the Sasquatch itself is not bad if you do not really see it and it's just a blurry picture behind some trees or bushes, but when you finally see him in the end, that of course disappoints you. First, he is not that big. The actor who plays Sasquatch is only hairy on certain parts of his body. It is a part suit! And he is bald! I heard that a make-up person died while filming. Maybe that explains why the costume looks rushed. Some of the sound effects coming from the Sasquatch are nothing but the well-known lion roar we have all heard in other films. I have to admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he works with bad material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can enhance certain moments of the movie. People keep saying that a good bigfoot movie was never made, but I do not agree. I've always said "The Creature From Black Lake" is a good movie, and I highly recommend it. I'm a jerk for a Sasquatch movie, but this one is just too amateur.
