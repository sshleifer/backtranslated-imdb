"Tart" is a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that wanders through a number of Manhattan teenagers exploring all the usual youthful preppy things. Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes while Swain dutifully pulls through another in her long list of dog flyers. Nothing in these films works and Wayne should consider getting a proper job. Recommended for anyone. PU! Pooh! (D)
