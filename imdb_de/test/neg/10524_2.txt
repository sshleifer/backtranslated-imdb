THE worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. Acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, the idea is terrible and it was not researched, which is so! Okay, I admit, "Air Bud" was a pretty good movie, but not "Soccer Dog". This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play football? Even for 10-year-olds, it's no problem to kick the ball hard enough to break the stupid dog in half! It's terrible not to watch this movie.
