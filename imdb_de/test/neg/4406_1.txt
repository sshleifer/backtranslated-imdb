This was one of the most dishonest, pointless and not most peaceful movies I have ever seen. The representation of the others, the Israelis, was racist, backward and unfair. For one thing, the song played by E.S 'car radio when it was pulled up alongside a right-wing Israeli driver, "I cast a spell on you" by Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is pretty Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food, and slang) are influenced by Arab culture, and there's no reason an Israeli Jew is offended or upset by a nearby car playing this song. The way E.S. Appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and a cool gaze to force the onlooker to persuade the Jew, through a long, still shot shot, to see the Jew as stunned and racist, and E.S. as noble and moderate. <br /> <br /> I've traveled all over Israel, and I've never seen an IDF recruiting poster because the service is mandatory. But in the movie, not only is there a recruiting poster, but it shows a stereotyped image of an Arab terrorist and the words, "Do you want to shoot?" This is an extremely inaccurate portrayal of the mentality of the majority of Israelis and Israeli soldiers, and such "publicity" would not even exist on any Israeli highway. The director wants to convince the audience that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists who are prone to murder. <br /> <br /> The Ninja scene was unfounded and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action scene in which Israeli soldiers shoot Palestinians would be as unwelcome in an Israel-led film as the Ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic and violent scenario generate applause from the audience, as the director has smeared the Israeli side so much that every shot would have been fired by Israeli soldiers. The director shows absolutely no attempt to build bridges, to portray the "other" as human beings or to work for peace; Violence is the only solution. This is supported by scenes of exploding tanks, falling watchtowers, and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends is serving in the Israeli military, and the targets in shooting ranges are never black-clad Arab women or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to shoot at the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger. According to my friend, the method is to deliver a cry of alarm, to shoot into the air or into the environment, and if anything else fails, shoot in the leg, then interrogate and go to the hospital. An arbitrary aiming at a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the right procedure. In addition to these inaccuracies, the directional style was bad. The repetition was repeated and no longer tied. Symbols such as the balloon on which Arafat is drawn are pushed out of a plot structure or effectively integrated into the environment. The balloon is that Palestine permeates Jerusalem and regains it. It is without reason of E.S. The ambulance, inspected by Israeli soldiers on permits, followed by Israeli ambulances passing by at the checkpoint, is an overly obvious allegation of Israeli double standards by the director. The director's attempt to portray life in Nazareth as grim and meaningless is done with overkill; to show the routines of random persons over and over again, even if there is a slight change each time, and to emphasize that no member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue, almost cries out the purpose of such scenes, the dreariness of life, from a lot of space for personal interpretation. Unlike a "section" of the film, Daily Life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this tribulation on Israel, but never provides direct evidence as to why such guilt is right can argued. <br /> <br /> I spent hours figuring out why music ended abruptly and started abruptly and why many modern fashion-show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. I still can not find an answer. I felt that the music in this movie was out of place. the contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and impaired or thought uninspiring. I can understand if the director intended the music to give a strange aspect to certain scenes, but I found out that there was no funny expression when Israeli soldiers fired on targets or had to fight a ninja or a woman to go through another passage Checkpoint, though defiant. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears in intense scenes, annoyed at the lack of a score in quiet scenes. Whatever the intention of the director, there was only one unpleasant unhappiness throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> This film has no legitimate political message because it is an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and fails to actually address issues. It is a propaganda film because the director proposes various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the Palestinian side, while invariably portraying the Israeli side as cruel and inhumane; The pulsating atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or intense music is shown by Palestinians perpetrating violence against Israelis, so that the almost inevitably positive and excited feelings that music and cinematography evoke from the audience are focused on one side. There is no reflection, reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience. Emotions are simply pulled aside and held in a clich√© between "good and bad". I believe this film lacked the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee".
