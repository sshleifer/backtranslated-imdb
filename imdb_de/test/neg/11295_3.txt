I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I've read all his novels at least five times and Hannibal's book that I love most. Therefore, the movie was my biggest disappointment and I do not understand why some people give it here Nine or even a Ten. Either their demands are very low or they have not read the book or both. Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider the film as an absolute average and would give it one five. The scary, mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not even appear in the movie when I first saw her in the cinema, I even fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important figure, completely omitted? Why was Barney shown as a stupid ignorant whose only goal is to make money? And most of all, why was the psychological process Starling had endured, caused by the drugs that Lecter had applied to her, the lineage? Not to mention the fact that even the end was left out and completely changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I have accepted it, although I am, like many others, very disappointed because I identified Starling with her, Hannibal, one of those psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a figure when it is adapted to the canvas. But as the Germans say, that is "yesterday's snow". Ridley Scott made some awesome movies, but he does not live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had just the right feeling for the storyline, the characters and their relationships to each other in The Silence of the Lambs, he should have done Hannibal as well. My only consolation is that I've only seen the film twice a long time ago and thank God I can not see the scenes from the movie as I read the novel. I'm so sorry, but I really can not recommend it to anyone.
