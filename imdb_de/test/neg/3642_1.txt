When I saw Zoey101 with my sister for the first time, we thought it was rubbish. Nobody is so rich and lives in a dorm off the Pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a very popular rich girl who is always asking for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect in everything, including her perfect figure. And she's such a diet freak that she talks about carbohydrates the way she knows what they are. When she sees her friends eating chocolate, she confiscates it. And one thing that scares me off is that she chews a piece of mint every time you look at her. And everyone wants to have something to do with her, for example in an episode where the Logan guy offered $ 4,000 to cheer her and her friends for everything he does in his miserable life. And her friend Nicole is an overpowering freak who cries a lot. And Lola dresses like a Houdini lady. Called '80s, they want bushy hair back there. Also the shaving could be shaved. This show sends bad news to kids everywhere, so they think they'll hate themselves if they do not have the latest I-pods and designer clothes. <br /> <br /> This show is a big thumbs down. <br /> <br /> We hate you, Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Best wishes Ryan and Kara L
