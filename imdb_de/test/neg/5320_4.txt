I had seen this as a kid on Italian television and remember that I loved it - given the mix of live action and animation; At the time, however, it was general panning ... and after catching up after all these years, I have to admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What must have seemed wondrous to a child's eyes is actually very bad, not to mention a fantasy adventure. Unfortunately, both Star (ex-'Angry Young Man 'Richard Harris) and director (action-expert Hunt) are unsuitable for the material! At least Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics provided by screenwriter Don Black) is usable - if not exactly inspired. Incidentally, among the voice artists of this British-Belgian co-production are some well-known personalities (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and this is his last movie work, Michael Bates). <br /> <br /> During the decisive plot of Jonathan Swift's classic novel ("Giant" Gulliver becomes a plaything between the small peoples of two neighboring countries and ends in flight) In a land where real giants live, they dive up here, on a strict child level (with stereotypical characters, but fortunately little interference from the comic / romantic variety) - which makes it all pointless, outside of his intrinsically experimental nature, since Max and Dave Fleischer made a great 1939 detailed cartoon version of the book had been created!
