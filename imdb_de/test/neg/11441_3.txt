Not as bad as 1992's "Nails" (where Hopper plays an "unstable" cop), but pretty bad. How can a movie go wrong with such a great cast? This movie creates a way. The story was pretty stupid and Hopper's instructions seemed like he'd never been directing. All long shots in the beginning were annoying. Many pointless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.
