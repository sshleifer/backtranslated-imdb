This was one of the shows I wanted to watch. But I just could not bring myself to devote my time to this show. To have a show that focuses on politics, you really need a strong plan with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, such as The West Wing or Commander-in-Chief. Rob Lowe was fine, but actors like Kyle Chandler just could not act (he was terrible in "Early Edition"). It was a pain to sit through this show. Due to the lack of excitement, urgency, and the characters who can actually act, I just had to give up this show and am glad that it was canceled, so I would not miss anything. <br /> <br /> degree D-
