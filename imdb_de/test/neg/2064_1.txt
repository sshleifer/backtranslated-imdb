I saw it today on French TV and was very disappointed! The movie starts pretty well, but nothing is cleared, and in the end we are not farther than at the beginning. If you see the husband for murdering his wife, this is simply not plausible. You need concrete evidence to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case, there are none, so it just is not plausible. Remember the old adage, "innocent, until it proved guilty." The fact that a woman has disappeared without a trace is no proof that her husband killed her. So I really do not know what this movie was about. The result is completely illogical and incomprehensible, the viewer will not be charged with any incriminating evidence. So, frankly, it's a waste of time. After all, a movie must be entertaining ... that's completely wrong with this movie and I suggest that it be irrevocably put in the trash can where it belongs!
