Bad spectacle Yes, but it was no surprise. Stupid story? So what? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Mr. Director, why all this slow motion crap? Battle scenes were bad, really bad, due to slow motion and poor editing. Not because of Seagal. <br /> <br /> "What if I just accelerate for 2 seconds and then slow down for the next 5 seconds and then ... maybe I have to turn the coin to make a decision?" What did you think, Mr. Director?
