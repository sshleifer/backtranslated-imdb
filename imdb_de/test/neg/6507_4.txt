This (supposedly) TV movie, based on a real story, is about a woman fleeing the FBI and a * serious * stupid guy. First, we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a "normal guy" with a startling job, an ex-wife, a kid he rarely sees, and a few cats. <br /> <br /> Next up is "Elaine-Lisa", call it "(Tracy Pollan), a smart, sexy, good-looking woman whose tongue would go up in flames if she ever told the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger and Lisa meet when they respond to a solitary-hearted ad Roger is one of those poor fools who can not live on their own after his wife dumps him his ad. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Roger to find out that Lisa found out is * not * a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her, he does not even have one enough sense to change the locks on his front door after he throws them out. <br /> <br /> If you have nothing else to do, look at this. <br /> <br />
