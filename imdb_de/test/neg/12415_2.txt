This film was missing in many areas. It's about this Elvis guy driving cars and being addressed by these BIKERS of SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo and they are fun college kids together. They want the Elvis guy to be their "driver". Sometimes I wanted the people of MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually good. Sure, there was violence and many cheesy sayings like "What kind of beer do you want? A COLD". That was cheesy. The guy who plays banjo is a great boxer, and I was glad he was doing some fight scenes. The biker named FATS also had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket !!! That was pretty brave, if I have to say it myself.
