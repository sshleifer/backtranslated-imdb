When people say that kids are annoying, you think my little cousins ​​can be annoying and I said, LITTLE. These children are 10 years old and they are without a doubt the most annoying children you will ever meet (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - she's a girl's bitch, I mean, come on, she's wearing miniskirts, she has stupid frizzy blond hair and a cheeky bunny face. She looks so innocent. Next up is the second kid - the geek - who thinks he's so cool, with his shooting away and the use of a muffler (a cloak over the gun), and above all, his wicked, brave smile. The next child is the quiet kid you do not mind. This movie annoyed me with the children's intelligence and the only fun I got was from my cousin, who always complained about her.
