Seriously, I can not imagine how anyone could find something flattering about this film, let alone in itself, write the glowing compliments contained in this commentary section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch doing while filming this movie? Did he give the actor a bonus that spat out his lines the quickest and with the least twist or the least thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot cruel, even for a "screwball" comedy, and claims that the film is a tribute to classic comedy about the craziest thing I've ever heard. The cinematography is under the quality and innovation of the worst television films, the acting is terrible (though I feel the mistake lies directly in the director's lap), and I have already mentioned that the direction is so it is random and inscrutable that it contradicts the definition of the word? The whole thing is a terribly listless (even in the much-troubled world of such nasty, funky clunkers), soul-sucking, waste of two hours of your life you'll never get back. I'm afraid, I'm very afraid ...
