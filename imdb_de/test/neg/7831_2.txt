You must be worried when you see Michael Madsen leading the cast of any film. I will not go through the list of shame that characterizes his film career. <br /> <br /> I watched for 45 minutes and still was not sure what was really going on. The film was a love-hate relationship between Madsen and Argento, which basically insulted Madsen, threatened violence and generally treated her like dirt. She, on the other hand, loves him, then she does not, then she does it, that she desires him, then she loves him again ...... what is wrong with you wife !!!! <br /> <br /> The Script is a horrible, lousy soundtrack and senseless aggressive and rough sexuality, which in my opinion was added to attract some viewers, otherwise the film has little to offer. I would have given the movie a 1, but in the last 20 minutes I managed a 2 with some excitement. It has actually answered a question in the last few minutes, but I will not share that, I'll make you suffer for the whole movie as I did.
