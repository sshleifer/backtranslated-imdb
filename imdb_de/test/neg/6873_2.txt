Here's another movie with dysfunctional main characters that are totally amoral and yet should we choose them? Not me. No figure in this movie was a damn worth. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays car salesman "Joey O'Brien". The man has no class, a loser in the moral sense, and a man who believes he can talk himself out of anything. Since he knew Williams' ability to speak, he was good for this role. The women in his life drive him crazy too. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins plays a similar low-life situation that takes over the film as he charges people carrying explosives, including his wife, hostage in a showroom of a car dealership. Robbins plays, as normal for him, a distraught and ridiculous character. I think these crazy roles are easy for these two actors. I ask myself why. <br /> <br /> There is so much screaming and screaming in this movie that it will give you a headache. Combine these two Screamers with the nasal voice of Fran Drescher and you really have an annoying over-the-top cast. This is like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hour and a half. This is comedy? No, that's lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, a Robin Williams movie that has just published a dozen reviews here tells you something. It's a long way from his best movie.
