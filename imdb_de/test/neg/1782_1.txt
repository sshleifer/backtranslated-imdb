There is so much bad to say about this movie and so little is that good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are absolutely incredible, the monsters are so unrealistic and it's me I'm sick of watching movies featuring an ex-husband and throwing out an ex-wife in a bizarre emergency - in movies that happens all too often and it's become another bad stereotype to think that anyone would have invested $ 1 in this junk, no matter how much $ 100 it cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more compelling special effects on your home computer! I did not think movies could be that bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something that's more fun and fun, like letting a tooth or an enema!
