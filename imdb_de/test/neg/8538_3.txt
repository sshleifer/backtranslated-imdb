First, editing this movie was a big mistake that I did not understand how it was overlooked - you're constantly seeing overhead microphones sticking in and out of the movie. When I saw it for the first time, I just said "good, mistakes happen" and wiped it off. After about the tenth time, it became incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you have not seen the movie yet, count how many times you see the microphone. could make for a pretty interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. This movie started with a pretty solid "ghost" story; However, the turn of action at the end has completely ruined it. They start to watch the movie, assuming that the haunted house is made up of ghosting that can only be seen by children. This is particularly true for young children, which makes it even crazier, as they can not effectively warn the family of the imminent danger. The opening scene has led the audience to believe that this will remain the premise of the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The movie begins with the family being persecuted and eventually killed by an "invisible" troupe in the house. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when, at the beginning of the movie, the daughter asks her little brother to tell her exactly where it is, before she grabs her and shouts her into the cellar. The boy also testifies that this supposedly "invisible force" killed his mother after she asked him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed, the boy tries to run and only hide. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie started with the testimony of a pretty scary movie in which the family would do it. They are being persecuted by an "invisible force," their only hope of survival at sightings of a two-year-old rests. This began to ruin less than half of the movie when the daughter also saw the ghosts. The "only children can see" illusion evoked by the commercials and the opening scene is ruined. Regardless, the film was not really "ruined" until the plot was shot in the end. It turned out that the man who helped the family grow the farm was responsible for murdering the family at the beginning of the movie. Suddenly, after being attacked by a crows swarm, the man tries to kill his mother, daughter, and son while suffering a psychotic breakdown in which he believes they are his family. which he killed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The whole conspiracy of the plan ended up making a whole list of unresolved questions and throwing me. First, why were the souls of the family locked up in a house? If the director aimed at a ju-on approach (The Grudge), where the family, after having died in a tantrum, would persecute the house and kill anyone who comes in, why did the haunting end after Father's was the ghosts of his family "caught"? If the ghosts just wanted to kill the man who killed them, why are they attacking the new family? Here is one more for you. From sowing to the complete harvest of the plants, it takes several months. This tells me that the man who had initially killed his family, the man the ghosts had apparently insulted with the entire movie, lived on the property for months. Why did not the spirits just kill him during that time? <br /> <br /> This movie contained many clich√© horror movies as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. But let me tell you, this movie could have gone well if the plot did not end. It's as if their budget was tight and they just threw something for an end together. For this movie to be a success, they would have had to stick to the premise that "only children can see them" and ended either that the family barely got away or how the family was killed at the beginning (would have opened the door for possible sequel as well).
