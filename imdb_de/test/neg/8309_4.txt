I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had huge hair. Whenever she was on the screen, I could only concentrate on her hair. Take about stage presence! In this movie, there also seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems. There was a street attendant who issued a parking ticket that somehow did not notice the owner when he came upon the car when he hit the car. Then there was a man in a phone booth who could not hear a huge bulldozer approaching him until he was five yards away. All hits in this movie seemed a bit numb, nobody had to sneak up on them. The one-handed "hero" of this movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny. The bar fight was pretty funny. There's a priceless scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judging by their facial expressions, it was not good for both of them. I had to laugh out loud. This movie is on the 50 Movie Pack Martial Arts set if you want to watch a lot of bad movies (with a few decent ones).
