The width and height of the scale of this movie overwhelmed me. About a week ago I published a commentary on the silent epic, MACISTE IN HELL, 1926, in which it is referred to as "staggering". Then I met the Pollonia Bros. BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's all about the scope of thinking behind it. The Pollonia Bros. and his colleague John McBride thought so great that the reflection on Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY was lucky that she was released thirty-two years before this treasure. In fact, Kubrick had it easy with modelers, a budget, real actors and big studio support for his little Star Trek rip-off, and all Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the damn thing. What's so hard about a typewriter? The Pollonia brothers, on the other hand, had to think radically, outside the box and fast. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including a hot-looking chick -, bought a pile of colored light bulbs, scanned old office dumps for every keyboard, monitor and handsfree headset they could find, and all were identical black turtlenecks, made with any cupcake tin in the county, learned enough 3D modeling and texture skinning to animate some spaceship flyby, spent a few hours figuring out a script, which is easily the most frightening space monster doll there This terrible little monster Jabba carried with him was roasted by R2D2, literally spending days filming and editing with a VHS camera and Amiga, and winning. This is the best D.I.Y. directly to the home video fan movie Space Epic I've ever seen and in relation to the talents and resources that are available to the filmmakers dwarfs, even LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as a daunting look our future, all the way to a newscaster who wears a mismatched, ill-fitting suit. As a species we are doomed to failure. <br /> <br /> Seriously for a minute, however, it's a tremendous improvement over later epics like THE DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is weird since it was made one of those masterpieces. At some point the Pollonias started to calm themselves down: this movie is performed with a certain conviction that makes you believe that you can really breathe in a vacuum cleaner that carries a dust mask and two biker spray bottles. And the scene in which the alien beast consumed a miniaturized crewmember made me immediately think of where I had seen it before: GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER, where the giant monster crab impales two canoeists and eats them in front of the camera. That made me cry as a kid. <br /> <br /> This has made me cry as a grown-up because I'm wastefully trying to be a bit of a critic or writer or writer / critic here, and these guys are having fun, really a true science Fiction epic with lots of cool colored lights, a hot chick and a talking slide projector called KAL. One of the flight crew can even carry his black space baseball cap backwards and glow with his goatee like this Metallica clown. Is that supposed to be a joke? No. It's an epic statement about humanity, about humanity, and about humanity, which deserves to be seen by anyone who has the capacity to take none of it too seriously. Look for it in a 2-disc box set called GALAXY OF TERROR in the DVD containers of your favorite discounters, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say, "Yes, they have a few boxes -Sets of our films for sale at Best Buy. "<br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone lacking in humor can try SILENT RUNNING or TRON. But one day an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this film and decide that we should not really care about it. Good job, guys !!
