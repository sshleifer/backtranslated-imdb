WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS IF POSSIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, if you have not figured out the plan, I will give it to you. Two couples make their way to a campsite, but a masked clown killer shows up and causes all sorts of chaos. Now is the time to advise these couples /> 1. Never go to a camp the locals call Camp Blood. 2. Do not have sex or get out before the killer. 3. Do not track the killer if he runs away. 4. Do not cry before the killer obscenities. 5. Make sure your mobile phone works before you camp. 6. Everyone must bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it at all times. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes with you. No tight and binding clothes and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses when you need them, so as not to stab with the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car keys with you. 10. Clear a campfire when you go to bed. 11. Pay attention to your step. If you stumble on something, break a bone. 12. Check the rear seat for uninvited guesswork. 13. If the killer cornered you, at least fight. <br /> <br /> And you know what? At least one, but usually all four main characters violate all these rules. They are the stupidest characters who ever adorn a movie. <br /> <br /> Now for some short comments. This Slasher movie had a tight budget. Four of the seven or eight actors play more than one role. The acting, the writing, the direction, the sound, the lighting, the camera work, the drawing, the editing etc. are all the bottom line. But like the classic movie JACK O that works on such a bad level, it's very entertaining and fun. So rent it and have a good time and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.
