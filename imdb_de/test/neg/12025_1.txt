How on earth does such a thing get into my DVD player at home? How is it packed and distributed at all? Are there absolutely zero screenings that a movie (and I use that term loosely) has to go through before it's put into a video store's store? I'm all for the DIY movie, but come on! That does not entitle me to bring together a group of my friends and relatives, a fucking camcorder, a terrible story, and put everything together to make a bunch of crap and call a movie. And I wish people would stop using the words "indie" and "campy" to describe these kinds of movies. They are not. In no other profession would that be acceptable. If someone tried to sell a car that was as bad as this movie, you would take it back and say it was a lemon. If it was a surgical procedure, you would sue the doctor for misconduct. I wish I could get my time and money back after seeing it. Pity about the video stores, the movies like this lead. They are a rip off for the public. You want "campy"? Get one of the movies from Friday the 13th (also the LATER) or Dead-Alive. At least you do not want to kill yourself. It is because of such films that humans automatically equate with garbage.
