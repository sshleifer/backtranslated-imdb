Obviously, a number of agents did not look beyond the dollar signs when they registered their customers for the 117-minute * Omage * at the Courtesan Complex. Of course, the film could have been fine the $ 1 million were excluded from it. Serious. The amount of the check does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and no "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage promise should ever mean "richer for poorer, for pimp as in loyalty". Imagine the story but different: 2 children, broke, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid. They clash with a wealthy businessman. The marriage of children is burdened by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, who radiates charm and stability - a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock - and with it the temptation of the woman, tension and tension. Who will she choose? Maybe I could really care in those circumstances. Honestly, Redford's selfish and manipulative Playboy makes the sympathetic character. A woman who will sell herself is exactly what a man deserves who will piss his wife out. The indecent suggestion turns the husband into a TOTAL loser who lacks any positive masculine trait, making the woman a cheap strumpet more seduced by money than by another potential love, a woman with no moral center and self-esteem, confused <br /> All the impressive talents (acting, directing, cinematography) that were wasted on this film - and those were impressive amounts - could not do it before its sparkling but trashy 1-million-meter pitch line rescue. If I see this turkey at another bridal shower, I'll fry it! (Or maybe cross it with Titanic and throw the tape in the ocean!)
