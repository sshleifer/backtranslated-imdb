Terrible movie about a doctor who goes fishing and catches a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. She makes him bring her back. Glynis Johns, in the title role, is really a stupid person with a tail hanging out. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric, but we do not see eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedies. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He met Johns in the far superior "Mary Poppins", 16 years later. <br /> <br /> Miranda causes mischief by falling in love with two men, a neighbor's fiancee and a chauffeur (Tomlinson). <Br /> <br /> Ask any mermaid you see what the best tuna is, Chicken of the Sea! Forget about this movie.
