It is terrible. <br /> <br /> Pretty short summary, I know, but it's been a long time since a movie left me in such a confused state - I wonder how the hell such a movie can be made. <Br /> <br /> The last time the turkey 'Mission to Mars' happened for the last time. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is an ex-cheater - trying to improve through self-help videos, endless seminars and improvement courses. He lives from the buzz words that represent these courses. <br /> <br /> He stumbles over a tense nightclub singer played by Nikki Bennett and has an epiphany. His new career will be that of a talent agent - with the singer as the only customer. <br /> <br /> Funded by his gospel singer, a paraplegic friend played by Sasha Horler, he founds a business and seeks to revive Nikki's career with catastrophic results. <br /> <br /> Walk the talk is why Australians so despise Australian cinema. It's poorly built, too lame and way too long (111 minutes for a comedy that was unlikely to scratch the 80-minute mark). <br /> <br /> Every scene is too long and very repetitive. The audience is given no figure to empathize with; An important ingredient in a movie like this, which is said to be about an "underdog" trying. <br /> <br /> The rundown and honestly bad ending comes after 30 minutes of the most nerve-wracking dialogues and scenes that there are you are screaming for after a power outage. <br /> <br /> This film is a failure on all levels - aggravated for the Queensland public by its liberal and unsightly use of the various locations in Gold Coast / Palm Beach; and his ridiculous use of Brisbane suburb names like Norman Park and Caboolture.
