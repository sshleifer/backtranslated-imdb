Now I have seen everything. Just when I thought it could not be more pathetic and cheesy than "Woodchipper Massacre", just as I thought dialogue and acting could not get any worse than "Nail Gun Massacre" when I thought, "Do not go in." Woods "would keep his title as the lousiest Slasher movie ever, along with" THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY! "Somehow, this cheap, miserable crap manages to avoid fornication, but it remains terrible! I can not believe my eyes - for the first time I can not complain about excessive (or in this case any) nudity in a Slasher movie, but I still managed to feel embarrassed because I rented it, never before have I seen such horrible drama, dialect, direction, writing ... I could go on with this list forever! Here's a quick look back: <br /> <br /> A mental patient somehow escapes from the garbage, dressing like a surgeon, finding out where his doctor lives, and breaks in while the doctor's daughter has friends for the night dumbest killing plague (demolished by other films like "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween ") on this side of the universe. The characters have negative IQs, suggesting that they are not human because they tend to bleed Kool-Aid when they are cut, as the Slasher likes to show off his Scapel in WAY to many scenes in front of the camera. It's only 80 minutes ... how many times do we have to look at the Scapel before it consumes the whole movie? ... which in my opinion would not be a bad idea! There is a moment when I thought, maybe just, maybe, the director would do this Make it interesting (a second killer was added), but unfortunately! It should not be! And then, to insult even further, there's a stupid super cop-out ending and an even stupid end result. It makes a lot of sense, but I'd hate to pass on the dumbest scenes in movie history to those two or three people. Ree fools (like me) are stupid enough to rent this sewage. <br /> <br /> I hope I saved someone's life by writing 80 minutes. I stand on my hands and knees and beg everyone who is still interested in renting: PLEASE, PLEASE NOT! This is a fan of the Slasher genre. I know something good for you! The only real victims in this rattling, insane nonsense are the poor idiots who have sat down all over the toilet! Zanatos' Score ... Since there is no negative score scale, I have to give a 1, but a below average 1. Avoid it in any case .... please !!!!
