The emergence of Quentin Tarantino and his dubious influence on people like Guy Ritchie may have sparked the wave of terrible gangsters from the UK that we've left behind in recent years, but one of our most famous actor exports is just to perpetuate the cycle by capturing his considerable name given to the garbage so. I only wish that he had taken a moment to think about it before choosing this project for the same reasons he benefited. It not only stifles his talent, but also the promise of future originality from British films. <br /> <br /> None of the characters in this film is personable or even remotely realistic, and the dialogue is made up of the usual empty threats and colorful language. Caine gives the material no more effort than it deserves. If this was to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la "King Lear", it would have helped immensely if I had taken care of the ultimate fate of the directors, rather than wishing that they would interfere with the shifting sands of the Life and almost immediately disappeared. <br /> <br />
