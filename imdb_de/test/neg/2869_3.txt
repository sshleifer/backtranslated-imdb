I like CKY and Viva La Bam, so I could not resist seeing it for £ 1.99 in Gamestation. It's the Bam Magera-born debut film written by him and Brandon Dicimaillo, and the entire CKY crew (Ryan Dunn, Raab himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc.). Brandon is also responsible for the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - rather CKYish in his color style - but also shows progress. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ryan Dunn's break (very casual) with girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, accidentally named after Vilo Valo?) And Falcone (Bran) play his best buddies, who stink of chaos through various stunts. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like the CKY movies, but with a linear plot (which is indeed very basic) and bad acting. It's strange that the usually super-charsmatic gang seems to have sucked the life out of them, knowing what they wanted to say next. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are pretty horrible for the most part, but the second half of the movie is much better than the first movie (90 minutes are a stretch for the movie though), and there is one Series of salvation factors such as Tony Hawk's Cameo, Dicimaillo's underpinnings such as "The Futurstic Invention Awards" and "The Diamond Bike," the soundtrack is also very strong (it's not ALL cKy and HIM - in fact, Bomfunk MCs steal the movie in terms of the use of music in the second half of the film is much more real fun - especially as Don Vito plays a pretty important role in the last part - and he seems to steal every scene he's in. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to those who like the CKY antics, but only because of the core material and not because of the filler or storyline bullshit Oh, and will someone say Bam that skating montages , especially in Movies, sooo 1998 are. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the package on the DVD is not the movie - it's the 40-minute making of 'doc. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of Raab Himself's alcholism documentary and the real feelings of the crew are surprisingly open (as usual, Bam seems to be a bit thick, especially in relation to Raab's drink) and Ryan Dunn is a really nice guy. The final ten minutes of the documentary deal with a friend (who is a rare CKY member) trying to kick heroin while staying with the crew in the Magera household - and a caring unitary group (notably Ape and Ryan) really comes over - a startling gem in an otherwise boring DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy for £ 1.99 - although I hope that Bam stays the improvised and short skits from now on.
