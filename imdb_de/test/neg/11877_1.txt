I've seen some bad action movies in my time, but this is just awful. I feel like it's a waste of time to even write this, but I'll keep it short. Why this movie shit? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurish directed and cut. 2. Bad bad behavior of the entire cast. 3. Stupid dialogues and too many clich√©s. 4. Too many action holes, many scenes do not add up. 5. Poor photographing (and many continuity problems). 6. Ridiculously poor performance of the leading actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not too good). 8. Even for a Snipes movie, he shows a great lack of acting material. 9. Unprecedented accents (by all actors). 10. Last but not least - too many implausible facts, such as a football tournament in the US. The CIA needs background checks to get new information about their employees, an explosion-proof mattress, etc. In essence - it's wasted time, it's not funny, not entertaining, not even a joke - DON "T WATCH IT !!!! Seriously, just not.
