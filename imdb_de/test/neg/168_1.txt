This is one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen, probably only surpassed by the terrible and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even give this name? I have a feeling that any respect I had for him quickly diminishes. <br /> <br /> So, what makes this movie so poor? Is it the story? Yes. Is it the actors? Yes. Is it the whole look and feel of the movie? Yes. <br /> <br /> To start the story, my God! It's about as clich√©d and predictable as what you'd expect from a drunken 14-year-old who writes too late. What I've done this summer. "The feel-good atmosphere that the creators are trying to achieve has completely drowned, while we are suffering another more painful turn to history.The actors are amateurs, I know, and therefore we can not expect that they are of the same quality as professional actors.For this to work, the characters MUST be charming and / or witty (preferably both), so that viewers do not disturb the cheeky acting or even contribute to the characters, in this case not once close baby! You like not liking the characters, and at the end of the movie (I think it takes about 90 minutes, though it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get rid of you Convincing those annoying stupid guys! It should be impossible to find the film's attempt successful, unless you yourself are like those stupid Hickey's The lack of talent and credibility mentioned in terms of acting leaves only the stupid and overly simple scenes harder. Even the family of those involved will find it hard to find all of this, but very, very embarrassing (I'd rather my sister was fooling herself on American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why Cram in a number of inappropriate Norwegian celebrities? They even look out of place as the actors, if possible. These celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the movie and are in themselves a pretty transparent setting when trying to improve something that was broken before the launch. <br /> <br /> I can not say how much I would rather dry the color than ever to watch this movie again ...
