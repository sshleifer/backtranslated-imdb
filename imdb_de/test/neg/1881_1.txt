What really intrigued me about this movie was that it sounded so wrong. First of all, who lived in the late 80's (when the movie plays) like this family? A college professor would not make enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in the movie. Therefore, he and his wife, who stays at home, would be plagued by financial difficulties, especially if they get cancer. Second, Streep is my age and most women, especially in their class (educated, white, wealthy), experienced the feminist movement. But this woman does not seem to be aware of her anachronistic behavior. I actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who considered her husband an emotional child by taking care of all his needs. <br /> <br /> The fact that so many people were touched by the movie is amazing. I admired Carl Franklin's films in the past, and actually I like Meryl Streep, but gad, what a manipulative and lying film that is.
