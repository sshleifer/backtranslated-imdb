This thing. Oh god that thing. I can not even call it a movie. A movie is something that does something. go somewhere. has a semblance of an action or something. I do not know how I do it. I really do not do it First I say that dark fields are the worst movie ever. and I thought it was like this. then pirates of Ghost Island proved me wrong. and now, for the third time in a row, another film goes beyond the call of duty to prove me wrong. <br /> <br /> (sighs) OK. Dark Harvest II: The corn. Lord, that's terrible. Let me tear it for you. Mann senses that daughters are in danger from magical psychic powers he's obviously gotten from his Act II popcorn, and runs to find them in a cornfield. Of course, this is the largest cornfield of all existence as it is the size of the cornfields of Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corn and Signs. The main character, whose name is Shy (awesome name btw), then walks through a cornfield ... finds some ghost girls, talks to them and ... runs through a cornfield. digs for a while ... and walks through a cornfield. and the incredibly sad thing? I really do not skip anything. That's pretty much the whole movie. The only thing I'll miss is that he's being followed by two policemen trying to arrest him because ... I do not know. pretend to be an actor. I did not care about it until now. He comes off and the police is in front of the screen killer - something -. holy crap, there is a murderer? Apparently yes, because he has introduced almost 4/5 in the film. but wait! then he runs away for a while, and then they roost through the cornfield and dig. Then there is the end, where he saves his daughters. huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it's boring. it is unbelievable, inhumane boring. I can not explain how cruel this thing is. Nothing happens, the characters are as appealing as a root canal, and there is NOTHING for an hour and a half. The ONLY good thing about this movie was that I and my boyfriend may have found enlightenment because of the nirvana state that this movie put us in after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to overdrive to keep us alive receive. During the ensuing madness, I found it much more pleasant to hug a wall, and my friend found a new passion for the hysterical laugh as he fluttered across the floor as if he had a seizure. That's the kind of madness this movie brings. it's not all bad. it is bad for your health. The cover looks awesome with a picture of a great scarecrow killer I would disguise as a horror scammer, but this was the most misleading box ever. DO NOT LET IT FOLLOW! DO NOT watch this movie. Look at a better corn movie. Every movie about corn is better. just do not let it get you! Not! a 0 out of 10
