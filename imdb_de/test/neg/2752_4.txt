Shemp finds out that he inherits a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Given how disgusting he looks and his personality, it is not surprising that he does not get a buyer - that is, until an article appears in the paper explaining his situation - where five crazy women appear who do not Claim your new husband (plus the money of course). <br /> <br /> Although I do not hate the Three Stooges and occasionally want to see their shorts, even on their best day, they never came near the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton. So I did not like this movie because it broke off the plot of Keaton's masterpiece SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges, it's not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or recycle older Stooge shorts. This film is from the beginning a pale imitation of an original. It's also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original, and the gags generally seem to be very forced (especially the phone booth scene). The cousin Basil Bit, however, was pretty cute and funny - if anything but subtle! The worst aspect of the film, however, was not the most funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women seemed to marry him, and the action became very fast and furious - everyone stayed in a small room and had no comedy - it ended in a hiss. <br /> <br /> Overall, a boring retread. Before you mark this review as "unhelpful", you should first see SEVEN OPPORTUNITIES to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
