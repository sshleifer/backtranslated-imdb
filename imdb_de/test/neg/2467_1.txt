This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started looking at it, assuming it was a "Skinemax T & A Strip", but apart from a few breasts that was all. I mean, I have the point of making stupid movies to show sex scenes as they are the only reason for a movie of this kind. However, this movie has no sex scenes and really does not make sense. There is no linear time, the scenes move like a fart in the wind, the people show up for no reason, then go away and it is never explained, the action is never advanced and nothing happens. I've never been so baffled by how bad a movie was until I saw that. Was the director at a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I do not know, but it looks like he's been doing a bitch with this crap because he's still working. I've literally gone away from this fool, but I still recommend watching it, as it should be shown as an example in every film school in the country, which is not to do when making a movie. Moving out of space via PLan 9, you have a new contender for the worst movie ever made.
