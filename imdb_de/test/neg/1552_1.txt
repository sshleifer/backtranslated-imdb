I rented this stinker only for its relatively high ratings. It's totally crappy! I can not imagine how anyone would think this was a good movie - even for an OK movie. None of the characters had any redeeming qualities. To varying degrees, they were both selfish and mean, or abused and damaged personalities who had no idea of ​​the Christmas Spirit (if that happens!), I know Canadians and I like them - but I can not believe that YOU too would do that that's a good movie. I'd rather keep an eye on a sharp stick than look at that offending movie again. A huge waste of time and money. Do not believe the person who wrote the opinion, it is worth to see it. This person would probably also enjoy it when a dentist drills their teeth without anesthesia. I do not want to be rude, but I can not imagine what this person thinks for my life. Unless they had ulterior motives. Maybe he / she was the director or the producer. If so, I would like to ask her to return my money. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting that piece of Drek - or rent something (anything else). I have no good reasons not to rent this movie. If I were a Canadian, I would be ASHAMED that it should be a popular Canadian strip. If so, I would say that those who say that definitely need large amounts of strong medicines. Yeck!
