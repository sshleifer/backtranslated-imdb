Based on the outstanding novel Watchers by Dean Koontz, it is an extremely horrible movie that most likely should not be seen by anyone. Not since "The Running Man" have I seen a book that was slaughtered so far unrecognized. The difference, however, is that the movie "The Running Man" was still fun, as an amusing action movie with a million buzz words. This movie?? No, nothing amusing from a distance. If you love the book as much as I do, you'll hate this bastardization even more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Rightio, basically I'll tell you that story here, almost in its entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, also do not have to suffer from this abomination - it's okay for me, because I like to crap. Because I like to complain about things. Now for the worse: This movie revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government, and a mutant monkey creature soldier who has fled a ruined GM genetics lab with a super-smart Golden Retriever the "hero" calls "Furface". Moan?? Trust me, in the novel this story is shaken. I will come to this later. Anyway, the hero is none other than this dreamy boy-kid Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero runs around in a crisp voice, trying to convince his mother to save this dog from the "evil government" that gave birth to him and made him genetically ultra-intelligent. The ape creature, cautiously referred to as "Oxcom" (God help us), is also a genetic stew of a creature built as the ultimate fighter on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers always plays madness) is in this movie too, and no, I could not figure out how anyone convinced him that this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO who chases the dog and the creature. Oh yes, here are a few Spoilerama: He's also a government creation and the same lab, and see, does most of the film spend killing a sting and killing people? And all the killing is supposed to be done by the monkey. Soldier. Instead of a rocky, scary horror movie, we have a rectal bleeding from a teenybopper horror movie. The intelligence of the dog is discovered too easily and it is believed easier than we believe that we can see the clouds by looking outside. Collapse !! <br /> <br /> Switching from book to film: <br /> <br /> - The main character (Travis) has changed from male to male. <br /> <br /> - Mann's love interest in the book (Nora) is now his mother and all her depth and character growth is completely gone. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson, black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This is important because the strength of the character is built on his inheritance in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between two completely ignored authority figures now kills Lem the man who was originally his best friend. <br /> <BR> - One main character in the book is now completely missing, the "immortal" who hunted the heroes - maybe it's supposed to be Ironside, but why is he someone else? <br /> <br /> - The dog never gets the deserved name "Einstein" in the movie. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book took place in a high school - at least nothing that strongly influenced the plot. <br /> - Does it take over a few days, more like months like the book? unrealistic pace. <br /> <br /> - Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - Character of Lem Johnson is no longer cool-headed; instead, he is a total asshole bullying his way through people. <br /> <br /> - Hero Travis was part of the Delta Force (military segment that specializes in hunting for terrorists), instead filming on his father, who is never seen in the US, was part of that group. <br /> <br /> - Perceived intelligence in the monster is now completely absent. <br /> <br /> - Subplots involving Soviets and The Mob completely disappointed the story. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most abominable changes, and the ones that I remembered well (and a day later). <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - At some point, after about 90 minutes of pain and mental agony, the movie ended. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt, did not help: <br /> <br /> - -Michael Ironside? I usually like him. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still pretty nice. <br /> <br /> - Crazy title screen with "total 80s". <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Okay, writing for one is extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so half-hearted that anyone watching the movie will do so feeling superior to anyone involved. <br /> <br /> - The show is shitty and weak, especially by Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - Loose, weak, diluted history. <br /> <br /> - The monster just looks pathetic, that is, when we actually get to see the damned thing. His head is gigantic oversized, the yellow eyes that belonged so much to the book are no longer than two seconds to see. Instead of a sleek, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we've forced some monster in a puke-ugly monkey costume. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> - Even the violence and blood pressure are bad, for God's sake, this is supposed to be a HORROR movie !! As a rule, violence is at least well done! <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz dreaded his brilliant novel to become that filthy f * cking sh *. It brings me dangerously close to vomiting myself and others around me. There are films that are worse than these (headache stimulating, as this idea may seem), but so far only "Alien vs Predator" is, at least for me, a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: The end of the credits begins. <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, that's awful) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 special effects / make-up : 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend that nobody ever watch this movie, except some some extremely tough horror fans and only if you have not read the novel. I would instead recommend to anyone interested in avoiding it completely and buying / checking / borrowing the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
