I saw this at the True / False Documentary Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, and was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a cool documentary about the protest and activism surrounding the RNC, but what I got was a largely flawed, ill-functioning, fictitious, conspiratorial, poorly woven story. I had heard of his neo-documentation technique that blended "true and false", but I expected more in the direction of a fictional plot that was developed for a better personification and creates a sense of unity between real interviews, but it was more behind one lines terribly made conspiracy theory television movie. <br /> <br /> The acting as a whole is terrible, with the exception of Rossario, which is not surprising, considering that the director at the screening said most of the main characters would not have any acting training, his excuse was that he wanted them to be real. Here's an indication that real people can not act, but actors can usually act genuinely. <br /> <br /> It would not be so insulting if it were not obviously obvious how much he dared to push this radical radical conspiracy theory across the film. It's especially hysterical when we see a scene where the director talks about the ridiculously stupid theories and secret plans. The film also does a good job of ridiculously stereotyping every single role. He tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and give each character a big "good" or "evil". <br /> <br /> Skip it, maybe find a nice real documentation /
