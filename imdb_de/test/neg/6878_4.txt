I never intended to see Venom, but I discovered it on the cable. It has good elements. The Louisiana swamp atmosphere on the one hand, something we unfortunately will not see so much in movies because of Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, an ordinary person who is permeated by the spirits of evil. His confrontation with his son could have been as interesting as the movie. But as is usual in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters except the good girl, starting with the blacks. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the aforementioned son of the villain, CeCe, who must become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for the love of God, I only want to see once that the virgin is killed. We all like the easy girl, why can not she live? In this case it was Bijou Phillips, and we love her. <br /> <br /> The end made no sense, considering what had been determined in relation to the villain's invincibility. The whole carnage and the atmosphere, and it leads to nothing.
