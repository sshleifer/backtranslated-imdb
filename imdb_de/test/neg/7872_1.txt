I rented this movie when my girlfriend was gone, hoping to see a serious military / professional action. After 10 minutes after watching this "movie" I was so horrified and horrified and sick of the quality of everything In this movie, I was ready to destroy the rented glass with a flamethrower. Luckily I could not find one. I have seen many bad movies. But that's not even bad, it's total garbage and it does not even deserve to be counted here as a movie in IMDB. <br /> <br /> I regret the people who participated in it total disgrace I hope it wins some Oscars: D.
