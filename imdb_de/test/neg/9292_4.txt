You might be interested to know that BARRICADE was considered by the studio to have failed and been put on hold for a year before the popularity of ALICE FAYE was so high that despite the fact that it was never completed, the studio would release the film wanted. At the box office it was modestly okay. Faye is referring to a murder during her nightclub in New York City - and this scene was indeed in the script and was the beginning of the film. Instead, it's completely missing and what could be an exciting sequence (including a full song number by Faye) has never been filmed. The rest of the story, however, is pretty intact and allowed the release of the film in a running time of 71 minutes. A weary-looking WARNER BAXTER is too old to be credible and credible as Faye's romantic interest is superficial as a superficial reporter. Today's audiences would be offended by the portrayal of Chinese with broken English phrases like "I like to make noise". Key Luke is one of the Chinese loyalists, but plays in an unobtrusive, uncomplicated way. Arthur Treacher is virtually invisible and receives the fourth bill on screen due to editing changes in the story. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut had a role in the movie, but his part was eventually cut out. <br /> <br /> A mish-mash of a movie that will serve as entertainment only to die-hard Alice Faye fans who have a chance to see them in a dramatic role - albeit in a weak one. Charles Winninger is completely wasted as a friendly man running the American Consulate. Despite all the weaknesses, there are a few scenes of tight escapes that are effectively played, and Karl Freund's B & W photography is first-rate.
