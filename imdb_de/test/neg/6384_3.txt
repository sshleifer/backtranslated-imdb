I saw this movie and was pretty disappointed frankly. And in my opinion, this movie is missing the heart. I honestly did not care what happened to the characters at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was so much you could have done with the film, it was not because they either went crazy, tried to be obscure, and made profound comments on life, or so hard not to try that the characters and the story were completely lost in all this. I have seen another picture of this director and I liked it a lot. But I felt that this movie lacked the mood and heart of the other, and I wondered what the point was or if the movie's meaning was that it did not make sense. I honestly did not feel like ripping my hair off during the movie, but I made up for lost time in the sad little movie. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but honestly I do not.
