Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the handsome adoptive daughter of a recently deceased Japanese businessman, takes control of her father's company. Her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), worried that he had not left the shop, ordered to meet his niece. When chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) accidentally enters the wrong hotel room and turns down the man Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for killing and killing Yumiko. Instead, he falls in love with the handsome heir and vows to protect her. However, she is abducted by Kazuo's men, while Kensuke employs an arcade game with policeman Daniel (Sam Lee). Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the business himself into trouble as his gangster buddies threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he leaves them in complete control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Kensuke is working with martial arts experts Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo), who are invincible in their hunt. He learns Kung Fu and tries to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> No Problem 2 is a mixture of broad slapstick humor, spoofery and fight scenes. A disappointing movie given the talent: 1980s kung fu superstar Yuen Baio manages to do some fight scenes, but a bit old for acrobatics these days; Director Kar Lok Chin delivers the kind of silly parody I would expect from a scary movie movie. Jung Yuen mocks his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee? Well, Sam Lee is just as annoying as ever! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou has impressed me as Gangster Ben; he has an obviously strong screen presence that has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood. Since then he has starred in two of the Matrix films and will soon be in D.O.A. directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for a very different reason: this beauty is good for the eye and should go much further in the film business. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun to work out which movies are being parodied, but after 104 minutes I found this movie a real duty to sit through. If people who make funny faces with stupid sound effects make you laugh, then No Problem 2 might please you. Otherwise, I would stay well alone.
