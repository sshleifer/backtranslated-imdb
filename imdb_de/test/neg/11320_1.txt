I have never seen a movie that is so terrible that I went crazy. It was a huge waste of time to see this crappy movie. There are many things I hate about this movie: The songs are so awful (but a bit catchy) that I hit my head against the wall (especially from the song 'Grandpa gets the pants out of Santa', the I have met) 10 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * with the armpits *), the character design and the Wicked, Greedy and Bitchy cousin Mel. I can not stand her for a second, she must have been one of the sloppiest people I've seen. Although I somehow like her southern voice. <br /> <br /> The only good side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake of Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to people to watch For the holidays it was a HUGE shame for Christmas.
