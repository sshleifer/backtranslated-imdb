Anupam Kher is a great actor. He made his debut at age 28 and played a 50-year-old in SARAANSH. Now he becomes director at OJJ. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good storyline, but it's regressive br /> <br /> The theme was made to death and Urmila's character seems too tense, while Anil Mahima and Abhi Tara tracks too suddenly and then forgotten. <br /> <br /> The movie moves at a snail's pace and begins to pull, but there are several good scenes, such as the entire conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek, in which Fardeen is to sell the house. Abhishek gets caught for a crime and Anil roars at him <br /> The climax is too much, although Anupam shows direct potential, but there is still a lot to do. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor excels in his part as Fardeen always tries hard and is alright, but needs improvement. Abhishek is excellent, this was a turning point that people realized he could act. Urmila is fine, Mahima and Tara are wasted Waheeda is good
