Like "The Blair Witch Project", "Hatchet" has gained a reputation from the bottom-up-up program (as an avid reader of Fangoria Magazine, the full-page ads are hard to miss). Even after his mediocre drama, the film only has to survive the hype around it and will eventually become a cult object. With a MySpace URL and a powerful (albeit enigmatically subjective) promise to preserve the so-called "old-school American horror", "Hatchet" will attract a lot of curiosity with its DVD release (which claim the CD itself is emblazoned). , Maybe it was the big-sized snippets from Is not It Cool News in the ads that caused me to approach the film with some discomfort (it seems Harry Knowles and his henchmen will approve each movie for VIP passports and free food ). But "Hatchet" makes me wonder what the idea of ​​writer and director Adam Green of "Old School American Horror" really is: according to the evidence here, this means the threadbare, late eighties of "Friday the 13th" and "Liberation . " The characters are hideous stereotypes (Black Guy Chris Tucker, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Old Couple, Asian Tour Guide), whose interactions are hampered by painful dialogue attempts and mostly obvious stings of humor (not quite as) bad as "Cabin Fever", but still); The script is too padded (for example, the "Raschelbuschszene"), and "Hatchet" ends as typical as any postmodern slasher in the last decade. Its only distinguishing feature is an expert-calculated hype engine. I give him a soft praise for the pile - if you can wade through the padding between the kills, the red vino is definitely a miracle and the only reason to see it.
