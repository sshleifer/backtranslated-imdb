To call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The acting was unconvincing, especially by actor Craig Fong, who was not stiffer. As far as the story goes ... well ... what story ?! The "movie" is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malaysian of Chinese descent, who returns to his homeland after quitting all classes he attended and trying to start a band. The film has always been a clich√© One can think of sex, tension among the band members and a bit of racist tension. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even on a topic that has been adequately addressed even by the most amateur directors, there is this problem. The movie is everywhere and the whole thing just feels that way, with parts that are even the hardiest Make the reviewer stop his hair. <br /> <br />
