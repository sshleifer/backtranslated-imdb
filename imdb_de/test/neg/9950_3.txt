The crazy monster starts in Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco), as he perfects his discovery of how to turn a man into a vicious wolf like a monster by injecting animal blood into a man who happens to be his somber servant Petro (Glenn Strange), apparently plans it Providing the War Department's serum to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! But first, as Dr. Cameron sought a sweet revenge on the people who rejected his experiments, forced him to resign and publicly ridiculed him. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his prodigious creation to murder Professor Blaine (Robert Strange) in an unfortunate turnaround. Dr. Cameron can not control the animal. He is discovered by local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden). The reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) learns of the story in another unfortunate coincidence and begins the investigation. He starts, Dr. Cameron suspect. Gregory goes with his daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) He has plenty of opportunities to get a taste of things ... <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Sam Newfield, this is really something from the 40s, which is even cheaper. The script of Fred Myton tugs the extremely thin premise to almost 77 minutes, which is far too long. There is no variation in the story and it's basically the same over and over. The characters are boring clichés, the crazy scientist who performs mindless experiments that make a monster, the fragile pretty daughter, the hero who plays the hero, and accidentally examine both the mysterious deaths for which the mad scientist is responsible and romantic He is busy with his daughter, the mute servant, the stupid idiotic police and the stereotypical shotguns with farmers who are getting drunk. That was probably already clichéd in 1942! The movie moves at a rather slow pace, and director Newfield never manages to sustain or generate a lot of excitement or atmosphere, which is a bad thing. Technically, the movie is not great, obviously the budget was small, and the crazy monster itself looks like it resembles an old homeless Wino who has not shaved for a few weeks and a pair of plastic joke-shop teeth in his mouth would have. Black-and-white cinematography, like most of the films of that time, is fundamental and static, while the good laboratory of Dr. Ing. Cameron consists of a couch and a table, on which are a few pesky scientific devices. The acting is stiff and wooden, and Petro looks like he's boring the whole movie. Zucco as a crazy scientist does not convince and is forgotten. The Mad Monster is a pretty lame horror movie. There is very little to talk about here, even if I made it to the end in a single session. When I think about it, that's a small achievement in itself!
