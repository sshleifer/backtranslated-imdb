ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe, shock, compassion and, yes, sheer terror. To think that actors who have done a good job in the past should come to this. The horror, the horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me, if that sounds familiar to you. <br /> <br /> A train that was built specifically for a political campaign is heading to Las Vegas for a grand rally for the candidate, a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor in both Decade as well as having ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN roles). At a railroad crossing in Utah, a meteor burns a car waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement authorities are summoned. It may be? The senator has a pretty young lady (Amy Locane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE), who happened to be married to one of the officers who answered the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train. <br /> <br /> The train departs. Lou has his buddy steer a helicopter so that Lou can get on the bandwagon (about 70 miles an hour) so he can save the day. As a reward to the buddy he crashes the helicopter into the mountain. <br /> <br /> Another example of how bad ALIEN EXPRESS is written. The buddy of the cop hero must die, we all know that. But he is supposed to die at the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives. As soon as he's on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so he can wear Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a women's tatter T-shirt. Yes, Lou is 46 years old, but he's going to the gym. The role he plays is not worth the effort, but he is in good shape. The senator will have an afternoon joy with Miss Utah, but aliens will intervene and both he and the woman are young enough to pay his granddaughter the ultimate prize. <br /> <br /> Soon we'll have bomb attacks, multiply aliens, and of course the train gets out of control and speeds up its date with destiny, while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT try to save as many lives as possible <br /> <br /> There's just one big surprise in the entire movie: at the beginning of the story, a couple lifting wine glasses for their thirty-fifth birthday, with hopes for another thirty-five years, is beaten, but he and the woman live both of them, maybe the authors just lost track of them. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you would like to hang on the wall, these actors who did a better job (and really much better earning as this) are probably just happy with the work, did they really think they were working on something valuable, or did they cry (and / or drink) themselves to sleep at night? The survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unchecked (quite a few, all in all considered). The other cars drive over a cliff, but the one containing the protagonists stops only a few inches from the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness rules. I would have thought that the first thing they would do would get off the train so they would have solid ground under their feet, but I digress. Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The earth is being bombarded with meteors breaking open and scary, crawling hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has come to a point where the words "The Sci-Fi Channel Presents" can be seen on a screen "Original" movie tells us that we are glad that we Vo so that we can go through the next two hours. Or, better still, make it easy and erase it two minutes after the beginning of the story and spend that time wiser.
