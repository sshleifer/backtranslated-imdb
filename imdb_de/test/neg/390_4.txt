The best scene of "The People Across The Lake" is the really spooky, nocturnal opening scene with a house, a murder and a lake. Then it's pretty downhill, as far as the horror is concerned. A family (mother, father, sister and younger brother) is fed up with the (mild) dangerous suburban environment and decides to live near the Titularsees. From then on, the film shows far more lame family Doo-Doo near the lake, and occasionally there are dead bodies here and there. The scenes in which they discover the bodies are quite convincing (as far as the horror is concerned), but they are in stark contrast to the other events (they only show everyday things of the family who settle there). The truth about things (the riddle of who makes the murder) is recognized too soon, and only the family knows nothing, and the viewer yawns during the non-exciting finale (with a discovery running around in the basement and in the house) as if this was the Case would be made-for-TV-Ding suddenly remembered that it should be a horror movie. It's not really done badly; The content and the story is simply not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, though his performance / character is just too stupid to be taken seriously. Blonde cutie Tammy Lauren (the daughter) could also be a recognizable face for avid horror junkies as she also starred in "Wishmaster" (1997) and TV shows like "I Saw What You Did" (1988) &. "The Stepford Children" (1987). However, she does not have much to do in this film. Skippable, but if anything to see.
