Synopsis: Hannibal is the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs. Not only is it not as smart as its predecessor, it's not even a splatter, suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media frenzy, and especially the stories about people who have been in the cinema for the rest of their lives because of the brain-eating scene and are mentally scarred: In the film, it just acts as a ridiculously bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum claim that H is not "all bad" and "it pays to look at the big screen," etc., is not mine. and it's not "so bad it's good," it's just boring. I usually respect other people's opinions, but in this case I have to say that they obviously can not say anything about Shine-Ola. Maybe they've fallen victim to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a movie by Ridley Scott and were impressed by his overuse of backlight, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is completely tension-free; instead, we see endless scenes of Lecter sloshing through an English-language Firenze, a blatantly unshakable plan with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually lay awake half the night, trying to find all the holes in the plan and when I wrote them down, I quickly filled out 6 pages in small script before I forced myself to stop). Instead of wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it appears on TV in a few years. and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Here are a few extra bones that I need to pick with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - This is the sequel to SOTL, too if some people claim in this forum. And although SOTL was a very difficult act, it was followed by sequels similar to its predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's "Manhunter" based on Thomas Harris's "Red Dragon"), and although the first episode was a very entertaining movie, SOTL was even better, another example would be the Alien series, which was initiated by H's director Ridley Scott (so much for the theory of taking sequences). In any case, the sequel is no excuse when a movie is total crap. <br /> <br /> - This movie has a renowned director. It's based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A-list, great cinematography, big budget, top-notch scriptwriters, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda and the end result is just a fart in the church. What went wrong? I think it's the fault of the producer of the film, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter", which despite all qualities was a commercial flop. Disappointed, he gave Orion the rights to the Hannibal Lecter character - for free, which allowed Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history. DDL then had to wait ten years (he is now 81 years old) until Thomas Harris finally found the successor of the novel. I think at the time, DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and desperately wanted to get his piece of cake before popping his cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that I find very annoying This blow is that there is so much undeserved hype in the media; I mean, it's boring and yet one of the most prolific productions ever, so there's no need to release it for free. And while most reviewers talk about how Dantesque are the scenes in Firenze and why Jodie Foster did not get involved, the simple fact that this movie is a total, total UTTER flop is not mentioned. But there's more: Hannibal is not only hoisted up the roof, but is also used as a media agenda for a plethora of "documentary films" (usually the remnants of similar productions to SOTL) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling. However, H does not pretend to be realistic; Lecter is no longer a serial killer (he only kills out of necessity or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (since we already know HL so no profile needs to be created) nor is cannibalism: Lecter feeds the drug Paul Krendler with his own brain, so that he (erm) does not make any vivo auto cannibalism. Try to make a documentary film out of it. <br /> <br /> - There has been much talk about acting: Mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (starring Hannibal Lecter) is usually given a lot of praise I think all these discussions are controversial. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore), but the script just does not give them anything to work with. The same goes for Hopkins: There is no development in his character and he is not challenged in any way. Incidentally, he plays almost identical characters in all his films, except that he must commit the strange murder in H and get paid for the ordinary sum of 11 million dollars.
