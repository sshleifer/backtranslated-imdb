Critics plunge into Weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, misguided, and repulsive adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it is based. Minghella's hamfisted direction of the timid bloody and shrill, overly episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this "civil war love story". Are they joking? After meeting cute little screen chemistry in a small town in North Carolina and leaving a kiss for Jew and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law are doing a two-hour kidney test whether he will survive a multitude of near-death experiences to unite with his soulmate. Who cares? Philip S. Hoffman's amateur scene chewing in a hideous and inglorious role fades to Renee Zelweger's appearance as Corn Dynamo miraculously invading the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day. Rarely has a performance of "Look, I'm acting" complimented complacency. Their sheer deafening nerve wakes the cross-country skiers for a few minutes, until the noise feels painfully thin. Strategically considered by Miramax to be an Oscar and a Golden Globe, the Weinsteins, along with Dick Clark, have become a critical community, winning 8 Globe nominations for their excessive failure. The crime is the consequence that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR films are getting dark. Cold Mountain is a concept movie and an empty, bitter waste of time. In fact cold !!!
