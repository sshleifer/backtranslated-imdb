This movie sucks a big movie. so many holes in the plot. If the devil is invincible, why does he need the protection of Arnie's bodyguards? I could not understand why Arnie did not come to work for several days and then suddenly shows up, picking up her entire armory and disappearing again !! Good job, if you can get it. It is sad that the last half hour has to lead to the standard final "uzi 9mm". Arnie's interpretation of a depressed policeman means bowing and sniffing the head. I thought he had a bad cold most of the time in the movie. For 95% of the film, Arnie is terribly scanned, "Buddy", "Dude" etc. and suddenly we hear him being called under his real name Jericho Cane (where do you get those names from ??). The end is so big that you should better prepare the Barf bag. Too bad that Gladiator finished the same end with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
