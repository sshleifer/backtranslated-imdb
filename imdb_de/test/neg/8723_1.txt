Drivel. Extremely garbage. The authors may not have read the book or seen the film by David Lynch. Not worth it to lose time. <br /> <br /> Longer does not make it better. Although the film is more in-depth than Lynch's, it has gross inaccuracies and key parts of Down's play history. <br /> <br /> "A Night at the Roxbury" is more time for you.
