Island of Death is not really a good movie, but it's a weird one. Imagine that Natural Born Killers was produced 20 years too early as a Greek Eurotrash pornographic film. That's what you get here - the weird story of a young, sociopathic British couple breaking a deadly streak through the people of a lovely little Greek island. It is not really important to build except perverse or violent sex scenes, followed by disturbingly brutal murders, which are often lovingly photographed by our charming young couple for posterity. It could have been brilliant, in its own sick and uncomfortable way, but instead I found myself impatient in the term and in the chapter index to see how long the parade would last last. Slow tempo and lighthearted drama make even the most vicious perversions of Pablum and the combination of scenes an eternity boring tricks. Ah great. You can not win them all.
