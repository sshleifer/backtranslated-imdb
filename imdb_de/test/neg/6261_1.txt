In a movie like this I appreciate the work of professional actors. I think moviegoers are generally a bit too hard for professional actors and willing to beat them for the smallest reasons. Just look at "Cheerlader Massacre" for a few minutes and trust me, you change your views. A Razzie would almost be a compliment to these non-talented actors. On the other hand, it's a Jim Wynorski movie. Wynorski is a popular director of these ultra-cheap B-Movies (having worked with Roger Corman many times). The problem with this movie is that it actually tries to develop an action. And if you have actors who deliver lines as if they were reading letters from an eye chart, how should I care? In Wynorski's "Bare Wench 2" he did not try to develop a conspiracy. He just tried to do a softcore porn / silly start on the "Blair Witch Project". It was fun and it was sparkling. "Cheerleader Masscare" is no fun. There are a few mandatory female nude scenes, but there are only a few. On an erotic level it is not worth it to enjoy it. I have to say, the worst scene is the one in which Nikki Fritz crosses a bridge that is about to collapse. First, her character did not have to walk over this bridge. Second, as the bridge creaks instead of trying to do its best, it just stands there and acts helplessly. And on top of that, we do not really see the bridge because the filmmakers did it for a budget of $ 2 !!! Unlike many B-horror movies, this movie is actually boring. And that makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (though he certainly is not over halfway decent). He was funny in "Bare Wench 2" and also had some funny scenes in this movie.
