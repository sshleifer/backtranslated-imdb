The fact that this movie is a bargain-bargain is a disgrace, but in the 1940s it was the only type of movie made for theaters that was black-and-white due to segregation were meant. So while MGM, Warner and all the other big studios made extremely polished films, tiny studios with little budget had to mess with what they had. And when you see this movie, it's obvious that a lot of energy has been put into the film, even though it's a pretty lousy movie. Some of the actors were not very good (especially the Frenchman), the sets were minimal and the plot totally stupid, BUT the movie also had good music - from different styles of classical music to jazz to rhythm and blues. This is due to many talented but fairly unknown black actors. <br /> <br /> Well, as far as the plot is concerned, she was stupid and stupid, but still in a cheesy way. I loved watching Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from the AMOS 'N ANDY TV series) in tow when he made the most ugly woman in cinematic history (including the Frankenstein Bride and many others) - that's probably true the fact that if he was not dragging, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. If the man pretending to be a woman actually looked like a woman, I doubt that the movie would have worked. It was pretty funny to see this ugly and rubber-coated man with a cheesy wig, who was still eagerly sought after by three applicants. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but fascinating and fascinating from a historical point of view Outstanding view for young adults to see how America was at that time for black people. A very interesting and funny time capsule.
