I am somehow between the lush review and the hate review. I have long been a fan of Lovecraft (and a lovecraft purist), and though this little amateur movie was of poor quality, it had a number of redeeming qualities. I looked at the worst thing I had ever seen and wondered if Lovecraft would turn it over in the grave, but I was shocked to find that I liked it somehow. <br /> <br /> I do not prefer it I do not want to catalog the film's flaws, so I would just like to mention a few that prevent this film from being an "excellent amateur effort". <br /> <br /> The budget is very low and was taken with a video camera. It has the look of some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea, it's no big deal anymore. The direction is pretty amateurish and the attitude of setting and the use of distance in the shots is quite awkward. Still, this movie was pretty scary and remained more faithful to Lovecraftian's intentions than almost all the travesties of Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna (my main exception being Re-Animator and Dagon). The idea of ​​being impregnated by an Old One is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which does not mean that this movie is as good as these stories !!), so the overall idea remains very faithful to Lovecraft's ideas. What bothered me was that the words in the Bible made a zombie inmate angry and scared. I am not sure if this should indicate that the words of "God" have upset the ancients or just that particular zombie. There was no correct answer. The rest of Christian symbolism reminds me of August Derleth's attitude to myth. In a way, this was a derleth style in myth. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this movie as a curiosity. It shows how to create a pretty atmospheric movie with almost zero budget. I really liked the winery. The outdoor shots, however, were sad. It was really sad to use the long beach and the same trees (and almost the same shot) for the journey of three characters. For that the director needs the head. Acting was standard for an amateur movie, with the blonde zombie girl receiving a personal award for "Best Identity of Gollum by an Italian Actress". I think this movie was filmed before the "Lord of the Rings" movies. Maybe Andy Sedaris watched her and thought "Dang, she would make a great Gollum!" <br /> <br /> A small compliment to the director. The make-up of the zombies was like bad goth kids. I was upset when I saw that and almost stopped to look. I was like "Oh, so we know she's evil and obsessed," but later in the movie, you see a girl who is making up like an older woman (both live). It was not an attempt to say "Goth Makeup = Zombie", but "Goth Makeup was left after Zombification". Obsessed / Zombie, however, makes equal 'blue contact lenses' ... heh. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the movie better than the Yuzna and Gordan movies (apart from the exceptions mentioned above). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this movie has done better to film a Lovecraft-like story than they do and a small budget. <br /> <br /> A quick word to the make-up artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but long, black press-fit nails looked really stupid. <br /> <br /> A short word to the author of the score: I know you could not do it The director who approved this may refuse, but as the two characters use rifles to "duel "and playing this little pipe out of" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly "killed every mood this scene had accumulated. It was cute, but sweet was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this film have read Lovecraft and had great respect for it. I enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character with the bad dreams and the character Pickman, who turns into a scary zombie.
