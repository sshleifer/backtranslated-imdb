Great music, but are not these people PATHETIC?!? A real piece of the Trippy Sixties, and that made me feel depressed. The director paints the wrong side of jet-set life and it's a hornet's nest. When the culture of time made people do these things, everything seemed like a journey without discovery, just despair. I tried, really tried to like this movie, but these people are nowhere on my side. Yes, it would be nice to see the world for a while, but I always plan to come back. Drugs are not the cause of the demise of these characters, but their lousy attitudes. These guys passionately drink their mug of poison. They cheapen their lives and in the end they cheapen the journey that is life. Was romance ever so dark? <br /> <br /> Cheers: Interesting landscape. Wonderful soundtrack by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Precautions: Dated. Depressing drugs. Completely unlikely characters; They are not flower children. <br /> <br /> Just for the curious, as most packages have the Pink Floyd connection. (Rare Floyd tracks have never been heard by many since FM is not what it was.) Review: Two stars.
