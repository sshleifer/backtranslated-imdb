I just have to comment on this movie because I rated it 4, which I think is pretty high for a soft porn mess movie. The actual plot is kind of hokey (who else would have expected that), but Hafron is so incredibly funny and he delivers everything with a cyborg voice, so it's easy for him. Whoever wrote the script definitely had a joke! I laughed out loud ten times, and that's not why anyone picks up on this movie. The only soft porn movie I've ever seen that had other merits than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is just gorgeous ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie who can entertain me considering how bad the plot was and how bad the acting is, even though the film was not made to be artistically entertained so to speak, it gets at least four in my book. I mean, who would not see that before the stop? Or my mother will shoot?
