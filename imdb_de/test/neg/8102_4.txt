This was a strange movie. A bit of horror and certainly noir. Fifth columnists meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) turns up. Soon, the only ranger in the person of the FBI agent Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore) Martin is unable to find the killer, as he is more interested in the niece (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor who Part of the gangway is. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies and the doctor is terribly disfigured by a strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and there it gets interesting and funny. I will not spill it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was wonderful as the terrible murderer.
