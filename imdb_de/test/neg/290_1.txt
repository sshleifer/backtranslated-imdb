As said by others, this is a ridiculously horrible movie (NO FILM!). It's not bad in a funny way, only painful to endure. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is quite hot but there is a scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles. Besides, she gets fat. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are so bad that they are unbeatable if you know or care about martial arts or even decent choreography, and the editing / effects are miserable /> <br / > There is no payout, there is nowhere to go and shit to get there.
