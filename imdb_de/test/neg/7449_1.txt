The first robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a sick feeling of violence. It was a fine line to walk, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and the movie went so well that it made a sequel. How terrible. (Possible spoilers in front of the door - although anything that could spoil this is out of the question for me.) Irvin Kershner is not the director of this kind of movie. He obviously did not understand the joke of the original, and as a result, the massive, meaningless violence that is over the head looks really bad - and worse is very uncomfortable. Even worse is the score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another time and the heroic, light music does not match the pictures on the screen at all! What has he achieved? The great American hero ?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated Robocop's theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without John Williams' fanfare or Indiana Jones, etc.? How can he do that? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that do not dissolve. In the beginning we see Robo "tracking" his old wife. Good, good idea. But then they drop it completely. Then there is a stupid idea that the company is reprogramming Robo to be nice. This is thrown in for 10 minutes and dropped immediately. Or the stupid idea that the repulsive ten-year-old drug king Robo is reminiscent of his son - Once again a faint motive, which is briefly shown twice and discarded. This may work in a comic, but not on film, and Frank Miller was too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea into the kitchen sink. It does not work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to praise the entrepreneurial strikes in this film and the privatization of the police. That's the best part of the movie that matches the first one. In the original, however, the old man was a tough businessman who aimed for profit but was ultimately fair. In this movie he is just mad in his greed for money and power. You can not change the characters for no reason. And the character of Nancy Allen is useless in this movie, while at first it was essential to Robo's quest for himself. It is as unfounded as the violence in this film. <br /> <br /> And the violence, yes the violence. I enjoy many violent, bloody movies when they serve and tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to assume that people will be torn to pieces, shot to pieces, children who demand death and torture, and people's craving for drugs. He does not know when to stop. Do we really need to see every innocent bystander (including people who want to help others) see him shot? It is concluded when we see the bad Robocop shoot again and again! Instead, Mr. Kershner proves he has very little taste for this kind of work and creates a hideous jumble that is a horrible piece of Pop Art and worse - a disgusting message of violence for every adolescent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not intended as a message, so I certainly do not watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However, if you go too far and cross the border, much of what you do has to be called into question. And as far as the movie is concerned, in the words of the last drug dealer of the bad child who dies while he dies: "It still sucks."
