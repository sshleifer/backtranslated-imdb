The most hardened worshipers of John Wayne will be scared when they look at The Lawless Frontier. Even for a studio in the poverty area, this is a stinkeroo. Unusually for a western, we have a criminal who is a sex offender. Earl Dwire plays a half-breed white and Indian woman who, for reasons that are not explained, pretends he's a Mexican, a hokey accent, and everything. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito, who became famous at the time. <br /> <br /> He and his gang meet Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really have nothing of value, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and get away with it. She hears her fated fate and she and Hayes flee the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where they happen to meet John Wayne, who is tracking the bandits. They also meet a very stupid sheriff who thinks Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons that I can not quite fathom. <br /> <br /> It was a hard way to earn the Duke a living mushrooming opera like this one. Luckily, better things were on the way.
