I have not laughed so much for a long time - or seen such an inappropriate movie! Do you speak so badly that it made me laugh! <br /> <br /> First, I estimate that for about 40 percent of the movie length I could not say what happened or even what I saw. I can only describe the camera work when Frenetic meets LSD. There are whole segments, for minutes, in which all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of the cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable things. I spent half of the movie asking my teenage daughters what was going on, but they could not do better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are the "black" moments when we try to scare ourselves (woooooooo) all the lights go out and the screen gets pitch black - and I do not mean it just for a few seconds. I think the longest took almost two minutes. I think the empty movie is one way to keep costs down ... I guess the "director" had recently read a book about all "must-do" assignments to make a scary movie to turn and decided to throw them all in - about 20 times. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this movie: 1 / It's short at 90 minutes (although still one and a half hours too long!) 2 / All characters die (after all, it's impossible to get one of to take care of them). 3 / There was a really good scene: When the group looked up the shaft, they fell down after finding that their rope had fallen to the ground (saw THE coming), pushing a large boulder through the opening and sealing it you. I WASN I do not expect that, and it was really cold. <br /> <br /> And what about the early campfire scenes with the shot, after the shot, after the shot behind the camp lights. I swear that the director used the same shot about 20 times in 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I am sure that after the first kill the exact same shots of blood on the floor of the cave will be used twice 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all a CRAP movie piece. I'll see almost everything, but that's close to the point where I would draw the line.
