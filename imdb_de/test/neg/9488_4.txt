One of the more prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A woman wearing a red shirt falls in love with Khan (instead of falling for a change) and then reveals Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty was a nonexistent trait on the ship. One wonders what kind of psychological tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test humans when hired. The same kind of absurd lack of loyalty we have in "Wink Of An Eye" when a man wearing a red shirt takes the side of the enemy just because he falls in love! Same as SS. (In this episode, however, the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall presentation.) This is very stupid, because Kirk's crew again looks like a bunch of soft-edged, easy-to-impress idiots who - once they have fallen into the enemy in love - are able to do almost everything. The fact that McGivers returns to Kirk's side does not improve the illogic in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan held behind a regular door when he knows he has superior power? This is one of several ST plotters that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's neck? If Khan is of such superior intelligence, one would expect him to be more reasonable with the way he wears. And what about a sikh played with a latin accent? Montalban should have received a singing teacher. I had half expected, "the Plaaain! The Plaaaain!" To listen. at any time in the background. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship's captain) provide the ship's library indefinitely in terms of ANYONE's innermost technical details? Is Starfleet an institution made up of idiots? <br /> <br /> SS is a very funny, silly episode, so no wonder trekkies love it. It does not contain too many sci-fi elements, which trekkies hate the most. It also turns out that the ST series has revived this boring character for the second film, which pleases the daring trekkies who were so disappointed with the first film that, as you guessed, they are far too much science fiction for the average tiny had trekkie brain
