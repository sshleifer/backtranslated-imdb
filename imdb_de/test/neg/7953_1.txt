Maybe you have to be a former hippie to fully appreciate this, because apart from a few outdated fashions, music and dialogues, it does not have much to offer these days. Four cheerful colleges art students enjoy carefree days painting nude models and riding a motorcycle. They take acid in a scene and go to a zoo. A sign reading "Do not Feed The Animals" flashes on the screen. Suddenly they are in a cage and laugh and hang on a chain tire swing (?!). A nasty artist (Larry Swanson) narrates (in a flashback) how his art career was almost ruined due to a crippling hand disorder. He sends black dressed zombie minions to kidnap people and injects them with a serum that distorts their faces. He tries to create a new form of abstract act (I guess the details are a bit fuzzy here, to say the least). Jason (Ross Harris) wants to save the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) was killed and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate) was abducted. I found the zombie make-up in ZOMBIE LAKE awful, but wait until you see it here! It's from Douglas Hobart, the star of DEATH CURSE OF TARTU. A minor role is played by Brad Grinter, the director of the Z classic BLOOD FREAK, which is much, much more fun than this deadly, boring turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> The Regal version of 1984 contains the wrong cast (for THE BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
