The scariest thing about the new horror film by freshman director Carter Smith "The Ruins" is the final criterion, in which the comedian Ben Stiller is listed as one of the executive producers. What did Stiller think as he sank his money into that cooler, over cursed carnivorous undergrowth that sneaks up on its victims and devours it. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of "A Simple Plan", who adapts his own best-selling novel, keeps abreast of the usual stereotypes and conventions of all twenty fearsome sagas in which reckless youths do everything except the signs of evil to eat her. If cretinous characters in this nihilistic nonsense were not enough to fight it, we'll be treated to another movie in which American tourists are in danger just because they're Americans. Unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters need to be fed, "The Ruins" offers no explanation for the supernatural phenomena of their vicious vines. <br /> <br /> The setup for "The Ruins" is similar to the horror film "Turistas" of 2006, in which sleepy South Americans have trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. In fact, "Turistas" have generated some legitimate thrills. "The Ruins" brings nothing distracting or shivering. A vicious mastiff suddenly appearing in front of the camera to growl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. <br /> <br /> The rest of "The Ruins" borrowed from another film: "The Descent", a great chiller from the year 2006 about a bunch of babes who are lost in a nightmare when they are in one Tangle of caves inhabited by Albinomutants with blood lust for murder. A few other films that have served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind. They are the straightforward classic horde of 1968 "The Lost Continent" about murderous vegetation that threatens innocent bystanders in a sea of ​​abandoned ships, and the Roger Corman cult class "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) about a New York florist Growing up a man-eating plant in his shop. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" unfolds in scenic, sunny Mexico, where four American college kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore from the "X-Men" movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of " The Covenant "), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of" Sleepers ") and Amy (Jena Malone of" Pride & Prejudice ") end their tequila-soaked spring. Stacy loses an award-winning earring in a motel pool, but a helpful Teutonian twenty-year-old tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson of "Copying Beethoven"), brings him back and is hugged by the group as his new best friend. These people are celebrating and they have already become friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his stubborn brother, who has accompanied a cute archaeologist to a secluded Mayan pyramid, which is not listed in any travel guide. He offers to take her and accept her. <br /> <br /> First rule in horror movies: If nobody knows where you are going, it is wise to avoid this. With only one more day left and nothing adventurous to do, our two couples, along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid. They take a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A taxi driver looks at the map and warns them to stay away. Second Rule for Horror Movies: If the natives warn you to steer clear, steer clear. A crisp $ 20 bill helps him change his mind, and he brings her to her destination and then he goes in a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> As soon as our heroes have found the mysterious Mayan pyramid, which is covered with undergrowth and looks suspiciously like a variant of the Mississippi Kudzu in the jungle, superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is being persecuted and kill Dimtri unhesitatingly when trying to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety on the pyramid, while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually, the vines sneak out to greet and eat our heroes. At this point, "The Ruins" turns into "Bug," the youngest and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that gets under your skin. It is not long before our heroes try in vain to extract the tendrils under their skin. A particularly cruel scene shows how the Americans cut off the legs of the German man to save his life. In comparison, the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition tame. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" is just a grape variety in which nothing can be redeemed.
