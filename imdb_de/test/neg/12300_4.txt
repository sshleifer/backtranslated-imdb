"The 4th Floor" is a decidedly mediocre film in which Juliette Lewis plays the lead role as a young interior designer with a problematic neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited a grandiose 5th-floor condo from her grandmother and, by agreement with the landlord, gets ridiculously low rent. Her friend (William Hurt as a scary weatherman) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves in and strange things happen, and since this is a B-class horror movie, there's a stupid, unrealistic reason. While the not-too-fascinating Jane is constantly trying to tell others - her boyfriend, the police, and her staff - what's going on, everyone thinks she's losing it. Of course, she has to face the problem - the madman who lives directly beneath her. Neither scary nor interesting. The only saving grace of the film is Lewis. She is a very good actress, but she is badly used here, which does not mean that she is not the best thing about this movie - because she is. She has wild charisma and keeps the video better than a dozen silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie. However, this type of film is not worthy of her - which is ironic as she is probably the only reason someone would see him.
