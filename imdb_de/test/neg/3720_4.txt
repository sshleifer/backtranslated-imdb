Gentle and mild Edward G. Robinson (as Wilbert Winkle) decides to give up his banking job and do whatever he wants, and he opens a repair shop behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married but childless. He has become friends with the local orphanage Ted Donaldson (as Barry). The young Donaldson is a keen workshop assistant and sees Robinson as a father figure. Robinson's nagging wife Ruth Warwick (as Amy) is dissatisfied with Robinson's career choice and conspires to question her normalcy. Her life is further interrupted when Robinson is drafted. The war also interrupts a potentially interesting story, as Robinson's character fights against a domineering, unsympathetic woman. Filmmakers may show how the war can save marriages and positively redirect life. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has an unfavorable part. The end trick played by Ms. Warwick and Donaldson is predictably staged.
