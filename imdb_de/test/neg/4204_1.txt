I work in an office on weekends and there is a TV that gets only ONE channel. So I do not have the opportunity to turn to something better. I stop it because it creates a bit of background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I got "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a third sentence (which of course is the case). All the actors and the bad guys look like they've just graduated from the Stuntman School. I saw better dramatic productions at a carnival. The special effects (flames at the end of the movie are more fake than Michael Jackson's masculinity). Even the horse at the end of the film was a terrible actor ... A poorly working, badly shot, poorly written movie.
