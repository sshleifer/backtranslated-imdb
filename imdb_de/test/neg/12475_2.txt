A film by Almodovar sends a tingling sensation into my spine each time. The capitalized print that opens the latest feature of the Spanish author instantly brings back memories of brisk nuns, gentle necrophiles, nimble transsexuals? And after a nice opening montage, while the camera drove over a windswept graveyard, alive with a bunch of widows scrubbing feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro had put me back in his evil spell, there was not much to occupy. For a director who loves to bring humanity to the assassins and rapists, he does very badly to find emotional depth or endearing quality in his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a wayward housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental death of her abusive husband by her daughter. Luckily, she lives in Almodovar, Spain, where her friends will be pleased to provide a corpse for offering a round of cocktails. Add to the crucible the spirit of Raimunda's mother and a host of other eccentric warm-hearted matriarchs. "Volver" literally means to return and Pedro seems to recycle old material. The underground of incest feels as if it were pinned as a compulsory "taboo". Instead of commenting or undermining the subject, as in his treatment of pedophilia in Bad Education, it feels compulsive and unconvincing amidst the sensitivity of the film's chick-flick movie. I suggest that Almodovar call his next movie Salir (to go on).
