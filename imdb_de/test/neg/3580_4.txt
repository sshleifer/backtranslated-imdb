'R Xmas is one of the few films I've seen and in which I can almost say nothing just happens. I felt like I was watching a middle-class drug trafficking couple running around with kids, eating, smoking, talking (apology I swear) through most of the movie. And I do not think I miss the point. I think this movie was well directed, well played (though the man's performance was more of wood) and the constant sense of impending demise. The viewer was certainly involved in every corner. But when the dust clears, your left is at zero (just a boatload of fades). I did not want chases, rifle violence, punches, etc. In fact, I'm tired of violence. But oh dear, let's dive into all these characters, at least (get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better - do not just glimpse them as street thugs). Why was the dialogue so youthful? Everyone spoke as if they were in junior high. I believe that this side of our human race can say something other than fu_ _, sh_ _ and so on. I found the tempo and story of 'R Xmas quite interesting, but the execution was plain-and-empty.4 / 10
