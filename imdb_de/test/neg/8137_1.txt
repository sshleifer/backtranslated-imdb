Barbara Payton is the presumptuous hot-blooded young hot chickie wife of the Geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungle lot in a cheap Hollywood studio. Raymond Burr wears his shirt with the top button and is cracked as the chunky plantation foreman Mrs. Payton wants to blow the joint with. There's another girl, a kind of peasant slave Burr used to play around with, but he gave her the old squat, so that the obligatory, clumsy old voo-doo witch conjures up a good spell on him and the Payton -Tramp works. I've only partially seen it, because it's really terrible, so I did not even see the star of the show - what I think is a gorilla that the voo-doo-witch made somebody or whatever ... .. who cares. I give this a half star out of a possible ten. It is not even without a fight, but really bad.
