This is an admirable attempt by the first-time filmmaker Ham Tran to give a little insightful look at the Vietnamese war victims fighting for liberation. With a chunky, self-assured informative dialogue and subordinate action, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not bring to life this limp, though historically worthy, melodrama. Pay attention to the often distracting separation between actors and reality on screen, and you should have an informative, if somewhat impersonal, lesson in post-war Vietnamese history.
