** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A hapless South Sea Islander is executed by other (cynical) Native Americans after being friends with visiting scholars Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. The scientists dug it up and found that it took the form of a humanoid tree. He comes to life and rages, and it is certain that the Boogeyman of the fifties, the A-bomb, is held responsible for this deviation. To claim that this monster runs like a stick, the A ** is superfluous. Suffice it to say that the creature, like the movie itself, joins in, throwing its enemies into a handy quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments about. Paul Blaisdell designed the tree-man suit and it's hardly his best work. Over the years, this movie has become too many comments like "Hell, it can go!" Personally, I think it's the best walking tree movie I've ever seen.
