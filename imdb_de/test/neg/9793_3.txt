A boring yawn of a movie that contains nothing of the zing and rascality of its predecessor, "Gold Diggers of 1933". The Production Code was firmly anchored at the time of this movie's release, so humor is the whole hokey, wocka-wocka twist and the dry one-liners that felt so cosmopolitan on the lips of the beautiful ladies first movie disappeared. A cast of stars and character actors from the second row goes through the movement here, and the theme "Show on a show" seems to be terribly forced; The show here is not a charity or break world, but a charity event hosted by a chic hotel. Who really cares if the show goes on? The score here is boring too. Of course, the big number of the movie "Lullaby of Broadway", which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about the possible demise of a New York celebrity from having too many parties - does not necessarily have the same effect as the burnt "Forgotten Man" track finale in '33. Busby Berkeley conducts and choreographs this film, and what appears in the film's flowing opening scenes deteriorates rapidly. Unfortunately, no one has learned from it, and two years later there was another film by Gold Diggers. <br /> <br /> grade: C-
