A cheesy "B" thriller of the early 50s, the story is funny, the wooden figures, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only sex spots that make them an eye-catcher, but a short shot, just a few frames long, shows one The "el" train, which crosses the river on State Street, takes the picture of the 6000 Series Pullman car in its original 1950s livery, as it was delivered in 1950 when it was redeployed. I think films like this, Ulmers DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, THE FUGITIVE with Harrison Ford, and other movie noir genres (big city dramas) make it interesting, if not for nothing, that I know Chicago and San Francisco very well, and recognize most of the street locations. Otherwise it is a really boring movie!
