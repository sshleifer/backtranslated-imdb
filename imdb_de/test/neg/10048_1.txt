The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this movie is "Graveyard of Horrors," but I think that must be a mistake. It should have been called "Cemetery of the Terrible". Terrible drama, terrible editing, terrible story and terrible music make this movie a horrible movie set in a terrible graveyard.
