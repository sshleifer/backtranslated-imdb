I had read online reviews and praised this obscure trip as a combination of bloody horror, quirky black comedy and cross-border art house. the film has elements of all three, to be sure, but they are at the service of such a stupid premise (the title immediately abandons the game)? and amateurish production to boot ?? that its long-term neglect due to a lack of adequate distribution? Basically, until Cult Epics recorded it for the release of the DVD 30 years after its launch! ?? was not a big loss for the cinema or even for the genres. The bed was apparently created for the inclusion of a demon with a woman; A dying man who uses and even painted the four-poster bed lands in the wall behind the screen (!) And intermittently comments on the 'action'. Several people (from teenagers on board to hidden gangsters) feed the hungry bed. At the latest on the menu are three girls? one of them, however, remembers his mistress of long ago and consequently the bed apparently fears her! See different objects? from cigars to fried chicken pieces ?? and the people who are swallowed (the belly of the bed is portrayed as a tub of honey-colored liquid) sometimes make the movie mildly amusing (especially when the hands of a young man are reduced to his skeletal formation, which he seems to take rather easily in his step!), but also terribly repetitive, so that the whole senseless exercise already tense after 77 minutes and feels almost desperate.
