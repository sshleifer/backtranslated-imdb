This spaghetti western uses three main American characters who take away some of the typical spaghetti aura. The plot is about an amnesty that the governor of New Mexico gives to all willing criminals to give them the chance to start a new life. Usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events, but in this movie it seems to be more of a license to kill, as even new crimes (such as the threat of the governor) are forgiven. History is an endless chain of murders in which almost every character has only the purpose of delivering more carcasses. Only the few leads have endurance. Clay McCord is afflicted by nightmares that refer to a childhood event in which he has killed a surprising number of people. In the midst of eternal chaos, this kind of reflection is not believable. Compared with similar films such. BANDIDOS None of the characters in this movie was sympathetic to me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the weak content aimed at specific customers, this movie is well turned. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
