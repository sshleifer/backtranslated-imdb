I just can not get these ratings! I can not help but think that they were written by a LOG fan who would worship everything without ever asking if it's really good. This movie was a pointless project. I could forgive the ridiculous action if I had come out of the cinema and laughed more than twice. At some point I thought it might just be me, before I realized that barely a laugh was coined by the rest of the audience stretched over 90 minutes), but thought that the weird bit of classic LOG dialogue or visual jokes (as at the beginning of each Program) would wear a film. After five minutes of the 17th century conspiracy, I asked for an end (little did I know it would continue for the rest of the movie). It just was not funny. <br /> <br /> I was just massively disappointed and can not see that the story is too friendly, even if a few diehard fans write rave reviews.
