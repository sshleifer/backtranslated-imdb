There is a part of a sequence in which some water rushes into the sunken level, everything else that happens in this movie is archive footage for the airport 77. In some shots you can even see Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee. A total rip-off? Almost by definition. There may be more footage in this movie than in Plan 9 from space. <br /> <br /> All new material in which actors sit and talk on a plane is bland and dreadful on every level. Dennis Weaver is utterly wasted in a career-low movie, though this is true of anyone but director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of many false names to continue working. <br /> <br /> There is a degree of lack of professionalism that makes this movie a waste of time. Actually, it would be better if it was taken by someone with no technical knowledge, because Ray has just enough knowledge on how to put together a scene in the worst old-school television fashion, that this movie, like most of his films, is completely free of Life is. The worst kind of hacking. The worst movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie is a waste of money, a matter where crews at all levels are ghosts hoping that they will get a low paycheck and that nobody will see or know them , participated in this rip-off. There are so many people who want to make films, it's disgusting to see how Ray burns the money to do nothing but fill in time that he's really Fred Ray because he's not credited in the movie itself. That has led me to see that it will not deceive you.
