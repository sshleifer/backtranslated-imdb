K Murli Mohan Rao made the MUCH BETTER BANDHAN 1998 This movie is a terrible remake of THE WEDDING SINGER <br /> <br /> In short, the movie consists of: Salman Khan, who used to play the role of a dejected lover he loses his girl and also had his comic scenes, in which he still has hammered badly today, makes it good, he does everything here and also loses his shirt in scenes. Jackie Shroff- wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra, then he is shown in 1 scene as a womanizer. <br /> <br /> Indian Kumar - confusing characterization again <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee- boring, overweight and does not do anything special. Pooja Bhatra- tall, fair and worthy of an actress but lacking in talent. <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah- says a dial like a poetry - poor guy the two kids were too awful <br /> <br /> The story is the same and has terrible comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes as well as a forced comic track by Shakti Kapoo r <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Music is decent <br /> <br /> Salman Khan only goes through the motions, Jackie is bad, Rani is like usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing big Indian is terrible
