I could not help but look at the time every five to ten minutes, as I found this movie as a slow as a whole. Childish humor, cheap-looking sets, cheap-looking effects, a plot that makes "Legally Blonde" look like "The Usual Suspects", and so many coincidences that I can now officially state that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he likes as a trademark are some cool camera shots, but that's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a spy film for kids. If I were 12, I would feel insulted. The best in this film is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino, who has just stolen every scene in which she was. Unfortunately, there were not many. 4.10
