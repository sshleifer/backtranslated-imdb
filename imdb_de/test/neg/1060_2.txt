My Caddy Limo was destroyed !!! Well, I had one that just likes it - I drove the Hoi Polloi and many of the Chosen around Manhattan for a few years. <br /> <br /> That was a lot more entertaining than this movie that I can tell you. Lordy, what a bomb - how to walk in RPG. I also drove much more stars in my white caddy than in this dud movie. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and has done a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his role like a circus clown with red noses. If he could not take it seriously, why should his audience? In the first shooting hour, the director should have kicked his butt out of the set. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written by 10-year-olds for 8-year-olds. Surprised, there was not much more about the sets. Well, I'm a film fanatic - ergo - you have to take the bad thing to make a difference.
