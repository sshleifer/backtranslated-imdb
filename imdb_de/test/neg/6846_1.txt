The worst hardcore movie fan will be surprised by the general inability of this "z movie". Mary Woronov, a clever actress best known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar at Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best on this trip. This movie is almost too bad even for MST3K - honest!
