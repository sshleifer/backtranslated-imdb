This year's Eurovision was a big disappointment for me. I've seen the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (at least this is the first one I can remember, and I was only two at the time). Like every year, this year contained both good and bad and horrible songs - nothing new. However, this year's show was the worst I can remember. Very few good (decent, probably more so) songs and a lot of absolutely horrible songs. <br /> <br /> The Turkish winning song "Every Way That I Can" sounded like a rip off of Turkish singer Tarkan's press on "Simarik" and sounds a lot worse. It did not deserve to win in my view. The second-placed Belgian song "Sanomi" was a no-language song. Wondering what's next? Sing animals? Still, the music was quite catchy for the song, giving the song a kind of dreamy feel to which the "lyrics" seem appropriate. One of the better songs, but that does not say much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in Eurovision history, the Russian duo t.A.T.u. Only three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, the third place ended with "Ne Ver ', Ne Boisia" ("Do not trust, do not be afraid"). To me t.A.T.u. was one of the few highlights of the show and pretty much surprised everyone that she was among the most trusted girls of all female contestants. They let their song speak and if we ignore the fact that they did not play a few times in the first chorus, then they let the song speak really well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise, if you look at this scoreboard was Austria. The bookmakers here in Denmark had the best chance of making this song - a song that was not that terrible indeed - but finished eighth. Could it be that this butt was shaken to the rhythm of the song? This performance made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was really fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden has done what it does best; ABBA. In 1999 they won "Take Me To Your Heaven" sounding like ABBA. In 2001 they made the Top 10 with "Listen To Your Heartbeat", which in turn sounded like ABBA, and this year they made it ABBA again and ended up back in the top 10. England was finally in for the making of this terrible, not punishing non-invasive songs that they have been in recent years. Ireland demolished the winner from the year 2000 "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I could always say how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I'm a little sorry for the Aussies who finally got the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest this year. They deserved better than that. <br /> <br /> However, I was not surprised by the show. The Euro Vision from 2000 to me is one of the best in recent years. 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. 2002 was okay, but certainly not anymore. This year was just disappointing. <br /> <br /> Let's hope it gets better next year. If not for us, then at least for the Aussies. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for t.A.T.u., one for the close race, one for the butt shake and one for everyone else.
