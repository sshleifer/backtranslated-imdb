Everyone knows the so-called conspiracy, so let me go hunting. <br /> <br /> Casual Frivolity. Miscast performers who work hard to have fun so you can have fun. The ingenious Meryl Streep is a great try. Pierce Brosnan is just embarrassing. Inexplicably, on a Greek island. Many squeal, screeching women. Lots. <br /> <br /> It was a silly juke boxing musical on stage, now it's a big, sparkling, badly shot juke boxing musical. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, an attack on the senses and an insult to the intelligence that left you leaving the theater. I gladly admit that I did not really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did it, but out of love for God. Why is my gender yelling and screaming for joy? Have you ever sat beside a table with women who drank too much and are determined to spend BIG night in the city? That's the feeling of this whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped.
