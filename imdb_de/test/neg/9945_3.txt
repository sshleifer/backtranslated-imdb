I heard a lot about the imaginative camera work and directing in this film. I thought both were a mess <br /> <br /> and also something really horrible spectacle. The main character of the film is irritating and can contribute in any situation. Everything she does or says is stupid, and in general, it just seems like people are losing their lives. If she could fight, I could forgive her. <br /> <br /> All in all, the women in this film are stereotypical "brothers" who need a man to rescue them. and all the men in this movie are muscular, weak minds who can not save anyone. Instead, look at something like the sword of fate. I hear that it's much better than this confusing mess of a movie.
