In an unsuccessful attempt to be taken seriously and go into "adult" movies, Hughes gives us this movie about a young couple. True, every clich√© in the book is included, stupid fantasy stuff and all that, but more importantly, Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> The best actress ever to appear in a movie by John Hughes. It gives the weight a weight that increases the sometimes stupid material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as a husband, but McGovern steals the movie with its quiet, true moments of honesty. The 'teen movie' fun that has worked so well in other Hughes movies is quite pronounced here - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh at 9, but he always tells you when you're 15 and you wish he would find new material. But I keep coming back to McGovern's performance because it's really moving. Mr. Hughes most interesting films for me have real actors (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and if his material meets a real talent, some wonderful things can happen. If only he would trust that it does not have to be mixed up with the stupid fantasy stuff.
