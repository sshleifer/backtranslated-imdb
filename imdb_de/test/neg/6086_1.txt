By far, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I watch virtually every movie that runs in the evening (either Showtime, Hbo, Cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you as excited as drying color just to make you feel even miserable. If you want to feel that you have wasted only an eternity for the worst movie you ever did, then watch this movie anyway. I must have shouted at least 900 times before the idiotic twists. If I had four hands, I would give this movie 4 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I believe that the only people who like this movie are those with terrible morality.
