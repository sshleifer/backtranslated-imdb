OK, this movie was not good at all. Video games are not what I would boast of if I was over 15 years old. To play cool games but to write a comment about video game players may like this movie. Just play a video game, do not make a sad story about being trapped in one. I use my phone, I hope I do not lose my girlfriend. Fat is the worst thing ever? OK, Grease has a very elaborate history and is also a musical. Even if you do not like musicals, everyone would say that grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time and he looked for 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. I am asleep.
