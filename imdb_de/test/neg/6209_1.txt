There was no 0 in the voting option, so I had to use the next available number. <br /> <br /> It's a sad day for Bollywood, when those movies that have star cast actors are nothing more, they are a bunch of youthful acting and a horrible screenplay. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means a clone of hitch. Salman Khan with his usual slimming shirt, and Govinda with his humorous laugh. If someone said two decades ago that I would write a comment on Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written him off.
