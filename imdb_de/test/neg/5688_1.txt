The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of the war, the human cyborgs, battles and history. Then two actors are thrown into a gravel pit. They walk around this gravel pit / desert area and shoot each other for about an hour. That's it. Must have cost about Â£ 10.00, with change. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Marks of Ten: Acting -9 Sets 1 Costumes -9 Director -50 Production 1 Titled Intro 4 <br /> <br /> I think to improve this movie would be: to lose the comment , (Let the guard decide what's going on). Remove some of the horrible CGI. Add some techno-rave music. You could only save it .......
