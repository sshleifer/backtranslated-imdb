This is one of those movies in which I rooted, who finished the movie the fastest. I wanted the cops to kill Keaton AND Garcia just to get it over with. Basically, this is the deal: Two policemen have to die and a third has to get terrible facial burns for Garcia's son to receive a bone marrow transplant from the convicted killer Keaton. Is it worth it? No!
