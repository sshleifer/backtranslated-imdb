I have seen this movie without knowing much about it. The split-screen device was immediately irritating and after completing the title sequence the situation did not improve for me. The plot, the characters and the dialogue were all extremely stereotypical - the poor guy from an abusive family is thrown from home, wants to leave his lot, reinvents himself, changes his voice, puts on other clothes, is adopted by a gay man he wants to abhor on his way to an international set of drug addicts of British aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The estate of Patricia Highsmith (talented Mr. Ripley) was to sue the creators of this film. The triple screen, together with the duration of over 120 minutes, underlines the almost nonexistent editing. I can not decide which picture works and which is the strongest. Why not show three and hope you do it right with one of them. This gimmick removed any connection or interest that I had with any of the characters. Important dialogues were repeated three times on each screen, as if to say, "This is an important / moving / deep moment, ok!". <br /> <br /> Do not waste time. <br /> <br />
