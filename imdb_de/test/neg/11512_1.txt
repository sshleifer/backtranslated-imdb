For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet, this movie is absolutely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen was Ballet Theater at that time, now American Ballet Theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but apart from Dame Judith Anderson, acting is amateurish and Checkov is totally over the top ... embarrassing! I saw this movie at the age of 14 and at that time, when I had never seen a ballet, I was very impressed. Later in life, long after completing my own career as a dancer, I bought the videotape, curious about what it looked like after so many years. I could not believe how naive Hollywood could be in the world of ballet. However, it was made in the mid-1940s before the red shoes or the tipping point, the latter forming a true image of the ballet world. The entire cast of Specter has since died ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) died at the age of 79 years. It was his only movie, which was later kept by a businessman from Chicago ... so the rumor.
