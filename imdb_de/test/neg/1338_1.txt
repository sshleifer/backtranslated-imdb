No! No no no! My entire being rejects this horrible remake of a classic movie. I knew we were on our way ever since Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes. They literally looked like a scarecrow in this garden where they dug. Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan - how boring is that ?! And it got worse ... so much worse. The terrible stereotyped lines, the stick characters, the growing sense that I was watching a spin-off of The First Wives Club, and the ultimate Hackney fate in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it feels like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh. To shame!
