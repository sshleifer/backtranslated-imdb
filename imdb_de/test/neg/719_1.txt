I read all of Shakespeare's plays, watched productions of a majority of them, and even played and directed them myself. I do not necessarily think Shakespeare needs to be done in a "traditional" way, but I hated that movie. <br /> <br /> There is nudity that is free and unnecessary. There is a grotesque that goes far beyond what Shakespeare intended, in my opinion. Part of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and there are elements such as singing and dancing that do not add meaning to the film, but replace Shakespeare with the director's indulgences. <br /> <br /> I have to say that unfortunately I have wasted absolutely good money to buy the DVD of this film.
