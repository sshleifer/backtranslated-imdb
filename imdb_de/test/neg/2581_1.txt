"The Patriot" starring Steven Segal is a late 90s thriller / action movie that is not really a thriller or an action movie. It's more like Steven Segal, who plays Steven Segal with a different name, but this time he's a Native American country doctor who gets his butt off every time. Given the obvious holes in the storyline, the film itself is absolutely amazing as far as the blatant disregard for character development is concerned. <br /> <br /> From a marketing perspective, I asked myself, "Who in the world have you targeted?" The biothriller plot line is far from the American population, and Segal as a silk cowboy would never sell to anyone, even if you fry him and place him between a Kripsy cream donut. The whole movie is just out there, even for Segal fans because it just does not run on any level.
