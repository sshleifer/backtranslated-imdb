This movie was awful, plain and simple! The animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was very clear that this film had the budget of my food bill !! The acting was just as bad. I have seen better acting in porno films. I would seriously like to have the hour and twenty minutes of my life back. In fact, I signed up with IMDb just so other people can not see it like me. Do not get me wrong, I love sci-fi movies! This seemed more like the intro of a video game :( I'm glad I spent just one dollar to see this one ... my goodness .. what should we do ??? I would not even play it in the background of my house let while I cleaned!
