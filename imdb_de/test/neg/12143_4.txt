I have to give Billy Dee credit for trying to achieve that. Knowing that this was a blaxploitation movie, I started my DVD with some expectation. I knew it would be a low budget ... the drama subpar ... but I hoped some gems would be sprayed everywhere. If diamonds or gems were scattered in this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or perhaps overreacted. As an actor and filmmaker, I often writhed when potential poignant moments were destroyed by cruel performances. But I have to admit, I could not look away. I do not know if this was like a car wreck that you can not foresee, or a mysterious force in the movie that held me there. This movie is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong. If Walter Kronkite told the "aristocrats' joke," that would be a total flop, even though the joke itself is hilarious. Let Dave Chappelle say, and we all roll laughing on the floor. This movie needed a "Chapelle". Now, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar I made, then do it. It is worth the money. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this movie and make it new. Who knows ... maybe it's not better, but it can not be worse.
