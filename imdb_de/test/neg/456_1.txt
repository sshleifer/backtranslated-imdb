The One is a very accurate name show, mostly because it's almost the only network in prime time that hardly looks over one person. When I first heard of The One, I thought, "Weee !! Another Sing Song Show! We do not have enough!" and then I went on to put on my helmet and run around in my house and hit my head on blunt objects and sharp corners. Honestly, the constant pain and suffering that causes only one or two "talent" -based reality shows throughout the year is not enough. We needed one more. And not someone - "DER". Those with slightly less attractive candidates with a little less talent. The one with a little less point, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which this is possible. Those with senseless footage of the participants, if these do not occur. Because it matters to me what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his free time! I really do that! Now you might be thinking, "Hey, there were less than 4 million people watching the first episode on the entire North American continent, does not that mean the show is shitty?" Well, to that I say that less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news, right? Think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, The One may be terribly unoriginal, a show that even the network could not disturb, because they, too, realize how completely worthless it is, but it's still not syphilis! Yay!
