My only reason for registering on this site was the ability to comment on this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of my anger by writing it down. <br /> <br /> Babas bilar is about the worst movie I've ever seen. I really think the script may have been a pretty good movie, or at least OK, but something happened somewhere in the line. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the cast on the paper seems to be in order. Both the script and the cast can not be executed. There is too much action, it happens to many things and you can not wonder why it happens. And then the actors make the actors so bad that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time, I would say that you can see it. If not - not.
