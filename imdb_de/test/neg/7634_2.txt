Man, that's bad. Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls in love with a wine shop, a lover of the Latin lover Antonio Banderas, a ponytail and a jailer. When it dissolves, it really cuts you off. Apart from this fierce affair that she has (and we have to admit that the affair has her speed thresholds), she is a pretty cold fish. Her broke, sickly father appears for the first time in years and she strips him. She is also adept at keeping her upstairs neighbor (Dennis Miller) in check. And there is the prisoner Harry Dean Stanton, who tries to get her to diagnose a multiple personality disorder so that he does not nail his private persons to the wall because of the serial killings he has committed. <br /> <br /> All these people and maybe more, they are immediately suspicious when strange things happen to her. Someone sends their dead flowers. Someone is doing unspeakable things with his pet cat. (The next time I see a pet animal appearing in a package or lined up in a cupboard or cooked in a pot, I'll puke.) Who's doing that? Suspect. No power on earth could force me to reveal the end, but perhaps a hint helps: child abuse. <br /> <br /> The abuse excuse is in itself an interesting business, much more interesting than the movie. What does "child abuse" mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physically? Both? How about slapping a child over the back with a wooden spoon, hard enough to break it? That happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just like the other boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? As far as I know, none of this happened to any of us, although I'm not sure if it would have been declined with some animation. In the Samoan village that I studied for two years, there was one case in which a teenage boy played sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. When he returned, the incident had been forgotten by everyone, including the child. (By the way, the little girl we see here is under five years old, so it's unlikely that she would remember any of Dad's nocturnal visits, as long-term memory is not really established by that time.) DeMornay's Experience her mental disorder can be described as "the social construction of a trauma". It is not there if we did not put it there. Enough of the psychiatric lecture. That's fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> You want a trauma? I give you a trauma. The film absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character from the beginning. Then, when she has her first tryst with Antonio Banderas and Pio Donnagio's result beats the erotic in our heads, the camera gives us a shot over the shoulder of the naked torso that Antonio crawls over us with his hairy chest. Well, that's traumatic. Every male onlooker feels like he's on the floor of the laundry room of the Californian men's colony in San Luis Obispo. Do not get me wrong. I do not like Antonio Banderas. I'm just not in love with him. There are not enough nude photos of Rebecca DeMornay's elfin body throughout the universe to compensate for this type of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Here is a fascinating way to survive this movie. Instead of just sitting there, pick out the scenes filmed in Toronto and separate them from the scenes filmed in Budapest. It really is a challenge and, as far as we know, can save your mind.
