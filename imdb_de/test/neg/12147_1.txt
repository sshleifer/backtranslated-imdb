He must surely be one of the worst gay-oriented films of all time. Who told one of the so-called actors that he can act? Bad sound - bad scripting gestures that go overboard to resist reality. A nightclub scene with only one actor and synchronized audience scenes. After seeing other low-budget movies made in a similar way, I was preparing for something innovative - but not just pathetic. Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such a trip. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - No menu access; It's worse than a VHS cassette. Once you've started, you'll need to look through it - luckily, the fast-forward button works with this movie and this DVD works fine.
