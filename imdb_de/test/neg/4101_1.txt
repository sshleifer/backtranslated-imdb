What could have been a good story was destroyed by the ridiculous time travel scenario. If something has changed in the past that has changed evolution and man has never evolved, the time machine would never have been built. If something from the past were brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past. I really wish movie producers would pass their ideas on to a real scientist before the end of the script. Even if you expose reality and assume that time travel is possible, you must follow the logic. <br/> <br/> OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to have a great time with his outstanding performance. All the other actors seemed to do the best they could. It was the script that twisted her in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the Future" handled it better.
