WEBS is a pretty weird movie, though something worth seeing. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who sucks into a parallel earth that is overrun by mutated spiders, or something like that. The film itself was filmed on a modest budget that explains the limited venues, and the somewhat boring script that does very little with a rather interesting premise. Basically a 90-minute episode of the TV series "Sliders" and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> (for a more detailed description, visit www.nixflix.com) and reviews on other films in the genre)
