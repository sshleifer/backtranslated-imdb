I saw this movie when it first appeared in the cinema. We all looked forward to reviving Mark Hamill's career, but we wanted to wish we had not bothered. After about half an hour, a lot of people went out - I wish I had. The basic idea seems to be all right, but the plot was ridiculously involved and devoured and halfway through. It's absolutely unforgettable and not a movie for which you want to get paid. If you are really bored and on TV, it will help you kill a few hours (or nod to you!). 2.10
