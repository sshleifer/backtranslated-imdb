After watching this movie, I felt sick in my stomach and if I had seen it for another minute, I would have had to run to the bathroom and vomit until dawn. A sick movie that was NOT funny and was NOT worth the money, no money at all. If anyone ever wants to see this movie, do not! Your children will never forgive you and make you sick for a week. So, if you appreciate the education of your child and want to stimulate your child's mind, please do not watch this movie. I ask you, not!
