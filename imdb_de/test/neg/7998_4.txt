This is a very famous Ninja movie, but it is not a nice movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some characters, you want to know a few things about ninjas. Watch this movie. This movie is only for Ninja fans and who wants to do nostalgia. The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film are best. You can only see ninja characters and fight in these scenes. In between, they are below average, almost as bad as a movie. Acting is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic but he can not fight well. Scenario is not good either. It is so easy. Franko Nero comes close to his best, old friend of army and war. He also protects him from mafia, but he has sex (go to bed) with his wife and his friend knows that, but says nothing to Nero negatively. Is that possible in life? What friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie started with a genre. Ninja movies. There is also the ninja master Sho Kasugi, but some fight scenes are not realistic and even with hurling fast. This film is below average, even if it is a classic.
