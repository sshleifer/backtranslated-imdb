Hypothetical situations abound, and former director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic view of the world, dead on the streets, in shops and across the countryside, without lying between a forgotten desert. A single survivor trying to rekindle his mind brings food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. Alone, he hopes for more, but since no one is around, he still has white underwear and the passion for a native Indian tribe? until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, a man of the book, has remained on Earth after an unknown catastrophe. He believes he is alone and begins to live his life in his own way. Until, Jeri Ryan appears (as she would in any dream) out of the woods, unkempt and unhappy, to find the last man alive, who is like Alan. However, they try to coexist, fail, get drunk, and before they can do the ultimate dystopia, they meet Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn apart, confusion sets in, a couple becomes the third wheel and the battle between a physically awkward nerd and a mindless jock. Even though there is no one left on the planet, it becomes true that even the darkest of human nature will arise. </ P> </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <m> </ b> </ b> Quiet Earth "(which I'll see next) weird, to which he never earned a loan, with a borrowed story I think he does It seems decent to reinterpret it, but at first Ralston tries to find his own way by once again leaning on the techniques of other film directors to try and find his own, and interestingly, he opens the film, It does not answer any direct answers, of course, the last few days have come, but if there was a terse answer, "how," or better, "why," those few chosen ones would have survived.A more scary start would have led us more into a comic movie. The juxtaposition would have been like "Shawn of the Dead", but instead, we felt like we were watching a "Made for TV" program while listening to the audio commentary I respect Ralston because he has been diligently working on creating this movie and his passion almost sold the movie, but you can tell from his interaction with the cast that he was not so happy with his overall finale product. There were mistakes he pointed out and others he was ashamed of. While this makes for decent independent filming, sometimes it feels cheap, and in Ralston's case it was the latter. I have to admit that David Arnott's addiction to Alan made me addicted. He played this wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. He was funny to watch and listen to, and so he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player to keep the movie together, unfortunately I can not say the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first movie and it was obvious? I mean ?? really very obvious. There were scenes where I thought the queue card would come out and read the lines for him, maybe even give a more realistic idea, but unfortunately that was not the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She captured her character at the end of the film, which for me was the culmination of the entire work of art. In the end, she turns from a strange unknown to a bitter, crazy, crazy girlfriend. Confused? In the end, she fell back into her character and gave us an insight into what she probably could have done when her acting matured. Even as the comment progressed, all she got was a laugh, a giggle or "ohhh, look at that color". While their beauty can sell tickets, you might want to know that knowledge is just as beautiful. This was her first movie, so can I be too hard? <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie felt like something was missing. I thought the idea was strong? the premise that the evil of human nature still exists even if only a few people remain on Earth? Jealousy can not be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc), and we as a race will always want what we can not have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and used in advance, but he knows how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"funny" is different, which is why I could not laugh at many of the parts he found "hysterical". His actors provided the acting power required for this film, which was below average. His film was loose, which means that there were elements that were never fully explained or tackled (ie, something with wings survived?!?), Which affected the overall intensity of the movie. This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much funnier. For those who think that Roger Avery was a huge element in this movie, as we learn from their comments, was he just for money? That was essentially the bank for "The Last Man". Do not hope for classic Avery moments. <br /> <br /> Do not you expect Ralston? and so I will finish it. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of *****
