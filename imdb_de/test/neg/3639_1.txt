Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding for rich teens and a perfect ending. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who became famous for her younger sister to international pop star Britney Spears. With her beautiful blond wig in the first season and trying to hide her monotonous country accent, it was confirmed that Nickelodeon actually went with nepotism to the dogs. When Kristin Herrera, the actress Dana Cruz portrayed in the first season, left the show, all hope was defeated, as she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete shame, but the male casting has potential for a teenage medium. If you continue to follow Jamie Lynn Spears as a picture of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. With hope, they will soon realize that nothing can make a career. Jamie Lynn Spears is not for acting, singing and whatever she wants for the downward spiral she calls career. There is no question why she is a self proclaimed actress. Critics would certainly call her something else.
