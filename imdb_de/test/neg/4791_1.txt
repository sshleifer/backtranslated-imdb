Have you seen all the great adventures of the last decades? If you did not bother, since you've already seen most of the scenes - and I can guarantee that these scenes were originally in much better movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I'm sure real storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid. Every character is based on a cliché and ... well, they are nothing but the cliché. And yes, again, all you need to be a hero is to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland it became known that this is the movie the DVD was made for. Maybe then I should sell my player ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
