I've seen about half a dozen of the low-budget B Western Westerns that Ken Maynard did in the 1930s, and I'm always amazed at how poor an actor was. How did he ever become a leading cowboy actor? They say he could ride pretty well in the Silents, but in these later movies he does not do anything very impressive. Maybe he got the leads because he was tall and could drive. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some other Ken Maynard movies I've seen, but it's still not much. Some of the other characters refer to him a few times as a "young guy" who seems to me to be just as old as the other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if that's not stupid enough, there's a pretty significant scripting problem in this movie. At one point, one of the characters makes a comment about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well, which had not happened yet. Only a few minutes later we will see this particular scene. No, it was not a flashback. At first I thought maybe when Treeline Films did the DVD transfer, they might have reversed two of the roles. At that time, film rolls contained about 11 minutes of film, and the entire reversal lasted only about 3 or 4 minutes. Everything else was in a logical order. So it looks like this is a real continuity problem in the original movie. Maybe that's one reason why Colony Pictures did not last very long.
