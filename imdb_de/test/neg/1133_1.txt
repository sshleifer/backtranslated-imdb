I was not in town and visited an old friend. After dinner, he expressed some reservations to the friend of his daughter. She is 15, pretty, smart, sporty, and the young man is also of an excellent family, nice and also sporty (if not so smart). I told him that he might feel the normal paternal worries; A few minutes later, however, the young man appeared with his DVD of this film, which he had apparently shared with the others for some time. <br /> <br /> These people have a real home theater system with a screen that's just over four feet, and the two young people got ready to see it, while young Swain almost praised his virtues for picture. <br /> <br /> I saw enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in its awfulness) to support all the most critical comments I've seen here while scanning. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I would not disqualify the young worshiper enough to like this opus - but it seems certain that his attitude will be closely monitored. <br /> <br /> Some flicks are so bad, they are good: the classic "Plan 9 from Outer Space"; and in my opinion, the wonderfully dreadful Bruce Jenner / Village people are working "Can not Stop the Music." <br /> <br /> However, this simply remains in the awful category. Second / Third / Fourth "Bananas" - even the best ones (eg Tim Conway, Don Knott, all with Seinfeld) are having great difficulty carrying a later lead role (or here like a movie). And these were great minor characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The "Eddie" character, really on the 5th or 6th banana level of the previous Griswald movies, and never added much to them, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has done well. His contribution to the previous vacation pictures was at best average. Both he and the other members of the cast, many of whom have done some good work in the past, have done nothing for their efforts here except to derive some house-hold payments or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This whole presentation --- story, performances (from lead to support) could not be worse.
