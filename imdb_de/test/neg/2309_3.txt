To introduce my comments on the film, I know that the subject is appalling, and words can not express the compassion that a decent person would have for people dealing with the horrors of an atomic bomb in their vicinity. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really working horribly, except in the first 10 minutes. Some of the pictures there are horrible and should be a reminder of what destruction nuclear weapons can cause. Seeing burned people walking around aimlessly, or how a man combs his hair and strands of hair, is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first dozen minutes, this Japanese film is about people dealing with Hiroshima's after-effects in the mid to late 40s. I found that the story quickly developed into a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the story occurs five years after the bomb, mostly about family issues at the time. Therefore, it became more of a melodrama than a shocking story of a nuclear disaster. It's just a story about how these people got on with their lives from around 1950, whether one of the women was permanently harmed and if so, should she marry? <br /> <br /> This could have been a real impact movie, but it did not go in that direction
