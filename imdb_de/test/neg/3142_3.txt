I borrowed this movie from a local library without knowing about the book or the movie itself, based on the likelihood that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that you occasionally spot and really enjoy <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies. I'm not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or a poorer conscious agenda, but certain elements of the film made it impossible to immerse. It is intended to be a struggling migrant workers' community trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. This is a nice premise that could have led to a gripping story, but the execution simply made me annoy me and laugh at the ridiculousness of it. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple farm workers who have emigrated to the US in search of employment and are constantly getting used to and abusing evil white men. And if I say evil - I mean the evil. All whites in this film are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual corruption linked to the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it were not unintentionally grotesque and therefore funny. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of immigrants is also a striking example of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are sacred, clean and could serve as an ointment for Bu-Boos and all over the world. I could not help but laugh as I saw these "field workers" probably digging in the trenches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and cut haircuts from a top-notch hair salon. A little restraint and an impartial hand at the wheel could have made this movie a much better movie, producing more intentional emotions than sarcastic Snickers.
