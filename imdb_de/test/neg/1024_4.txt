An effort that succeeds in adapting the classic Odyssey story to a piece of nostalgia from the 1930s. The adventurers have escaped captured convicts this time and are in trouble in the depression-stricken southern states. <br /> <br /> The movie's greatest asset is the wonderful music soundtrack, which not only evokes the era of the scene, but also the spiritual references that appear unrestrained in the film. Aside from its value for the sound of the movie, the music is just fun. <br /> <br /> What triggers the movie is that the characters are really not that sympathetic. In a comedy, you need this element to enjoy their mishaps. Instead, we have a bunch of egotistical, arrogant, soulless, mean nobodies who really do not have positive points. They are not impressive enough to hate you either, so it's difficult to even understand them. They are offered as clowns, but like people who dress up with clowns and march in parades, they are just not funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspired them, the film takes these guys on an "odyssey," encountering a variety of symbolic (sometimes even mystical) characters. Everyone is marked with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid". People are mocked on the right and on the left, so no one remains particularly interesting or appealing. The movie does not like its own characters and does not like you either. <br /> <br /> Riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fist fights, radio talkers, people whipped with sticks; All are thrown at you incoherently. Some evoke some laughter, others confuse or bore you. I laughed when a Nerdy beat the snot out of a particularly disgusting main character. But there were much more senseless scenes; For example, a Dillinger guy from the 1930s beats cows with a Tommy gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; only mindless violence that distracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material on which this story is based. <br /> <br /> Other adjustments to the Odyssey are much better. If you are not a fan of George Clooney, rent something else. But buy the soundtrack CD. The music is great.
