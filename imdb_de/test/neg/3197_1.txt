I watch this horrible movie while we speak. It may be one of the worst films ever aired in my house. I'm sitting here with 3 friends and they agree. it is not scary. It is not funny. It is not dramatic. it contains nothing appealing. We are 49 minutes in the movie. We only saw 2 animals. Only one person died. This movie is a big disappointment. Nothing about this horrible, horrible movie made me see the rest. I get a movie over. I hope everyone who has had something to do with this movie dies. I'm not just talking about the actors. I mean the director, the producers, the presidents of the studio that financed this movie. It's the worst movie ever. it should make the IMDb 100 worst movies ever. at number 1.
