Not good at all, the whole movie was just Grudge, who happened to kill people out of nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with the story are killed, such as the 3 schoolgirls. The family at the beginning also has nothing to do with the story, I think they happen to be family that never went in and never had anything to do with the murders of the grudge. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all, I was not afraid, I did not jump anywhere, and the whole movie was just a coincidental crap to get more money from. Makes Gridge 1 look like crap, which was okay. <br /> <br /> I think The Grudge 2 is like a leading movie to The Grudge 3 if they ever make you one. You should not even have called that Grudge 2, you should call the prologue of Grudge 2, and you'll see if you've seen it because I'm not going to spoil anything. Not that it would have been important anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, no scary, bad story, and just completely random.
