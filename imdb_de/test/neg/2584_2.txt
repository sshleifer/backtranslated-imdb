This is clearly a French movie. It is a young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist persons. It moves very slowly. Long takes close-ups. One minute or more for trying to light a hash / opium whistle. A long view of a group overturning and burning a car. It is a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so they were unreadable about one third of the time. (Why are they doing this?) I left after about an hour and three quarters, when it became clear that this image was nowhere going, slowly. I was not the first to go out. It was the first time that I left a picture in my long life. (Well, maybe the second one.)
