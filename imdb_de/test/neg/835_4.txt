EACH Weapon CAN PLAY (2 of 5 stars) Completely routine "spaghetti western" with the guy who played "Kookie" on "77 Sunset Strip". The plot is a complicated nonsense about stolen gold coins and various armed gunmen trying to track them down. This is one of those "carefree" westerns, which means a lot of tedious "comedy" attempts, and some really cruel music during most action sequences (you can say that this is not Ennio Morricone's work). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter named "Stranger" ... but he leaves no impression ... he simply does not have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who can do much with a sparse character. The ending is a complete homage / parody of the end of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" ... though it's hardly amusing enough to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the film are the first 5 minutes in which actors after Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (Should Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very clear ...), which are confronted by Stranger. It's an amusing joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and western spaghetti fans ... but I imagine no one would realize the point.
