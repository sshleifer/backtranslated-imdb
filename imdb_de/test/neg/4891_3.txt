It looks like a cheap porn without sex and is the first of an impressive line of stinkers from producer (or in this case director) Geoffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And it's an idiot. Laughable on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Some government agents (I believe) are "professionally murdered" in Amsterdam and are a far less charismatic Interpol agent who proves to be irresistible, I assure you is not called Louis Salinger) to investigate by running around a lot to make sure that the tax hiring financiers get their money's worth so that the plane tickets can shoot on the spot. <br /> <br /> The wannabe hardists The attitude to drugs and the depiction of prostitution must have looked ridiculously outdated even before the cellulite dried, but the script is at least very compelling in that it explains exactly what is regularly in place "No one outside of Washington even knows you're here!") Nevertheless, the conspiracy somehow remains confusing at the time that a sinister Vladimir Putin looks like a priest (no less than Kronsteen from Russia with Love), he plunges to his pulpit to deliver a sermon that has shut off your brain ground during a fight - trouble grabbing a plank of wood to later realize that he is actually sitting on a loaded pistol, shouting "You bastaaaard!" on the murdered corpse of his friend and on the leathery, mustachioed go-go guys, the morris ta and the hilarious torture sequence - all laugh Only the climatic boat tracking impressed. It's an exciting, directed sequence that really has no place in this movie. Such a gross anomaly is explained as the credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with this sequence! Fortunately, everything is back to normal for the ridiculous, spitting out drink and warehouse shooting. <br /> <br /> Unless there is such a miserable thing as a Geoffrey Reeve complainant - and you are one of them - I would not bother with this instantly forgotten nonsense.
