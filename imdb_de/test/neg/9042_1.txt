Uuuuaaa! Suck! Yuk! Yuk! Disgusting! Puke City! The worst piece of garbage ever made. Sick. Strange. Dreadful. Enough said. Hold your nose. Do not eat After seeing this sick, crazy garbage basket of a movie, you can not eat your food for a week. But maybe that's good. A new diet was invented. Look at this vomit. Get sick in the stomach And you will be put through the mess so that you can not eat for at least a week and lose about 15 pounds. With a name like this, it's really amazing that she does not have a "cult" fan. She is considered the worst actress of all time. Her films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. This movie is rated at minus 10.
