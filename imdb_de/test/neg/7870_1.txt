This movie is shit. Acting is worse than in the movies we did when we were 10 years old with a camcorder, the effects look like a computer game from the 80s and the plot is worse than horrible. Even the worst Van Damme movies make this look crappy. The accent and the rhythm of the "bad guys" is so bad that it's funny. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend watching this, unless you are a big fan of the actor. 1 out of 10.
