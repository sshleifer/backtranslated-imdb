This movie just stunk. I know some people say that anyone who thinks it's not good "just does not understand it". I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But that's utter shit. The main character is so annoying that I do not care what he does. He's like a little annoying monkey hopping around, as another reviewer said. I just could not stand it or force myself to be interested. This is the case with most characters who are just trying too hard to be Goofey or weird. I liked the Mel Gibson character and the Milla Jovovich character and wished they had focused more on them. Of course, Milla is beautiful, pathetic and you really feel for her and what she's been through and why she's the way she is. I almost see Gibson's character as Frankenstien. I just wish he had saved Milla and depressed the hotel with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. Milla Rating 10 Film rating 0
