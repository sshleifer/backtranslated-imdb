I really tried to like "saw". The story was good and I admire the fast pace of the movie. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that, although they might have looked "cool," really did not make sense. <br /> <br /> First, what I liked about the movie was the general tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of the Jigsaw Killer was fascinating and reminded me of the vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was well in an ungrateful role as a kidnapped wife of a doctor. Shawnee Smith's scene was incredible, and both Wan and Whannell should be recommended to use this scene as a demo to support the film. The whole idea that the Jigsaw killer will find a way for his victims to kill themselves is an excellent idea, but once the movie got underway, the logic began to disappear. <br /> <br /> As soon as they showed that Zap played the right role. Gordon's wife and daughter were taken hostage and it was obvious he was not the jigsaw killer and part of it. The scene in which he covers the heart of the frightened Diana with a stethoscope while Allison yells at him through her gag was one of the most unpleasant scenes I've ever seen. It should cool down, but do not make anything. With the Jigsaw Killer finding a way for the victims to kill themselves, he has no problem slicing a police officer's throat. I suppose it's a way to show that he does not want to get caught and do whatever it takes to make sure that does not happen, but there's no logic for me, especially if he shows no remorse for the death of one other detective (which I liked a lot would have been better if given to someone who actually deserved it). I felt Leigh Whannell as Adam. It was not a really eye-catching role and he has great potential as a character actor. However, I was not so excited about James Wan's direction. The story may have been original, but certainly not the direction. I guess I'm tired of using the old MTV style fast, but many scenes with the Jigsaw killer reminded me too much of "Se7en", far too much. As the movie progressed, he became a series of demo roles like "Hey, look what I can do". Instead of being fascinating, it became very distracting. But it worked. He is now director of Final Destination 3, so he's on his way to a successful career, and I think he will become a top-rated horror director in the years to come. <br /> <br /> What that really was for me was the end. Like I said, I knew Jigsaw was not Zap, and I liked how Adam spotted the mini-cassette player after he killed him. It would have had a terrific end, except for one deadly mistake: I had the feeling they should have left it where you did not know who the killer was. The way it was done was done for one reason only: Boy, are we smart? Oh no. For me it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Some of the better horror movies are made for a reason, where there is a reason for the violence that we see in the story. While "Saw" got off to a flying start, the filmmakers' insatiable need to be "cool" and disrupt their winning story was dashed. If they had not insisted too much on making the films themselves, and relying on an experienced horror director, it would have been the horror classic he'd given undeservedly for the past four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of horror, I'm very scared.
