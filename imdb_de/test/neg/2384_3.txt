Talk about marketing. The poster / home video cover of "The New Twenty" sends a half-naked man in a "Wolfe video". For those who are familiar with the gay theme films? This sends a "must". (I loved reading a reviewer (from another site) who said they were "tricked" to see a "sodomite" movie. Are you serious? The slogan itself is the word "gay." Apart from that, although the number of homosexual characters is stereotypical (see: the lonely homosexual, the AIDS victim gay and the closed homosexual), it is more of a long-term friendship and characters growing apart. If anything, there is more (here is one that Christians can complain about) that heterosexual couples have sex outside of marriage. Not to mention backstabbing, excessive alcohol consumption and drug use. I think that's more of a TV logo or Showtime movie than a big screen. Sure, I loved cinematography, some actors could play and I always love seeing a large group of friends who actually behave as if they've known each other for a million years. But we've seen it all before. Nothing really "new" here. Hardly an original idea? So we bring back the same thing "I have AIDS, let's handle it". For a good part of the movie and our boy, our friend has a serious drug problem. This is so (US) "Queer as Folk" and "Broken Hearts Club", respectful. The film looks at a group of college buddies who have grown (in size and not in the head), who eventually have to grow up and everyone tries to do their best while failing. Oddly enough, as in most of these independent films, for me, at least the tougher, Ben, was the most interesting. He stole every scene, but there was not much to do.
