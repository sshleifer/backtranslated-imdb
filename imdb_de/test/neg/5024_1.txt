May contain spoilers or not. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. It is actually very overrated. Why? There is absolutely no story, no action, and the show keeps on going ... and on ... and on ... That's because there are more side stories and fillings than episodes that drive the storyline. And the fillers are exactly the same stories that repeat over and over again. The same episodes seem to go the same way: Kagome feels a jewel splinter, a worm / slime / tentacle demon thing appears, Inuyasha says "Windscrew", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer" etc and kills the demon. You get the Jewel Sliver, and then we repeat that scene 160 or more times. <br /> <br /> In addition to the repetition of episodes, there is also the repetition of comedic devices, and they are not funny anymore. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is NOT funny. Viz rated the series Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated that. There's nothing wrong with that, except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is somehow suggestive, and which could arrest you today. Now we know that Inuyasha is overrated. The video games. They all sucked. Especially the masquerade. I played that with my friend. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring and had Nintendo 64 graphics. In a magazine, it received a rating of 4/10 and said, "... this RPG is slower than a milkshake leading up a cocktail straw." Then there are all those stupid Inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers and coloring books. MALBUCHEN! We thought Inuyasha would be 16+! Maybe not ... But after being a member of MSN's Inuyasha Groups, about half of the people were 10 to 13 years old. I think Inuyasha is after all a little kid of anime. (I think only a small cut was made on this show could be shown on toonami.) There are over 40 manga volumes. All I can do is help, but I wonder how many miles of forest were cut down to form them. Sorry ... <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs in each episode. After 10 episodes the music really gets annoying. In other anime, they have music that suits the mood, and we do not hear a lot of songs often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Do not waste your money with this garbage! <br /> <br /> And where do you think I know all this? Because I was a fan of Inuyasha. I am ashamed of myself. I would rather see Kim Possible or Pokemon. Unfortunately, these two shows have more romance between the two leading actors than Inuyasha ever ...
