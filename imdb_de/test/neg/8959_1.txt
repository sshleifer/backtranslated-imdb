I got this movie for purchase and got a deal with The Ruining at troma.com (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted to do it was seeing Star Worms II: Attacking the Pleasure Pods. The DVD is a double film with this movie. I really did not know what Actium Maximus was at that time, and when I saw the trailer, I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you say about the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. To be honest, this movie did not make sense to me. The special effects were so terrible that you can not say what's going on in God's name. I understand that Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but come on. And it's sad, because in the interview he sounded like an epic movie and meant more than you could see. But unfortunately, watching the movie is one of the most boring hours and fifteen minutes in one's life. It's so painful to sit through it. I really can not even explain the plot to you, because I did not understand it at all and unfortunately saw this movie twice! Apparently they used a kind of doll for the "alien dinosaurs" as in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can not stress it enough. And most of the time, bad special effects are okay, but this movie needed them urgently. It takes place on a futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs fight each other and bad actors in hoodies run around, and they look like they're in the kkk. And a box with blue light is the president. I know that in the interview Mark Hicks said something about this being a TV pilot. Well, I can see why this did not succeed to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. The music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that stays in your head for days. And 2. The introduction of Lloyd Kaufman is as hilarious as ever. Do not waste your time, but watch Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!
