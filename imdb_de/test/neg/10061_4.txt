This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, jumbled mystery that captures the grace (and budget!) Of its predecessors ("Death on the Nile", "Evil Under the Sun"). and Donald is missing Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov when it comes to screen detectives (of course he plays a much less interesting character than Poirot). The movie manages to go as far as Christie's action allows (all her actions have a certain self-interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
