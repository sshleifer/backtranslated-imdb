"Ashes of Time" was a daring project, but it became a presumptuous movie. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The act of "Ashes of Time" is quite simple and comes from two words: "love triangle". Because of these "love triangles" that cross stories, jealousy, hate, and love are the main dynamics of the characters. The narrative part is seen through Ou-yang Feng's eyes (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as a middleman of various swordsmen and becomes a tool of fate, through which revenge is achieved. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" fails these simple stories about love and hate. Wong Kar-wai was driven by the desire to turn every film frame into a painting and an aesthetic experience. Apart from the casting of beautiful actors (men and women), everything else is a failure in this film. Dialogues are minimalists and not at all original. The image quality is very uneven, the editing is one of the worst seen (at least by me) in the "sword fighting" genre, and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unattractive. Even the attempt to build artistic scenes is not always achieved: The so-called erotic scene "Women on a horse" is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to give 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that in a movie, it's about how an act is told. He forgets that he delivers an awkward film that does not even fulfill its artistic purpose.
