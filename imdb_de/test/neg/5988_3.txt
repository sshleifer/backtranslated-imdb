SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality), but I did not expect it to be as painful as SHRIEKER should have realized. <br /> <br /> It's just awful. Bad spectacle, confusing scenario and direction. Annoying characters that I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably done in a week. I have seen CHARMED episodes that were more complex and convincing than this cheap one. <br /> <br /> It has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a poorly designed television series that no one has ever seen. It was a chore and I could feel my spirit weakening by the minute. Watching a movie should not be that hard.
