So that's where the head of the short course department of Colombia got his start, what? Yes, it is none other than Mr. Jules White, who is recognized as the director of this entry in MGM's DOGVILLE series (or is it more "exposed"). With co-credit as co-director is a Zion Myers; whose name was previously unknown. Mr. Meyers was undoubtedly the man who controlled the four-legged Thespians and was responsible for training and "acting". In short, he must have been the dog trainer on the set. <br /> <br /> THE TITLE of this short comedy is undoubtedly a game of the MGM features of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; It included Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast. We must appeal to ignorance of this title. not seen until now. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are many dog ​​handlers who refer to what we've read about the movie *; not to mention certain character-specific gags. For example, we observed a dog convict who stuttered St-St and rightfully assumed that the bow-wow actor was imitating character comedian Roscoe Ates. Later we checked with the actors of THE BIG HOUSE and Presto, his name is here! (Brilliant print, one fits Holmes & Watson!) <br /> <br /> THE PRACTICE of Lampooning's popular features was already a proven practice in the field of comedy shorts. It was one that apparently did not object to the producers and copyright owners of the big movies. but quite opposite received much heaped approval. After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Also, every producer would welcome even seemingly disrespectful parodies. ** AS FOR THE MOVIE itself we found it interesting in a kind of perverse way. Seeing so many "Man's Best Friends" so artificially animated into a single, boring, kind of anthropomorphic gag seemed to be a lot of work for us, who make up the audience. I mean, how many dogs were barked unnecessarily to achieve the illusion of "speaking"? <br /> <br /> When it comes to pets or "animal companions", as the politically correct ones prefer, we are very versatile. Favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We are not happy when an animal is exploited in such a non-funny, expanded game format. <br /> <br /> HOW AMAZING, as it may seem - the step taken by Mr. Jules White out of the MGM shorts to lead Columbias 2 The Reeler production does not just seem to be in the financial sector. but also in the artistic content. We never thought that we were producer directors for greats like the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who have certainly seen better days like Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be kinematically a step up. <br /> <br /> IN CASE We have not decided yet; we are officially this panning. So look at this at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We have read excellent reviews of THE BIG HOUSE and the Laurel & Hardy program PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic confirmation. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** The prison picture became a separate genre; all owed to THE BIG HOUSE. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and his director have made a first class parody, the first of many. For a prison comedy, the theme became fun for many a screen.
