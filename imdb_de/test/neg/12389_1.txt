I find it disturbing that at a time when the satisfaction and fulfillment of spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the spectrum of possible beliefs, a charlatan and a fraud with Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan he is extraordinary, there is him It was a pity that he abused it to increase his wounded ego by feeding on the careless sheep who were by his side and in awe of him an idealized version of Gurdjieff's own largely fictional and fantastic account of his genesis and awakening (which I would rather call his discovery of how he can influence the mind and will of certain types of sad, disoriented people.) If you dare, to vent an unpleasant eye-opening about how sad we really are to religious leaders so much so that a clown like Gurdjieff inspires such devotion - and be careful, if you have blood pressure on hand, one of those who still hope that from the ruins of Christianity emerge a healthy religion, as an outstanding example of the cinematography in the entire service of the premises and the assertion of a dysfunctional cult.
