I waited to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to the wretched films he'd made after "Eraser." However, "End of Days" can be added to the gloomy movies in which he had the misfortune. Focus on action and excitement and instead focus on investigating demonic events and the approaching millennium (read "Doomsday"). <br /> <br /> The performances are old-fashioned, special effects so good and lush. I consider myself a diehard Schwarzenegger fan and could not believe I did not like this movie, but what could Arnie have done with such a horrible, lame screenplay apart from this turkey? > 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
