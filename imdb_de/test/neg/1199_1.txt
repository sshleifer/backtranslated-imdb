OK, the idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not own airplanes 2. Children do not drive airplanes with dirtbikes. 3. The Air Force looked like total idiots. 4. The father of the children would not jeopardize his entire career so that his boy could travel with him a reserve colonel. <br /> <br /> The sequels were certainly worse than this threesome. The soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry, but I just do not understand why anyone in the world would write directly and produce such incredible garbage. The Iranian Air Force is lucky enough to filter a few parts for an aging F-14, and this kid does not struggle with 1, but with 2 fully loaded and fuel-powered F-16s? Give me a break.
