San Francisco, oh you wonderfully ravaged city, thank God for destroying them and dropping bricks on our collective heads and forfeiting tens of thousands of your innocent, obedient sheep, oh God who are so merciful, in heavenly ways. .. "This should have been the lyrics for the title song of this oh so inspiring and mindless movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well enough when Gable discovers a Cinderella with a very annoying but highly praised opera voice, and she soon shoots the star One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that she's played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if you "take the time" to see through all the make-up and the '30s glitz, realizes that she's kind of ugly, too ugly to play THIS role anyway, but Gable and everyone else puke around here as if she were some damn beauty or something Cinderella is that her character is so modest, healthy, innocent, loving God, kind and generous - enough to give herself over a full hour. MacDonald plays her (admittedly one-dimensional) role with the kind of "ahhh," "oh," and "ooh," which tends to annoy her rather than make her sympathetic. Tracy was better, and had better roles than playing this clichéd, golden-yellow, god-loving, child-eating priest (who boxed in his "spare time" - as if priests had something to do with - how cute). Even the ever reliable gable does not meet its usual standard. he is far too animated, and his character is too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western "villain" (though this is obviously the script's fault). The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play with Cinderella Ping-Pong - they as a ball. How? Well, she works (sings) first for Gable, then works for Holt Place, then returns to Gable to return to Holt very soon. (And of course, both of them want to have her as a girlfriend / wife.) And if the earthquake had not disrupted this table tennis facility, it would be a safe bet that she would jump ten more times up and down. the furry little princess she is. <br /> <br /> There are many, far too many, actually musical numbers. It's almost as if they were trying to make the first "disaster movie musical". How silly. What she sings in Gables "Joint" is fine, but when she starts tearing out those shrill, annoying ghosts in the opera sections, I feel that my ears have been involuntarily and unjustly attacked by the enemy's sound fire. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES. For those who have not yet had first-hand experience of Vietoperanam with such horrors of audiofolters, it seems to be little to do, but it is like having dogs; The year of a dog corresponds to seven human ones. One minute of opera equals 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog urinating acid on the leg). <br /> <br /> I thought this was a catastrophe movie, but it's more like a movie about to make a catastrophe movie. (I read that some of the dialogues in this film were written by a SILENT ERA film director, Jesus ...) The melodramatic and only occasionally amusing process is interrupted by the real star of the movie (the earthquake). only after about an hour and a half. When Joe, the earthquake, finally shook the city and our clichéd characters were in it, I almost feel like, "Thank God, death and destruction are finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe is late in the movie to save him from increasing mediocrity. The scenes of devastation are very good, but even the film's earthquake is ruined by an extremely annoying, religious end. Do you see, Gable, who always identifies himself as an atheist (without using the word himself), finally finds MacDonald alive - after searching for days - and suddenly he becomes a believer because Cinderella lives? !! How stupid! All I'm saying is that Gable's character is a moron git. <br /> <br /> The film ends in a very stupid note. Gable, who said thank you God "saved" his girl (and he goes to his knees), finds "God" (sees the light) and the movie's little old devil, Gable, turns into one believers. How God-fearing American ends ... <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody thought to ask this "god" why the hell there was an earthquake! The sad and unintentional irony is that in the end Gable becomes a "jerk"; all along he had made fun of "idiots" who fall in love for the most sacred fraud of all - religion - and in the end he becomes one himself. That's what I call a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the end should have improved Gable as a person, but I see it very differently; On the contrary, it took only one big Joe to turn Gable into a God-fearing, gentle, small, obedient believer who joins the world of sheep. And as if this intellectual downfall of Gable was not pathetic and disappointing enough, this very first "earthquake musical" ends with a really hair-raising (noble and hopefully beautiful mass choir) scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud, proud citizens of Frisco sang spontaneously (or "God" might have arranged it?) All the title song in the hope of a better, brighter, Joe-less future. Hallelujah! If you are a "jerk" to "Hollywood sentimentality", do not skip this movie.
