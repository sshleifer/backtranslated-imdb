I liked this step when I was a kid, but now that I'm older, I can see how absurd the plot really is. If you have not read the previous reviews, it's a teenager and a Luftwaffe colonel stealing two fully loaded F-16s to rescue the teenager's father. <br /> <br /> It even has a few nice air strikes when the dialogue then accompanies, is basically teckno babel. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor in the version edited for TV. When the hero's father is being held by Iran, I mean an unnamed country, and his kidnappers ask him for a confession (regarding the question of why he is being held.) Do not worry about why or how to confuse him he says, "Tell him he can take my confession and push it down his throat." But his lips, and above all his gesture, make it clear what movement and part of the anatomy he really thought.
