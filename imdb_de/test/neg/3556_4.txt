The Ealing comedies form their own subgenre in the history of the film. They were shabby, droll reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always amusing, but I find it misleading to call them comedies. They are airy and in a good mood, instead of laughing funny. However, the best of them are traversed by an obscure satire and are occasionally hit with a dark stroke (especially Child Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). Hill Mob is probably the one I'm having the most trouble with. Compared to the others, it seems a bit superficial. For me, it's an outline sketch for a movie, but one that took a lot of time to develop before it was ready in front of the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything is cooked a bit too little. For example, nobody gets a real context or background. Henry is simply a dutiful grudge whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist who has to force his talent by collecting gift shops as a prostitute. This sets a motive for their crime, but nothing that happens afterwards is either a consequence of their characters or their plan. Other characters are introduced but do not really play a role in the story. The elderly resident of Henry's Guest House (with her love for detective stories) may have been an ignorant thorn in his side, but is only used as a background color. Similarly, the various police officers getting in and out of the action are simply there to keep the action going. <br /> <br /> As a result, the movie is completely controlled by its fictitious plotter, which I find both frustrating and slightly irritating. The not very ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems, although Albert was prevented from performing his part of the plan (by Sidney Tafler's Clayton). The gold is then smuggled into France without incident. Everything would have gone smoothly if it had not been for a minor incident based on the French pronunciation of the letter 'R', resulting in six of the golden Eiffel Towers being accidentally sold to some English schoolgirls Row of hectic car chases, while Henry and Albert want to find them again. These scenes are well executed, but at every point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the students by a series of totally fictional accidents. It's as if God were deliberately intervening to make it difficult for them. This kind of disappearance always makes my teeth crunch. <br /> <br /> When they finally track down the last Eiffel Tower to an exhibition at the Police Academy and snatch it from under the nose of John Gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) All traces of the plot logic are abandoned. The last chases then just fill up the screen time until we return to the frame that started the picture. <br /> <br /> The movie does not even bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This ingenious little caper has the professionalism of the Ealing team behind it, so it's anything but a bad movie. I guess most viewers will find it much more enjoyable than me (and why not?), But I can not help but think that there is a much better movie waiting to be shot, if only for more time and more Effort would have been spent on meat wiping Both the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> Following the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity. PS: One strange footnote is that Audrey Hepburn owes a single line early, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much larger contribution. I think she just had a better agent.
