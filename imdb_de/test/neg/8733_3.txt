After his career as a romantic captain ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson played in many different projects, including television programs and smaller films. However, I believe that "embryo" is his only role as a crazy scientist, and that's probably a good thing. I suppose he needed the work. <br /> <br /> Driving a dark and stormy night, the brilliant Dr. beats and injures. Paul Holliston (Hudson) a Doberman, whom he brings back to his lab (that looks a bit like thank you Keller in the Midwest). He then manages to raise the unborn puppy of the dog outside the womb, which is why he naturally decides to do the same with a human. He raises Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) in the same way from a fetus. Victoria is growing at an amazing pace and soon blossoms into a beautiful young woman. <br /> <br /> Foreseeable things are going very wrong. Holliston's sister-in-law Martha (Diane Ladd) wonders about a halcyon start where the young woman comes from, and Victoria herself shows signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is a long chase straight out of "Smokey and the Bandit", after which Victoria, who has been shockingly aged in a few minutes, is attacked by a desperate Holliston who tries in vain to destroy his deformed creation along with his unborn child. All this is accompanied by squealing tires, roaring engines, a fire and many sirens. The flabby end, a bunch of paramedics desperately working on Victoria, while Holliston writhes in regret, is more tedious than scary. <br /> <br /> Although the film was only made in 1976, this movie is very outdated. The only difference with the many crazy science films of the 1940s is that Hudson plays the main role and not Boris Karloff. The sets are quite cheap and very antiquated for today's audience, in that Hudson's tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson saunters through his filthy role, giving the impression that he is a tense movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more credible. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> The Passport video transfer is very inferior and looks like it was made from a bad VHS copy with home appliances. If you're nostalgic in 1976, look at it, just to say you did it. Otherwise, look at a football game or a soap opera instead.
