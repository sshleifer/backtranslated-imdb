"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad rehearsal if you're doing a sequel over the course of a year. The first movie was cute, cuddly and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing in a basketball team is quite far-fetched, but he defiantly brought enough stunts to save the concept. Even human history had an explanation for that. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. And the audience is also emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now to the bad continuation. It is terrible. This is the worst kind of bad continuation that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The kind that changes the main play in a way, this time plays the K-9 football instead of basketball. It's not surprising how much time is spent on matter. Take a doubt, be open with an attitude that you have with a movie like this. There is no positive thinking when it comes to making really bad movies. <br /> The sequel plays Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eighth grade. He lives with his mother and little sister in a suburb of Seattle. The first movie in human history was about losing his father in an airplane accident that the public can identify with. Most people know what it feels like to lose a close relative. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional action is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is back together. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, do not like that at all. Why? If I were in his shoes, I would like to have an extra parent in my life, especially one so beautiful. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him and became a local veterinarian for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The animal story is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend, who is being tested for the school football team Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like America's funniest home videos that can even catch a ball without stumbling or clashing. When Bud shows up one day, he proves that he can play for them as a receiver and is undoubtedly the team's best player. Buddy is extremely cute in his football costume. Oh, it's enough to melt the heart. The dog is also the best in this movie. Too bad that there were not enough stunts done by him to distract attention from the fact that no one ever asks questions about a dog playing a football team. <br /> <br /> There is a very bad background. Plot about Russian circus workers who like to steal amazing animals, of course try to catch Buddy. But their mindless minds are ruled by the animals and do what looks like a "home alone" scenario to them. <br/> <br/> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a lot daft than the first one. The Russian hijackers add a pile of lame slapstick that, I must admit, made me laugh in the face of stupidity. There are far too many sequences that describe a screwball character, and too few scenes that are the real reason why people will watch this movie to watch a dog play football. <br /> <br /> The performances were also pretty embarrassing. I liked the presentations by Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the overall grade for the drama was a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, there were a few funny moments from a few football players, but that's not even worth mentioning. Will children enjoy this movie? Maybe, but even they get tired when the heart feels the discussions too long and deep. You will most likely complain that the dog did not have enough time for the screen, and say goodbye to the rapidly changing screenplay, protested against the boring ideas and claim that this film compared to the origami al "Air Bud" like garbage I have that. <br /> <br /> I think they will think the dog is adorable.
