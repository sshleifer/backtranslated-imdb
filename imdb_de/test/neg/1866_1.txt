The only good thing about this film is that it has managed to connect it to the first part. But otherwise it was one of the worst movies ever! The only time you see the Ghoulies is a flashback (and the flashbacks are just clips from part one)! A may NOT see! In a one to ten gets "Ghoulies 4" a one!
