Three delinquents disrupt the grave of an ancient warlock who, after ordering Jack-O (a less than threatening figure with pumpkin heads) who had chased down Hoodlums, continues his sworn revenge to kill all the deceased family members who punished him had. Including the young Sean Kelly and his horror-loving family. Of course it's up to Sean to find a way to save the day. <br /> <br /> Such a stupid low-budget B movie. The spectacle is cruel and the plot is not much better. Throw an extremely lame killer, a potential pedophile who laughs way too much and some stereotypical cardboard cutters from a conservative couple, and you've got this movie in a nutshell. It's not really worth it, except to see how well Linnea ages. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always good for some T & A and she does not disappoint with a long shower scene. Rachel Carter also gets topless (although it could be a body double) <br /> <br /> My Rating: D-
