Most of the movie was okay, for a sequel to a sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the amount of excitement that was there; I had expected it to be spewed out of the window in favor of blood, blood and blood. It was not like that, but there are pretty ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> What I did not like, however, were all the complications of the complications. That could have been fine if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain them all. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the psychiatric institution? Why were they protected from Michael's damage to a certain point? What exactly did you want to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant? Why was she imprisoned for 20 years so she could get pregnant? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why did fetuses exist in the lab? The actors seemed to have "understood everything" when they saw the fetuses. But it was never explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> If you only see this movie, people will be snooped, then that's okay for you .. But if you can not stand a plan that's being thrown at you and until that time the credits are rolling, not solved, then you should see something else.
