What a lengthy painful experience. <br /> <br /> That's more than two hours of my life, I'll never come back. <br /> <br /> The joy of this film festival director is overwhelmed by the excessive use of slowness shot .... however - that's not the only thing that makes a script. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
