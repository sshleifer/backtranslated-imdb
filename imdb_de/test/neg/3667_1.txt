<br /> <br /> In Japan and elsewhere in Europe, the new technology allows filmmakers to bypass the Hollywood mainstream's closed-circuit and avoid Ed Wood's visible low output to produce compelling films. What a pity that in the UK we can find examples like "Avatar" (name of many video games) where brain dead are trying to imitate so many movies - and console games that are loved by friendless teenagers - even cheap photocopies are clichés abound like testosterone kangaroos. Take a look at the overview: <br /> <br /> "The futuristic London 2024 tells the story of a team of Virtual Reality Virus Exterminators opposing the ultimate Internet virus." <br /> <br /> Go back and read the quote again - avoid laughing - and try to find a single original idea in it. This should have been a tired, sad concept in 1993, no matter how it was in 2003. Ah, but there is more - the "ultimate virus" has already crashed planes, infected the air traffic control center, and so on. It was developed by a "Children's Genius" and manifests itself as a lightly dressed, athletic, jamming offspring Lara Croft mimic who pulls a grand line in growling and cod fighting sports out of the playground - the living product of youthful imagination. Oh, and she is accompanied by 'Predator' -like sound effects to emphasize her remarkable powers. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a 'futuristic' vision of breathtaking originality - the After Effects filtered Lloyds building looks a bit green. The budget really shows - which should not be in this day and age. All in all, a pointless mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have left on the tailoring floor in his most shameless and desperate moments. Too bad that such an alleged love work provided nine minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
