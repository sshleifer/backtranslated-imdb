I've seen cheesy kung fu fighting films. In Taiwan, they live in the place of sitcoms in America. I've seen movies make fun of themselves, but this movie belongs to the sad category of combat films that try too hard to be taken seriously with terrible actors, terrible props, and horrible music. I really feel sorry for the person who composed the music for this film. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to throw out crap, as I think it should have been called: "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations on a Wicked Guy Who Ways To Toss A Gun." Maid shows when retired a corner "or the daring" flight of the helicopter ". Then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled. They had actually laughed in tears. If the "special effects" were not proof that it was a cheap budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably locals who were good for the much-needed Phillipino economy, was probably just for cost reasons I have always done something since this series. They rented equipment, though they did sequels to this movie. That was pretty funny too. The thing that really got me started was not the music (which led me to expect an animated Sargeant Slaughter from GI Joe), but the end ... I think this would be a spoiler, if it really is a conspiracy I was pampered, but when the American Ninja throws the girl in Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, I wanted him to jump off the roof and let Jackson drop the girl to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think that would have been the perfect punch for this joke of a movie.
