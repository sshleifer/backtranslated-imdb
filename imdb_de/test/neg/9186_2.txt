"Wagon East" was a big disappointment for me. The saddest thing about this film, however, is that it's John Candy's last movie role (he died shortly before filming was completed). There are few laughs in this western parody and for a comedy that does not cut it. If you want to see a disgusting parody of Western movies, the answer is obvious. See Mel Brooks classic "Blazing Saddles". Or if you want to see Candy in much better stuff, read "Summer Rental," "Spaceballs," or "Uncle Buck" (just to name a few). These three movies (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, "Wagon East" does not. What a shame! <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
