This movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "Let's make a movie about one of the biggest and most controversial sports trainers of modern times, and we want to cast Brian Dennehey as coach Bobby Knight!" There, the film went terribly wrong. Why an actor who does not have the appearance of the man he portrays? And why does not this actor make his character Coach Knight, but Brian Dennehey in a red sweater? When I saw this movie on ESPN, I could not believe that man was actually Coach Knight. He did not look like him, did not talk like he did, behaved like him or even walked like him. I could not overcome this fact and so I could not enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as Outlaws Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we did not care if they were exact historical models of their true characters, because most of us had never heard of these men until we saw the movie , But with someone who is so visible in today's media as Coach Knight, you have to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was cast as Nixon, it was the same situation. But Anthony Hopkins made us believe that he was actually Nixon. Dennehey did not even try. What might have been a great movie got sour. Apart from the fact that this film has tried to do for the four letter word what "Saving Private Ryan" did to dismember, it stunk. Too little of the real Coach Knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock made this film a "season halfway through the show should be turned off". The only good thing is that it was a TV movie. I did not have to waste my hard earned money on this garbage.
