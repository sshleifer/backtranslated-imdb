Pun intended. This low budget action / horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is the stuff that Direct-to-Video fare consists of. <br /> <br /> The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under natives' shelling prosecution after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in the public eye. The police chase him, vampires chase him, he answers by kicking a lot. <br /> <br /> There is a little more in the story, but it is so unimportant that I honestly can not remember it; I think people actually talked in the movie, but that's up for debate. The storyline is nothing more than an attitude for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible at run time, mostly by kicking. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are anemic in short. Little color treatment, amateurish use of lighting, simplified use of camera and angle. Blood and blood are markedly limited, odd for this type of movie. The most hurtful of the shooting is the terrible shift to an extremely shaky cam in every fight scene. When the camera begins to bounce at the speed of a reese monkey, you know that Don is about to put everything in sight. All in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be done well with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise you should not watch unless you really want to watch how things are kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
