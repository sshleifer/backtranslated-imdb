One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they have read the other two, or at least know something more about them than miracles and the Day of Judgment. This film contains absolutely nothing relevant to viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy - there is only the British standard of social realism with guttural dialects and clumsy characters in pubs. <br /> A true Third Testament has been published several times - such as "A Course in Miracles" or "Conversations with God." They all have given new food for thought to the Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in the IMDb rating is not the number of stars, but the number of people who have decided to vote. In four years, only 387 people have opted for this film. As always, the enthusiasts are the most zealous. For comparison: "Jesus Christ, superstar" - Original version of 1973.
