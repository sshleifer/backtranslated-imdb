** May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island whose characters are so casual and deadly that he could drown better. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") speaks with his own hallucinations and sees all the invaders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats the mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Unintentional laughter is delivered by a huge "Nubian" slave Mantis, who speaks with a deep southern accent and helps de Sade hunt down intruders in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. De Sade's crazy wife, devastated by leprosy, offers some truly terrifying moments as she wanders through the dungeon and hugs a captive-bound prisoner. (This scene was seen in late-night TV by many children who carried the memory into adulthood.) The one near-normal person in sight is Cassandra, who disparages herself for a science. ("I used to be a nurse, now I'm not much of anything.") She and Fallon plan to escape and eventually meet an enemy more frightening than de Sade and Mantis together. <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed in San Antonio and directed by a man who draws more horror comics than horror movies. (I say this a lot for Mr. Boyette - he shows his contagion infection here, as in his comics.) It's more like an Andy Milligan melodrama without the meat splitters. The style wardrobe, library music, abuse of the disabled and all-round misanthropy raise the question of whether Andy was not consulted as a consultant. Milligan, however, made better costumes and wrote better dialogues. Technical gaffs are too numerous to list here, but you know this strip is in trouble when you see the first shipwreck that looks like it was shot in a fish tank. A movie made in Texas should have been more likely to have spiders and snakes than rubbers. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the glaring look it so richly deserves. Fallon's first encounter with Leprosy Countess is truly dreadful, as is the shooting of the film. If the rest were only half as heavy, THE DUNGEON OF HARROW would have been a classic of terror. Instead, it's a fun beat that garbage friends will love for all the wrong reasons.
