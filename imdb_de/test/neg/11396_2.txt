If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you'll find that this movie is full of poetic licenses. Not that that makes a big difference, because Errol Flynn was quite generous with a poetic license in autobiography anyway. Do not worry about spoilers as there is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> It makes more sense to use the story of a fictional Hollywood actor. Then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play him, and you do not have to worry about the audience saying things like that, "But he did not have any mustaches in Captain Blood." Another flaw of this movie is that Flynn is presented as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well educated and well read. This movie focuses only on its functor image. Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the cast is struggling with their scripts. Hal Linden is alright as a warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a believable Dassa, though Lili Damita herself did not think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do with this movie is to forget it and gently spin it away into oblivion. Well, what I'm writing for, I can not imagine.
