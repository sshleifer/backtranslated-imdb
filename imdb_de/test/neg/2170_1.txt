I wanted to give a 2 in the vote, but when I saw that I meant awful, it hit the nail on the head. The depiction of the Indians as bloodthirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me. This is the third movie I have from D.w. have seen. griffiths, in which races are stereotyped by men in an ugly way. The man can not tell his side of the story, so I'll try not to attack Mr. Griffith personally. I think of millions of people and their children. Movies like these probably made up for many of the resentments that are still with us. Some say the camera work was great, the action a first for the time. The positive aspects are far surpassed The negative, it's like someone takes $ 10 off you and returns a penny to make up for it.
