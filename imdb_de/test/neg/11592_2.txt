If you are looking for a movie that is fun, easy to watch, because you can joke about the not so big theatrical, cheesy "special effects" and the typical sci-fi plot ... this is the movie for you You! Not acting was bad, in fact some actors were pretty decent. The special effects were not the biggest (to say the least); The animals looked completely computer-animated. There was a vicious screech to cover up the cursing and only one song was repeated throughout the movie. All in all a good movie if you are looking for something totally cheesy and fun. Not a good movie to look at, if you are looking for something serious.
