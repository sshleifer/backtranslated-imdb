It is a pity that you do not cast negative votes with IMDb. This is the most frightfully horrible show that our normally sympathetic neighbors in the North have ever accused the American public of. The parents are a caveman and a neurotic witch. It is as charming as a well-used hydrant with the same sanitary standards. She is a wax figure programmed with more neurosis than the entire cast of THE VIEW. The children are not entities if they are female, and if they are male, especially the title character. The boy is a serious contender for the insanely self-satisfied, complacent, arrogant, and futile male character on Disney who says something. This show was obviously conceived as Anti-Brady Bunch, but comes as an anti-Christian. And why is photography so dark?
