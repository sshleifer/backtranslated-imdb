Altman is very proud of the fact that people talk to each other in his films because he does that in life. Well, people cough, burp, go out tangents, etc. The point is only because people are actually doing something that does not force the cinema. That's a problem. <br /> <br /> The bigger problem is that this is not a particularly skilful or direct or pertinent satire in 1988 or 2004. A small core republican MP is a hippie liberal of the 60s. I mean, the guy is still trudging Zonker in his streak - a character that's a total anachronism, but Trudeau still employs him as if he's a representative of a big strip of American youth I'm wrong I'm conservative, but I'm not saying that this is bad because it is liberal. It may require a liberal approach and be funny and relevant, but it is not. It's mostly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent Liberal (including the hideous, repulsive Ron Reagan Jr.). Sometimes it feels blank, and the rest of the time it has a sense of self-esteem and "are not we smart?" - ness. Someone said that this show insists that it has a cult episode. I think his cult status is more desirable than it is. I'm sure there are two or three people out there who have all recorded and still have original episodes in 1988, but if that's the standard, then every show ever broadcast is a cult. If Tanner did not have the names Altman and Trudeau, this would be another forgotten HBO production from the 1980s. Instead, it's presented as a punchy, haunting political commentary by guys who are at the top of their game. The reality, however, is as far away as possible. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner's ever been, and he's been dead for a decade.
