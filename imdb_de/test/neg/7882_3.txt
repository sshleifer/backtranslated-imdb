While it's true that the movie is interesting, the execution left a lot to be desired (much like Blood Orgy by the Leather Girls, I Spit on Your Grave and Born in Flames, Think It All Over). I do not think it's porn, but pornography is in the eye of the beholder: If it acts as porn for someone, who should I say that he / she is wrong? I was rather confused about the statement in Winkimati's general thoughtful review ("Such a Shame"): "One time we actually see men's faces when they come." A couple of years ago, I occasionally did freelance reviews for an adult magazine, and I remember seeing many male faces when they came. I think that's probably more common when the movie shows some of the few male porn stars (and especially if that man is the director). Although I can not surprisingly refer to specific titles, I know that there are some cases in the work of Ron Jeremy. I also do not know that I agree that a man inevitably faces his face when he arrives.
