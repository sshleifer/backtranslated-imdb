I checked out this video and I expect it to be great. Do you want to like it? I like foreign movies, I like nice cinematography, I know the critics liked this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I do not mind "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it's nice. That's about the best I can say for it. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the looks are very significant, the actors are very sincere and it seems to be a very long film. I fell asleep halfway, woke up, rewound the tape and tried again. It was an exam, but I made it to the end. I did not like it better.
