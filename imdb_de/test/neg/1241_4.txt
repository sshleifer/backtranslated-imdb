This show is like watching someone training to one day to host a show. There are some good comedy ideas and a lot of mediocre ones. It does not look like the authors know the difference between what's funny and what's funny or crude. <br /> <br /> It has its moments. When Spike squirted a neighbor who had repeatedly let her dog down on his lawn, he reached his climax. But the funny moments are not enough, and there are too many experimental comedy bits missing the mark. <br /> <br /> The show is better than a test sample or the QVC network, but it needs some better authors. <br /> <br /> Reading the glowing positive IMDb comments on this show, I'm convinced that most of them were written by Spike's show staff and relatives and personal friends. <br /> <br /> is usually not very good.
