Bad, bad movie. When I saw the abstract, I expected something like ring only with video games rather than with tape. Nothing happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the choice of the person of real life, Countess Bathory, is a stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. Anyone who knows their story vaguely would wonder why and how these Hungarian nobles ended up in this film. The choice of a generic vengeful mind would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> Then there is a whole concept that you will find in real life the way you are in the game. As I said, interesting, ring-like story. But instead of turning it into a good story, it simply flows with an explanation of why this game has become as it is, why it was created, and so on. Waste of the good idea. <br /> <br /> And finally, this movie does not even have a lot of fun parts that can, if not at least, help make shitty horror movies visible. Death scenes are too fast and acting is too wooden to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
