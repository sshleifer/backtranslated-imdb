For reasons that I can not understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) injecting Wolfs blood into his gritty artisan Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro turns into a hideous (as disgusting as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth), a killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to revenge himself against those in the scientific community who have mocked and mocked his ideas (and why they should not.) Dr. Mad Monster is a boring and downright Poverty Row thriller, and there is really only one positive point that I can write about in The Mad Monster George Zucco can be fun if he plays the mad scientist as well as anyone else.His Dr. Cameron is a regular idiot.He has no qualms about killing, he has whole conversations with People who are not there, and, like most crazy scientists, confused with "God's Domain" (I'm not sure anyone's accusing him, but it's fitting), except for Zucco, there's nothing to recommend. Everything else, from the monster effects, to the understudy, to the music, is downright poor - there are far better examples of the 1940's Poverty Row horror than The Mad Monster.
