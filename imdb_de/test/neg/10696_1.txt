I agree with the comments of the other users. Hard to believe that this film actually appeared in 1994, because he screams in the mid-80s. I think it gets dubbed because the sound and the image do not always match. If someone can really say that this is a good movie, they must be imprisoned. It's so sad that money has so much power over people that they do everything they can to get it. I have the feeling that by looking at it, I lost the intelligence. I had a little respect for Chuck Norris before I looked at it, but now I just feel bad. I bought it as part of a $ 3.99 movie package and I can honestly say that I would have liked to literally throw away the money. Forgive me Jesus.
