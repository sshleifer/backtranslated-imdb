The plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is incest to save her, Odet turns into a swan, the turtle / frog / puffin first the "bad" magician as best they can, and in the end ... There is not much New here. Except for a lack of known talents. Sorry, neither Palance nor Cleese and so Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
