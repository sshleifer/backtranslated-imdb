If Corky St. Claire had directed the citizens of Blaine in comic undertones in a horror film in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, the result would have been very similar to THE MILPITAS MONSTER. <br /> <br /> To be generous, this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie I have ever seen. To call the pace glacial is nice. <br /> <br /> Almost no one associated with this project has ever made another film, except for Ben Burtt, who did the really admirable (budget-wise) effects. He made sound for movies like MUNICH and some other big budget projects. The narrative is by the experienced spokesman Paul Frees, who probably contributed his efforts. <br /> <br /> If you look at the opening titles and call the Milpitas Unified School District one of the producers you know makes a long, strange journey. <br /> <br /> The pollution at the garbage dump in Milpitas, California is becoming so toxic that a monster is emerging. Remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. Only a few years earlier, cinema visitors had been treated with GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature that is at least fifty feet tall and has the ability to tear the city apart. Instead, it steals garbage cans. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the premise is the idea that this monster can roam a small town and leave footprints eight feet long, but nobody notices. There is a beautifully designed scene that goes through the middle of a carnival at night, but somehow nobody notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster until the last scenes is George, the drunken city. I had been hoping for the whole movie, hoping that I hope George would be torn apart in front of the camera, but that did not happen. Drat. In fact nobody is killed. George allegedly sacrifices himself to save Priscilla (he is tied to a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells worse than garbage and the monster attracts the scent). <br /> <br /> The nominal leads are a group of high school students. There are pretty Priscilla and her inconspicuous friend and some "bad" guys who get in shape (surprise, surprise) to defeat the monster in the final scenes. The monster is involved in four main sets. He attacks a garbage truck from Browning-Ferris and leaves him standing on an elevated highway, but nobody notices. He goes unnoticed through the carnival. He rips a building (nice miniature work) and nobody sees him except George. Then he attacks the high school during a dance, grabs Priscilla and carries her away, just as a certain very large monkey has done several times, most recently last winter. <br /> <br /> There are action ideas that result from this nowhere and dropped. Local citizens are picked up at the town hall because they want their trash cans back. An ingenious secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by a private jet, examined and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Why did I look at this? Because these people had so much fun. I had the idea that the firefighters were firefighters, the businessmen were shot in their own offices, Priscilla might live in this suburban home, and scenes of people in their yards might have been on their own farms. <br /> You may not be great actors but real people. Nobody looks amazingly good. In fact, I would estimate that four in five of the adults on the screen wear glasses. Since this is in the mid-seventies, we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have incredibly bad facial hair. A dignitary interviewed prior to a meeting at Ciry Hall has such a tie and sports coat that he thinks he plays Marcellus in THE MUSIC MAN. <br /> <br /> And that brought the movie two additional stars. Zero for the story. Two points for the sometimes decent special effects. And two points for the fact that the people in the community have actually come together and have done so. You can actually say that they appeared in a movie; Despite a lot of stage work and working behind the scenes on live television, I can not say that, and I'm happy for her. <br /> <br /> Remember the good old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point someone said, "Let's do a show, Aunt Edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" Then they would do "neighborhood shows" with sets and costumes that would be more than seven digits today. <br /> <br /> That's the spirit Milpitas good people had for this project, and bless them for that.
