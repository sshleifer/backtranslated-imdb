As a fan of the old series, I have to say that this is, at best, a parody of a popular series. At least the old series would at least try to follow a military structure. I know in this P.C. World is not the thing to do, but they do not make it the foster bear. In the old series Beachead was a hardened soldier, now he is a mutant turtle in his teens. Another thing is the flying tank. Okay, he flies off the cobra base and jumps off the helicopter and both are alright. Let's face it, if the next one is not better, it could mean the end of G.I.joe.
