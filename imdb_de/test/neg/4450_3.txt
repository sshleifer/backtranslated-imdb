I just saw the movie and was pretty disappointed. I did not expect much of a start, as the premise of the movie is not great anyway. Unfortunately, it does not even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably the spectacle. Although I've seen far worse performers in far worse films, history would require some people to act as violent insane, other than the people who are in a really stressful predicament, and they can not. Although I looked at the German release, I looked at it with the original audio. So it's definitely not just a bad voice or something like that. In addition, the German DVD release is seemingly cut off, the murders are all pretty hilarious, which means that the German release is not a film for "gore- dogs, except for a few half-blooded scenes just before the end of course, do not comment on other releases.The plot has some stupid moments here and there and the beginning is just funny (have you ever heard a demon visit a psychiatrist?). Pity the movie takes itself too seriously if he does When horror comedy was filmed and things changed a bit here and there, it could have worked better, and the end is just a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you really have nothing better to do and boredom just stops If you can endure, then think (and it's really a weak "maybe") for this movie. If there is anything left to see or do, choose this alto nutrition tive.
