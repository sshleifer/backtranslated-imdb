This movie is not a horror movie. There's nothing scary about it, it's more of a torture strip. And it does not make sense to me, there are some scenes with vanishing bodies. For example, the woman at the beginning of the film. The Get Pullaway Away returns for a scene in the bathroom with Nicole and she disappears completely. Then she kills the police officer to free him from his misery, and he disappears. He had to shoot him twice in the head to kill him. I do not think so special when you can see his head half blown off and did not kill him? At the end, she sets the killer's truck on fire. But he is not in it. He stands behind her. Then it has been cut to the rest. Stop was completely redesigned and some people are at the truck stop and a new girl comes in and Nicole asks for help like the first girl who is completely pointless in this movie. Save some money and skip this movie.
