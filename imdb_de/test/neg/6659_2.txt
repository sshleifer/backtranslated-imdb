Exceptionally bad! I do not expect much from Garcia, as he is one of the most overrated actors today, but Keaton should have known that this movie crap and came out, even though he could (not that I like him particularly, but he did Batman .) <br /> <br /> In one scene, Keaton is taken to a chain down hospital and wears Hannibal Lecter's face mask when two attacking dogs bark at him (dogs can hear the evil you know) and Keaton growls back to them, forcing them with their tails between their legs. Did the movie become a comedy right there? Garcia makes a fool of himself in an interrogation scene with fools, only a full delay could be plausible, and the child is too annoying to be sorry. <br /> <br /> If you make a film so poor In an action, you need some charm, humor and solid action. Take The Hard, for example, which is great despite its crappy storyline. <br /> <br /> Although the character of Keaton was a joke, I dared him all the way. But I wanted to see Garcia cry because his dead child was trying to sip martinis on a paradise island. This movie makes for a good laugh. Watch it with a funny friend, and you can have fun as this movie craves for cleverness in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> All in all an insult to your own intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this movie and thank God he bit his own ass.
