A study in BAD. Bad direction, bad drama, bad writing, and F / X that show you better upgrade your computer before filming. That's the kind of movie that made you drunk with Dad's camera in your basement when you were young. But you would certainly not show it in public when you're sober again, right? YOU would not even see it. Avoid at all costs.
