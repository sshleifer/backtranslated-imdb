This is certainly not a comedy - I do not know what was marketed in this way. As a serious film he lacks any substance. If you have not just left Sunday school or need your Noah fix, you'll be bored until your tears are bored. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. His kids do not really add anything to the movie. They only seem to be brooding over their absent father at the beginning. Jonah Hill plays a scary internet addict who does not seem so funny. <br /> <br /> I found that the original is a decent movie. Disappointed that he did not really go anywhere.
