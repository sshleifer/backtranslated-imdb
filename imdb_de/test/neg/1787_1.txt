This movie is so irretrievably bad, NOTHING makes it worth seeing. NO impact, no tension and poor dialogue quality. Oh, and neither a CAMP nor any FEAR contains it. Do yourself a favor and check out the original Friday 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp. Whatever you do, you DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> Even Michele Bauer's appearance at the beginning can not save it. Normally in such films you expect violence, tension and a little blood and some T & A. The violence was poorly executed, the "tension" was ridiculous, there was NO bang, and the T & A is plentiful in the first 5 minutes, so NOTHING. At least one of those things that worked properly would at least have made it visible. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing, Buck Buck is awesome, he seems to be the only one who understands that they make Schlock, and rams it rightly. If everyone else would agree with this tone, it would have been fun, no pun intended.
