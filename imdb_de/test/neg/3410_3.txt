As a science-fiction fan from my early childhood (for a long time), I always hated implausible conspiracies. It is a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show that respect for their audience. I've always suspected they think, "Kids are stupid to realize that we do not have to try." The author of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is encouraged by his new friends to spy on his parents because they think the parents are foreigners. As intriguing as the idea sounded to me, its realization bored me. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had just that one idea and tried to immerse them in a dark, stylish and slow-moving atmosphere for over ninety minutes. The only thing that kept me in my place was the question "How do you manage to get out of this implausible trash"? And then - bang - they did not even try. So if you are looking for a good conversation for children and parents, look instead at "Klatret√∏sen (2002)".
