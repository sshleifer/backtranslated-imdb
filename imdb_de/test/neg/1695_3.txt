Maybe this fascinated them in the 50s, but that's one of those movies that does not age well. This serious, serious, run-down, working male humor on a TV show "Playhouse" by Rod Serling with 2nd rate. The "conspiracy" is through the book, the confused background of the Cassevetes character seems to be tackled, and the love interest is unconvincing and half-hearted an annoying, haughty snot. If I had to work with this man in a warehouse, I would probably hit him with a hook as well. Jack Warden is good because he plays Jack Warden as usual. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of IMDb rated movies (classic, mediocre or crazy), this movie is somehow rated 7 points - some stars. That does not deserve it. Save your time
