I was an extra in this movie, in the part that was shot in the first 15 minutes at the airport. I was one of the fleeing (mainly Mexican) refugees from Bangladesh who were running over the runways of Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point, as we stood in our turbans, waiting for another shot, one of my comrades turned to me and asked me what the movement would be about. I told him that it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just as a musical. There was a long pause, then he replied, "Man, this movie is going to fuck." Pretty much, I thought. I had a good time and earned a bit of money, but even with some interesting personal memories of this film, I can not stand it all. <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen the movie "The Swarm", you can pretty much get the idea. You see a lot of famous and talented people being wasted on an idea that's just plain bad at first sight. The idea seemed to be that if you put enough money into a movie and set enough big names, a good story and good writing are not necessary. Just turn the big crank and the product comes out. It's just not worth watching.
