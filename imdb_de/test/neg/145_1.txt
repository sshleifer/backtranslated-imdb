This film is really a big piece of garbage trying to make it look like a Hollywood production. Bad story outline (stupid robot story) ... extremely bad acting by infallible pop idols ... and they're trying to "fight" !! Geez ... these miserable actors use wires to make them look like "good fighters" ... :( and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !!! I'll never Do touch his movies again. AVOID this movie at all costs !!! I wanted to give it a negative value of ten ... not even worth a 0/10.
