Doug McLure's appearance in a movie is something that is a guarantee of poverty. His DG initials are like a special cinema certification that appears somewhere before "U". <br /> <br /> Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer from a dilating agent and bad judgment. He has excellent work in the Hammer films as Dr. Van Helsing. I saw him making a very passable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his Magnum Opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first "Star Wars". The only man except the Emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to stop bickering and get away with it. But - crikey! - He made turkeys. There was this pitiful 'Daleks' movie for one. And here is another. <br /> <br /> There is a machine that was hijacked by Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a screw on the front and drawers on the sides. I am surprised that Jerry Anderson was not sued for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought. However, if the film is a guide, they can not have paid him much. It's 1976 and we're still playing in latex onesie. <br /> <br /> That's really true. Some films have an entertainment value in the category "That's how bad it is good". That does not even work. It would not even entertain children. "Crash Corrigan's" things from the 1930s have more to offer.
