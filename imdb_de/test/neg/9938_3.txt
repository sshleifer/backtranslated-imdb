Impressive! This is the movie that should be shown on television at 2am on Cinemax for all these insomniacs (Lord knows they would probably fall out of boredom on the movie). Terrible acting, the killer is far from scared, I've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. Countless "skins" in this movie, pseudo-pornographic scenes that are horrible in more than a million cases, a flashy soap opera-style script that really hurt the movie, and the director really had no sense for the genre that he wanted to create with this movie. I saw a group of teenagers with their camcorders doing a better job. I do not think there's a part of me that could recommend this movie to anyone ...
