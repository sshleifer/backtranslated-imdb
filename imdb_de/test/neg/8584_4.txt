Predictable, clich√©, unbelievable, boring ... what else can I say? Only the caliber of the cast saves the redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yes, and the entertaining antics of the endzone. <br /> <br /> But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, as the result is as predictable as the one who wins the Globetrotters / Washington Generals match. > <br /> I was well in Act II before I found out they were PRO teams we watched (all dressed in Vintage Padres Brown). And the imitation of a young front by Georgia Frontiere by Cameron Diaz was hard to imagine on the side. (Not your fault, Cameron, would you like to go to dinner?) Enough of that - I'm only on guard because I was looking forward to this movie. Rent the longest yard instead. <br /> <br />
