Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not a thriller, no suspense, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror. Terribly bad. After many years lurking here at IMDb, I was actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people. IT STARTS YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world where movies are so bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life, if you are not smart enough to push the fast-forward. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's voice on an "improved" DVD (there's another horrible thought) to see what the hell they're thinking. The producers had to assume that there was enough jerk to fall for the name Val Kilmer, to bring this film at least in international distribution to the breakthrough. <br /> <br /> I actually had the misfortune to vote for films on request that did not provide subtitles to the Russian dialogue. Not that it mattered much. Try listening to the Russian translate it in your head (if you can) just to find out how boring it is, just add insult. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a "1" because I can not give it a lower rating, and because it has achieved a remarkable thing. It somehow made an almost subterranean film that did NOT feel claustrophobic. Well, that's a dubious achievement. <br /> <br /> HERE IS YOUR SPOILER: And the Holy Mother at the end (no pun intended) is like having no more money and decided to stop filming. The "climax" of the movie happens literally seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I've ever seen in the movie. Also practice your easy escape mechanism when you observe this - the off button.
