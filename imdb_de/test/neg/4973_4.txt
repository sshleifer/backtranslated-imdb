This is 2008, which really cares about a man like DB Sweeney in the world, even then he was not a big deal. <br /> <br /> Two Tickets to Paradise is a story outlined where three friends were traveling under their personal circumstances. Another proven conspiracy. The problem with this film is, apart from the title "so bad that it is captivating", the script. Cliché after cliché three guys do the same thing you've seen in every other road movie ... and blow up vanna white's house. <br /> <br /> John C. McGinley's acting job is outstanding, especially compared to that of former DB Sweeney. (His career is dead, so late.) Although I hear he's on TV, that's good for him. John C probably has the least horrible character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The score is so general that it feels like you have a third-grade film from 1993 or Jeff Anderson's movie Now You Know (I've also retired a few years, but at least that was more entertaining.) I mean, yah, I think I enjoyed some of it. But the nerdy guy is annoying, DB is trying to be that cool, offbeat guitarist (with some harsh influences like one of the worst classic Rocks) who has a weird relationship with a stripper, and John C is a player whose wife and that Kind leaves him after the death of his father and a visit from one of his henchmen in the bookstore. <br /> <br /> I keep thinking of ways to make this movie better. But I think it would have been a good start to burn the script. <br /> <br /> But as I've hinted, it's not the worst movie ever. And every chance to see McGinley in a lead role, I suppose. I hope he gets some better projects.
