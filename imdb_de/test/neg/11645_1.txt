An old high school teacher of mine used to boast that he had seen every movie I had ever made. One day a friend of mine decided to create a movie called "Pacific Inferno". Later we got into a fight whether Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams played the lead role. Our teacher found the argument interesting, so he came to us and told us that Jim Brown played the lead role in "Pacific Inferno". We thought he was trapped in a lie until we went to the library and found out that "Pacific Inferno" was indeed a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's awful. Our fictional film had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better on the picture.
