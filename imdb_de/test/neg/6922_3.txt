Since this was not a theatrical release anywhere in the world, it's just a reminder that the careers of talentless ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich have gone. It's also a special kind of movie, the kind she thinks is smart, witty and original, though she's poor in every way. Full blame can be Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script assumes a rather unoriginal situation and goes nowhere with it. The situations develop completely without inner logic, except for a desperate screenwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, behave stupidly and with no real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than when Mrs. Richards was admitted. We do not think they're related to David Krumholtz's character for a minute, and the way she's brought back into play after an hour is particularly pathetic. Why would anyone care for a self-centered, self-possessed, arrogant stuff like this first, and certainly not a second time? Especially after he supposedly found his..me ... true love? And if one of these things is not enough to completely submerge this movie, then this is the central couple. The connection between Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more credible than that of Richards, but it has no success. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we could easily accept as a credible couple. Worse, these two central characters are especially annoying and irritating. They do annoying and irritating things in which the viewer finally has no interest at all. <br /> <br /> All in all a very bad idea. Even die-hard Rom-com fans might want to share it, as there are dozens of more skillful or charming films.
