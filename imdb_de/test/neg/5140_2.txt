Like the previous poster I am from northern Vermont and wanted to have this movie. However, I have not seen such a confusing conspiracy since "Red Zone Cuba". The things that people smuggle do not make sense. Two of the gang paddles across the border send a second party in a car over. Um, why? Then they meet two others and drive at night in a luxury Packard to hide the evil. - Would not only two people in a flatbed car make more sense? Then park the four in front of the garage, which holds the targeted Hooch, and fall asleep! When they wake up in the morning and start getting the whiskey, they are naturally discovered and shelled, losing some of their precious cargo. Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and swim across the border. Why again? I'm telling someone whose big uncle has really smuggled in the area. All it took was to drive a vehicle that could boil over the American Border Patrol, which at that time had only a fraction of the resources. <br /> <br /> And I did not start in the last half hour, which made no sense whatsoever. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the movie is that Kris Kristopherson has it. Actually, some charisma grew over the years.
