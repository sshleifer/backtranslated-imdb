Korea's answer to "I know what you did last summer" follows a similar storyline to its American equivalent: a year after a group of high school friends killed a classmate by mistake, a masked killer begins to search them one at a time. Who could possibly have seen her that night - or was her "victim" still alive when she threw him into the sea? <br /> <br /> Originality can no longer be expected of the Teen Slasher, but one can still make an effort to make sure that these movies are entertaining and scary. RECORD is not one of the two who brings out poorly prepared scenes from "I Know ...", "The House On Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among many others) and does not deliver decent shock in the 95 minutes. <Br /> <br /> The drama is decent by the performers, who, as seems to be common in Korean cinema, approach a non-inspirational screenplay with enthusiasm and undeserved enthusiasm. The direction, however, is mediocre at best; a strange choice of camera angles and the costume of the worst killer * EVER *, which contributes to the sinking of RECORD. Most disappointing is the end of the film, when the two "surprise curves" are obvious, that you have dismissed them as too blatant! <br /> <br /> RECORD's only salvation is the bright beginning - the first act is indeed excellent and shows the American colleagues how character development and mood building should be done - but otherwise this is a very bad movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
