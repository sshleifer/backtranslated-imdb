This definitely looks like "the amateur lesson". How this piece of garbage was ever published is inexplicable to me: the acting, the story, the characters, the alleged special effects, etc., that's ALL wrong. Why Lance accepted Henriksen will remain one of cinema's big secrets. Maybe he was in dire need of money, or maybe under the influence of some illegal drug. <br /> <br /> It's useless to explain to you what this movie is about. It deals with the great foot legend, but in the worst way. In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! 0 * of 10 *
