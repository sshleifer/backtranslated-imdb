This movie was by far the worst of the 67 of the 71 best pictures I've ever seen. At first I found the plot somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Give me a break. And why did the guy who had been absent for so long happen to work on an oil rig next to the convention women's party? This movie also showed some of the worst stereotypes of African Americans I've ever seen. It blows out of the wind (see Prissy) downright progressive! I barely saw a movie I did not like so much. POOH!
