So, um, this woman has a vagina that pulls people in when they do, and there's this guy who follows her everywhere ... everywhere ... and uh, she's in love with her and she can not go back because of him love her thing Well, her thing starts to talk to her ... somehow ... it just says, feed me again and again and she tries to feed it with hot dogs, but that does not work because it wants ummmmm fresh meat ?! ? !!? So this woman goes to the red light district where she picks up tourists, but only the really bad ones do it, I think they deserve it, and after a while this guy looks for her and even if she's there, he does not see her like that Finally, he engages with affiliated twins, but he only likes one of them because the other is a true huss. That's not bad, because I thought it would be so because the novelty wears off within the first 1/2 hour and lasts another hour. I think it killed a few brain cells because I was eating it all out and now a little brain is damaged. Anyway, that's the worst man-eating vagina movie I've ever seen.
