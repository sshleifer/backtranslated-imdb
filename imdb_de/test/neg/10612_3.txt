I'm not one of the people who complains every time a movie appears on an old television program. I usually run out and see it (if I saw the show) and try to get nostalgic. If someone wants to run down films based on old shows, this is Exhibit A (you can actually say something more than just "McHales Navy"). "Mod Squad" is bleak, tiring and lethargic. At least the original series was scary long before anyone knew teenagers could be so bleak, which made them groundbreaking. That's just boring. Claire Danes is nice to look at but does nothing more than mood swings and sneaking around the bad guys. Giovanni Ribisi's acting extent in this film is that Droopy the Dog searches for an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps looks like he wanted to escape from the set, but the Chlostraphobie of the script caught him. Sure, the production is beautiful, with the now seemingly compulsory "Rave" nightclub opening action and shootout in abundance. Oh, and the kids are screaming and getting angry with them and their superiors. It's like deciding to use the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine for a Hollywood family vacation with your teenagers, who you and your spouse know need heavy medication and prescription drugs. I really wanted to have this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would distract life from it. You can tap another remake of Spelling's "Charlie's Angels", anything you want, but at least that movie knew he wanted to have fun with himself. "The Mod Squad" lets you know where the inspiration from the original series lay.
