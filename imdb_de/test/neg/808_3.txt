Unfortunately, as a South African living in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the UK, I have to say that this film is a big disappointment. The three main problems I had with the film were: a) Why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - are starring. This country is full of talent and does not need imports ... b) Gillian Slovo has been exchanging her combat skills for years. She is a very mediocre writer and even her novel does not put Mr. Hooper in the limp ... and c) Hilary Swank is again such a great actor, as proved in Million Dollar Baby (but also in Eastwood), dressed here in contemporary New York style, as he roams free through the poverty of the Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity of the client and the director required? Yes, the movie is finally moving - how could it not be? - But the general mood at the conclusion is a tremendous horror. Heart is in the right place, but needs a pacemaker.
