Wow - thank god I was in an airplane and could look out the window. Poor Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly acted (who was this terrible woman the woman was playing?), Poorly staffed, terribly written. This movie was apparently made to appeal to the kind of person who is willing to change firefighters, "heroes" or gods in general, I suppose. I just do not have enough bad things to say about this movie. It could not have been cheap, with all the stars that were there, all the special effects and fire scenes. Had to cost a fortune, but it was still worse than any movie I can remember. Funeral scene? Amazingly bad. Courtship between firefighter and aforementioned terrible wife? Corny, invented, banal. Fire House pranks? Do not we all wish we could be so masculine and cheeky at the same time.
