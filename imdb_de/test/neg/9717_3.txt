A group of four young men visiting a prestigious private school is part of an old covenant formed by their ancestors in the late 17th-century witch-hunts. Each of them has a power that always ages him when he uses them, and he suspects that a new child at the academy could come from a family that was thought to have long since perished. This new guy wants everyone to have power for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie as it tries to present itself. Yes, there is magic and all the supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Almost exclusively to be cool and smooth and to pay little attention to the plot, which unfortunately offers plenty of unused space for interesting twists. However, none have yet been inserted, and even before the film is half over, you know what is being played by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, especially an exploding car, magically reconstructed after hitting a big rig, but that's about it. What's worse, director Renny Harlin, who has some very entertaining if not intelligent films to his credit, relies heavily on crashing metal music and leads to overly sexy leads to wear this movie, and that may well make it the dumbest "horror" movie since the disaster "Alone in the dark." It's not as bad as "Alone in the Dark", as the few smooth scenes are actually smooth and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the highest movie this movie can hope for is a nice and cozy home late in the evening. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated with PG-13: violent action
