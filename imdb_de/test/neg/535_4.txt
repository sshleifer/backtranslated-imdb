I somehow had high expectations for this movie. I've always thought that Tom Selleck's lesser-known films (such as Runaway and Coma) were significantly better than those for which he had more pressure. Perhaps the producers should have known a little more about former major league baseball players who became overseas stars. The majority were players who were too good for Triple A baseball players, but not Major League Matériel. I admire the idea of ​​setting Selle's character in Japn as opposed to the stereotype of playing in minors. Sad to say that this film, like the title of the post, is stranded on a third movie that seems to be on an autopilot. I would not mind seeing a sequel, and hopefully the producers would learn from the mistakes. The premise is just too unique to be left alone with this uneven movie
