Okay, how anyone really thinks this movie is fantastic is a mystery to me. I can not even understand how anyone can find this movie funny from afar. The only character he has is the evil super nerd game designer, and that gets old after a while. This film is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny, they are forced, you can see better in the red light district, and the story is shitty, it's so predictable, you know exactly what's going to happen. Even the characters do not react the way they should, try to go to the hot chick that your boss is at work and tell him you're beating 2 crazy chicks you live with at the same time. Your answer would not be (smile.) "Ok, let's get back to work". I never once laughed in this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent $ 3 because it's not worth it. Adam Sandler produced this film, I have lost all respect for him. All his movies are the same, his comedy style has been getting old since The Waterboy came out, if I knew that Adam Sandler had produced that before I rented it ... I could not have wasted my time on it. This movie is as bad as it can possibly get from all sides ... ace ventura was not a canny comedy movie, it did not have a killer plot ... but it was original and it was weird. I'm not knocking on the movie because he has "low-level" humor, I'm knocking because he's shit, it's a piece of Hollywood crap. If this movie was presented to a production company and does not have "ADAM SANDLER" behind it, it would be dumped faster than a used condom. If you want to watch a good movie about pot culture, check out Cheech and Chong or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, you will only get a generic comedy aimed at 14-17 year olds, with all the rock music in all sorts of cuts that make your eyes squint and turn your belly, and a comedy that looks good Your movie matches stoned friend eats McDonalds for an hour and a half. Do not do it ... for the love of God ... this movie is shit, treat it as it is and look beyond all the Hollywood glory ... Hercules in New York was once the worst movie I've ever seen, but actually it's so bad that it's good. This was instead a very expensive movie that sucked just as much, if not more.
