I'm a pretty tolerable guy when it comes to movies, even B movies. I regularly watch some B movies that are fun, and they range from surprisingly good to just awful. Normally I set my expectations very low before looking at these types of films, and even after that Descent was just awful. I really did not mind that they demolished the core, but they did not do anything interesting with the material. Some scientists are worried about Earth's earthquake activity and have to travel to the depths of the earth to stabilize the mantle. So what we get is a monotonously long lineup in which two dueling scientists from Luke Perry and Rick Roberts have to work together on a top-secret mission called Project DEEP. The responsible man, General Fielding, played by Michael Dorn, secretly denies key information to assistant Marsha Crawford, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Rounding out the cast is Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a mission specialist who created a drill with the "Mole" drill that plunges into the depths of the earth. Except for some pretty good special effects and set designs, nothing from Descent is worth it. The film opens quite entertainingly, but it quickly gets bogged down in a boring tale of uncontrollable seismic activity that has died in other films like the Core. Descent also has a bad script, with useless, forgetting dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. The attempts of comic relief are painless. The plot has gaping holes and some of the dealings remain in the end, leaving a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie was just a cheap way for anyone involved to get a paycheck. There was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. Apart from some good-looking special effects and set design, this film fails on every other level. The story comes from the dustbin of Hollywood and the characters are uninteresting. The descent will simply plunge you into boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
