The child was born back. It moves in half a dozen directions, has dialogues and actions removed from much older and better-known flops, and could be funny - if only the authors know what's funny. Much better in the last few decades, but let it go do not be fooled. They should have given The Kid a wide berth, sang a lullaby, and then led the train down a ravine. Gnadenschuss.
