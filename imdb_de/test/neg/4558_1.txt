I'm impressed by the number of people who think this movie is decent ... much less great! Does the majority of people have any basic standards for a movie they see? I just do not know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial movie product" does not really deserve the respect of being called a movie. To call Dean Cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent. I had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of it went straight into the tube. At least her role was extremely small. Maybe she had a bill that needed to be paid urgently. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while watching "Firetrap" was amazing. Let me begin by taking this from my chest: if you can not show the fire realistically, then you will not show it at all. OK?!! It's an embarrassment for anyone involved to have lame effects that do not even come close to simulating a burning building. <br /> <br /> Some interesting little things: 1. A janitor opens the door to a large storeroom and finds the entire room in flames. What does he do? He tries to extinguish the fire with his broom! 2. The same janitor (who knows the building is on fire) later comes across a door labeled "DANGEROUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind tells him it would be a good idea to open the door. Big mistake! 3. One woman makes fantastic generous donations of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she wears a fur coat for the charity event they host! (Would not people who are interested in animals abuse this kind of frown?) 4. Several people in the movie are forced into a vault with massive steel walls that even penetrate an electromagnetic impulse (!!) t. However, they have a spacious air outlet that leads directly into the back of the thing, through which anyone could crawl through. That certainly seems to be a security hole. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I'm getting tired of thinking about this lame movie. Our "hero" for cheering is a professional criminal who tries to kill some police officers early. What a gay guy! If the public wants to waste their minds with this bustle, then they have more power. I just wish I could erase it from my memory. 1.10
