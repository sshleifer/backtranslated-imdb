For this movie, based on a TV show, and a serious finale. I thought it was a lousy way to end it seriously. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, goodbye and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. If you do not really like the show (like me), skip this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a loyal fan of the Even Stevens series, but the plot was too tricky, and Dave Coulier, man, this guy has nothing. I did not do anything good. You should not have used Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give it 4.5 / 10
