I had some hope for this one-hour movie, which consists of footage from old Poverty Row films. Surely it had the opportunity to be more than a home-video mass marketed in the world. Unfortunately, this movie still feels like a home theater, but with stock footage inside. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the planned reading of a will on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship sinks and that's the movie. <br /> <br /> The film promises that Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others will be taken from old films to interact with new material. We get it all right, but most of the time we get a lot of new video footage that looks like a scratchy black and white movie where new actors come in. Old footage is mostly used as a cutscene to stage the scene, but very few of the old and new matches are clearly matched. It is not very convincing and is very disappointing for someone like me who was looking for a better constructed movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you know and love the old Poverty Row movies, this (maybe very spoofy) is worth looking at. I would warn against buying this, but it's about five dollars (the price of a rent) so you have the choice (though, if you can get away, not pay for it). <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
