A big waste of time is everything you get from this bag. I rented this in the hope of an exciting movie with maybe a few credible scenes, but I was disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101" or something. Well, stay away from this movie anyway. It stuns you to death. Do not be afraid of big feet, I'm afraid of this crap !!
