This movie was not very funny. It was not that terrible either. Just a fun ride aboard the Soul Plane. It's a black owned airline with a kick-ass disco, a nice bar and pump stewards. The plot leads you through the whole idea of ​​a black (not racial or colored, but "style") plane with the same black humor. Sometimes there are some rare scenes in which the main character uses the normal toilet at the normal level. Look at that. There are breaks, however, and I find it most in the character who played the Soul Pilot. Watch who it is. All in all, it's a funny movie. Tom Arnold adds fun with his cracker attitude. This is a movie you can watch while playing poker, drunk or vegging.
