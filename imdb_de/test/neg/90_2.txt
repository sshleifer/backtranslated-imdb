The only reason why this film is not rated with a 1 (terrible) voice is the fact that both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan play a prominent role. Ida Lupino, who as always is amiable, is increasingly disturbed as she tries by various means to free herself from a madman. Robert Ryan is terrible when the threatening stranger, whose character is distracted only by his disturbed mind, changes from minute to minute. Seemingly simple and docile, he suddenly becomes smart and threatening. Ms. Lupino's character was more endangered by the house she lived in, and her own stupidity than anyone who came with her. She did not manage to get out of her own house: windows did not open, both the front and the back door were locked with a key from the inside and unlocked. You could not design a worse fire trap if you tried. She has not taken the precaution of having only one extra key. She also could not figure out how to get help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own cellar while being detained by her kidnapper. I do not know in which war her husband was killed, but if it was World War II, the furniture in her house, the styles of clothing, especially the children and the car company's car, are anachronistic. I recommend to just watch this movie to see what curiosities you can find.
