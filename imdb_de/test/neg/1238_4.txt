I am not sure if this test is a spoiler, but I play it safe by pointing it out. Still, it's unlikely anyone will look at this movie that does not know the book. There is an old saying about working powerful and producing a mouse. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on the Indians than the Americans. McMurtry and Osanna were right in saying that the public was more interested in the whites than in the reds. Unfortunately, the novel contains little that we do not yet know about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. The film therefore usually gives us a daring premonition of "Lonesome Dove". The Indians, who have their own story to tell, are largely pushed into the background - so that someone who has not read the novel will rightly ask why he is called "Comanche Moon". <br /> <br /> The novel has no common plot or much of a "dot". This could be corrected in the film, as the contrast between the Indians who lose their land and their way of life is drawn more to the retreating Americans who bring "civilization". This opportunity was missed. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Lonesome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships - at least with the Americans. The extended scenes with the Indians were largely removed or shortened. And for a (net) four-hour movie, it's remarkably episodic and choppy. One has the feeling that the script was originally longer and the production costs were lowered. <br /> <br /> The script consists mainly of clich√© dialogue, aphorisms and platitudes. From the author of "The Last Picture Show" comes an amazingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to troubleshoot history and characterization issues, but did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogues in the novel are missing or changed without any obvious reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred of Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) for always running away to be with his "Pard". This little revelation of Clara's sexual jealousy is over. Then there is the scene in which the primeval Woodrow Maggie warns that Jake Spoon does not "compromise" her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and rougher; The movie cheers it up and does not show Woodrow as the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (As I read this scene in the novel, I wanted to punch Woodrow in the stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of which are understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut off; I would like to have needed expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! (Perhaps it was unreasonable to ask Wes Studi for such a large prosthesis.) And Buffalo Hump's character is "friendlier and gentler". He is by no means as grotesquely violent as in the novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this turkey is Steve Zahn's remarkable achievement - not so much as Gus McCrae but as Robert Duvall player Gus McCrae. It is scary. He copies Duvall's mannerisms and speech perfectly, without ever appearing "intentional" or self-confident. Like Duvall, he is completely in the figure. And he actually shows us that Gus in the third part "more Gus" is. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it does not affect our affection for "Lonesome Dove" Great Western, but a great American movie. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who think Rachel Griffiths is exaggerated - that's what she was in the book.
