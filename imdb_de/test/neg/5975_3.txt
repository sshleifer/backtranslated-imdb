When exploiters become evangelists, they are still exploited in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after watching the movie is ?? God bless me, that I eat no fish or no non-vegetarian products! <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on Lake Victoria in Tanzania, where once upon a time many species of beautiful fish lived. One day, in the 1960s, someone came and injected the mighty fish Perch, which became Japan's exportable commodity for Tanzania. The consequences were serious? At first, all local small and large fish were extinct; Second, the plane that wanted to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not have a commercial / business / capitalist sense. Therefore it is filled with weapons and ammunition (that can give Europe to this world). Third, pilots (like all migrants and travelers like truckers) must survive their sexual needs by thriving on them for cheap local African prostitutes; Fourth, the brokers, traders and middle-men in the chain (mainly businessmen originating in India) become richer and poverty in Tanzania remains the same; Fifth poverty drives children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The requirement to do this documentation was excellent. But has the director Hubert Sauper managed to make a good documentary? It's a big NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: As in India, it requires a higher Brahmin caste to stand up and project on the world, Indian poverty and untouchables; Similarly, an Australian-born European documentary filmmaker requires telling the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. It is the miserable motive of the unconscious discipline of this rich class (who has never seen poverty or poor known) that survives, lives, is deserved, and famous, as if pests are attached to bringing poverty to the world as soon as they do see. There is nothing more than contempt for poor people in Africa and India who see such pictures of their pictures. <br /> <br /> Hubert's intention and motives seem to be completely one-sided. The images, characters, locations, interviews are too serious and gloomy, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to introduce his case. What we end up feeling is pity and sadness for Africans. We also start to see the government and people of Tanzania as evil. Some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing else. The director limits himself to showing himself once on screen ?? Not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director Hubert can only survive if he himself, like today's CNN and BCC media giants, is an exploiter. Hubert did not have the courage and common sense to speak with Europeans who eat or companies that import these fish products. A completely one-sided effort! But I understand the reasons immediately? Hubert only wanted to boast of his fame by sitting in his European comfort with prizes and smiling. <br/> <br /> No words left for this miserable effort. I discount the documentary's rating of 3.5 out of 10 stars just because the topic was correct. However, it was exploited and overpowered by amateurishly ill-conceived directors designed exclusively for dubious western audiences! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
