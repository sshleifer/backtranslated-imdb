This movie was a thorough disappointment. There was no history of development. The audience was thrown into the story without explanation and had to think for themselves how they wanted to find out what was going on. The action sequences were fine, but confusing. They were not the Matrix and they were not sitting on Tiger. This movie is best left to the cable TV, where you do not have to pay to see it, or convince a friend to rent it and then watch it. As a big Jet Li fan, I expected more. How can someone who deals with Once Upon a Time in China name this name?
