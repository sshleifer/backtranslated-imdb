"The Cave" was released more or less simultaneously with the English movie "The Descent" by Neil Marshall. Both films share a similar premise. Only "The Cave" is terribly unoriginal, incessant and incompetent compared to the great horror adventure "The Descent". It seems as if Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and that ingenious ideas, depth and personal style were immediately added, while Bruce Hunt, director of The Cave, simply chose the most rudimentary script writing his desk was shown. The result is an incredibly mediocre movie that contains every horror cliché you can think of and in which most of the violence takes place off-screen. And we all hate that, right? The story introduces a clique of unbearable cave divers trapped in a completely undiscovered Romanian subterranean ecosystem. Horrifying winged creatures, which are also parasites, attack them soon and the escape seems to be impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still a little entertaining as you study all the clichés and listen to the cheesy textbook dialogues, but the whole thing just gets too dark. None of the events is even slightly plausible, and it looks like the entire cast is competing for WORST performance. I have seen better special effects in anonymous B movies, the locations are not fully used and the end is really shit! Very NOT to be recommended!
