It was so bad that I can not even check it. I'll write a few sentences about what I've seen, and it's up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk climbs with Elo and Capby intestines on Yosemetes El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway on a hovering skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, gets him inches, before Kirk drops his head on the floor. <br /> <br /> Spock, Kirk and McCoy eat beans at the campfire that night. Spock likes the beans. Then Kirk and McCoy sing Row Row Row Your Boat and want Spock to take part in the three-way harmony. Spock does not want to sing. And later that night, he does not agree. "But life is not just a dream, Captain." Should I continue? <br /> <br /> Okay ... A renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half-brother, executes a revolt on a sandy planet - hostage-taking. The crew of the company lands on the planet, and Uhura, who pushes fifty-five and weighs two hundred pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. But they can not fool the brother who claims to find God. <br /> <br /> He abducts the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big, bearded apparition claiming to be God sets fire to Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's sibling realizes that it is not God - but is really a form of himself or something - connects to the apparition to destroy it and ... sparks fly. Then something too complicated happens to explain the involvement of Klingons, who resemble Lorenzo Lamas ... The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (I mention, Kirk wore a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt ?). With Spock, who plays a kind of funky volcanic guitar, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three harmonize with the credits.
