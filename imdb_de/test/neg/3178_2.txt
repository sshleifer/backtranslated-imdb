There is NO Esperanto in this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. However, IMDb is wrong about the languages ​​used in this film. There is absolutely no Esperanto. It's almost all English with a few Navajo words. Do not watch this movie if you are looking for Esperanto movies. Other options are instead "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable), which has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (though totally mispronounced), and there are some Esperanto street signs in "The Great Dictator" by Charlie Chaplin. There should also be an Esperanto in "Gattaca" but I have never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the other reviewer is right. This movie is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time elsewhere.
