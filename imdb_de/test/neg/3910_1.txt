K, one day my dad got a movie with a "decent" cover. I came home with my mom and we were like Yay, we're watching this new movie we've never seen before! Ok, it started ... interesting start, cool robots and disgusting disgust on an alien planet (actually, it was Pluto, was not it?) ... Blablabla I could tell the whole story, but I do not want to say, WTF is NOT getting it a movie with a lame donkey name on it, and seriously, I DO NOT mean EVERYBODY read a book based on its cover (volume) of science fiction movies. I mean, it was so bad that I just started to laugh (I swear it was trying to be serious). I CAN NOT DESCRIBE THE STUPIDITY! It killed more than a million of my brain cells. I can not even write a parentage review. ITS that bad! Argh and I prepare you for something "weird". But his classic Batman laughs in a new packaging. What the hell was this director thinking?
