I watched this movie at a midnight sneak preview screening last night (I work for an independent theater chain in Colorado - that's one of the benefits) ... I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever had I saw it seen! I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics who (like Star Wars's hard-boiled ones) are lining you up from the nearest tree, if you do not dare to say something about their beloved movie icon ... yet, Campbell Guy The work of The Chin is a black hole in the celluloid area. Before you make any assumptions that I'm a good movie fan who only sees "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways". Think again - I'm a big fan of B-Movies and especially of Bruce Campbell. His trademark Ash is one of my favorites, and his depiction of the aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But hey, B-movies still have the potential to be reeeeal, reeeeally bad (and not in that "good" camping way that we all love) ... and that's just what It was for me and my colleagues. With the exception of a tracking shot of Bruce running through the square frightening the children, there were no laughter. Overall, we thought the story was stupidly stupid, like the Mollasse and the so-called Humor Dumber as a bag of hammers. (I'm sorry, but Ted Raimi's "Pavel" character was not a weird relief ... he was just left behind!) Believe me, we were all really into liking it, but I felt incredibly disappointed and robs hours. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely loved this movie, plan to see it several times, want to marry and have kids, etc., that's fantastic - we all like what we like, so you will not get judgment from me. But do not question the humor or fan loyalty of those who do not have multiple orgasms over Campbell's latest movie coupe. In my humble opinion, this strip was a steaming biscuit ... and as a true Campbell fan I can say that!
