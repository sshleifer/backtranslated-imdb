I have very little to add to what all other reviewers have already made clear! This movie is terrible! Beyond the Terrible ... In fact so unbearable that they still need to have a term to describe the horrible thing that is "Skeleton Man". If you believe that your films have a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay away from it as much as possible. Sure, a lot of people are killed by this skeletal doll with a ridiculous cloak, but no one bothers to explain exactly who he is, where he's from, or why he's so mad at the world. He looks like a crossover between Skeletor of "Masters of the Universe" and the rider of "Sleepy Hollow" and runs amok in a godforsaken wilderness. The setting of "Skeleton Man" is another totally delayed aspect! I spent almost half an hour assuming that the movie was on a remote, remote island, but it's just playing on the mainland, where fancy freeways pull through the forest and power plants are at the bottom of the forest! Huh: Why does everyone pretend to be trapped when there are a million escape routes? After a few random killings, a special commando command, led by the poor, stranded Michael Rooker, comes to a monster they know nothing about. Really funny is how each member of this team introduces itself as an expert in a particular field (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, a drill teacher ...), but they ALL die before any one of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful abilities! The horror gods must really hate Casper Van Dien, as he is also present again, representing a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason and crashes on the highway but is somehow catapulted to die there. Right, that makes sense ... In addition, the characters steal cool one-liners from "Predator", the Bonehead's horse constantly changes color, helicopters are shut down with bow and arrow, ordinary bullets explode trees and completely reckless Vietnam flashbacks follow Michael Rooker , I say we combine powers and align with this pathetic punch in the IMDb Bottom Top 100 ASAP!
