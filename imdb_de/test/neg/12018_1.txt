I saw this movie in the theater and it was a horrible movie. The way Michael Oliver, who is now getting worse in the sequel, is the biggest intolerance I can not stand. Junior annoys his father because he would not go to school, which drove his father Ben crazy. Even the Crazy Dance driver is not fair to Junior because he does not let him ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as dreadful as a serial killer for juniors because she insulted Junior severely, which is why I can not tolerate this movie. Even if the movie is back in theaters in the extended version, I still would not see this movie because I can not tolerate it. In fact, it stinks!
