With all the hype about the stars of the movie, I could not stand this movie anymore. I expected a much better movie given the talents of Murphy, De Niro, and Russo, but found that the film was completely in the face. Comedy sequences were over the top and the stars' superior performances, especially De Niro and Russo, could not save him! <br /> <br /> ** from *****
