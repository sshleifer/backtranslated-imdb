As much as I love trains, I could not stand this movie. The premise that you could steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train must be at the top of the Impossible Plot line. Imagine two disgruntled NASA employees stealing the "crawler" that shuttles the shuttles and driving them to New York, and you have the idea. <br /> <br /> After saying all this, it's a good try. Wilford Brimely is best on his Quaker Oats, and Levon Helm is a good performer if he's a feeble but well-meaning buddy. Bob Balaban is like the corporate guy, and the story of the "little guy takes Goliath" into the air.
