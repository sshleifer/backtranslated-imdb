I classify the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> If there ever was a movie I would wish for my enemies, that would be the case. The plot is ridiculous, there are only two characters and the coincidences between these characters completely burden the faith. <br /> <br /> These factors combined to make this movie an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother left the film in about 15 minutes. I figured a movie had to have that boring and slow * cool interesting plot tactic, and you were pretty disappointed when nothing exciting happened. <br /> <br /> I briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours lost life.
