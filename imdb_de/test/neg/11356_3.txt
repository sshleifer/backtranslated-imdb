This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I discovered Flight Of The Living Dead, I searched horror movie DVDs on Amazon. I already knew from the name that it would be a terrible mockery and most likely a rip-off of Snakes On A Plane, but it was sold brand new for 69p, so I thought I did not really have much to lose /> <br /> The music played over the opening song did not fit at all, although I liked the song itself. A pop rock song is not really suitable for the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie. It started surprisingly well, the opening scenes were not that bad, some of the acting were a bit ailing, but not as bad as I had originally thought. <br /> <br /> Until all goes well Laura Cayouette (Kill Bill rocket: Vol. 2) enters the picture. She should play a scientist. If she is, she is not very intelligent. Fortunately, she is done pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> I actually laughed physically as the camera drove over the passengers during some turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been with a nun on the plane? I was surprised that she was not clutching a crucifix. Finally, after 35 minutes, we come to a zombie action and use the word "action" loosely. The special effects are pretty much below standard, but that's to be expected of a movie with this budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie, but makes you pretty amusing. Slow motion does not work too well either. I think this movie is probably guilty of adding too much history. Trying to pose the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not a particularly good step, even considering that malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is quite similar to other zombie movies. Most characters are killed and a handful of people struggle to stay alive. Perhaps the worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is the unimaginable end. I know it's a movie about people who come back to life and feed on the living, but the end was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
