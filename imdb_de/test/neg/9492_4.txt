Douglas Sirk's "Woman Image" for Universal based on a preaching, dogmatic, didactic novel by the intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of this other popular junk, The Robe *). Rock Hudson starred in the role that catapulted him into a star, Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy worth millions, who is more interested in hunting for skirts and racing boats than in his medical degree. In the first scene he ruins his boat on a lushly photographed lake. The accident almost kills Merrick, so he needs a pretty mysterious "respirator" to keep him alive. , , Throughout the city, the beloved surgeon Dr. Phillips finally at a heart problem. Since the local hospital can only maintain one ventilator at a time, Phillips dies so the louse can live. When Merrick finds out, he tries to apologize to the family of Phillips, especially the widow (Jane Wyman, dressed and dressed in matronly haute couture), but in fact everyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spat like a Cobra's clasp , A doctor of the hospital staff even describes it as a "total waste" that the Playboy lived in place of the Christ-like surgeon. Hippocrates might have something to say! <br /> <br /> In these early scenes you will find the typical Irish iconoclasm: the director rubs himself so deeply into the inconvenience of the middle class, mid-century America, that one is rooted in the Wastrel Playboy to To bring cushions under the ladies of these moral hypocrites. But unfortunately, no, the thrilling plot of the novel must continue, and Merrick is soon converted by God, as Otto Kruger, an artist who claims Phillips made him a better and better man painter. (Why do not we see anything of this amazing art?) We learn that the unbearably ubiquitous Dr. Phillips often refused to pay for medical services provided (though it is clear who qualified for these "great exceptions"). This should give our hero a completely new way of life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger even tries to make the whole thing sound incredibly exciting: "If you start with this thing, there's no way out! It's an obsession ... a MAGNIFICENT obsession!" Merrick tries again, by pestering the widow again with apologetic upheavals, but he somehow gets her hit by a car. She loses her eyesight. Merrick seems to have a few more Stations of the Cross before he can be considered a decent guy. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to sneak into revenge, even as the movie continues to preach more and more of its growth The most obvious piece must be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as the chief nurse and Wyman's friend and uninvited lesbian lover. Notice the disappointment on Moorehead's face as Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, appears to save Wyman's life just before the end. Hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at the time, is also used with great ironic effect. He and Wyman - cowardly and fifteen years older - create in their scenes together absolutely erotic warmth, which incidentally is intentionally little, presumably because all the scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole company. (One thing is for sure: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with anything, it certainly was not Jane Wyman.) It's a chronic case of * tea and sympathy *. Sirk seemed to enjoy improving the noses of all, as this gay actor, who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the time, drifted coolly through these exquisitely colored "images of women." In fact, the director worked with Hudson six or seven more times to achieve the best results in the movie "All That Heaven Allows," in which Hudson worked with Wyman again, but was also accompanied by a realistic conspiracy. In * Obsession *, we have to endure God / Kruger, who spends an observation window on Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman's life, along with vocal music from a kitschy Hollywood choir. <br /> <br /> To see why Sirk is an author, look at the scene in which Wyman explains to her adult daughter that she can really tell the difference between day and night. The entire frame is blackened here: the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman's face is slightly raised against a faint light. She goes on to say that she hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come back". A great, relaxing moment that deserves a much better movie than * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars.
