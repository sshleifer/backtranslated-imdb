This movie started terribly - but it was meant to be determined by a cocky mother, a rival's witch, and a hesitant beauty queen who was always in second place. There were a few stupid exaggerations and a few implausible action points (she comes second in EVERY individual competition?) Unfortunately, the film suffers terribly from being a TV movie. Instead of ending at the end of the film, an amusing twist in which the killer is revealed (half-plausible), the film continues for another twenty minutes just to make sure justice is done. Now that the killer is exposed, she suddenly experiences a complete personality change - her character is completely rewritten as the authors no longer need to keep their identity secret. The cheese sinks completely, which could otherwise have been a pretty funny movie.
