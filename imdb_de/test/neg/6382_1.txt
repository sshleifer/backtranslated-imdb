I got this movie from the library and saw that it had a lot of actors (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I got it and saw it. I had expected Cleese to play a big role since he had the first bill. I was surprised to learn that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else I liked. This movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are Nobody's, the storyline is nonexistent, and the ending is one of the worst endings I've ever seen. There were some fun parts, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent "what?" and "Huh?", a lot. And if you do not want to waste your time. Ignore the people who say that this is a very funny movie ... that's not it. Just stay at any cost ... please.
