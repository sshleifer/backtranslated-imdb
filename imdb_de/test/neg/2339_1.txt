It's a joke, right? Lynch could not produce this as a television program. He had no more money, so what to do? Well, somehow he got a few bucks and "ended" the pilot, causing this mess by simply mixing everything together ... How can anyone see a failed pilot for television as a cinematic masterpiece ?! Everyone knows the deeper meaning! Well, wake up, there are none! As in this other Lynch TV series, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a puzzle and then find out nothing. I think Lynch will repeat this concept until people realize that the Emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian named Harpe Kerkerling. He disguised himself as an opera singer and "introduced" some new "art songs". Complete nonsense sing as follows: <br /> <br /> "The wolf. The lamb. In the meadow. Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. In any case, he later discussed it with the audience. They spoke seriously about the deeper meaning of the relationship between Wolf and Lamb. <br /> <br /> If you rate this movie at imdb.com at 8.0, you could be one of them. <br /> <br /> So let's say everything together: "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
