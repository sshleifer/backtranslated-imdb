This terrible insult to the memory and genius of Welles. This pointless collection of selfish improvisation on a big topic should be kept together with a number of other unfinished Welles projects that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! In addition to offending the previous injury, the dreadful English-language dubbing dubbed by amateur actors and even the big man himself only adds to the sloppy mistakes of storytelling and building. It's as if every weekend a kind-hearted Spanish soul gave Orson a few pesos, a 35 mm camera and a couple of short negative films from another production and asked Welles to drive into the Spanish countryside and just film everything until the film supply was exhausted. It is true that if Orson really did make this film out instead of the infamous Jesus Franco himself, he might have thrown out 85% of what he did, but we'll never know. Since Welles has never taken the time to edit his own work here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs have sanctioned someone else, he is not entirely to blame for the debacle. Those who want to prove that Welles was the luckiest young man in his early days because he was around people like John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise need no better proof of his inadequacies for adults than this Confusion of a movie. In his sad age, Welles was able to do anything when he needed a few dollars or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. The devil certainly got his fault with this thing!
