I often wonder how such films are made at all, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to look at them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar, it seems like the director invented the story, adding twists and turns if he wanted, no matter how ridiculous they were. The script did not exist with inhumane dialogues like "Jo Sheena Roy Pehenti Hai, Wahee Fashion Hota Hai" and "Yeh Versace hai Madam" (yes, right). <br /> <br /> Each of the characters was flat and underdeveloped. Acting was terrible. Constumes (Lycra for Udita and terrible suits for a burly Emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even resemble a Victorian mansion), scripts, etc., just a word of garbage. <br /> <br /> For those who love Hashmi and his films, look at it. I never get these two and a half hours back. The only salvation factor was a part of the music that was decent.
