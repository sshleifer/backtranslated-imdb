I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I got that in droves. She was charming in the romantic scenes; Too bad that Bill Paxton had flown the whole effort with an autopilot. I almost lost my lunch when he pulled his thick, thick white out of his flight suit to "get involved" with Julia. <br /> <br /> I realized that Julia was very fluent in French and watching her in 'Sabrina'. I saw 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia called her own dialogue. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was selected for this Dutch film through a native French speaker who had enough English to communicate with the American aviator. Maybe they wanted at least a household name for the British-American market. For my stranger's eye, Julia's facial features might suit Belgians. <br /> <br /> The whole movie had a strange nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium during World War II. I would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance against the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the occupation than the French or Norwegians. The most ferocious fighting took place in the Balkans, where Tito's communist partisans had attacked the Germans. <br /> <br /> In another article, I found that 'dbdumonteil' thought Julia Ormond an American instead of British nationality. Maybe Julia's acting skills were big enough to leave that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie several times, it suddenly dawned on me how off-season the movie is. It is set on June 16, 1944, when the American plane crashes in Belgian farmland. The trees seem to be in the middle of autumn with many leaves and the weather is warm. People walk around in light clothes and the grass is still green. There is not the slightest trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The actual plot of the movie was a mess. Where should I start? For anyone interested in the history of World War II, the film was a farce. The reconnaissance plane was a huge converted bomber with 4 engines. Such aircraft existed, but they needed a massive escort to have a chance of survival. In reality smaller and faster aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for this task. The vital codebooks in the movie would never have been carried on the plane. The crew did not need this information to complete their mission, while the compromise of that information would have been a huge intelligence defeat. Even on the premise of the movie, the first elements removed from the plane would be the codebooks. They would have been within 10 minutes of the arrival of German troops at the crash site on the way to Berlin. <br /> <br /> The House of Daussois, where 'Major Brice' took refuge, was a farm where nobody had any interest in farming. In Belgium, food would have been very scarce at the time. The Germans needed substantial quantities of locally produced food to support their forces. The family's truck would have been dispossessed long before the arrival of the American airman. There would have been no fuel for it anyway. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy in which Henri Daussois turns out of jealousy into the American is miserable. He should have revealed everything he knew about the resistance to live. He should have acted as a double agent to thwart any effective resistance. The woman with the secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> 'Major Brice' was in civilian clothes at the end of the film. This made him a spy under the laws of war and execution without defense. He would not have humbly surrendered to being exposed to the questioning unhindered by the Geneva Convention. Better to force her to kill him and, if possible, spare his friends. <br /> <br /> I did not read the novel on which this movie is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, the novel reveals an abysmal developmental defect. Regardless of the novel, screenwriters could easily have produced a superior screenplay that does not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better film.
