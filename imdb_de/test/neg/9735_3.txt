I hoped to learn something from this film, but was disappointed. It's all about Rommel and praises him as a great general, but at no time in this movie have we ever had any idea why he was so great. What made him so successful? Was it his drive, his unwillingness to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a Patton-like version that really gets into the character, but this was flat. Most of the dialogue is fictional and sensational and feels stale and artificial. Here and there are good measures, but not much. The end of the story, in which he discussed his involvement in the assassination attempt on Hitler, was the most informative and probably the most interesting part. But as a history lesson about Germany's greatest general, this was a failure.
