Cyclone is a low-value piece, even on the badly entertaining front. A friend of mine took the tape from a crowded laundry basket by St. Vincent DePaul. Okay, that may be a bit dubious, but it should be a wardrobe, not a crappy old VHS container, something that the less fortunate members of our society do not really need to make their lives better. It could be a mercy. Seeing a movie like Cyclone would really only add to its problems. The basic requirement of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that she is armed with rockets and lasers to the teeth, is not properly exploited. The two "high-speed" tracking sequences include vehicles that go faster with less than 40 km / h faster hair, and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a shitty old station wagon is not particularly inspiring when you it interferes. There is only one scene in which the stupid guns of motorcycles are used to the climax of the film, and it is ridiculously ineffective or just ridiculous, if so. These include laser beams that look like they spring from an evil sorcerer in a cheesy 80's sword and a sorcery that triggered large flames that have no noticeable effect on their targets, even in a direct hit. The rest of the movie is just tedious to see filler. Many bad actors, even Combs and Landau, suck it, and most seem to have been deleted from the set of a pornographic film to exchange really bad dialogues in a desperate attempt to push the barely coherent conspiracy. There are some poorly staged battle sequences and some unbearable comical relief scenes with some policemen and the owner of the motorcycle repair shop. Comedy of the Underground Benny Hill, a horny old man, can not stop staring at the female loinbones. Basically, the "money" scenes where the bike actually does things are little and lame and the rest is chunky filler. Skip it.
