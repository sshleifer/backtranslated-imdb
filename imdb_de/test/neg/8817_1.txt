(This review may not necessarily reveal the storyline of the movie, but it may change its expectations of the movie, resulting in a less enjoyable experience.) <br /> <br /> Have you ever rented a scary movie and expected that he is at the edge of your seat out of fear, and instead it landed with each stupid turn of conspiracy in laughter? This film had so many possibilities to impress and frighten the viewer. It was badly cut and jumped too much; References to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot went in its particular direction. The authors must not have thought about how the potentially outstanding plot should have been performed, because the poor construction of time throughout the action discourages the viewer and makes the film increasingly tiring to watch. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than the writers who could have abused an outstanding and classic thriller was the fact that he was gradually leaning on cheap tactics. The acting did not make it scary, and the situations made it hardly scary, so it took a few dark scenes where things jumped on you to make it worthwhile. Even these were predictable. <br /> <br /> Not even the bubble could have saved the story, and she can keep up with the gore of the successful thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> When I talk about se7en, I feel Saw was trying to follow Se7en's incredibly intriguing psychological issue, but failed miserably. I was terribly disappointed that there was a lack of analysis and plot structure in terms of the psychology of the killer. The opening scenes tend to make the viewer think that this is a psychological thriller; Believe me, it is far from it. Oh, did I mention bad acting? At first Cary Elwes seems to perform a convincing performance; However, this worsens completely at the most important places of the diagram. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and overplayed, though not as bad as that of Elwes, and the big red flag is that Whannell is also an author of the film. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw could never be made good again because he had lost the entire middle and that makes it a big failure. It was an wasted opportunity, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover have chosen roles in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm mad at myself for wasting money on renting it. The $ 4 was definitely not worth it and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy is not that it lacks the base, but that the big potential action was thrown away and bad action offended the injury. I avoid the bad puns that affect the title and just shut it down: do not watch this movie.
