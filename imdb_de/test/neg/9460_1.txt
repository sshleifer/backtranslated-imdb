Before I saw this movie, I believed that there are two types of bad movies. (1) Your average, totally uninspired rate (ie "Constantine") and (2) the work that is charmingly bad or so bad - it is good (a la "Manos The Hands of Fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore," I know there's a third kind of bad movie: the absolute crap sandwich. This is irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is stunningly executable. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I've hated some movies, but I've never hated a movie so much that my revulsion reached its Thresh-Hold and became selfish. Have you seen a movie that not only regrets having lost the hour you spent watching, but also being sad for an hour or more? Mystery Science Theater JÃ¼nger beware, this is a psychic cinema. Rent "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
