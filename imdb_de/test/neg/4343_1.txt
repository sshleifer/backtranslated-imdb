"This Life" is really as bad as it gets. His cast of mercenary, lustful, reckless, incomprehensible, flat characters is meant to reflect post-1980 attitudes, and I must admit that this is an accurate creation. Unfortunately, I have nothing to start with, and I consider it a further step towards fraud on the premium TV set. surprisingly bad, cheap, reality-saturated television; and other attitudes that have destroyed this medium and indeed much of British society. Sounds exaggerated? I do not think so. In this regard, programs like "This Life" were indeed as influential as they are often called.
