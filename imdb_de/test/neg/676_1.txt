Tyra Banks has to teach this girl that it's not just about being beautiful on the outside. The interior counts for something, too. Many of the recent winners have looked reasonably decent, but are terribly cruel to the other girls and cause trouble. I see Tyra less connected to the girls every season. The only thing worth looking for Top Model is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a candidate who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that her feminine look had uncertainties about her original anatomy. Tyra should have tipped her, or maybe she could have sent Trannie Ms. Jay to help. Instead, the candidate was met with sharp criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first three seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway releases all four seasons on DVD and Top Model only has one season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of rebuilding and a little more humanity.
