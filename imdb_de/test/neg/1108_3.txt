As someone said, the Living Dead Dolls were cute and if they came out as a new set of Wicked trinkets, I would buy one or two. Well, basically this movie was dark, not in the creepy sense, but somehow I can not see that. And it was boring. Three women in a house, the youngest, had said that under no circumstances should she go into the woods (well, that did not go down) and it would have been better if this advice had meant death. And if nobody does a cleansing or whitewash or something, you would think that a lot of coughing would follow. A sexy young mom, wasting her time calculating her age (by my calculations, 34 or 36.). And it looked like it was more than 20 years since someone had lived there older album? I'm so tired of clichés, that's just lazy, and here they come in thick and fast. Teenagers get stoned and drunk in the car and now you know where that leads to ... death and apparent deafness, while Tim does not notice the cries of his friends. I mean, I've already pushed a lot of cars where the instructing driver did not scream and I heard them. Cliché weird man in the forest that nobody believes. A plumber who has been living in them for years, and this is his first experience with the said children, so that he avoids driving the pickaxe in the middle of the night, driving a youngster ... drive over him, you idiot! Cliché ... walking around in the woods without any idea of ​​where you are going, armed with the knowledge that pickaxes that guide kids (yes, they're back) are on the go. Pointless scene the brutalization of pigs ... Why do so many directors see no problem with mutilation and slaughter of animals? I would much rather have seen the children running and people biting their thighs. Zombies do not seem to have that much energy in other films. The bad guy, how ineffective was he? His biggest part was in the shop. They trudged in, demanding to be served first. What a non-eventful man he was. Why do not you kill him earlier, before the family got there, and avoid the movie being made or make it different. I give the house my tracks, the woods and the little goth-dollies that I want!
