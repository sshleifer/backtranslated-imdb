Matthew Aldrich. This is a name that deserves to be remembered. This is the person who used his fingers to go to the keyboard and developed one of the worst scripts of all time. Cliche. Predictable. An insult to public intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only beneficiary of the debt? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this terrible apology for a script and made a movie out of it. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually (or not) read it and decided to play in it. Culpability is abundant. <br /> <br /> This is the Denise Richards of scripts. There are not enough razzies in the universe to realize how horrible this writing really is. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, Samuel Jackson's profession is unbelievably new and the way he is presented is extremely creative, but at the end of the day, it's all a breeze. Pretty ornaments. <br /> <br /> Pack it the way you want it - rubbish is still rubbish.
