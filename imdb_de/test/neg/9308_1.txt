Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - initially had no substance and gets worse with age. This movie proves that he is completely poisonous. We can only hope that this is his last film and that his serious success will reduce his chances of getting funding for future ventures. It's at the top of the list with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saves the World" as the most disgusting example of an Australian comedy you can imagine. How tragic is it that Yahoo, with so many immensely superior comedic talents in Australia, has received such vehicles to express its brand of puerile schoolyard comedy. And to think - he had 7 years to get the script. True genius!
