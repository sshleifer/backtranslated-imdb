This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Ing. Bannister, a woman who not only has the best years behind her, but also a scarred face that makes her look like a freak. In Madrid, a professor she knows has done some experiments on animals with a substance that regenerates cells. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Since the professor dr. Bannister does not allow the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious killer when it comes to keeping her secret a secret. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is great fun, but Piero Vivarelli did not have enough skills and money to earn a cool movie out of it. Also, the movie gets boring after a good start and does not manage to regain a fast pace, even though the movie's running time does not exceed 83 minutes. And while the setting for the last third of the film changes to the Swiss city of Geneva, sometimes it even looks like a vacation movie, seeing how beautiful Geneva is (what it actually is - but it does not help propel the action). ) ..). With a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "Satanik" could have become an obscure Italian classic. But as it is, it's just a dull and boring Crimean movie that's not worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
