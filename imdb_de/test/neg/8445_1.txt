WARNING: I advise anyone who has not yet watched the movie not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie, DO NOT! I'm warning you ... this movie is terribly boring and basically horrible, not the kind of horror movie to watch. I mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when I realized that I made a mistake, I decided to watch this movie anyway. I wish I had not done it. This movie is so obnoxious and so unbearable in any material that I could not bear to let anyone tell me that this movie was reasonably decent. For one thing, this movie should be called "A Boring Talk About Wilderness" instead of Piranha. They only show piranhas ONCE! At the same time, the movie sounded so bad that I got tired after 20 minutes. In the end, my mouth was wide open and I stared blankly at the blank screen. It's a VERY poorly directed and badly filmed piece of garbage that I feared I had a brain dysfunction after seeing it ...
