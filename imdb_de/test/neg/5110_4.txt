From time to time I remember seeing this bizarre fiasco that was a cross between "Whatever happened to Baby Jane", "Sunset Boulevard", the Lana Turner movie "The Big Cube" and the Manson murders , which also took place in 1969, but maybe this so-called "movie" was made! There are already some descriptions of the plot, so I will not go into that. But it's worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody about herself: a babbling, ego-manic, fading actress. Maybe she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the Bette-Davis horrors. Old Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to give it to her. She shows a bit too much meat in this movie, something Davis and Crawford never did. And there's a scene with Miriam in the peculiar Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade that Xmas, 1968, must have filmed. <br/> <br/> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It is shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks. John Garfield, Jr. looks a bit like his dad, but not so interesting. I think one of the three Stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. If it's not one of the Stooges, it's someone. <br /> <br /> I was astonished when I came across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape, given to me by a friend who is so familiar with junk. It is wonderful!!!
