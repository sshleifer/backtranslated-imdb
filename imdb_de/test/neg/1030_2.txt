It seems like if you post here, it will be a 10 star rating, no one seems to like it. Well, I'm honest, some do not like it, but here it goes, the Rachel Ray show is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the snl-type linda whatever, if she has a cooking show. I have to say, I liked Rachel's food network for $ 35- $ 40 a day, but I'm sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day by day, give me ham on the road, Anthony Bourdain, interesting people, but most of all I find them annoying, she actually told a member of the studio audience to "shut up" in a joking way, but shut up, shut up, and who cares about her pet stories?
