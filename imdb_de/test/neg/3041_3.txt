This is so great that you want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, fair and someone is killed. This movie would have been better if you set this attitude. <br /> <br /> Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with friend problems. I do not see any sense in having separated from her boyfriend, which happens in the events in the story. <br /> <br /> Since Jill came home late, her dad sends her to the mandrakis, who are sitting in her nursery glamorous home in a deserted lake. The children sleep and the maid cleans, another empty house for her son, who is in college. OK. <br /> <br /> After running around alone in the house for about half an hour, she gets some problems. Oh, scary. To which her friend comes to find some high school lines about "love" and whatever. Friend goes and goes to her car. Then they drop their keys. Ehh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to pick her up and gets into her car. Which does not start, of course. How clich√© is that ..? So ... she disappears = D Jill, alone again. UH. (Most of the movie is alone with her, so there's not much dialogue.) So more hangups, she calls the police. They say they can not help her, but they call back if she has more problems. Then she suspects that her friend is calling or calling her friends. But they were only once. How should that be a lot scary? Oh, and did I mention that? Her friend is just coming on caller ID and an eerie male voice is ringing. She gets everything freaked out and shyt. <br /> <br /> Yes, so skip that. She sees the light continue in the house of the Mandrakis son. So she runs with music through the forest as a companion and goes inside. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> AH ITS SO BORING I CAN CONTINUE !!!!!!!!!
