One of the reviewers wrote: "Good acting, good special effects, great location." Better yet. " All I can say is "Ugh." This movie was painful to watch. Let me say: I am a Christian who is considered by many people I know to be extremely conservative. So, what I want to say now is not dependent on the <br /> <br /> "Christian content" of the movie. I will not beat it because it's Christian. I'll give it 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. The writing is bad - exaggerated, way too preachy, and a lot of "preacher" is simply irrelevant to the story. It just makes bad writing. Whether I agree with the writer writer's beliefs <br /> <br /> is irrelevant. Make a good script that flows well, stays on course and is credible. The drama was at best amateurish. But hey, if you occupy amateurs, you get amateur performances. Dirk Been may have been on "Survivor," but this show requires zero acting. Playing on his name and reputation to sell units has bad taste. Throw strangers who can act and you have a much better movie. The effects were terrible. The scene with the hail and the subsequent fall of the stars was embarrassing. And what was so great in the end? It did not make sense. Yes, I know what Tim Chey was up to, but it missed the mark. I bought this movie and expected much more based on reviews and the wrong information on its website. And although I had hoped for more, I got what I always get when I see "Christian" films - an undervalued, poorly written, pathetic-looking, poorly-produced piece of Ka-Ka. Maybe someday someone with an end-time movie that was so well written and as good as Gibson's "Passion ..." will finally hit the plate. 2/10 stars.
