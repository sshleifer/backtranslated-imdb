It's really a shame that the script of this movie had more holes than you could shake off with a stick (mixed metaphor intended), because Kinski and Coyote - both extremely talented artists capable of subtle and nuanced ability - have a wonderful one Chemistry and the always provocative Fairuza Balk did not hurt the mix either. Jeremy Piven would have been great, too, if his character (and all the other minor characters) had not been written as a plotter. As for the main proceedings, the writers just did not know how to create the appropriate culpable or innocent suspense for Kinski's character - instead they gave us confusion, contradiction and in the finale the spectators hope - do not mind Claptrap.
