I was just in the cinema in the city center of Prague and saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster I found the old-fashioned heroic style of Holywood. Not because of the high level that reminds me that most of these high-powered French films are usually pathetic. But only because there are not so many movies in my native French in a city like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau's <br /> Cyrano. Then I decided to write this little comment because I think I really disagree with the commentary mainstream on this movie on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The movie just looks like the poster. The <br /> <br /> characters are just as stupid as they look. For a while I thought Adjani was like a caricature - just a funny character to laugh about. No she is not! For example, if she decides to tell Depardieu that she killed the fat she killed at the beginning of the movie, then the violins come in a thick, fat pathetic <br /> <br /> music that makes you cry bring and recognize that Adajani's character is a deeper person, as it looks. Maybe the humor was at 10th grade <br /> <br />, but I'm sorry that my humor is not that high! If I want <br /> <br /> to see a funny French film about World War II, I'll take another look at La Grande <br /> <br /> Vadrouille! It's definitely more fun! I also read on imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine is doing a great job in this movie. I have to say, I have never seen such a bad show! (Well, I've never seen an Ed Woods Wood). Even so, the film is filmed well with many good <br /> <br /> (very expensive) scenes like the Pantheon in the morning when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees settle on down a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker but <br /> <br /> he runs better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. He <br /> <br /> did not have to write the dialogues! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
