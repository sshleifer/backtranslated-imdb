The box is the reason why I originally bought this movie, and the back is the reason why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been cheated. I thought this movie was something like a Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the stupidest I've seen in a long time. The unrated seduces you to look, but will completely disappoint you. The drama was terrible and the sound effects were just gaudy. The budget seemed very low as the whole environment was in the same building. Get out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can not believe that National Lampoon put his name on it. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT RENT IT. Do not waste two hours of your life on it.
