Target is the story of a special agent who, after executing orders to assassinate Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those American "films for men who love mindless nationalist super-patriotic shit films"), returns home to the His ex-wife and two children are taken hostage. Charlie Snow only has a few hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him to get her back. <br /> <br /> This was by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And if there had not been someone I actually (and probably mistakenly) removed from the video store, I would not have seen this huge pile of garbage at first. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like any generic action movie story I've ever seen. In fact, these are the things they show on variety shows, that's how bad it is. I was expecting half of In Living the Colors's "Homey the Clown" when Will Sasso of Mad TV made his Steven Segal impression to jump halfway across the screen to remind them that this was just an exaggeration Action movie was, but now our characters are here to deceive how ridiculous it really is. There were not even good combat or action sequences. With the way things are played, you would not believe that someone was abducted, that there were terrorists, or that there was something remote interesting going on. <br /> <br /> Not only the story is absolutely and absolutely uninteresting, the spectacle is so terribly wooden. Just look at the part in which Stephen Baldwin, as former special agent Charlie Snow, talks to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him they have his wife and answer the phone. She says, "Charlie, help!" or something for that purpose. And Baldwin answers, "It's okay, darling," in such a total way, you think he's read the script and tries to fathom the words phonetically. I can imagine that someone with talent, even though he's such a ridiculously bad movie (one of the bottom 100 on IMDb - a list he should expand to at least 250 movies and contain nearly every Stephen Baldwin movie At least he tried not to burden it so much. Someone. Someone. I could not get past the fact that everyone sounded like reading from a script. Unless that's the only person in the whole fucking movie who has any talent (and therefore should not have been in that role), Mad Wilson's Deborah Wilson. This was the big cheese festival. How embarrassing.
