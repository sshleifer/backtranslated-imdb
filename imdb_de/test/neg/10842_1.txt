This movie seems like someone has a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three fun options, put on a good cast and then turned it over to a really bad scriptwriter and an even worse director. The director filmed a romantic comedy like a dark, artistic film - weird camera angles, blue-filtered shots, lingering and close-ups of raindrops. Steve Zahn was good as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy. He was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock fought bravely with a character who was supposed to be crazy, but whose craziness was kissing a crazy husband, leaving her child, making carnival trips, spending money, and taking a ride with him. The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring It led to potentially funny situations and cut them off before they could develop. To top it off, the "twist" in the end was a slap in the face for anyone looking for a fun romantic comedy. If you've seen the trailer for the movie and liked it the way I did, my advice is: Do not go into the movie. It will only spoil a nice trailer.
