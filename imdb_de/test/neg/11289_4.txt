Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and warlike craziest athlete ever. His baseball career was unique in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure, unadulterated violence. Every game in which he played was a spectacle of human ability and cruelty. In the film about him, of course, it's not about it, but focuses on writing his biography by the author Al Stump. This, in theory, is not so terrible as Cobb has himself been slipping into paranoid dementia over the years and shocking the stories of his crazy outbursts even as a senior even after today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on these events, which I find simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo-fictional road movie with a clich√© and stereotype that makes every knowledgeable Cobb fan cry of vinegar tears. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is good as a busty Cobb, but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervision. Most stories about Cobb are hardly believable, but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, who portrays the writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex of non-existent talent. He sucks the life out of every scene and tries to make this movie his own Nagasaki. There's a reason why we never see him as a leading man again (Arliss does not count, it's hardly a show). Even the persevering, inevitable "role reversal" of Cobb and Stump at the end is exacerbated by his utter inability to utter words that do not sound like a bad book on tape. <br /> <br /> For all the horrible writing and bland filmmaking that is being shown, there is a sequence that is so superior to the rest of this failure that it's almost impossible to accept it from the same movie. A hyper-stylized flashback sequence that shows Cobb's overwhelming psychology and brutal sportiness while the baseball game is actually played is sheer brilliance. The camera moves in a bizarre way, and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of Monster Cobb. Every slide, every hit and every tackle gets even more powerful with the improved sound and Tommy Lee Jones has the intensity of the master player. It lets the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopsy of Cobb in the flower of the same actor. It's worth watching the movie for those incredible few minutes, just to see what could have been. <br /> <br /> I may be a bit unfair to this movie because I know Ty Cobb and want it to be something it is not, but making such a boring, castrated movie about this maniac is nonsensical , I am glad that the career of Ron Shelton slips off since then.
