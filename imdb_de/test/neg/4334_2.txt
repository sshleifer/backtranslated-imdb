The evil Biki gang in this movie was called the Savages, hence the title, but Minor Nuisances would have been a better name for this sad bunch of weak actors who wanted to look dangerous. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they rode their bikes generously, so that the intended victim could easily avoid them or hit their bikes. Their leader had a bad buddy, but still believed he could take in the hero and win. As far as Karen Black was concerned, she did not seem to know where she was for most of the movie.
