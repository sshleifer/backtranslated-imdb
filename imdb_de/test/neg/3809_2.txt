This movie is one of the worst examples of hype. People reading IMDb comments may be tempted to see this total waste of time the way I was, with false markers such as "A Return to the Eighteenth-Century Horror" and "What's Not". This movie is a shit, from acting to directing to history. Terrible, all over the world. And I like GOOD horror movies a lot, I'm not a snob at all. That sucked. As a reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre's The Beginning, The Others, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror, and really hated The Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) Wolf Creek , The Hills Have Eyes (make new) Hostel 1 and 2 and this movie. Gore is not fun or originality.
