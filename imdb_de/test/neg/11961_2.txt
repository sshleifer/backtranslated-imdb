I looked at the first scarecrow movie and did not get it out, even though I knew it was a grade B, it actually had some teeth and the guy who played the scarecrow was a fantastic acrobat and had some good skills. The effects were better and the costume looked much better than in this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this with an open mind, I'm also a fan of Ken Shamrock (former UFC superfight champion) and hoped that it was a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, the movie was shitty, the monster was pathetic in both ways and indeed scary, the plot was as predictable as if you were watching the movie in preview mode I would guess What's going to happen, the music was so bad, with a terrible lip sync song that made me want to hit the screen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this crappy movie altogether. <br /> <br /> Save some money.
