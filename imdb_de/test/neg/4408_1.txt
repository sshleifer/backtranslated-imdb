Did I waste my time? This is a very presumptuous movie. In the beginning you will think there is something going on, but after 30 minutes you will notice that nothing happens. I waited another 20 minutes and was so frustrated that I started reading reviews on IMDb and noticed that the director wasted valuable time with so many people. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring, pointless movie. Stay away. So many good soundtracks. I'll give a point to the police inspector because that worked for me. I laughed a long time, but otherwise a very bad movie. Stay away from 10 am 10.
