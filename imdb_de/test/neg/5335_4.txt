Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and appealing. Here she plays a dying actress. We do not know with what. It is a bit of a precursor to "love story" in this regard. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​good, as is most of the minor cast. John Payne is said to mourn, but he seems to be sleepwalking. The girl who plays the kid he and O'Hara adopt does their best with a fictional plot: Of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live on after the death of her wife. It's a sweet movie, but it does not feel right. I was hoping to be moved. I was from O'Hara's gentle performance. But I do not like to be manipulated.
