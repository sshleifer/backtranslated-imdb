There are many secrets in life. For example: Why did one of the people except Carrot Top agree to appear in this movie? Why did someone distribute this movie? Why did someone pay to see it? I think none of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing is for sure, this movie is one of the worst ever made on such a big budget. It would be bad, but the addition of "humor" from Carrot Top makes it even worse. The only entertainment you can possibly get from this movie is to burn it, smash it, or otherwise destroy it. If you rate it against any movie that has ever been shot, it would be right between "problem child" and "Biodome." Nuff said.
