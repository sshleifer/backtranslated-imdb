.... and now I'm on episode # 7. I was really hoping it would be over now (not to mention the cancellation after all that had to do with the show - including the actors - along with toxic waste landed somewhere on the ocean and never seen again) because this series is really bleak. <br /> <br /> If this program is categorized under the genre "Comedy", this is misleading at best! It's hard to believe that Ben Elton could write such a bad thing. Perhaps this indicates a lot of input from the other authors in everything he has worked with so far. In some episodes I have not even laughed! Oh, and I can not believe that Ardal O'Hanlon really stopped making 'My Hero'. Instead, he began by saying that his decision-making skills were obviously impaired that day - maybe he just can not read and did not know how poor the scripts were for Blessed. Do not get me wrong, "My Hero" is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> And just to annoy me even more, I bet there is a DVD release Well, if there are so many great TV shows that are not going to be released!
