Or at least a forced retirement! This movie is awful, terrible, awful, of rank, rotten, lazy ... well, you have the idea. Do not watch this decaying piece of rubbish unless you have a death wish because it will kill you. (I only survived because I missed the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor. I can not believe that he has made someone to finance this enormous waste of time and money. It only turns out that some people have no qualms when they think they're making a dollar or two (in the truest sense of the word ... I can not imagine that made more than $ 2!) Tell me what kind of motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (a reasonably decent actress, certainly anyhow) had to sign on to that steaming pile of crap. Was she so bored during this 3.5-second dry spell between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or was she the kind of karmic guilt to the most annoying person on the planet's face (also known as the Carrot Top)? <br /> <br /> I give this a 2/10, and that's probably way too high. I try to save my 1 for movies that make me vomit, and since I did not see the whole movie, my stomach contents gratefully stayed behind. I do not think I'll take another look to see if it really is worth a 1!
