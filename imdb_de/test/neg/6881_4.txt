Overall, it was a movie. I did not stop it or stop to come back to it - a clear sign of a boring movie - so it passed the first test. The best part is that it quickly went down in history, no boring, unnecessary backstory for the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never go down as a great movie. Also not as a great B-movie. I would recommend this movie to slasher / horror fans who are not directly concerned with the video releases. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other films, there is no nudity, only moderate language and more muted blood. But there is violence. The deaths were unfortunately rather dry and unimaginative. The computer special effects were actually pretty good. The way the creature moved its chains in some scenes reminded me of "Spawn" and the comic books "Ghost Rider." <br /> <br /> A little animal ... It is located in Lousinia, but nobody seems to speak with any accent. I had to look at the credits to realize that it was shot in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget movies, there are also minor glitches in the filming. Lack of time and money would be the main factors for the absurdities. In one scene, for example, it became black in just a short drive from mid-afternoon. The other example was the stunt double for the "creature" that had not fallen out of the tow truck. Besides, it looks like he wears a shirt in the scene. <br /> <br In summary, I did not hate this movie, but I did not love it too. I'll probably never rent it again, but if a buddy owned it, maybe I'll look at it again in a few years.
