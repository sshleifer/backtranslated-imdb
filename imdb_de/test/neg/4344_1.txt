Normally, I would not hurry to see garbage like that, but because role-playing is a nice hobby, and that was the theme of the movie. It was rubbish in so many ways that I do not know where to start. I prefer to sit through the marathon "Plan 9 from Outer Space" as another minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 had no agenda. How the media could capitulate extremist agenda and represent it irresponsibly is a fact for me. It is a scary time when a whole group of people without defense and without real facts can be beaten without further ado. I know this comment became more social, but it could not be helped because this movie worshiped him. Imagine a pro-Nazi film that is strictly audited according to film specifications. Will not happen As it stands, the people who made this film are themselves Facists and perhaps should move into a communist enclave where propaganda is accepted.
