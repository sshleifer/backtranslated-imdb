To say that this movie is worse than stifling your own diarrhea is a generous understatement. The only thing that is miserable than this reprehensible piece of trash of a movie is the fool who gets paid by the producers to register a bunch of accounts to publish fake reviews. <br /> <br /> If you observe a malfunctioning, uninhibited person, Snoozer from a movie about Sloth of the Goonies kills people in a way that completely ignores any law of physics (pulling on the legs of an uninhibited person, what causes them to be torn off the torso), is your idea of ​​a good movie, then kill yourself. <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life-form with a working backcap would assume in a million eons that this movie is scary or entertaining.
