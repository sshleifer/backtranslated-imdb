I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel to the movie, which did not need a successor. <br /> <br /> Chili is back, but Rene Russo disappeared without a beep. Unfortunately, Chili's game was played in the first film and instead of finding an interesting personal arc for him, they simply let him stand around to repeat lines from the first film. It's pretty lukewarm. Travolta looks old here. It's like moving people around him because his bones creak. His pink lip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very strange. The second bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a music producer for whom she only has to be the female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey, those kids have a great new sound.") In each scene, she hits the wrong note motivating, emotional, or both. It is painful to look at. Despite the many problems Be Cool is getting better after a very promising start. <br /> <br /> I definitely brought out my laughs (Vince Vaughan burned around, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the rock, a-shirt that says "Widow", but it does not have any great memories when No one is as pricelessly idiotic as Gene Hackman in the first film, it's just about doing good in the world, for a few kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the rock) Ho-hum: The first movie was not preaching. <br /> <br /> The work on (repeated) gags and lines from the first movie is annoying, as is the stupid concession to the wrestling fans of the Rock (he raises his eyebrow twice) Droll-Insider jokes: Steven Tyler says, "I'm not the sort of singer who appears in movies." Ar ar. <br /> <br /> The spectacular All-Star Casting is part of the problem The first movie was not charged by "stars". <br /> <br /> For a loan we call it even.
