I saw this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was pretty happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon played. But this is just awful. Oh my God, I do not understand how they dared to tear this classic story apart and make the characters completely different, starting with the move of Beth, the younger sister, and making Amy the third. And Jo, awful, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and somehow angry young woman, and the actress Jo portrays in this movie looks like a stupid and very annoying little girl. And what about Laurie's war? I'm fine with the fact that when a book is made into a movie, some changes have to be made, but not the entire story is rewritten. very bad.
