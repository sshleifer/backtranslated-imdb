"JB" (Jack Black) runs away from home after being beaten by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally makes it to Hollywood and meets the greatest guitarist he has ever heard: "KG" (Kyle Glass). After a bit of a fight, they decide to go to an Open Mic Night in a seemingly less popular bar. They do not do so well to their shock. <br /> <br /> Back in their less than spectacular apartment, the two try to figure out what the legends of the rock have that they do not see while they are looking at some old magazines. Only then do they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same choice. <br /> <br /> When trying to find a similar title, an employee of the music store (Ben Stiller, who is also the film's executive producer) tells him the ancient story of the "Pick of Destiny", after which they are looking for. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the spy made of Satan's tooth is in a history of the Rock Museum. Now the two deadly losers are in for a megalomaniac on a musical adventure to steal the selection. <br /> <br /> Let me say this in advance if you are not a fan of Tenacious D, who gave us the comedy actor Jack Black. You should skip this one. I'm not a fan of those two and just saw it because Flixter.com suggested it. <br /> <br /> The jokes usually create silence more than anything else. I laughed maybe three of the jokes and giggled at some others. Tenacious D is only intended for a certain audience of which I am not. <br /> <br /> This film has been left behind in many places, and here are the worst jokes. And let me say that if Black and Glass do not interact, they will be completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are by Tenacious D. Many of these songs are performed by Tenacious D. Perfectly advance the story by describing their adventures at the time in the movie. However, I had the feeling that the songs sounded too similar to distinguish them. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that the language will turn off a lot of people. There are many four-letter words in this movie. There are also some drug references. I would not recommend this for children. <br /> <br /> Part of Tenacious D's chic is that black is in your face and most of the glass stays in its shadow. That's the way they are in this movie, and it does not really work. Well, maybe that was part of the act, but I had the feeling that Glass just did not want to be there. In one scene, he plays his (background) lyrics at a party and just can not work alone. Tenacious D are supposedly rock fans in real life and may have two rock legends in the movie I lost the count because I was so bored with the movie. Personally, I would like to have seen more rock legends and icons in the movie. We do not get that. <br /> <br /> What we get is a movie full of lame jokes, a lot of indecent language and a lackluster script. You also get horrible spectacles and an unoriginal story. But you get some pretty good songs that sound pretty much the same. <br /> <br /> The story could have been promising, but many scenes seemed to have been filmed at the last minute. This was similar to the Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much larger fan base - and two songs in the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D has only a small fan base with some HBO specials under its belt. And unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not well thought out at all. <br /> <br /> If you're a hardcore fan of Tenacious D, I suggest you try it. Like most of the movie audience when this movie was released, I would say avoid it. Save your money, people.
