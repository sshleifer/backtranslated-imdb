Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important topic and trying to make a great movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: she's so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect, and so is the energy she's constantly radiating, giving credence to the often misapplied term "star." <br /> <br /> The film misses its tracks for a variety of reasons, but above all because of the apparent maladaptiveness of the story that makes it a captivating narrative ... more on that later. The cast at first glance is excellent, but considering that Jessica Lang as a Jewish mother is too Protestant and not exactly right, Ann Hetch does not come close to showing the compassion and devotion of the psychiatrist from the book. How can you? justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? The real problems, however, lie in the construction of the film: first, because he has no lasting sympathy for the Elizabeth Wurtzle character, and secondly, everything about the all-too-common and terrible situation in which this poor girl finds herself Importance is Unfortunately, Lizzy only makes the affected teenage girl the most, but not nearly as ill as she appears in the book. That is a big problem. This story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch. She is only eight or nine years old when her depression starts due to devastating social factors, both of society and of the family. This is a crucial point to awaken not only the right sympathy for her, but also the severity of her case. She is so talented and so vulnerable and dissatisfied that her heart can not help but reach her because of her victimization. This is missing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, you have to accept what the movie is trying to say: it's a biography of a badly affected girl, but it's also a film about a nation who can not get together; This is very clear in the book, but interestingly not in the movie in which the Chosen at Harvard are even more confused than the average college student. After all, the film can not convey these messages convincingly, and that's too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing or a mixed blessing or apparent necessity in a country where so many people can not work without a chemical crutch? These are difficult and challenging concepts to work with, and writing does not really try to appeal to any of them in a more or less appealing way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting picture that symbolizes a dysfunctional America. However, this does not have the effect it has due to crosscutting and insufficient prior development of control issues. Ricci's performance is close-knit, and one of the best in her acting career. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also great in her role.
