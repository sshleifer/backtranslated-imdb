This movie features 2 well-known actors I've liked to see before. There, the actions are great and every action is felt from the heart. However, I think that these two were thrown into a collegiate drama class for the first time and asked one to dominate and restrict themselves in one room to the other without being allowed to leave and the woman really innocent and She was smart enough to make the audience cry for her release. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is the acting ability. The plot has the same cunning as Hitler's influence and I started to hate the protagonist. But all of that, in my opinion, could have been done within 15 minutes. So it was a pure punishment for all who saw it. <br /> <br />
