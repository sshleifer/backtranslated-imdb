I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video "Music". I always think he is funny. (Actually, he really is.) Just last year, I always thought about buying a VCD from Ali G Indahouse. That's why I bought it cheaply a few months later and started looking at it. <br /> <br /> But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I expected this to be a great comedy. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid garbage. It was really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It did not make me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate this movie. By the way, I intend to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was really different from his TV programs in his movie - in such a negative way. Maybe he was not really focused and serious enough to make this movie. Just because there are sex scenes does not mean it's weird (because sometimes too much is not so ridiculous anymore). For the first time I was disappointed with him. That really made me sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually, I really want to give him a 0. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I would not recommend to anyone who wants to see good comedies that are not too explicit or terrible.
