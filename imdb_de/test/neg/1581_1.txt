Wings Hauser and his son Cole Hauser have made a movie about neo-Nazi thugs attacking a gay man and terrorizing a city. Wings plays the hero and his real son is the villain. A relatively low-budget movie that does not have many redemptive features, and for some reason no one has ever seen it! Maybe because it's a pretty ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and the studio has recognized that! Maybe Wings Hauser himself prevented the spread of 'skins' after seeing them! Maybe people just did not want to comment on such a bad movie! Well! In general, I like Wings and Cole as actors, but this was a movie that both had to skip. Wings directed, wrote and was the main actor in "Skins"! An extremely bad and stupid movie! 1/2 from *****
