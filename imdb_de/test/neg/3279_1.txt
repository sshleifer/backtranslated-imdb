The acting was bad and the plot, I do not think there was one. <br /> <br /> A fat blond guy, always dressed in a suit, kidnaps a guy from a nightclub, I think he kills a copper then. then pointless fights will happen Kidnapped girl gets caged on a boat, why? A tough, uncompromising martial artist appears, speaks bad English and does things that do not make sense. It's all a shame. But he has a nice car. Christ on the bike, this movie was a waste of 90 minutes.
