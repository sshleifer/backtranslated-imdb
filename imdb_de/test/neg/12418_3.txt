If you decide to see Wild Rebels, do not expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you are looking for an explanation of the collapse of the American education system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that explores how understaffed police in rural areas face a well-funded, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie that's scene after scene with unintentional humor, horrible drama, paper-thin storyline, and community-theater-style output, Wild Rebels is the movie of choice. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of a heartbroken Stock Car driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a fiery fall (the Rod, though he had only a pair of cotton trousers and a London Fog jacket for protection, gets away with it), Rod decides to give it up. Without having a plan for his future, wandering aimlessly through the back streets of the South, he stumbles across the motorcycle gang of Satan's Angels (a gang that's three of the stupidest guys ever to put on a leather jacket and a woman who they seem to have share). This group of Hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural Florida town by making such atrocities by stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These limping idiots need someone to act as their driver in larger, planned crimes. Apparently, these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to dare that only an experienced stunt driver would be able to keep the car in the middle of a gravel road during a slow chase. Finally, they hold up a bank, get into the low-speed chase mentioned above, and run the lame shootout with the police ever shot on film. I could go on forever, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "it's that bad," but Wild Rebels seems to describe it aptly.
