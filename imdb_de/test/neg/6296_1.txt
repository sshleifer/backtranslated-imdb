I saw this in the cinema on his first release and can only ask, "Has the world gone crazy?" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is overwhelming for this poorly written, embarrassingly predictable gossip. Stephan Elliot is not a brilliant filmmaker, as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since then (see 'Welcome to Woop') Woop ',' Eye of the Beholder ') <br /> <br /> I can only assume that a film dealing with gay / transgender culture assumes that people assume that the aversion to the film is an insult to this sector of the population. Are not we smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Okay, the 3 main characters are fine considering what they need to work with, but this movie contains the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, but not through a dreadful dialogue and a really lame solution a kilometer away. <br /> This is a disappointing movie that does not deserve the deserved reputation it deserves.
