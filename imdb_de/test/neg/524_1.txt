Among the many awards for this production, there was one person who asked for comments on whether he / she was the only one (who was not that enthusiastic) - d. H., This movie has been awarded three stars. However, the commentary pointed out that the story as a whole fell and others were produced. Well, this person is not the "only one" who did not like this production (include me!), But there I even part with him / her. If you put a gun to my head and ask me to decide if you want to shoot me or watch this movie again, I would certainly see it - but I would probably think about it for 10 seconds. But I would prefer to be locked up in solitary confinement or see paint drying on the wall. Also, I do not want to see this story always, everywhere or in an alternate presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's "brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo," and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in one of my favorite movies, "Long Hot Summer," and although I was not a big fan of the show, he enjoyed "Murder, She Wrote." But HERE - I was not just interested in the story or other aspects, I found Angela squeaky, screeching, singing and everything else about her outstanding performance, perhaps the most present presence in a movie (or presentation in other media) that I have ever experienced. It was like an unending sequel to Audrey Hepburn's equally "exaggerated" Cockney Chuckle on Rex Harrison - in the earlier sections of "My Fair Lady." But this was an incident in the plot, which was presented for light, comedic effect and (compassionate) brief exposition. Relentlessly, this was anything but short, and for me it seemed like it would have taken about ten hours (Einstein's layman explained "relativity" at work.) If I had not been to friends, with the need to stay, my looking would have been short. However, I laughed at the episode "Seinfeld" in which Elaine annoys everyone for telling them how much she did not like The English Patient. My friends kind of looked at me the same way as I nervously interrupted their growing about this movie. Instead, give me some fingernails that are drawn aloud over a chalkboard.
