Steven Seagal has made a really boring, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!!!!! ???! This movie has some action scenes, but they are badly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A group of American Nazis is spreading a deadly virus that can wipe out the state of Montana. Wesley (Seagal's character) is desperately trying to find a cure, and that's the story of The Patriot. The Patriot is an extremely boring movie because nothing happens. It's full of boring dialogues and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors. Steven Seagal was totally annoyed in this movie, and I would not recommend this guff to my worst enemy. 3.10
