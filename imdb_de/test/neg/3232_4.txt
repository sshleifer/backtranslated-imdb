Corey Haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to get rid of a giant troll and an OSA hit man (Michael Ironside) with 30/30 and homemade bombs (which are plausible considering Haim) , Oh, he also protects his mother and girlfriend in this observable but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is of course terrible, but the sheer dynamics of the film and the impressive presence of Ironside make this at least modest effect. Nevertheless, the plot is ridiculous and it would have been nicer if we had seen a monster or at least more gore. At least it's something else. It's also quite likely that this movie will be for a while the last teenage movie showing a teenage boy how to build pipe bombs. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
