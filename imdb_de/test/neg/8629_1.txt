I saw this movie after seeing the original "Spoorloos" a few times in anticipation of the frightening end. <br /> <br /> I can not even explain the anger and disappointment that I experienced back then. The end came and went, and the movie had a happy ending. What a waste of time watching this US remake ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, please skip "The Vanishing" and look at the Dutch original "Spoorloos" , The tension is very good. They feel the frustration of Rex looking for traces of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia after she entered a gas station and never returned to his car. The search takes three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he has to agree that he's going through the same thing Saskia has been through. The end leaves you speechless in your chair ...
