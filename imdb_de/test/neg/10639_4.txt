This fourth installment of the series is the last to receive a theatrical release, even though it feels like a direct movie. That's fine, I think, but nothing special. and like in the third movie, there is not much imagination. Even the sentence "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. Directors use the pseudonym if they want nothing to do with the film. Anyway, it's an acceptable movie in the Hellraiser series, but not much else. It's a slight loss of quality from number three and a big drop from the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is 4.5 / 10
