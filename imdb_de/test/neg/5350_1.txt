This film confirms self-righteousness! It gives a black man the freedom that killed the men who raped his daughter, and in the end he gets rid of Scat-free! As despicable as it is, there is adultery in this film as well. The Connaughey character has a penchant for the Bullock character, and the film has some of these stereotypes of test films (like the important news that has recently been brought to court) that make any aesthetically-demanding visitor like me sick! I really can not believe that someone liked this rubbish. It's a movie that is so bad and holds false ideals that I can not address my critic in an eloquent way. When will the Americans wake up and learn that they are being manipulated around the clock by films like these that turn reality into a BS where justice is for all if they just take it in hand? This cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes represents everything that is wrong with America!
