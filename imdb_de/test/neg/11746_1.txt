OK, first of all, who in the mind would make Hitchcock new, and second, who would shoot it? I admit, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. The original psycho is one of my favorite movies, and it seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I looked at it because my friend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed for less than five minutes that it was awful. First, as I said, they shot it. Where is originality? Why make a movie that is almost perfect, just like the first time? Why make such a movie first? If you want to do something new, do something that does not work and make it even better! <br /> <br /> Second, they used exactly the same script from the 1960s version. The dialogue does not work anymore. It works well and sounds perfect for the 1960s version, but seems strangely and stilted to come from modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch did not write the script, you could have rewritten it. <br /> <br /> This film had a very good talent and was wasted by imitating the original actor. The actor who played the car salesman just seemed to be playing John Anderson's original car sales. All the actors seemed to be the only direction given to them were the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn seemed a bit more sinister than Anthony Perkins, but you lose the sympathy you should have for Norman. Masturbating on Norman as he undressed Marion went too far and lost the innocence of the character that Tony Perkins has so well captured in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline. Her lines were more desperate than young and funny as Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the movie was that Gus Van Sant could open the film with the shot Hitch had envisioned. Hitch wanted to go with a long shot over Phoenix, but could not. Therefore, he had to settle for a series of shots that had split across. This movie filled this vision with a helicopter shot shooting through the window of the hotel. After that, the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful movie, take a look at it, but do not look at it BEFORE looking at the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been green. Stick to the master's movie, not the imitation.
