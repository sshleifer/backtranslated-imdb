It's hard to say what I should say about this boring and boring little movie. The story is predictable, if not completely ridiculous. It is all about "dutiful gestures", which, as shown here, are absolutely not convinced. Yes, MGM's "production values" are beautiful, and yes, Mrs. Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that made this parade of stereotypes all that effective ... I understand that this movie received bad reviews when it was originally published; The timing has not improved.
