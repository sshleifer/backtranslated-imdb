I appreciate satire that runs counter to my own views, but it has to be witty and well placed. This movie is ... how can I explain that? It does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety, let alone intelligence. In fact, it's hardly a horror. Dead soldiers come to life, but they are not interested in brains, only in voting booths. Why? Cue a never ending stream of the most idiotic, mundane, inflated windbag raves of "evil president, evil conservatives, evil republicans". What a smug, snotty corncorn piece of pig manure this was. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "points" of the episode, only the stupidest liberals would say they liked it. On the other hand, it is a big task in itself to attribute a certain amount of stupidity to the crazy, angry, hostile, antisocial and against anything halfway normal liberal spectrum.
