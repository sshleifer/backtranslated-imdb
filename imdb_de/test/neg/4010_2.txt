This pointless movie was a complete disappointment. None of the characters are in the least sympathetic so you can watch what falls on everyone without really worrying about it. The worst part was renting the movie in gay possession, only to find that the story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men involved in numerous scenes of direct sex rather than a single scene of gay sex.
