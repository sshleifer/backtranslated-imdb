A curious, deliberately twisted biography of Dyan Thomas, in which we hear a little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we must undergo a raw character exposure, which is seen through the prism of his proto-bigam relationship with Ms. (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to vaccinate against his otherwise repugnant self-interest, and Cillian Murphy makes the stubbornly tense love. <br /> <br /> The film never seems to decide where to go. There is no more arch than a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems to be much more interested in his two female leads (who would not do that?) Than the man who brings them together and then shares them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best, but then I never thought her sympathetic), but both offer awfully inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny choices are too much for the inconsistent character of William (Murphy), the artistic production (eg double transitions), which is neither impressionistic nor symbolic, and the old chestnut act from historical footage that does not merge. 4.10
