It is said that this is the first Polish Western written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY in the US, this film uses some strange images to tell a story that has few dialogues. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some awkward visual situations are sickly weird. My favorite is a young man who builds gallows on one of his own fingers and actually hangs out to test the strength of the rope. A cowboy known only as the stranger (Karel Roden) finds a dead man (Kilmer) whom he believes to be a wanted man. He takes him to the next town to get the bonus. In the end, he loses the corpse and the potential bounty in a gamble with the city's drunken sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and lets the few citizens dodge him when he's involved with the barmaid (Katarzyna Figura). He manages to escape certain death and leads the small group on a dangerous "wild goose hunt". In one scene, the stranger tilts to a scalp wound by chewing with gunpowder and a match. The corpse rots on a saddle post as the sheriff finds out that there is no reward. Also known as SUMMER LOVE, this movie features a haunting theme song sung by John Davidson. Nevertheless, this Western looks like a train wreck. There is only something that tells you not to look, but you do.
