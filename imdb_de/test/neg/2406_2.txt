This movie is worse than Cat People, which I saw in the same week. It's all 80s style. MTV punk rockers, the real ones who are not social, not today's commercial PC guy, comrades, and a bad guy named Splater. I really like Splater, and the movie feels like the 80s light is blue, but the rest looks like a cheap Canadian Schlop. I've seen so much of it while living in this great country, and realize that these films were made for tax relief. Avoid at all costs.
