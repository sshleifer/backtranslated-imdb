This film was a low point for both Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. The main plot points come directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Upon a Time in the West" (published two years earlier and also includes Robards): A man finds a water hole in the desert In each direction he plans to "station" around the hole to build around it and to make sure that there is a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. Add to that an immoderate preacher, bad music, stupid, fast action shots, even darker T & A shots - and off you go. It is little questionable why it failed at the box office. The real question is "how did it come to this?".
