The premise of this film seems to be that the death of the second generation of World War II in America, with its apple-like phonetics and hypocritical morals, was a terrible tragedy. These terrible hippies seem to have ruined everything. <br /> <br /> What holds the film together are the outstanding performances - especially that of Lemmon is really remarkable. Otherwise, we have a boring piece of drama of life (just over 24 hours of Jack's life) with claims. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to go through.
