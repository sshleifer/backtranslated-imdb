I have seen many - possibly too many direct videos, no budget Slasher movies, and have developed a taste for the "good" or the less annoying, as ridiculous as it sounds, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, that's what I like to call ... absolute crap. Nothing is pleasing - the acting sucks, the characters suck, the killer sucks, the gusset is minimal ... and sucks. It's about a group of college friends driving to a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the children. It's meant to be a relaxing retreat, but they barely know that a dying former plastic surgeon and his two assistants are looking for useful tissue to rescue the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper, as he drives around on a motorcycle and of course chops. This is just a horrible movie that is worthy of no time. Enough said.
