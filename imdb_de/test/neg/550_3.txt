The last part of the Karate Kid series is predictable, poorly handled, and borders on the enjoyable. But not quite, it's just bad. This episode lacks the Karate Kid by Ralph Macchio, who has already been in too many episodes. The new kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Miyogi's World War II. Her parents died recently and her grandmother unsuccessfully tries to raise this young hell. In steps, Mr. Miyogi, to get things right. The formula shows that there is a group of neo-fascist tyrants, the alpha troops that need to be replaced, and a new karate movement, the praying mantis. As I said, this movie is a mess and should be avoided.
