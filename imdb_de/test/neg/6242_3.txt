Now I know why this movie can be bought in the video stores so cheap. I was curious because it had three big stars, but it was one of the "B" movies that apparently can not reveal the video! The answer is, it's a movie that would appeal to a very limited audience: a crowd over 50 years old with very liberal sensibilities. Anyone else seeing Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe, and Helen Mirren essentially provides a basic message that "cheating on your wife is okay as long as you still love her." This is the beautiful "feel good message" here, especially at the end of this strange abduction story. Who wrote this script ... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "weird" because the kidnapper is the most beautiful hijacker (Dafoe) you've ever seen, except at the end. He dissolves his hostage (Redford) frequently, which no kidnapper could risk, occasionally talks about family matters, etc. It's all ridiculous! Well, the Times says it's "an intelligent thriller". Ha ha. Well, that confirms what most people know about the L.A. Times. For those of you who believe that and have not seen it, I will not spoil it with more gigantic holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is, it's an insult to anyone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can not fool all people constantly, as critics have yet to find out. Here's another movie they rightfully bombarded at the box office and in the video store.
