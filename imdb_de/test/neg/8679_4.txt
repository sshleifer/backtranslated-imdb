This fine-production movie contains secrets and how friends relate to each other. Henry May Long is a well-functioning, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century piece about a friendship between a dying man and a melancholy, indecent junkie. Talky drama is not my thing, and all the crying is thin. Recommended if you prefer independent, crafty, intellectual, slow Merchant Ivory features. <br /> <br /> I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimate that they did not really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain'. There are some good lyrics with a scene discussing the disappearance of life, but it is really a dark and depressing movie.
