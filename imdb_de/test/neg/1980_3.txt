I was dizzy with girlish joy when I heard about this movie shortly after seeing Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After years of anticipation, they gave a release date in November 2005. Well, November came. And went. Followed by December. Oh, look, today, January 31, 2006. No release in the US yet. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm so glad I had a friend with a subtitled subtitle copy. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, the CG was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I flinched at the unnatural movements of the children throughout the movie. I thought we had done that now. I was not interested in the anime look that was given to their faces. I got the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look of the movie, and yet most of the characters have more than normal eyes, especially the girls' characters. They had a personality, but I give them that. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of anime, I have to say I was impressed by the wild fighting scenes. They were beautifully animated and left me hanging on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> For about the first two. <br /> <br /> And that's where Advent Children's biggest mistake lies. It's usually just a bunch of hyper-styled battle scenes. <br /> <br /> An epic FF7 sequel had been promised for years. Instead, they gave us a pretty piece of CG with almost no action to excuse the running time of just under two hours. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this film falls into disrepair. They do not really get to know the characters. The only way to understand most of what happened in the movie would have been if you had played the game. We barely saw them before dealing with the current threat. <br /> <br /> What arouses the fans even more is the terrible cameos that the majority of FF7 characters have given. They were nothing but Clouds "I call when I need you, but I probably will not support singers". And to add to the pain, they had to throw each character's Cloud up and up one at a time. This little part was so cheesy that I nearly turned it off. I would have been all the more impressed if he'd just jumped on his own and bounce off the walls to go up-just weird relief. That was good for the game, but that's cinema. In a tough battle, people do not behave like cartoon characters. They took away their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And, spoilers (yes, most of you already know it). Who remembers Darth Maul, who was pushed up in SW: Episode 1? Yes, imagine that, but with Sephiroth. Right. He had maybe 5 minutes left. Maybe that. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was made for the fans, then move on to Square. If this is an indication of the direction you are taking in the FF series, I doubt you will see much of my money. I have played your games for the wonderful story and the outstanding characters. <br /> <br /> You had the chance to do something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece that faces all Disney CG movies. Instead, you've given us a pretty piece of meat that has hardly anything under it to hold it together. Keep it up. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to pay attention to everything, except on the CG they would know what I'm talking about. Well, I would rate this at 5/10, but after thinking about it, when I did it right, I give him a 3/10 because they could have done better. You have done better. And that's just sad. <br /> <br /> If they remake anything FFVII, they have to do this first.
