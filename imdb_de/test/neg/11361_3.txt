I do not understand why some of you (or many) rated this movie 8 out of 10 stars. Sure, that may be a zombie strip with a little splatter, but that's it. I'm not a hatred in zombie movies, but that was terrible. Actually, I should rather call it zombie soap, because that's the acting. Production is ... well, okay. Hardly an attempt at action development, terrible spectacle, stupid effects, clich√©s and an abrupt end. Go ahead and like zombie movies, but never give them over 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you should see this movie is to laugh. Serious.
