The only reason why I did not judge this movie terribly is because I feel that he was such a horrible movie in every way that he deserves at least 2/10; for not trying. <br /> <br /> The action is the least of your worries as you are hit in the face of the top language and scenes like "the singing asshole" in a bad attempt of shock and disgust. The main purpose of this film is to shock, and the main part of the film has not achieved this. The last scene makes it disgusting to erase the memory of this frighteningly pointless film and achieve its goal of being the dirtiest movie ever. A really low-budget movie, terrible act and dialogue terrifyingly bad. <br /> <br /> I really give 0/10 !!!
