Brodzki's creation is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. First there was a book with great humor. Book that has a lot of fans who would like to help if, for some reason, producers have decided to hire people who have not heard the book at all. Then came a script that was as humorless and as meaningless as possible. At the same time, the script was written in such a way that only those who actually read the books could understand something of the conspiracy. Not that anything in this movie made any sense anyway (eg, "I'm like a shard of ice, you can burn yourself," Yennefer said as a warning - warning that this movie lacks logic, which he seriously lacks). In addition, regardless of the amount of money supposedly spent on the film, it all looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes look like they're in a really poor theater. That's the better one that looks like this. And there are a few "naked scenes" that are only shown in the film, because they have no explanation for what you can call compassionate as a plot. The film has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest - music is not bad. If I had to decide, I would rather have it separately. It sounds better if you do not have to look at this failure of super production.
