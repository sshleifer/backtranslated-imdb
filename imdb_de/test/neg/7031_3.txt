Did we all see the same movie? I can not believe that the raves give some of the others this really horrible biography that, believe or not, was authorized by Shirley Temple herself, based on her book CHILD STAR. It makes me feel that some are terribly easy to satisfy. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, whatever their modest talents are, in no way resembles the shape or figure of Shirley Temple enough to act as an actor in this kind of straightforward biography of the most famous child star World. She gives no indication of why or how this child was so worshiped, unless she made every effort to make a Shirley impersonator who does not click on any level. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> And that's the biggest handicap of the whole piece. But as if that were not bad enough, any drama inherent in Shirley's story of her ascent to an almost overnight celebrity, with bland lettering and occasional song and dance moments, did not even come close to what Shirley did ( For example, "The Codfish Ball" starring Buddy Ebsen, who was probably the culmination of Shirley's choreographed dance routines.) When you put a girl in a polka-dot dress, she does not turn off her Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's own brand of charm, warmth and charm is even suggested remotely. All we see is a pale imitation of the original proving once and for all that there was only one Shirley temple. <br /> <br /> It's worthless to keep writing about this mess. None of the others is more than usual in lifeless roles. My tip for fans of Shirley is to read their book - or, even better, watch their movies. <br /> <br /> This is the pit.
