Despite the All-Star cast, this epic attempt fails. It looks like a series of flat comic stereotypes strung together by an overly canny social commentary. <br /> <br /> It's as if the author would look out at every dialogue and introduction to a new character and say, "Is not that wise? Am I not smart? Is not that a snappy social comment?" And unfortunately the answer is always "ummmm ... no". Lavish, self-sucking stuff that is more like a soap opera (in the worst sense of the word) than a movie ... and an obvious attempt at immortality on television. Luckily, it died young. Empire Falls falls flat.
