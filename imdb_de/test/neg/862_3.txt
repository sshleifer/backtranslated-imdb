"Tweety's S.O.S", which was opened with some blatantly re-used footage from "Kit for Cat," can not do justice to this classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series in their most general form. Unlike Chuck Jones' Road Runner series, which sought to introduce new jokes into the same environment, Freleng's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different location. "Tweety's S.O.S" basically means "let's put her on a boat this time". It is not a very weak cartoon. There are some good jokes, mostly with grandma's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags that you can see when you come a mile away (the seasickness courses), and all will lead to another end where someone else says Tweety : "I tawt I did taw a putty," a joke that once worked well, but the yields wore off. 'Tweety's S.O.S' will probably appeal to kids who enjoy virtually every cartoon, but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags, this is definitely one to avoid.
