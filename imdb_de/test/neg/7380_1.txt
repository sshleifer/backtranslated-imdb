If you had asked me a month ago what this movie looked like, I would probably have skipped most of it, but I'm a fan and as a fan I often go to the movie sites well when Super Troopers came out on DVD and was addictive, it is difficult to stay there, but the good ones are usually like good families holding together. What a story this comedy / comedy troupe has. To come to people to watch movies on street corners, universities, anywhere they can, and all for nothing, and to build up a great following after all these years, decide to close the website that helped them and for the fans but the worst part was ... they did not say anything about them. They just decided that they are better than us. They want new fans, not the fans who helped them get where they are ... They know the same fans they begged years ago. Still, the smart crew, they've released the best movie with Super Troopers, and caught the attention of everyone and thank God, because then they sucked with everything else. Good for you to become mainstream. Remember, if you find your material is not that good and you have no new fans, you are the ones who shook off the original fans. FANS MAKE YOU IF YOU ARE NOT THE OTHER WAY. Never burn your bridges
