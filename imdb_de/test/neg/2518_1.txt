Like most people, I saw this movie after listening to Patton Oswalt. Strangely, it was easier to find than I thought. It should not come as a surprise, however, that I used it. <br /> <br /> The plot is masterfully summarized in the title. It is a bed that eats. Not more, not less. There are efforts to make a story, but not very good ones. <br /> <br /> The blood of a demon landed on a bed and is thereby possessed. It devours everything that happens to it by absorbing it and then dissolving it into a seemingly orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but fell ill and ended up behind a painting in his room. The narrative is completely told by him. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible at everything, even if it's bad. Nevertheless, it is not without its own charm.
