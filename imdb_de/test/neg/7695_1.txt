Total shame! Really terrible! The script and the dialogue are a joke and combined with a director who has no idea about life in Saudi Arabia. It's no surprise, a pretty Saudi film, the director is Palestinian-Canadian, the writer is Lebanese, the lead actress is Jordanian, and filming took place in Dubai instead of Saudi society. Yes, it does contain some Saudi clich√©s, the stuff we see in the daily cartoons in the papers, but it's about everything. The film had the opportunity to present a real problem with Saudi society, or at least to convey something new and genuine about the problems and concerns of the youngsters in Saudi Arabia, instead copying and inserting from here and there, and that Result was a mess. Even the alleged love story in the film does not exist or at least we did not see it. The only good side to this total debacle is a good play by the supporting cast. The veteran Khaled Sami was funny in a badly written role as a grandfather, which he was clearly abused because he looks younger than the actor who plays his son. The actor who plays the role of the fanatic brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, did a good job as well, he was actually the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast, as pros for a long time, had a good job, but the lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just bad. He had a look at a small, charming Bobby in all situations. He could not even say his lines correctly. He has charisma that earned him the title of Star Academy, a well-known reality show, and he's good at interviewing and watching TV, but he was only the weakest link in the movie. The lead actress did not bother me, but even in some scenes she did not beat well and unnecessarily exaggerated her sensuality. <br /> <br /> The film was a great success, Saudi Arabia poured into neighboring Bahrain by the thousands and Dubai participated in it when it was shown there and it made a sound out of money, then it became shown in per-view, then on TV, and that was in a few weeks. This should Saudis zeal for domestic entertainment, but unfortunately; The film was neither native nor entertaining.
