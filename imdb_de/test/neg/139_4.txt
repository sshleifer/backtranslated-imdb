When I was young, I got up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons, but to turn on the local channel for the so-called "kung-fu theater." It was not like these films were works of art. It was not like these films were all from China, Japan, Korea or any particular country. if the story had to do with fighting? Be it swordfighting or punches? and if the struggles in American gymnastics did not look like much, that was good enough. It was not like they were really good. It was just great action flicks with unbelievably over-dramatic music, where the hero took his revenge on a number of bad guys and then rolled the credits. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" is very similar to these films from my youth, a bit of a thematic setback in the face of a welcome twist, so confusing the characters that it gets harder and harder for the evil of to distinguish the good. Yun (Cho Jae Hyun.)) Is known throughout the kingdom as "the human butcher". He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun dynasty, the supreme bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the lives of his men in exchange for his service. An equally merciless rebel and his loving sidekick appear on the land and begin assassinating Imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find and kill these rebels. His mission becomes a personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Sword" does not have much to offer different from other action movies. Some stunning cinematographies are almost wasted on inferior editing, and parts of the film are so loosely pieced together that it's hard to believe that what inevitably came to film was what everyone was up to. While the atmosphere and the story tend to be dark, the sound is almost sacrificed to the endless parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters gets a healthy story arc. What should actually be a fast and easy action movie is burdened by way too much personal luggage, and the movie suffers. <br /> <br /> I read that this film represents Korea's first real push into the world of arthouse action pieces along "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Next time, I would strongly suggest that the producers spend a little more "martial" and less "art".
