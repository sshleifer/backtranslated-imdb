Can anyone give me a reason why only one American dies in this movie, and if he does, it should be a very emotional scene, but if the Operation Delta Force team hundreds of Russians in slow-motion scenes or thousands of Arabs, too in slow-motion action scenes, you should cheer and say, "Take that, you non-American monster!". I know that I've often used "slow motion action scenes", but that's because every action scene in this movie is in slow motion. Every last one of them ... And this squad should be called "Invincible Slow-Motion Bullet-Dodging Force" because they seem to have supernatural powers that help them avoid bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have a sort of regeneration superpower, which is all it takes to kill the entire non-American army that stands between them and victory. At this point, nobody cares anymore since they were brought to sleep by another ridiculous slow motion action scene. What I've done ... The cast is made up of unknown actors who are likely to remain unknown as they do not even play characters. They just play guys with guns (and let's not forget superpowers) ... The only feature is that the special effects for a TV movie are surprisingly not so bad (even though they're in slow motion) still sucks ... and at the same time is it so bad that it is good ... OK, maybe it will be a bit boring in the end ... <br /> <br /> 25%
