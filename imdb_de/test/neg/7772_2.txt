Lazy writing, bad acting, and wooden directing lead us to a television movie produced in Canada in 2005 called HUSH, which should not be confused with about eight other films bearing the same name. Tori Spelling and her doctor go from SanFran to his little hometown, where they meet his old friend who decides that she still loves him. She becomes pregnant with Tori's baby (does not ask) and beats down anyone who could stand in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame. The actors who play the old friend and the doctor are not worth mentioning because they seem flatter than flat. Tori is not much better, but at least she's something she needs to focus on as the plot winds its way here and there before coming to a very lame and all-too-familiar conclusion. Instead, look THE HAND THAT FOLLOWS THE WAVE.
