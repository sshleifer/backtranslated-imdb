I participated in a screening of this film. Travolta came to the end of the film to questions and answers. It was a small projection room in Tribeca. Out of courtesy, I did not go out what I wanted. This is the worst-case movie. Starting the script was poorly written. The writer writes in one voice. The dialogue was stilted and clich√©d. How this author / director, Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta, and Lions Gate Entertainment managed to support this, is the only brilliant result she has achieved in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie to all aspiring screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. Because if you are told that you are wasting your time and it is impossible to achieve your goals. Hey ... look at that crap and tell yourself ... if they can do that, anything is possible. <br /> <br /> PS- Travolta had a great question and answer, although ... he felt well, spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy. The director / writer stood on the sidelines. When John tried to engage them in the conversation, she stepped back like a piece of wood and never joined. I looked at her and thought ... how could this person "beat" agents, studio teams and top talent ... if she can not open her mouth at a screening of her own movie. The conclusion of some of us was that she needs to have strong family relationships in the business. After watching this, head over to Guy Ritchie's Zero Star Masterpiece "Swept Away" with the most unwanted funny and worst performance of Madonna Madonna. She is so bad and looks so bad in this movie. I think that was her way of getting her back to her for all the abuses he suffered from home.
