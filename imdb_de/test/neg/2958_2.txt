The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two freakish servants coming from Paris to New Orleans. Apparently her mother was involved in a scandal years ago, and Ingrid returned to provoke the relatives who had earlier forgotten that her mother existed. That's because they have reasons, if they're shocked enough they'll pay them to get rid of them. Then with this money she will leave New Orleans and look elsewhere for a millionaire posing as a countess. On the way there, Gary Cooper appears and seems to be completely out of place for love interests. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that this film was not the reason that Ingrid Bergman's film career collapsed - her performance and her character were so bad! Instead of the noble and reserved woman she usually plays in movies, she's probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie. Her fake Contessa was flat, demanding, unpredictable and stupefly stupid. How she was able to vamp EVERY man seemed to be a mystery because she looked less vampy than just nuts !! I'm not exaggerating saying that sometimes she behaved like someone with a combination of a serious mental illness and a personality disorder, and all of this together makes me think, "Who in the world would fall in love with this mess ?!" , Honestly, I could not stand watching her histrionics and her narcissistic behavior, and she looked more like a guest on the "The Jerry Springer Show" than a lead actress! Confusing, terrible and exaggerated are words that come to mind when I think about their role. The rest of the cast is, frankly, overwhelmed by Bergman's cries and hysterics. While Gary Cooper is generally an excellent leader, he is dominated by her and just looks lost. And strangely, they're throwing out two complete comedies as entourages - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Ms. Robson is best known for her portrayals of Queen Elizabeth I, but for some strange reason, they covered her with make-up, and the end result looked like the love child of a cigar shop Indian and Aunt Jemima! Her face was very wooden, she had strange eyebrows and dressed like a slave. He was a dwarf with respect to Mr. Austin, and although this was not to be held against him, his role was written like a court jester - a very ungrateful role for someone "vertically challenged"! All in all, the lazy spectacle, the writing and the slack alignment is one of the big stinkers of the time - almost as meaningless and boring as the famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
