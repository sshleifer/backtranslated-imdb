STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) spends his time in tow dragging the local police and trying to Romanize a member of the police staff. Everything changes, however, when the landlady of the Thames Side pub he visits is found murdered and a copy of an unpublished novel is found with the confession of the legendary writer Charles Dickens.

Jacobi's side by side roles as a former trampoline and Dickens talking directly to the camera are obviously allusions to something and the script is predictable in other areas as well. In addition, Brendan Foley has made a first impression. <br /> <br /> What exactly had I expected with something delivered with The Daily Mail for free? *
