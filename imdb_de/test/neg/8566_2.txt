The only good thing about this movie is the final twist. In 97 minutes of film, we can save only one idea that was totally wasted in this movie, I must say! For more than 90 minutes, this film is just a collection of clich√©s, bad drama, stupid ideas and revelations, utter tension-free, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a miserable and unoriginal act? until the last three minutes, where FINALLY a good idea appeared! It's not something out of the ordinary or a very original idea, but at least a "decent" good idea, the only one the entire movie has! I will not spoil it, but I have to say that with a better plot, better effects, and definitely better acting, this idea would become a good movie. If you can see this movie and endure to the end, will you know what it is?
