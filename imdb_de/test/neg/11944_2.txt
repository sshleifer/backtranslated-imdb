I was reluctant to see this movie because I really enjoyed the original "Mostly Martha". What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but that was not her movie. The original had poignant moments, perfect with an incredible soundtrack. No reservations felt like it was never connected. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. In Mostly Martha, the food came alive - every scene was filmed so that you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - we rarely got a close-up of the preparation; The characters were not real enough to wear the movie without him. It was hard to finish the movie - many scenes felt awkward. Look at the original - it's a really nice movie. the soundtrack incredible.
