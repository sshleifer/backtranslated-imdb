OK, I saw this movie through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie, so I thought I'd leave a comment. I just love how Joe gets stuck in the dirty roles, while his brother and nephew get the Oscar winning roles straight and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call a movie that should be good. It seemed like the director and the actor were just taking the movie very seriously and looking very cheesy, a story that did not make much sense, let alone damn acting skills. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes. Quite simply, because many of the things they talk about are thought throughout the movie, and I'll explain why in a nutshell. Natalie and Zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to get things done. But with Zach in the upper class and Natalie in the middle class, it just will not work. But on the way home, she and Zach's friends get into a car accident and now the Death Angel / Soultaker is after him to reach his quota of watering. But it also seems like he has a different life relationship with Natalie and just does not seem to move any further. Now, Natalie and Zach must defend themselves against the ever-appearing five million times a minute to save their souls and their lives. I wonder if Black Sabbith was wrong either. Basically, there are many storylines in these films, so no one can see the characters and they can not be killed. Still, can they still push buttons and open doors? The angel of death had a very strange face and distracted a bit from the story. Soultaker was just a lousy movie that was rash and made you feel so bad for Joe, the undervalued brother of Sheen / Estovez. <br /> <br /> 2/10
