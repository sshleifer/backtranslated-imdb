I really like Harrison Ford so I've eagerly rented this movie just to be disappointed by the minute. Mr. Ford seemed to be running through very warm water, looking for a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had the better lines. The story fascinated me, but the mistake - BIG MISTAKE - because everyone is identified by a driver's license or passport before boarding an American airliner, has raised many questions to ask. <br /> <br /> I could not have cared less about these people. In fact, the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed in Miami on the first class. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the director Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie and other films. This is a waste of time and energy.
