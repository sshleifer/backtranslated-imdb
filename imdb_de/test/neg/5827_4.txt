I saw Winnies Heffalump a few days ago. A beautiful story based on familiar characters from A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger, and Rabbit are featured in this animated feature, this time around, the main character is Roo. He befriends the frightening Heffalump, who turns out not to be scary at all and shows everyone that friendship knows no bounds and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and I would love it even more if I was 10 or 15 years younger. Unfortunately, I would like to become a child again to enjoy this Heffalump story much more, but all I have left is a feeling of grief over the loss of a kind of childhood and innocence of which this film is full. I was glad to hear Carly Simon sing, Joel McNeely delivered a great score.
