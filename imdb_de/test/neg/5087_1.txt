Apart from the beautiful pictures of the New Zealand cameraman Alun Bollinger this film is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The plot is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what's going on at any time. Just when you think you're following, the direction changes again, just like a lost bipolar doggie. <br /> <br /> The score is awful and relies too much on extremely emotional parts that try to force the audience to feel a certain way, as if the instruments acted as a queuing sheet for emotions? "feel sad here"; 'feel shocked here'; "To be afraid" In addition, the repeated samples that are used over and over again leave the audience laughing. <br /> <br /> Gone are the days of silent film when musical instruments were the only representation of the voice? But you would not think while you saw River Queen. <br /> <br /> The voice-over has been exploited so much that you have to wonder if this movie really needs any accompaniment. It could easily have been a radio play, though even then it would be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the stolen ideas of Jane Campion's The Piano are too obvious to miss. The beach and forest shots are not only almost identical to those in The Piano? Maybe it's up to Alun Bollinger's camera work on the latter? But also the voice over feeling and the levels are strikingly close. And who could forget when Holly Hunter's figure pruned her wings by severing her index finger from Sam Neill? Does it remind you when Wiremu has amputated his 'trigger finger' and surprisingly with an ax too? I thought so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can not recommend watching this movie, unless you wear earmuffs and just go out into the countryside.
