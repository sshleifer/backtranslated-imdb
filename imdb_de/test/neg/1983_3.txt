I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I saw this movie because I heard that there are autobiographical aspects in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbols such as a piano sinking in a river, or strange silhouettes on the walls. Then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "A child sells fortune, but his box is now empty." This is really disturbing and not really necessary because everyone understands what this film is all about. The film shows how Kinski's figure treated the woman and how he controlled her. If there really are some aspects of Kinski's life in this story, then he was really a pig. So there's no need to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinski naked or, if you like, laugh in sick trash movies.
