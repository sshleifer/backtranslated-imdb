Thank God I was fast-forwarding. I think this is a movie about a man who goes up and down. Whatever: It's a stupid clich√©. It makes no difference. There's this guy, Javier Bardem, building buildings or something. It does not matter. He's pretty, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there's a car wreck, but I watched it fast, so who cares? Car wrecks and pretty heroes who fight back, smell like a melodrama to me. Javier likes someone, but marries Maria de Madeiros instead. She is beautiful, poetically beautiful and has a heart-shaped face. Then Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who for some reason washes her vulva first. You'd think Maribel Verdu would be sexy with her hand-washed vulva. No she is not. This is a boring story about a group of people who do not interest me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have a threesome: how boring. This movie is annoying. I think this could be a small THEME of (some) Spanish-language films: the rise and the predictable case of a small man who succeeds against the odds. Let me make it clear: This is a first-class melodrama or a soap opera. It's not worth your time except for a laugh.
