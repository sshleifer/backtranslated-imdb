Luther the Geek (1990) is a boring horror movie and really bad even for Troma's standards !! It's about a freak who bites the heads of chickens and kills people by rubbing his neck, and he actually believes that he is a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because he was obviously an "exemplary" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is VERY hard to believe after seeing how he treats and treats people throughout the film ). <br /> <br After killing an elderly lady in a supermarket parking garage, he manages to sneak into a woman's car and continues to drive her, her daughter, and the daughters' friend to their family home in the country torture. <br /> <br /> Then we get a boring and boring movie, with terrible actors, before a useless policeman shows up trying to kill Luther once and for all. Oh and the movie has a ridiculous and ridiculous ending !!! I love low-budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is a classic but I'm afraid Luther the Geek is just boring, illogical and boring and that's about it! 3.10
