The third in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) making Vigilante to avenge the thugs who murdered his old buddy. I do not know why this movie made me, but somehow it did. I saw myself forced to Bronson to wipe the floor with these punks. Every time he blew away one of them, I felt good. This movie is not serious, but what if he did? The fireworks finale, in which Bronson rages, is well structured. But when it comes to acting and action, it simply can not keep up. If I lived in this area, I would come out as soon as possible, but it seems people are asking for trouble. I know that there is this mentality we need to save our roads, but there is a limit here. I had to give him a 4. Sure, there are good "Blow'em" scenes, but that's about it. At the time, Bronson was 64 years old. I'm sure if these guys really wanted, they could prevail with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This movie gives you a sense of pleasure. The simple man can save the neighborhood, save the day. In summary, this is anything but the original death wish, but it's pretty good if you're only looking for shootings after an hour and a half.
