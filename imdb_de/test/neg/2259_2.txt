This movie was NOTHING like the book. I think the scriptwriter wanted to have the assignment to write the sequel to Gone with the Wind and was rejected. This was his or her way of bringing in their ideas anyway. The only similarity between this film and the story he portrayed was the names of the main characters and the location of the main action. None of the events shown in the film have been done that way in the book. For a Gone with the Wind fanatic (of both the book and the movie) this was deeply disappointing. If you loved the book Scarlett, do not watch this movie in the hope that it will be played on screen. They only share the title together.
