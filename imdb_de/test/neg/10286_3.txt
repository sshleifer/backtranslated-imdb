If you find the portrayal of violent murders and wanton police brutality in a glacier-speed, film-less movie that's entertaining, then Surveillance will definitely appeal to you. This movie was garbage for mind and soul. The idea that this is a "thriller" is funny; that would mean a kind of tension and distortions. They have always been waiting for the story to actually "get started". It never rises above a glorification of feeble-minded perpetrators and individuals from all walks of life. Imagine the violence of "No Country for Old Men" without any kind of persecution or sympathetic characters. Nervenkiller run amok. Acting is mostly good, but the script is a bunch. Do not bother and tell your friends that you should not bother.
