I will not lie, I rented this movie because it was an "arty" movie with possibly explicit sex. I got this scene and Catherine Deneuve's (just shown) breasts, but the rest of the movie is just the usual long-lasting European art film with lines like "Do I have a mother or a father, I do not know" (paraphrased). Usually delivered in long monologies. <br /> <br /> If you're curious about the transition from "art" to pornography, an interesting look at using the fast-forward button (I was still too slow!) might be interesting.
