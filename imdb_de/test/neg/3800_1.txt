Misery. Talk about botched. ABOUT THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every way. The Savior Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug. They are challenged by the ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang of machine guns. In this part, Part Remake, Caine, Malden and ANOTHER have a group of Poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous hike out of the sinking ship. This group includes Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely you wish you would be blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly disturbing as a passenger aboard Caines tug. <br /> <br /> Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced it, he also decided to direct it.
