I'm still wondering why I've eaten the whole thing. There was only about 3 minutes of entertainment, the rest was just a boredom. Acting is not great and the action scenes are so cheesy that it's not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can not think of anything at the moment. There have probably been some things that some can enjoy, but the end of it must be the stupidest idea ever. Which guy would get a remotely controlled toy helicopter with a branded machine gun to assassinate the president? That idea could never have come first, let alone someone stupid enough to give it a try. I think the writer had to be obsessed with the toy car scene in The Dead Pool.
