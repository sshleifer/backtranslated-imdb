Here's a movie that clearly insists on appearing as Exotica to an audience unfamiliar with its theme. <br /> <br /> An attempted hybrid of fiction and documentary, "Kadosh," falls awkwardly between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor enlightening. In order to realize his sloppy handling of details, one need not go further than the opening scene, where it is obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to properly put his T'filin on. Generally, the boring presentation of red-style details (in this case, a Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of a handbook, not a good documentary. The latter should provide an organizing principle (a figure, if you will) for the viewer so that he can emerge with a better understanding of the seen. This is obviously not the case here, as ultra-orthodox rituals become even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job of verbally explaining everything during the film campaign. kinematic, however, this is a serious stammer. On the other hand, it suffers from the flatness of character, the simplicity of the conspiracy and the dullness of the message as a fictional feature. In some places, I felt like I saw a cartoon. (For example, the wedding scenes finale scene - without going into details on angles, positions, and dimensions ... technically, this could not possibly be a realistic representation of the human sex, as fierce as it may be.) <br /> <br / > There are no subtleties in this film. The clever manipulation of allusions that inspire the viewer's imagination and actively participating in the cinema text, which I believe is a good trait, is completely absent. On the contrary, when I saw the movie, sometimes I felt force-fed, with the same, already chewed and far too obvious content. Indeed, as director Gitai himself put it in an interview, it is an architectural "shifting of objects in space" that then colors the scenes with the appropriate emotions when needed, and propels the action on its appropriate and predictable track ; but the spark, this creative, duende-like, dark, inarticulate spark (one must not forget that "Kadosh" is probably a tragedy) casting the spell on a two-dimensional screen that makes it an extension of the viewer's world disappeared without a trace. Perhaps a work of a visual engineer, perhaps an uncomplicated ideologue; definitely not from a true filmmaker. What I saw was a passion play for animated themes and not for real people with flesh and complexity. Acting, by and large, has not overcome this directorlessness of an idea that was (sometimes even tormented) forced into the film. A notable, though relatively insignificant, exception was the Mikve Lady and Mother, both played by the excellent and experienced Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It takes more than strict adherence to a formula for success (namely, a dose of exoticism plus a heart-rending but simple melodrama plus a popular agenda (preferably politically correct) to spark my interests.) The bottom line is that That I was bored for a significant part of the movie, despite the novel, perhaps even a pioneering effort to use an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a movie backdrop for which Mr. Gitai and his crew deserved praise, I found "Kadosh" by the way also Nadosh (Hebrew for "trite").
