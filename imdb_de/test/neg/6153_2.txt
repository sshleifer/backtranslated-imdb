Impressive !! I did not even know anything about this movie until I searched for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better left unknown. Mark Hamill's role is quite limited. I would compare his appearance in this movie to all the performances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in these nasty horror B movies of the 60s and 70s. In these films, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. A memorable play by Mark with such great lines as "Do not try to run, you're under arrest." Did I mention that he EXACTLY says this thing more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a Uzumaki spiral of drug and alcohol after aliens because he ended up in a violent session in this movie after he woke up on the set. The HAIR .. the HAIR !!! .. Priceless bill. Actually, actually "GAME OVER" should have been for Bill ... but somehow ... he got treatment ... and then went better ??? Movies. This movie is blowing. It's boring and boring than The Crazies. At least the movie was crazy ... that's just boring. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM.
