Everyone loves to see a really bad movie someday. You look at it, laugh well and forget about it in the next half hour. But that's not one of them. It's the worst thing that appears for a while before your eyes. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see someone take on Dante's responsibility - he's really the stupidest villain you can think of: a man in leather pants who speaks with one voice and a victory laugh like a Dracula of the '50s Has. How could anyone come up with this guy? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... my cereal box has better acting skills than him (maybe all), that's incredible. But the worst thing is the fight scenes, where you think something could be in there. You are so lame, you can not describe that. It's no shame, I just can not believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. But I'm just thrilled that it was like this. Watching this is a self mutilating pleasure. Only see this if you are looking for pain in the movie, and in that case, this is a sure winner.
