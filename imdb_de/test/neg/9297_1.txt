Comedy? What's so fun watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic who was anonymous to alcoholics for 6 sessions (up to the time I shut him off)? Start with a sad script of grunts and marbles and drunken slurries. Another reviewer mentioned Tea Leone's "Sassy Dialogue" - well, I was able to watch almost an hour of this boring movie and have not seen any sassy so far - in fact, my 80th did not -aged grandmother comical comebacks than tees character in this garbage. Tea is rather stony and shows less emotion than Keanu - in fact, one wonders if she too is not addicted to anything - maybe Botox's face is so wooden? Save yourself from being killed with boredom from this movie.
