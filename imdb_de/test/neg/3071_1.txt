Anyone reading these comments might think we could have a great movie in hand. I am Portuguese and ashamed that this film became a blockbuster in Portugal. It can not really call this cinema. The direction and "Mise-en-scene" is basic (even Ron Howard is better!); the script is bad and overbearing (a really bad Tarantino); The cast is filled with TV stars, models and reality show stars who are not involved in acting. Of course, if you publish these ingredients in a movie, the fans of this type of TV show will see it all. I'm also surprised that people posting comments here in IMDb say this movie is a masterpiece. I thought this site is for people who really like the cinema and understand a bit of it. All the movies that become a blockbuster in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always terrible. If you think that this movie is appropriate, please do not say your love movies and your cinema.
