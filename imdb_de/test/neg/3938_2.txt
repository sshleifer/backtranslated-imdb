Good idea ... shame about the actual movie. Did it want to be a bit more scary and more about the characters and who exactly the bad woman was? If she tortured these children, why did they help her kill and not help others? It's a bit run down by Malcolm in the middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would benefit from some longer use and more detail with the characters, though after about an hour I wondered when it would be over !! <br /> <br /> If it had been better if the real characters who killed them were not computer-controlled in reality, it would somehow make them look crap. And what happened to the Frankie Munitz figure? He fell into a bed of wild roses, so it should have been safe, but the computer game showed him over as a game, ie dead. Next, he appears with this irritating blond girl to rescue the guy who is afraid of the fire, who, I noticed, had no qualms about turning the lighter over when the demon lady was after him !! Too many inconsistencies in this movie To really enjoy it, you'll need to think twice about playing the new computer game.
