I have to admit that I'm at a disadvantage here. If I learn more about a movie from other reviewers than from myself, that's a problem. Although the plot of "The Man Who Knows Too Much" generally seems simple, the movie admits too many cryptic elements that could stand in the way of a satisfying mystery. When we get to the scene where a funny-looking woman introduces the secrecy of "the first degree of the sevenfold ray," I did not know if I should laugh or rewind to see if I missed something. <br /> <In hindsight, the cryptic message retrieved from the grip of a shaving brush by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) was a cleverly written message that led to a dentist named Barbor and finally to Albert Hall, a place not a person like specified by "A. Hall". Despite all the intrigues, it was never clear why the attack was shot down. Okay, Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plan to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Come to think about it, why was the note even written in the shaving brush and secured? Does Bernard have to refer to it now and then to remember what would happen? <br /> <br /> With its disjointed scenes, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is hard to follow and a little confusing. However, I give Alfred Hitchcock recognition for these early efforts. For the perspective, I have to see some of his other works from the same era, though this film certainly can not overshadow his later works like "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
