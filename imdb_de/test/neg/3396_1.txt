This is my opinion on this film, expressed in his dialogues. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I can not say that this movie is a bad moment, but I did not enjoy it either. <br /> <br /> At first I was just indifferent and could not go into the world of monkeys. Although the make-up is very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. May the movie have changed monkeys against cats, and this is a cult movie for me regarding my preference for the latter. The second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of newcomers Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is in a big British mansion: No matter how luxurious it is, it was like a prison to me. <br /> <br /> Finally, could it be good tailoring the story of the Burroughs of Tarzan? I do not know that I've never read the book (or seen Disney). <br /> <br /> Finally, I have no good moments to remember, so one look at me is enough. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freezing called "Overture" ... What does the meaning mean? Only the director knows.
