A moderately interesting beginning, some pretty scenes in 16th-century Japan and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison, which occurs after about fifteen minutes, is "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death". Really. A specialist in "Oriental History" who does not speak Japanese, goes on tatami without taking off her shoes, and is generally stupid like celery? You're welcome. It looks like a student movie: The sets are ready to shoot, the acting (except perhaps for the title character) close to wood, the plot completely arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! This is best seen with someone who knows something about Japan, just to see unbelief creep over his face repeatedly.
