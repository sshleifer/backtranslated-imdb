** SPOILERS ** If the title of the movie twice has the name of the killer, you would not expect them to attack in action when they bite, tear and eat almost anyone in the cast of characters. Instead, you have to wait until the movie is almost over to get a look at the piranahs. All you see is the water that seethes and moves as a poor person disappears underneath, provided he is eaten by the fish whole and alive. <br /> <br /> The movie "Piranha Piranha" starts with scary-looking piranha on the screen as the credits begin to roll down, but **** SPOILER **** is the only time in the movie that You ever see the killers or fish you never see, a piranha is the movie again. What you see is a travelogue on Venezuela and its people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon basin. Along with many beautiful and stunning photographs of the landscape as well as humans and wildlife, but that's all. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of story related to this great White Hunter Caribe. William Smith, which ironically means piranha in the mother tongue spoken there, was the title of the movie "Piranha Piranha" really meant that way? "Caribe Caribe"! The person Caribe is played by the legendary Hollywood Hell's Angles biker and the all around tough guy William Smith. At the beginning of the movie this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown & Ahna Capri and their American tour guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, are on their way to the Venezuelan jungle to do sightseeing with Terry, after photos Home to send. Terry is scared of guns when we learn that a young girl saw her father blowing her head off a gun. Even as Art saves her life by using one when she sees a six-foot Diamondback rattlesnake that Terry almost straps for a gun; He promised her that he would not take him on the trip. At a jungle rest area or in a bar, the three meet Caribe, who had caught monkeys in the jungle at the start of the movie. Caribe is more than welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy of life and death, as well as his ability to take them where they can get to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon Basin. <Br /> <br /> Even if it's a bit strange at first, the guy is so in himself that he does not seem to notice that there are people around him. Caribe turns out to be a swelling and likeable guy who engages a long time and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and the jungle with Art. Caribe shows even Terry, who had almost knocked on the teeth at a certain time in the film, the finer points of the hunt and the Shooting game that he believes will not really die but become part of him after he kills her! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this guy has imagination. <br /> <br /> It's much later in the movie that, for some strange reason, it was perhaps the cheap liquor he drank. Caribe suddenly goes insane and is assassinated, attacking and raping Terry and then murdering her angry brother and feeding him to the deadly piranhas. When he tries to escape the raging madman and then has to be forced to deal with him, Art is so brutally beaten up by the dirty-fighting Caribe that he is almost unconscious. Just as Caribe is about to kill Art, Terry shot him dead. After learning what this insane nut job is all about, he finally decided that weapons are really necessary and should be used to kill in very rare but lifesaving cases. Worth seeing, if at all, just for the countryside and nothing else. It's just a shame that the movie must advertise as Killerbisch or Piranha, a horror movie, if he were honest, it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure movie with Smith. He has the build for it, plays Tarzan from the Venezuelan, not African jungle
