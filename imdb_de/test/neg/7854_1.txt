I'm a fan of good historical fiction, and I loved the idea that someone would take and shoot a well-written series of books. Writing scripts is not like writing normal fictions, but if you have a book to customize, it would be nice to follow the plot line. <br /> <br /> The depictions of the Vespasians (the real Emperor and his) 2 sons Titus and Domitian) were terrible. They behaved like a cookie cutter Caligula and were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation. There was a scene in which Titus did justice as if he were Caligula (from the movie of the same name). The manner in which the Vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follows the reports of the historians writing in that period - them were fair and healthy, not stained by the imperial imperial madness. Helena (the love interest of Marcus Didius Falco) claims that he was a traitor as a reason for the divorce of Pertinax (one of the traitors named in the title). However, in the books, it was because he ignored her, and she felt that it would be better to marry someone who valued her as a person. Marcus gets a slave in the movie called Justus, but in the books he could hardly afford, let alone a slave. There was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slaves Justus and a gladiator ... <br /> <br /> If you want to have good cookie cutters with Roman stereotypes, then get Caligula if you want good novels from classic history Viewpoint, I'll get, Claudius.
