This must be one of the worst movies I have seen. I tried to like this movie, but they managed to screw up just about every aspect of the movie! Cheap dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough history to take you, no action, except for some really cheap scenes. It seems like they tried a few things on the set and said to each other, "Hey, that looks pretty cool, why do not we put that in?" and returned to Cola snuff or something. When it comes to acting, I think that the only person who tried to make the film is Daan Schuurman, but in the end everything is in vain. Cause of this movie SUCKS !! 2.10
