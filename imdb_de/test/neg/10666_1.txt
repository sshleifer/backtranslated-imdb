I've been watching movies for the past 10 years, and I have to say that I never felt so bad about what I felt when watching this extra large movie. There were songs and songs. Nobody should see this movie. The director has shown German that they speak English, which is so nonsense. Germans do not speak English. In one scene, there was a white girl asking Himesh for an autograph. (Obv, that he must have given her some money) In the promo, they prepared for Laughing Riot. But I could say that there was only one scene where Himesh laughed for no reason. Maybe he thinks he is funny. Hansika is very good. She is like an angel. But too young only 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and do not know what to do, you should watch this movie or its waste of money
