This could have been a good movie if more was explained. Far too many action holes to find this pleasant. The ending is especially outside the field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper get back to Dundee so fast and Dundee arrive in the house in two minutes? Get out of nowhere. How did Anna get the money? No explanation at all. If Pete, the cop, knew Lancaster was in danger, why did not he have a policeman at the door in the hospital? These and many more questions remain. Pity, because the premise was there, just bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> Good litter is wasted here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad? Lancaster's character lacks development, and Dureya is just the "bad guy." <br /> <br /> This could be restored with a coherent storyline and better writing. Of course it would be much more violent with a lot of free sex and everything. The editing would be jerky, I think, so let's stay alone enough.
