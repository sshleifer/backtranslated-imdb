I really hoped for the best with this one, but it just did not happen. Very Dutch-funded and still looks great, with a style and pace very similar to Hollywood. What I do not understand is how - with all these great advantages - the director, author and producer have managed to make this film a completely horrific picture. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who just can not really speak in English. Kudo for pulling through, but what did this guy think!
