... but not these! I always wanted to know what happened next. We'll never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and could not have been rejected by the movie. I have compared "Scarlett" to the original GWTW because any movie worthy of following GWTW needs to be at the same level of quality as the first one. Rhett was beautifully staffed, although NO ONE can never be compared to Mr. Gable. I am also a strict Vivien Leigh fan !! She was Scarlett. She adjusted the bill. No other actress will wear the same shoes in this or that life, but with "Scarlett" the work could have been done better. It was not enough to think, to find the right Scarlett, that was obvious. <br /> <br /> Overall to see something, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest writing it yourself or finding a fan fiction. This movie is not worth the time.
