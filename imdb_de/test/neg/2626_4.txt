"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama set in the World War II Japanese POW camp bearing this name. History alternates between past events and today when veterans plan to reunite. This is a much publicized and controversial miniseries here in Australia. The budget ran over ($ 6.5 million); Historians and veterans criticized his authenticity; and critics praised the unpleasant mix of comedy and drama ("Pearl Harbor"). Serial author John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G. comedy team) has tried to defend himself with comments: "The characters are made up of real people"; "the troops used a comedy to deal with the situation"; "it is based only on actual events"; "One of our actors was actually there", etc. I have no problem with any of these issues. Many great fictional and factual dramas are from the Japanese P.O.W. Camp Experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Paradise Road", "Kingdom of the Sun", "Blood Oath" and "A Town Like." Alice. "Black comedy has often been used successfully in POW dramas:" Life is Beautiful, "" The Great Escape, "" Seven Beauties, "" Stalag 17, "" The Colditz Story, "and even" Hogan's Heroes. "Why is "Changi" a monumental failure? - The drama in "Changi" is consistently excellent, the music and cinematography are good - it is the writing and the direction that left it in. Each scene seemed to me waves of Deja Vu When Anthony Hayes was put in the blazing sun, I thought, "Did not I see Alec Guinness in 'Bridge on the River Kwai'?" The sudden lightning in surreal song & dance brought Dennis Potter's "Singing Detective" Back, but without the finesse, this loan was so often that it smelled more like casual writing of cut and paste than homage, and the constant connection between the stories of the past and the present never made me focus on both d and Flash Back can be a useful tool - here I have distanced myself from the characters who needed intensity. The "ausiness" is exaggerated - every conversation seemed to contain "Stone the Bloody Crows" and so I said "I understand, I know that they are Aussies". Cultural stereotyping also extended to the British and Japanese - radical young Japanese officer; reticent British officer; smarter Japanese commander; fun-loving, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I was watching "Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai". After 3 episodes I turn off.
