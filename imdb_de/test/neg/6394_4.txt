I saw this in the theater a few decades ago, and the fuzzy memory suggests that I liked it. When you see it for the second time, you notice two things: (1) very bad acting by Michelle Johnson and (2) very bad music. <br /> <br /> It's not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was fine, but the theme song and others that influenced it recalled the worst pop music of the 80s. Johnson's voice seemed to be wrong, possibly synchronized. That was distracting. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) it's interesting to see such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better and (4) Johnson looked quite captivating at various stages of captivity.
