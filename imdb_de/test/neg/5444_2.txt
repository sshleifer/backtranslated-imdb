"Congo" does not try to restore the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is, the book was not great either. The movie's first problem, however, is that the character was added by Tim Curry. The second problem is that the talking arm has been added. The main problem, however, is that the actors do not create realistic characters. I guarantee you that with this movie you will not think that there are killer gorillas all over the world. Also with Laura Linney (Happy Birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I suspect they do not want to highlight this movie in their CVs.
