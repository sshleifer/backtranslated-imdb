The authors do not know anything about Russian prisons, the movie is absolutely cockamamie and has nothing to do with reality. They also do not know that the foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison, so foreigners NEVER live with Russian criminals. The uniforms in this movie look like they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia do not work outside the prison. Every murder in the Russian prison is the subject of investigations, so the prisoners only kill themselves for important reasons. Football is also banned in prisons, contacts between the prisoners are very limited, no chance for bloody fights, etc., etc. So this movie has nothing in common with reality.
