I overcame Mandy Lane about an hour ago and felt the need to come home right away and come here to warn anyone who would spend his money on the DVD - NOT. The supporting characters are flat, the failure of acting is higher than that of Matthew McConaughey's films, and to the end the plot is far from obvious. In nine out of ten cases you will see the next scene 5 minutes before the start. The whole movie is more or less without a motive or message, and the half-revealing portrayal of "the killer" simply makes the slightest interest that you might have left at that point. What could have saved this flat, boring film is a decent splatter, or at least Gore, who is worthy of the genre "Slasher" - he fails there, too. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party you can jump in and out without missing out on anything. I recommend buying All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you sit down and actually want to focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I will not.
