This is one of those movies you see because it's bad. Such a movie you are watching right now to see how shabby the craftsmanship is. Probably a horror, I can not imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation flaw, especially one that is translucent in nature and sees the actor's legs behind it. <br /> <br /> A little bit of budget without attention The attention to detail as well as the attempt to make this film credible would have sucked the fun because they had to replace all the actors and the entire story with it. If I had not made fun of it during the game, I would have finished it after 10 minutes and showed a quality show like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR). <br /> <br /> I can only warmly recommend that Brett Piper pump out Quintin Terrantino and really some feces. <br /> <br /> :)
