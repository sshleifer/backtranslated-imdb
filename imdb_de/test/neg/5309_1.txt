I rarely give ratings below 5, but in that case I have to weigh myself up. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogues and invigorating action changes. Films based on his books include Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez). Even if this is the case, the films have at least a certain amount of story essence. This one here .... it just is not a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad (I do not know why, because these people are very capable here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are miscast. <br /> <br /> Since Elmore Leonard is a truly great storyteller, I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would not be advised to read his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories. <br /> <br /> The story is a continuation of Get Shorty. If you have not seen this movie, do not look at it. If you've seen Get Shorty, do not continue with this step. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a couple of years ago and I visited the video again tonight. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dark this sequel was. Luckily I do not believe less of those who have appeared in this movie. You probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and a lot of fun. I almost always like Travolta, but it's so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the previous Get Shorty. He obviously could not enjoy what was going on here. <br /> <br /> And I hear that Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, will be released for 2008. I hope they can do it. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all great.
