Okay, Herc is a guy ... but the rest of the 3 hours was wasted, wasted ... oh mankind! The poor Sean Astin had to wait for his master on the same hills of New Zealand ...! Could it be? Someone in the production crew of Lord of the Rings shot home videos in his free time! Yes that's it! <br /> <br /> I wish I could at least say that he was promising. <br /> <br /> The special effects were often ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Herc was a big hunk. <br /> <br /> NH
