I'm usually quite tolerant of movies and very easy to talk to, but this movie was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after it was seen on the cover that William Zabka was in it (The Karate Kid Bad Boy) and during that movie I could see that this was the only reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is a huge waste of the talent of the actors. The music and the sound are awfully cheesy - I could not believe it for a movie from the 90s! <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend this movie if you are not interested in any of the actors.
