In order to make such a terrible movie, he would actually have to participate! Actually, I'm embarrassed that I've eaten the whole thing. It looks like an old science fiction movie from the 80s, with fake-looking "special effects", queer images and very kitschy dialogue. Maybe they wanted it to look like that, maybe they think it's cool to make 80s-style movies as if they were returning in style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think that the promised eye candy will save the movie, you will be disappointed - the so-called "babes" are crazy and downright ugly. They can not act at all, I do not understand why they could not at least get good-looking chicks if they want to have babeseless talents! But I think if you make such a stupid movie, you do not have a very good choice. Hot girls are not just ready for this pathetic crap!
