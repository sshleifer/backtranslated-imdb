Just explore the genesis of this movie. Something as simple as a Google search. It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the elections. It's a great idea, but I'd rather see a DOCUMENTATION, not something edited by the Bush administration and told of its reality. The timing of the release of the film, its tone and the fact that MS & L has promoted it raises questions about the intention of the film. "According to MS & L CEO Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues are deliberately sending specific constituencies about the Iraq war," wrote Eartha Melzer. "Was the left-wing Kunsthaus audience of one of these constituencies? Has the government hired documentary filmmakers to propagandize the US population? No one involved in the film is willing to say who first raised the money for the film or how he was portrayed by the army's PR company. "
