I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago. I thought I had encountered an unknown gem as it had Val Kilmer in a truly unique role. Unfortunately, I did not have more than ten or fifteen minutes to realize that this was an epic catastrophe. The first hint that this movie is really terrible is about to start when you have a pile of dirt bags in an old salon that laughs like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that's about five times too long. It's unbelievable how bad it is. And unfortunately it does not get better. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmer is prominently featured on the cover box of the film, perhaps to make her play a role in the movie, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is in favor of focusing on miss a few half-sinners and the most inappropriate conceptualization of a unique city sheriff I've ever seen in a movie. It was played by Boguslaw Linda, who can not or does not disregard his Polish accent, making it impossible for the movie to be played in the American West. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have this kind of borderline past? I dont know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strength, but I can tell you: The sheriff, as he is called in the film, is the worst prosecution I can ever remember in a movie. He is presented in a truly ridiculous scene in which he wears a blindfold and alternately slaps a room full of men in the face. Before they start beating him, he declares that they can beat him once, and then they will beat him again after the first round, and if he can find out who is beating them, they lose. What the hell is this crap? I'm completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this could ever be included in a movie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the sheriff appears more and more beaten and bruised, drunk and battered, until at last he does nothing but appear occasionally, stumbles on the screen and murmurs "not without". "The law?" "You see, there's a lot of talk and preparation for a hangover, the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It happens to be in a city that's not anymore As two dilapidated wooden houses facing each other on a flattened piece of earth that is more of a path than a road, I understand that this is part of Poland that should be acceptable enough like the American Southwest, where possibly none of the figures Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was fascinated by his unique role and the minimal commitment of director Uklanski for relying on a timely juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages . <br /> <br /> Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> For me Kilimer does not seem to be able to overcome the truly satisfying feeling, d he must have gotten when the role was offered to him. Personally, I really feel I have achieved some degree of success when someone comes up to me and probably offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lie for a while. I like to think that he did not even read the script for this mess, because if so, I would be completely at a loss to understand why he accepted the role. In any case, the film opens with a man bringing the body of a man, played by Kilmer, looking for a reward. Soon he is involved in a ridiculous love story involving the city prostitute, the alcoholic, and many chaos involving a series of stupid, stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also a far-reaching and absurd lack of understanding for American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and puts half of Kilmer's eyes in his eyes (for whatever reason, I can not imagine), and later a man gives a short speech about Kilmer's body, in which he explains that was "one of the best men we've ever had," and then he continues to lift his head off with a shovel. What the hell?? <br /> <br /> Not convinced yet? Here are some reasons why you should not look at it. In one scene, the sheriff seems to be covered in ashes except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that soaks his head and body with blood. In a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Clever. Towards the end, the sheriff seems to have broken an arm. Sitting at the bar, he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm. He pulls on the rope with his good arm and raises his trembling beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth instead of using his good arm drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why does not he just use his good arm? I have no idea. That does not make sense like everything else in the film, like the title. Summer love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, here something for the IMDb Goofs page? <br /> <br /> Error of characters (possibly intentional mistakes of filmmakers): This movie was made. HA!
