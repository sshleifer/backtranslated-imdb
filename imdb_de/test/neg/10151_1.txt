I love kitschy horror movies, I find dead and alive and the bad taste is great, and I think the slaughter party massacre II (which is not even related to this movie) is weird. But this movie absolutely stunk, I did not laugh, I did not even enjoy it. You can see all sorts of mistakes that are not even camping. The best shot of the scene where the woman is leaning out of the window is where she pokes her head on the windowsill? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not let it be thought that it is related to the slumber party massacre series. It's awful and I do not even have a clue how it came to distribution. Rent it with a false name and burn it, do the favor of everyone else.
