Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was in one word "crazy". Now I doubt if the guy has ever seen it, so I would not put it in a word. Disgusting, absurd, um, disgusting would do it. Every time you think it can not get dirtier, it does. One of my special "favorites" was when Divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to crush her, they were slaughtered and eaten by the guests , I admit that it is one of those films that is so grotesque that you just can not look the other way, but this is not a creative work of art. It is a pure shock. <br /> <br /> On the other side, the Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.
