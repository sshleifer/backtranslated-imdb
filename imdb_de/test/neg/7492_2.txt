Which garbage, is there really no part II? If this movie actually ends the way it did, everyone involved in the movie should be ashamed. This movie is not near a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This movie was rushed in the hope of earning a few easy bucks. I started watching the movie on the assumption that it would be bad, but I never thought it would be so bad. This film was nothing more than a way to use the fears of the American people for profit! If you have not seen this movie, do not bother. The movie is full of badly developed characters and bad acting. I really hope that the production of this film lasted only a few weeks. Stay away! Do not be fooled by the hype!
