Until around 1970, Lucille Ball was a big comedy. She was such a perfect clown, I just wish more people saw her with "Bob Hope" in "The Facts of Life" because she could also do dry water. as well as slapstick .. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was wonderful. , , until "Mame." <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible, as there is so much vaseline on the already-filtered lenses that you need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. Even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can not really see Lucille Ball in "Mame". What a blessing is. <br /> <br /> That's the nicest thing I can say about "Mame", the movie of the musical of the film of the play (that could go on, but it started with an absolutely funny movie) book titled "Aunt Mame "). If you make this a bad rap, it's like hitting a sponge. So it does not matter that the music croaks rather than being sung. Most of the songs were not much anyway. There is no difference in the first three. "It's Today", "Open a New Window" and "We Need a Little Christmas" are all the same song. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and boring. The killer ballad "If he's gone into my life today" needs a confident, beautiful voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy in 1967), which poor Lucille Ball did not have when she made that movie. (Correctly, Elaine Stritch can not carry a melody in a bucket either, but at least Stritch can dub a song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life is not complete, if you do not See the movie musical "Mame". Notice how DANCING dances there. However, if Lucy / Mame starts something other than a palsied shuffle, the camera cuts and returns immediately when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers. Again it is just as good. Jane Connell could repeat the role of the miserable Agnes Gooch after Madeline Kahn was shot by Lucille Ball to make sure that no weird originality put the star in the limelight. Connell is a stage artist who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, can not limit her performances for films, which makes her embarrassing to Lucille Ball, albeit for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> The lavish dresses are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and they provide the color that is missing in all but one of the performers. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Mames best friend, ignores everyone and does her own funny thing. If only she were in more scenes. She is also too old for her role, but at least she did not mutilate her.
