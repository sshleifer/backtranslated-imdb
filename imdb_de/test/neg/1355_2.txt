As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatical movie lover, I made a terrible mistake. I've seen "The Women", the remake of one of my favorites ever. I have seen the original many times, in fact I own it. My urge for the remake was based on Diane English, the responsible woman for Murphy Brown. My opinion, however, was: how bad can it be? She needs to know what she is doing. I do not know what to say. I do not understand what happened. The Botoxed women are a pretty depressing affair. Meg Ryan or whoever played Mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress wearing perhaps a Meg Ryan mask - she does not give the character anything of what Norma Shearer did in 1939 , The new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. The "friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing and Jada Pinket Smith are as unconnected as anything I've ever seen, and if that were not enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character that Joan Crawford in one of her best and funniest Performances was created. Eva Mendes casting is really the poster boy for how wrong it was, how bad this commercial attempt came up. I have not paid any respect to Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
