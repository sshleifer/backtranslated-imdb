From the fertile imagination that brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983) comes from an even more absurd (Read Goofier) ​​sequel: Immediately we get another unwieldy "prologue of the beginning of time" that even contradicts the same events in the first film set up !; After a compressed montage of highlights, a SUPERMAN-like scrolling sequence will soon follow. In narrative terms, here we have four rebellious gods stealing Zeus' seven important (but badly animated) thunderbolts. a crime that brings the moon on a collision course with the planet Earth! Faster than you can say "Nepotism", Zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion ?? Who has rightly accepted his place in the elite because it is assumed that the almighty tasks were performed in the first film? Finding his thriving thunderbolts and averting catastrophes. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hercules (Lou Ferrigno, as if you did not know) touches the earthly surface, he comes in contact with two attractive girls (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need to rescue them from hardship to free !; the former (who would later become an Italian television personality) apparently has the ability to speak with the Little People (!)? who look like the little sisters of GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964) !! So that they can shake out as much unused footage as possible from the first movie, the divine villain quartet awakens the good old King Minos (again William Berger) from his skeletal slumber and sets him again against his eternal enemy. Hercules usually encounters a number of potentially deadly enemies, including a gorgon. a fearlessly underproduced sequence that would have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had disturbed the filmmakers behind the much superior "CLASH OF THE TITANS" (1981), seeing this movie (with the same "reflection in a shield") preceded by that Muscle man, who lets the audience engage in his tactics before he executes them, as if he shows us how smart he is) !! And to make it clear that he carries his influences on the sleeve, Cozzi Hercules and Minos turns for one of their battles in a cosmic version of "King Kong vs. Godzilla" transform. Later, King Kong comes up with a big snake, an encounter that stems directly from the 1933 classic. I swear it is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As was the case with the first movie, the cast is full of old trustees like the aforementioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a wizard with a really bad hair day) and upcoming stars? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and once again Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily surpasses her appearance in the first film); Pino Donaggio's score for this piece was recycled from the musical clues that were included in his soundtrack for the previous film. If you've held on to this criticism by now, you must have realized by now that this is one of those films that is so incredibly bad that a reviewer has to decide which course to take: either reject it in a nasty sentence or one Film spend undeserved time to analyze his mistakes. I'm sure I've skipped some of his ailments, but I would not forgive myself if I did not mention the biggest laughing loud instance of the whole movie that almost dropped me off my chair (yes, even surpassed me the aforementioned animated titanic duel, namely the decoration of the insane deity cave, which has the shape of a huge marble armchair !! <br /> <br /> At this point one could do this well I wonder why I made this movie (and its In the past, I have had several lengthy online discussions about whether the stars of a particular movie should reflect overall artistic quality or entertainment value, but these are two cases in whom I thought necessary, consciously influenced by the latter in determining my final rating I do not know: Maybe it's because I'm currently in a "sword and sandal" mood (with some ten more handsome examples planned for the coming days!), but at least uncharacteristic of I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection, simply based on the fun I had with them in this new release ?? and that alone has to count for something, no?
