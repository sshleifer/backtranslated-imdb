I assumed I was really expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog" from the title, but it's more of a Bollywood remake of "I Know What You Did Last Summer" with some elements of "Scream". somehow and not very well. Apart from some very entertaining song and dance numbers, that's pretty awful. It obviously has a decent budget and is wasted on heated up leftovers that were not particularly tasty at first. A young woman is threatened by a scary guy not to participate in a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win (luckily she does not look as scary as her brother), but she steps in anyway and wins and of course Creepy Guy is coming after her and is killed, whereupon a rousing game of "Hide the Body" comes. Of course, the body disappears and nobody seems to know why, but someone knows and they wait for the end to discover a ridiculous conspiracy of action. With all this tired revival, some nice dance numbers interspersed, especially the festive dance number at the party for Simran, the girl who won the beauty contest Terrible Movie. I would much rather see an old Ramsay Brothers movie than this piece of crap, though somebody thinks that for the most part they do not have to be made available, which is a crime in itself. But not as big a crime as this movie. I took one for the team watching this, so take my advice, do not worry about it. 2 out of 10.
