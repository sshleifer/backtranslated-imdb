I like J-horror, anime, and somehow even digging the pink movement that some say is a member, but that did not help me. I'm ready to go one step further and call this one of the biggest disappointments in my film career. <br /> <br /> Three young Rockabillies go around trying to rape girls. One of the group starts making a decision about the pass time when his little sister nearly gets her. Without exception, the group revolves when the erstwhile friends start fighting each other. It ends with a suitable for the movie Downton. <br /> <br /> Apart from how the friends shout at each other, which they often do, there is not much going on here. The film is littered with LONG series shots, which only make matters worse. And even when the movie starts to do something interesting, it suddenly becomes involved in an ethereal philosophy that makes no sense. For example, after one of the buddies has had his heart alteration because of the attack on girls, he goes out and does it again, but then stops his buddies from taking their turn. Huh The cinematography is slow and the lighting is bad. The writing is fine, as well as the acting, which makes this a sub-paremic effort from the beginning. Mix the lack of technical skill with the threadbare content, and you have nothing but a waste of time. Oh, and one more note, at least one of the girls who does not show up in the buff Look old to do that. <br /> <br /> 3/10
