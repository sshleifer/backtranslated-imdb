An American boy goes to Paris after his mother committed suicide, becomes an artist and discovers himself and returns to the States so he can properly put things together with his former friends who classify this film so high, all of them Files fans, even if there are no aliens or serial killers. Do not be fooled, this film blows chunks. <br /> <br /> The story is incoherent, there is little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. If you get an explanation, it does not fit the previous story. What it does bores you. For all the acting talent in the movie it just is not interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when the sex addict Duchovny would beat someone. Maybe he did it behind the scenes. that they should have filmed instead. <br /> <br /> What comes up is the story of a selfish artist who worries about minor incidents in his life and somehow wants to get them right - even if they do not seem to start wrong. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, though a great secret was mentioned in the first few minutes. It's just a guy who thinks his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. It is not. <br /> <br /> I saw in a nutshell that Duchovny claims that he wrote the script in a week, which is absolutely believable. The guy can act, there is no doubt, but writing and governing are obviously beyond his talents. I do not care why Hollywood keeps these self-discovery stories green. I find myself in the shower every morning, but I do not bother to make a movie about it. Mine would probably be better than this one; At least there would be a nudity.
