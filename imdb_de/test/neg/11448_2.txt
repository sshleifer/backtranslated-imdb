I have seen this movie and I can say that this is really a bad movie. The director is crazy ... of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but he's definitely a cheap guy. There are also some technical flaws in the movies ... <br /> <br /> Okay ... here's my doubt - in the end, if they save the family (including a girl who has just been raped) .. Why are you leaving them out of their place? I have not seen an ambulance! There are many aspects of the film that are real ... but then I just wish the Major had told / helped / helped another good director and made the film. Mohanlal certainly deserves a better director!
