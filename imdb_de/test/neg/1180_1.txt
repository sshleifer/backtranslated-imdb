What a waste of time watching this movie. Poor picture quality, bad sound, bad acting and definitely not on actual facts. The deputy's "girlfriend" had played as much as the sheriff said that it was more comedy than horror. The deputy tried to make an emergency call under the number 911 ... PROBLEM ... in the year 1957, since this emergency number did not exist. This is just one example of blatant inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect has been suppressed many times. I just did not feel so terrible. <br /> <br /> I really thought that the actor playing Gein did the most admirable acting job in the entire movie. I could definitely see mental disorders in his character depiction. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry ... this just will NOT get it !!
