It was only the second year of the academy, but they were already voting politically - Jeanne Eagels' brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to settle for an Oscar nom, and the statuette won the worst performance ever - Mary Pickfords COQUETTE. The only existing pressure was a working pressure with no music or final editing, but wherever it is shown, Eagels stuns and impresses their beguiling, powerful performance. She is so persuasive on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth (we've seen it SEE how she kills the man), like the jury, we believe in her innocence before we suddenly catch ourselves itself. That's great. The movie needs to be made available on video so the world can enjoy this great performance again. (A silence from Jeanne exists in archival print - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost." So it's the only document we've got from her. Get it off (when it first came out) .) Of the archives that were to be shown in NYC in the early 1970s, the Village Voice printed a full page review adoring the performance of the Eagles.
