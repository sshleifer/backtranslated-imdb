I have never really understood the controversy and hype that this movie has caused. Especially in French and in the neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I find myself, for example), "Baise-Moi" was announced as the most shocking and thought provoking social drama you could ever experience. Yes exactly! Maybe it's a bit shocking (how often do you see someone shot in the ass?), But the weak and meaningless conspiracy certainly did not make me think a lot. "Baise-Moi" is another "blame" for anything that harms society, and they are generally not very persuasive. Over 99% of people work perfectly in this society. Why would you blame this very company for the vile and hopeless acts of two disturbed nymph girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are shown separately and in a flash. Nadine has just killed her roommate; Manu shot her brother and they met late at night in a deserted train station. They decide to travel together through France, leaving a trail of sex and blood where they stop. Although we are constantly confronted with pornography and violence, this movie is very boring. As the girls are constantly showing, the dialogues are lame and the people they meet (and kill) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porno films, that's okay with me, but please do not pretend it's an art house movie. If you omit cursing and hip camera work, all that is seen is (not so) exciting pornography. Cool soundtrack!
