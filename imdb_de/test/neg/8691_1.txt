Does anyone care about the characters in this movie? - Or what happens to them? - I doubt that. That's the key problem - for a tragedy to work, we need to at least look at one of the characters, and none of them attract sympathy or seem to have any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> What can be? certainly did not work in the 16th century, one can only assume "post-apocalyptic Liverpool" if that was what it was supposed to be. The problem is that the characters in the post-apocalyptic Liverpool, while still driving around in cars, working with cell phones and watching TV, have used Shakespeare's language - with a Liverpudl dialect. Oh man! Bad enough, you might think - but that has often fallen into a mere scouse - with comments like, uh, are you a cockney? And was this an announcement by Merseyrail during one of the scenes filmed in the subway? Well, the good news is that in post the apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still driving. <br /> <br /> The characters are invariably poorly drawn, made of wood and more like characters on the Joker / Penguin lines in Batman and Robin. Besides, there is no real plot to talk about - or if so, then this is one that does not work in a modern environment where half of the sets are bleak and "Blade Runnerish" and the other half is fluorescent shrill or just plain normal. The costumes are also mixed with half of their everyday wear (Parkers are obviously large in post-apocalyptic Liverpool), and the other half wears costumes from the remnants of a costume party. <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most unimaginable way imaginable - the tragedy is that this movie was made at all. <br /> <br />
