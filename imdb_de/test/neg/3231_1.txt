I could not agree anymore. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels, and this movie is an absolute travesty. I saw about half of it and threw the tape in the bin with disgust! I have no idea what the idiotic director was thinking to do this piece of crap, but I would rather stick my eyes out with a sharp stick than look at this useless movie again. Everything about this movie is just not true. First, the main character is changed from a former naval to a high school KID. WHY??? Second, the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! I bet Freud has something to say! LOL. The dog is cute enough and the best in the movie. A main character who helps them in the book, she reveals in the film. There is really nothing good to say about the film except that it is relatively short after about an hour and a half. If someone has not seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's so much better than this worthless waste of time!
