What an embarrassment ... This does not do justice to the original, with horrible spectacles of all in this movie. The scene in which Marion is killed in the shower is simply ineffective and unoriginal. The only good thing is that they used the same music and it's so obvious who kills them in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
