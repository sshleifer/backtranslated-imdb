Lowe returns to the nest after another failed relationship to find out he has served as a jury member. It is in the plans to somehow come out when he realizes that the defendant is the girl he has seriously fallen in love with since the first grade. By living in the past by telling other people about it, Lowe remembers this girl (played by Camp), recalls those feelings, and does everything in his power to free Camp from an attempted murder while he is at the same time keeps away from the true evil and a successful movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I've heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the US, and I also know that it has some connections to Ponce de Leon, so the setting is a good starting point. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing about this movie. The local police are incapable, the judge is an idiot and the defender is doing everything in her power to make herself look like Joanie Cunningham! I do not know if I should blame the director for the bad direction or if I just have to make the cast so bad. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring that I could not even sleep it! 1 out of 10 stars!
