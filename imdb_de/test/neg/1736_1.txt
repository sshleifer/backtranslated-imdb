The only people I would recommend for this film are both blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sadomasochist would get a kick. This movie had nothing; No theatrical, horrible music, terrible script - just the power to take your soul's luck. You may be wondering why or even how I've managed to sit the whole hour and a half of sheer madness, and frankly it's a difficult concept for myself. First, I had to pace up and down as the movie progressed It was extremely difficult for me to feel comfortable. Secondly, I only managed to bite off my own arm in order to beat myself to death by calling on friends for moral support when the conspiracy became particularly slow. The problem was that it was a matter of pride for me to finish after the first thirty minutes, and that was a fatal mistake for me. Usually I want movies to leave you with something in the end, but all you did was ..... For your sake, do not watch this movie.
