Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, this is another 80s feature about the dangers of the urban jungle, where police are afraid to leave and the homeless and criminal classes are the only inhabitants. This is the mix of the myth of Wild Thing, a wild young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty policeman (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local criminal (Robert Davi). Engage the local do-gooders (Priest Sean Hewitt and the unsuspecting social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for some pretty unexciting action sequences. Davi is the outstanding performer, and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a good job. Otherwise, this is a pretty lumbering action photo that will not satisfy action fans and satisfy Sayles' admirers.
