The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror movie. Unfortunately, it is more of a boring adventure movie and has no real horror elements. It starts with some divers being attacked, and we see some blood, but that's the only blood in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is not the worst, but for a horror movie it's boring boring. Acting is decent, and to be honest, the growing romance between the two main points remains the only thing that's watching you. There are a few nightmare sequences that the director simply did not know what to do. I've decided to go through everything (just about), but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Horror fans might want to buy a copy for the cool VHS cover, but it sticks best.
