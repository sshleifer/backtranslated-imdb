Oh my god, I am lost. Now I know that everything this guy does is meaningless. R J A wrote on August 13, 2006 (entry # 881): What a terrible experience. It looked like a bunch of third graders who had stolen a video camera, borrowed old 1995 editing software, and played a joke together.

This was a group of friends who had a good time and received each other. The plot was very difficult to track. The attempted artistic camera angles affected the story and made the whole time a dizzying experience. The spectacle, though funny, was very amateurish. The concept is fine, I think. Maybe next time, the producers should get some capital and hire real professionals and try again. I have to say that I'm sick of thinking so many that it's easy to make a good movie. It's not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe they can make a good product without education / experience and talent. I think in the end they will find out how difficult it is for me to be so disgusted that I have no comment. Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (Post # 762):
