I honestly do not know what legal or illegal substance they - the authors - were in when the terrible tripple wrote! The cast - sucks The plot - sucks The edit - sucks The entire premise The film shows that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers encounters a lesbian vampire sorority. You just have to be totally out of your mind to see even a minute of it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I had to see it - it was on this! Network as part of a two-picture purchase and the movie that was shot after that was the one I wanted to see. I quickly went through the whole thing and was amazed how stupid this film was in double speed! <br /> <br /> Borrow, buy or watch this movie ... the vampires in the movie do not suck you as much as the entire movie and the entire production! <br /> <br /> If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon & Katharine Deneuve - this is a great movie you can watch this piece of pure sh * t
