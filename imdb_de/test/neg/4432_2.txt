Ramsay ?? The kings of comedy (or was it horror, whatever) wake up after years of hibernation. And yes, I got scared. No, not because of the horror element (of course, I'm not so squeamish), but because rats were always dancing in the khatmal chaap theater (where else would such films be played). <br /> <br /> So the story. A man is repeatedly stabbed, suffocated, stuffed in plastic and thrown into a basin. But he still returns to avenge himself. Was the movie a thriller or a horror now? That's the tension you have to discover. And the end turns out to be another mask mystery. Remember the trademarks of Ramsay agents? Men with stupid horror masks. Only here is the mask of a human. I think there are no further details required to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay tends to become overly dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between movie and TV soaps. A cheap and tightly dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like ... .. (er, you know what). <br /> <br /> The background score is a direct lift from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. No single section of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth a comment. There is a lack of novelty in both history and execution. <br/> <br/> Dhund certainly nourishes your senses.
