Eaten Alive is a bad test for Cannibal Ferox the following year. The characters are generally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there is no attempt to create tension or tension, the physical effects are either ridiculously bad or stolen shamelessly from other films, and the ubiquitous rape scenes are hardly worthy of PG. 13 Even the scenes of animal cruelty are more boring than usual. The only slightly shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, who plays a bit gold finger and uses a blood-soaked dildo. a scene that is just bizarre and no graphics. My beloved wife, she from the Romeo and Juliet Collector's Edition, has seen this movie without a trace of disgust! And it's called Cannibal movie! All in all a rather lame effort that thoroughly reveals the Cannibal tradition. Cannibal Ferox, Luci's successor, is a far better example of the genre.
