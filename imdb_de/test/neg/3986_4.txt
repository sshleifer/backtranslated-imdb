Poor Shirley MacLaine struggles to give a little gravitas to this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she's trampled by the fleeting sentimentality of a movie that's not the least in reality. <br /> <br /> This was addressed by Curtis Hanson? Did he have a lobotomy since we heard from him the last time? Hanson can make an effective drama with comedy, as "Wonder Boys" prove. So I do not know what happened to him here. This is the kind of film that does not want to accept that life is messy and fussy, and those neat, tidy ends (however they may not be plausible) could make a nice closing shot, but they seem very fake if people do this I looked at the movie like the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and I made a game in which they had to proclaim the action points before they occurred - z "The old man will teach them to read and then die." Bingo! This is one of those movies in which the characters make small speeches summarizing their emotional issues. They wonder why they still have emotional problems when they are aware of what causes them. Toni Collette (by the way, a fine actress and one of my favorites, if you do not have much to do with them), talks early about why she buys so many shoes and she never wears the film's uncomfortable connecting motif. At that moment I knew what I wanted, and from then on the movie was a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> degrees: C-
