I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The plot is your average monster movie where it kills a few people, the mayor / boss does not believe it and they fight it in the end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film quality is very good, and the New York setting is impressive for a budget movie - unlike a small seaside town. Acting is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, mainstage in a monster movie, are ridiculous and the addition of a random busload of children into the action that lies halfway through the curve becomes strange. The end is just bad. <br /> <br /> In summary: If you can see this, please do not - there will be something better. <br /> <br /> RTC "True horror films" have no PG rating "
