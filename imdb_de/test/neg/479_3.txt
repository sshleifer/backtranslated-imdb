Written, directed and directed by Camp Champion Bruce Campbell. It's easy to say that this is a budget for a thing with little money. shot independently in Bulgaria. I can only say with certainty that stupid is not always funny. Campbell plays a wealthy American businessman with a cheating wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to complete a deal before he is murdered. He hires a taxi driver who drives him through a strange little town. Not knowing that his wife is going on with the taxi driver. Within moments when Campbell was beaten up; The taxi driver is killed in the same place. A mad scientist (Stacy Keach) continues with an experiment that puts the head of the American in the head of the American. With huge punctures on his forehead Campbell freed himself and roamed the streets looking for his wife. Meanwhile, he argues with a strange voice in his oversized head. Campbell warps his rubbery face and makes silly expressions as he strokes himself. So Bruce does what he does best, and no doubt his many fans will be happy. I have the impression that this was written as a mere comedy. Rounding out the cast with Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Pay attention to it on the sci-fi channel.
