OK, I'll be brief. This movie was not only bad, but also very bad. With Line4s like "If you're dealing with the devil you expect him to put on his shoes," you know your horrible movie realm. After seeing this movie, I wanted to kill myself and my entire family. That gave me such a big sense of self-contempt that I wanted to do a murder. Do not look at this movie I'll kill again. But when I do it, it's terribly edited with a miserable soundtrack and shot with sequential shots for action sequences and bad shirts. Fortunately, there is a downside, it's the first action movie showing a three-door Ford Sierra. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it ends up on the roof as a trash can: (<br /> <br /> Ps: Worse than the Marksman
