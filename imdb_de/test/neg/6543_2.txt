Although the film has a pretty stylish look for an indie that was made on a really low budget, that's not what I go to the movies for. There was no character that I found sympathetic, they all seemed to be absolutely unsuspecting losers. Everything they try ends up bad, it's all too hopeless for me. Reviews refer to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like a refugee from an institution. When Josh talks to his girlfriend Emily about his brother, he almost suggests that Rhett does not play with a full deck. Still, Josh hosts a wedding for Rhett and a wife Rhett met hours before. Some of the characters encountered on the street had some interesting ideas. For me, the most meaningful thing was that people went out of the movie ... and I saw it in a free show.
