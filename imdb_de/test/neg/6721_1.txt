There are films that are not released in cinemas but on video. This should be allowed to age and dissolve like old nitrate films. No story, inappropriate violence, exaggerated, poorly written, and unfortunately the star is not the only bad part of the movie. And I liked and enjoyed a few other Siegel films.
