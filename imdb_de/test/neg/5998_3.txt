Jackie-chan films are typical examples of how supply is greater than demand. Well, to be honest, in this movie, Jackie Chan, whatever his name in this movie, is racing car driver. Well, he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage gets sped up so I can do all the stunts myself In a race we can finally see how bad this production really is. Chan's fight, especially in the casino scene, is decent, but when we talk about special effects, Lord. And everyone has to crash in this race? stupid. And here it really is not safe for the drivers, there is not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood point of eight-year-old, but still, what a mess. I like Chan as much as the next guy, maybe more since I saw "Rush Hour", but his agent's remaining cousin really needs to pick his projects better.
