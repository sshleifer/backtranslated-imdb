The growth of taxpayer money and sale-and-lease-back programs has resulted in a number of unsaleable films that absorb dust in laboratories and vaults across the British Isles because they appear to be made pure because they meet financial criteria and none have potential audience. A few lucky people get a week on a small screen in London before going on the Budget DVD, but The Riddle excels in completely bypassing cinema, television, or even the rental market, as a free gift DVD to be premiered in the mail on Sunday. <Br /> <br /> It's all too easy to see why this was literally given away. Apart from a few glitches (a boom microphone is clearly visible in one shot), it's not all that bad, and while Vinnie Jones looks like a modern-day version of Freddie Mills Mills' British cinema as a Greyhound reporter Since the desk and the secondary character of ham are too vague to pass through, no one distinguishes himself here, who is either outstanding or bad: mediocrity is the norm here. The real problem is that, like so many sale-and-lease-back tax fund films, it's a "soft" movie - there's no reason to look at it. It exists because of the circumstances, but lacks pace or forward movement. It seems the TV audience audience on Sunday (although shot in Scope), but it does not cut it off. In this decidedly harmless story about an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and a few suspicious deaths in modern Limehouse, there are a few okayistic ideas, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as is the supernatural turn of the last minute (you 'I can never guess who Jacobi's literary tramp really is, what, did you guess?) - that you almost expect the Scooby Gang or the Double Deckers to show up to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's a very misunderstood movie For all sorts of reasons: A few performers play a dual role, if they're not even supposed to play a role, and all the shock that reveals the truth of the Dickens manuscript is completely wrong, because it is all told in the first person by Dickens as the alleged character of the novel. The main murder in the film is awkwardly integrated into the main plot. The characters suddenly remind Vinnie that he has already forgotten this, and announce an increasingly desperate last half-hour in which the evil developer puts Jason Flemyng's secretary Rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so she can. Have her bad way with him She has burdensome photos behind her, "to make you an idiot with your girlfriend," which leads to a dream in which he speaks to Charles Dickens ("You are Charles Dickings," "What's in a name?" something unlikely suggestion "you read too many books" contains. But that's nothing compared to the final, which falls into utter absurdity. Logic and common sense go completely out the window, as if it were a bizarre Jacobin vengeance with guns on the Thames and two-day guest stars. Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave look like they would rather be in a different location (Mel Smith dives in) a one-day cameo, so it's clear that the "names" of the movie are mainly for a $ 10,000 cash prize or to cover their alimony payments.). The final picture of the film is so absurd and meaningless that it almost seems worth seeing. A curiosity is a pretty prominent role in the first third for Vera Day, a kind of prototype by Liz Fraser and a unique prop of British films of the 50s - the barmaid in Hell Drivers, the bartender in Quatermass II -, promoted to pub owner here, while the comedian Kenny Lynch shows up briefly to perform the best as an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow as - oh the irony - as examining magistrate ... <br /> <br /> To top it off, the free DVD also included a trailer for director Vinnie's other film Jones, Bog Bodies, a terrible British horror with transatlantic scientists, and Vinnie in Elmer Fudd Duck Hunter Outfit, terrorized by a revived 2,000-year-old victim from the next peat bog ("Be Wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: I hunt," Dwuids "). I can not wait ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can guarantee, however, is that every indie producer in the UK will spend the next few weeks figuring out how much the post has paid for the license to press the DVD (they paid Prince Â£ 250,000 for his new CD.) With so many British tax shelter indies on the shelf and with money currently hard to find, this could turn into an interesting setback f for British movies.
