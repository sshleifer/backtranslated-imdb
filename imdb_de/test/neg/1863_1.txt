Ghoulies IV begins in a museum warehouse, where blonde-haired Alexandra (Stacie Randall), wearing PVC and leather, is looking for an antique gem. After retrieving various guards, she summoned the demon Faust she had sex with and unfortunately she lost the jewel so he is not very happy and tells her to get the last of the rest ... What Jonathan Graves owns (the one of Ghoulies Alexandra sets out to find the jewel so she can bring Faust to Earth from the "other side" on a permanent basis , Well, I do not really know. Um, that's it really ... <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Jim Wynorski, whose name name gives me a shiver when he's tied to a movie, I just pass 90 minutes of my life for Goulies IV As I had expected, the complete and total crap was from start to finish and it is so simple and straightforward. The ahem, "Script", coughing, by Mark Sevi, has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies films, except in the title and that they managed to persuade Liapis to repeat his role, which also has the great advantage that he can use footage from the original, even if it has no relevance. The story is almost non-existent, the whole movie is a real duty to watch, it's unbelievably boring and moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's sparkling when it comes to blood or blood, and it does exist two comic relief goblins that I suppose are they Should fill the ghoulies quota, even if they do not look like they did in the previous films, and it's actually just embarrassing to see them. I think they worked as ventriloquists for most of the movie, as if they were speaking their mouths. They do not move ... I do not want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore, so please believe me when I say that this is a huge bitch of elephant size. Do not waste time or money. <br /> <br /> Director Wynorski is shooting a thoroughly spoiled movie on almost every level, the special effects are just as awful as the whole movie. Apparently, Ghoulies IV is supposed to be some kind of horror comedy, but it misses both targets around the proverbial mile and is neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this film is the actress Randall in her PVC and leather outfit running around to find the jewel. It is not worth to see through this garbage. There's a reasonably mature, out-of-control car scene with a few crashes, but it looks like it's been cut from a completely different movie. Wynorski's track record was safe. Forget about every Gore, since there is none. <br /> <br /> Technically, Ghoulies IV is an idiot, it's obvious it had a low budget, but that's just no excuse for being so bad, right? Liapis is back in the cast, though he probably wishes he had stayed away. PVC-clad Baby Randall is simply the best thing about this movie that says a lot. Ghoulies IV is crap, otherwise there is nothing to really look for. I really can not see anyone enjoying the movies getting something, I just can not. I can not believe I'll recommend the original ghoulies, but it will happen now, because even if that's crap, it's a lot better than Ghoulies IV. One who avoids people and you can thank me later. You do not have to worry about the things that I'm sitting in ...
