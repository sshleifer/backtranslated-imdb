Honestly horrible movie, bad editing, terrible lighting, terrible dialogues and bad script. <br /> <br /> The lighting is so bad that there are moments when you can not see what's going on, I even tried to play with the contrast and brightness so I could see something, but that did not help. <br /> <br /> You must have found the script in a clipboard, the character development is just as terrible and while you expect little from a Jean-Claude, Van Damme's film manages to reach an all-time low. You can not even laugh at the cheese factory. <br /> <br /> The direction and the editing are also terrible, the whole movie follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every opportunity, when he hums by the action that is so weak it is just unreal. <br /> <br /> There is not much else to say except it is really bad and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Damme's earlier work that you could enjoy. <br /> <br /> Avoid the blackboard, frankly, the words fail me to condemn this "movie".
