Made in an imitative documentary style, Subversives of the late 1960s and alleged obstructionists of the mainstream government are arrested and made a choice. After being convicted of wrongdoing, you may choose to go to prison for seven years, or spend three days and two nights in a Southern California desert in Punishment Park. In the 100-degree heat, the prisoners have to wander fifty kilometers to an American flag to reach their freedom. US and state law enforcement agencies will follow two hours later. If the dissidents are captured, it means a prison. <br /> <br /> In this pseudo-documentation are: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
