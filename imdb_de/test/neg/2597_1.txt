It's literally the Three Stooges again without the charm. This show is nothing but the worst slapstick. I'm surprised they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random and "controversial" to no other point than very (very) hard to try to be controversial. And people think that's "edgy"? Get a hint: This show requires no thought, time, effort, money or creativity / originality. All existing references are for people between the ages of 6 and 16 who occasionally search People magazine. But I think that's just what all kids want, want and need today.
