Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 stank, but the first one was better. The special effects in this movie were not at all special. Although the killings in this episode were better, they were nothing special. What was worse in part 2 was the characters. They suddenly changed their emotions and some of their lines were just stupid. For example, a character quoted: "You better have R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or you will find out what that means to me." When I heard this line, I thought it was the worst I've ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was the fact that it was too short. A successful movie will take more than an hour and twenty minutes, as with Killjoy 2. If Full Moon does Part 3 of Killjoy, it would move to the lowest possible level. Total 1 in 10. <br /> <br />
