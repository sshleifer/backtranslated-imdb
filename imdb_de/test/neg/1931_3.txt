The story is from "King Lear"; The area is a farm in Iowa. Here is a test for this kind of stuff: If you ask, "Why and why did you do it this way," and the answer is, "Because that happened in King Lear, you know that the movie failed. Well, that's what's going on here, the father figure in this story is not living his own life, he's imitating a fictional character, but the movie is more wrong than here. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than I think she realizes, she tries to take on the story of King Lear and change the attitude completely - this is a task in itself - the most likely outcome is that the transplanted story dies, and no one really can find out why (although there are enough successful grafts, such as "West Side Story," to make it worthwhile), but she also tries a revisionist retelling, in the version of "King Lear" she wants to create, Reagan and Goneril our compassion l, and Cordelia is a villain. This is also a task in itself. <br/> <br /> Success in both tasks is difficult; to achieve both at the same time is impossible. In fact, it is impossible to be successful with one time while trying the other. If we look at the same events from a different moral perspective, the events must be exactly the same events - meaning that there can be no manipulation of the attitudes. If the story is to be transplanted alive into another environment, you have to beat your moral heart all the time - meaning that there is no impact on the ethical perspective. Moorhouse had to fail not just one, but both of them. And so she did it. ... Of course, it is possible to try both tasks to fail in both tasks, but by a chance blow to a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I did not read Jane Smiley's novel, which, to my knowledge, is good for independent reasons. But the movie is not. If nothing else was to blame, it still would not get around that it's so thoroughly and painfully DULL. The corn fields are even more boring than in real life - which does not necessarily have to be the case, as I can imagine four films ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest"), "The Straight Story", "Kikujiro "), where the corn fields are not boring at all.
