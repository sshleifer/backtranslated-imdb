This movie was too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy it. Hardly until the middle of the film. In addition to moving from Edwards Neffe's Don Wanderly to his son, he removed most of the important scenes and a series of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was garbage. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I also do not think casting has done such a good job in selecting members of the Chowder Society. Hopefully somebody will come with me and actually make this movie right in my life. I just hate when Hollywood slaughters the works of talented authors because they find their version much better. Makes me sick.
