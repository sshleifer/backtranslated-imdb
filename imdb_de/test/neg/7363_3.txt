As a major in Canadian history, the first thing I want to say is: HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT EXACT! How can a producer do that? The deportation of the Acadian was not 1759, when we saw Franklin in London, but 1755! How can he survive that in the movie? The scenes in Londo were also useless. Then you have the story for all who read "Les Anciens Canadians". It is the story of La Coriveau, this "witch". Also add a love story and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter. Sure, it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then there is the fact that it was obviously set up in Quebec City, but was filmed mainly on the Forteresse de Louisbourg. Sure, it's a historical place and timely, but it was obvious the scenes were not all in Quebec City. If you're looking for a documentary about New France, check out Candad: A People's History, a true documentary about the history of Canda and NEw France. If you want a love story that will bring you tears, a story set in a beautiful forest, then check out New France.
