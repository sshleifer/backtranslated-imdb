Well, this strange movie. It was performed as a comedy, but I certainly have not laughed. Actually, I'm having trouble finding something positive about this movie. Oh, I'm going. Alex Ferns is not bad in the lead role and I have not chosen the end for a change, but apart from that, this does not have solid two-dimensional character traits and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough form a decent drama. I really would not want to have to watch this movie again, and I think that does not benefit any of the working class characters he's trying to portray. It was hard for me to empathize with any of the characters, and I did not have enough information about main character Jimmy to believe his motives. Best avoided.
