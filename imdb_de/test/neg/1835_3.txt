This movie was a good place to start. Excitement, Slashers, a secret society, and you really could not figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many stupid clichés from the worst of the old American slasher / horror movies. Now I love slasher / horror movies, but there are all the old clichés that have long since disappeared from American cinema. For example the old "I hear noises in the basement and I am all alone at home and the basement light does not work." I will examine the cliché. "Three examples of these clichés really do not annoy me to an end: <br /> <br /> 1 ) When Potente discovers that a secret society may be working on the medical school that is opening up living bodies, she asks further and asks EVERYONE - very publicly - essentially she says, "I found you. Come on, kill me for telling everyone your secret. "And then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over the bed and puts her roommate's severed finger into a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Self after a man she met two weeks ago landed on the dissecting table, she learns how this secret society undressed living people, and she goes to the lab, where all the corpses are kept 2-3 times to investigate. <br /> <br /> 3) Her roommate is killed, she is persecuted by the murderer, who she knows does not report to the university or the police, then leaves the school to visit her parents Then she returns to school and apparently believes that this guy who tried to kill her forgoes the past and does not try to kill her, even though she knows his secret, which of course was wrong. > <br /> For someone , who should be so smart (she studied to study at the best school in Germany), behaved like a cliché bimbo in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> These things made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me wish that the end would come sooner. After half the movie, I stopped looking for her and wished she'd also land on the dissecting table.
