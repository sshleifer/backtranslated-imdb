SPOILER!! Terrible camera work, terrible writing, non-existent plot and numerous plotting holes. Wonderful spectacle With the exception of Julia Roberts. Who plays badly someone imitating Julia Roberts, bad. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the film, we zoom in on each of the twelve (!) characters again and again. Twelve are too many, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we are slowly concentrating on the characters when everyone is in the same room and doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney eats. Yes, Pitt eats. Yes, the "Jew" eats. Yes, the geek eats. Yes, the bodybuilder eats. Yes, Mr. Sensitive eats. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep Yep. Yes. Phew! This happens at least three times in the movie. Yes, they all sit in cars, bored. Yes, they are all arrested, scared. Yes, they are all dejected out of jail. <br /> <br /> But it was not until I got home that I realized how bad they "caught" me with this one. This is a raid movie, right? That's what I saw, right? But when I went in and put my car keys in the interchangeable glass, it was clear to me: NOTHING HAS BEEN STOLEN IN THIS FILM! Right. It's a raid movie that does not steal anything. Oh, they try. They are trying to steal some boring document or something from a man's house (whatever) and it turns out that it has already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal something from a museum (YAWN!) And they screw it up and get arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see a French fairy man steal the egg even before they did that, and we get all the joy of "entrapment" except that this time the person in the tight catsuit Dancing around the wrong lasers ... is an ugly, thin French guy. Around. <br /> <br /> But it turns out he did not really steal the egg either. In fact, our heroes stole the egg before LOOOONG in another movie that would have been a great movie if they made this movie. Instead, we see a 30-second clip in black. and know how they robbed some students of his backpack. You've heard ... the bold caprice, the ultimate robbery - the construction of those two and a half hours of boring shit - is they who steal a backpack from a college backpack by creatively embarking on a fight for baseball teams that distract him and replace his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you, that was so bad that I did not even know how bad it was - how badly I had been robbed - until I got home.
