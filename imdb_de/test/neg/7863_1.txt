This movie is so bad that it is actually funny. One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The funny thing was that the trailer had scenes that were not in the movie. Just by watching the trailer I would have saved a lot of time. It actually showed everything that happened in the movie except for the conclusion and that was so obvious. That's just so bad. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> I would give it 0 out of 10 if that were possible. There is nothing else to say about this film.
