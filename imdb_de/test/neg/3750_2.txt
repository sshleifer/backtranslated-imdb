Martha Plimpton has made several prestigious films that have worked with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she has not been able to extend her limited, bombastic charm to the same class as Molly Ringwood. Barely released, this film is just one extension of his attempts in the late '80s / early' 90s to find a screen person recognizable to the moviegoer and another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who is on her 21st. Birthday learns that she was adopted and - worse than that - was exposed as a child on the doorstep of her parents! She goes in search of her birth mother and her father, but the viewer has no idea why she would want that at all (would simple curiosity make her so determined?). Unattractive material in handling the sitcom; it starts on the wrong foot and never recovers. Plimpton gives a sour, grumpy performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine as adoptive parents. * 1/2 of ****
