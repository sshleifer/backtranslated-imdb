"Northfork" is what's wrong with indie movies. This will not be the case for all their hard-edged comments and attack studies with big subjects, this is the sacrifice we bring. For nearly two hours I was exposed to the torture and pain of a movie that begins to wander like a blind man in a new place, without breaking new ground and thankfully dying. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories that detail a dying city and a dying boy. Two black-clad men (one of them James Woods) have to force the remaining inhabitants of Northfork to leave before a dam opens and floods the city. In the other story, a boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte), who gave it to his parents. He dies and is, I think, visited by angels. Among them were Anthony Edwards with bizarre glasses and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume that reminds me of the pirate shirt of Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Although this is the "conspiracy," it's not about the movie. The movie is about nothing. It does not do anything, says nothing, goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show. Maybe by design, rather an afterthought of the overbearing, surreal David Lynch wannabe - we're an important artistic film you can not see - directional style. The entire film is filtered through a gray, gloomy backdrop that blends into a movie about death. Instead, it just makes the movie much harder to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about black men, you will either see the two "Men in Black" movies that are not too impressive, but compared to "Northfork" you will be in the status "Citizen Kane" If you want to watch a movie about a dying boy, look at 'Lorenzo's Oil' If you want to watch a movie that causes the destruction of a city by water, look at 'O Brother, Where are you?' If you want to see a movie better than "Northfork", there are hundreds.If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there are only a handful.
