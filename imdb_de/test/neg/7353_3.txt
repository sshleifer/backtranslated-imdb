Why did Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a poor Schnook who would eventually be undermined by Anna Dundee, a woman played by Yvonne DeCarlo in "Criss Cross"? The same reason why Robert Mitchum is allowed to be another loser who falls in love with "Femme Fatale Faith Domergue" in autumn 1950, "Where Danger Lives". Maybe they both felt it was a great way to show that they were "rich" actors. If they played against the type and ordinary role of a hard man they were known for, it would enhance their image as an actor that could play a role. The problem, however, was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic, lovesick Milf Crust in Criss Cross, did not promote Lancaster's career. Not only is Lancaster completely wrong in Thompson's one-note role, there is also something inherently improbable (and may I say pathetic) about the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> 'Criss Cross' is an infinitely slow movie. One of the many unnecessary scenes in the film is in the beginning: the flashback in which Thompson's confrontation with Dan Duryea's Dundee is recorded in the nightclub. Everything that appears in this first flashback is explained later in the picture: The unauthorized affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with Martinez, the cop, and his bad blood with Dundee. If director Siodmark was forced to start the movie with a flashback, you should not keep him under three minutes. I think it would have been more effective. <br /> <br /> In 'Criss Cross' it takes a while for the protagonist to commit himself and step out of the 'ordinary' world of the first act. This is the scene where he "passes by" and meets "Anna" in the nightclub. And Siodmak spends so much time staring at Anna Tanzen and Steve staring at her. Besides cross-cutting, he spends a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and his rhumba band rather than pushing history. Until the crisis of the second act, the story collides with Thompson, who had several unpleasant encounters with Anna and then He drowned his worries at his usual watering hole. In the middle of Act Two, he learns that Anna ran away and got married to Dundee. At this point, it becomes clearer that one of the movie's main flaws is that Dundee is never on the screen. During most of the second act, there are almost no confrontations. At this time, there are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee, and we stick with the rather nefarious machinations between the two Lovebirds. Reason she left was no. Just because he had been gone for eight months, she also felt pressure from Steve's mother and direct Threats from Martinez, the policeman, who had suggested that he would make sure that she ended up in the detention center. Anna goes back to Steve because she realizes that she made a big mistake with Dundee. It turns out that he beat her and she is now afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the stupid refrains voiced by more than one character in Criss Cross is that you can never hijack an armored car. But everyone is so surprised when Steve points out that it can be done if it is an insider job! They would have thought Dundee had learned about Steve's job as a tank driver and suggested it beforehand. But of course, Steve has to suggest that Dundee not kill him after discovering his affair with Anna (if they're afraid to get caught, why do Steve and Anna meet in his apartment, where Dundee can find them so easily? ). I'm really excited about Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the "heads" of the operation. Dundee is so stupid that he has to hire that alcoholic ex-professor guy who's the robbery on a map. Oh, it's the question of sourcing the ingredients for the construction of the gas bombs used during the robbery, and of course Finchley is fine too! <br /> <br /> The only really successful scene in the entire movie is the armored car robbery. The editing was pretty good as it showed the increasing action of a failed robbery. As the gas bombs set in, the gang's brutality is greatly relieved as Dundee murders the innocent Armored Car Guard. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is just as big as the rest of the movie. Why does it take so long for one of Dundee's thugs to kidnap Thompson? There's this sister, then the idiot is waiting outside, then he comes in and pretends to be a friend, Steve falls asleep and after he awakes, the idiot abducts him. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna in the house, we wonder how Anna got the money. Did she somehow steal it from Dundee after the robbery when he went to dinner? It is never explained. Worse, Anna turns suddenly out of the blue to the evil Femme Fatale. Her selfishness and her attraction to Dundee can be explained earlier by her rejection of the threats made by Steve and Martinez. But after she returns to Steve because she fears Dundee, she inexplicably turns to him when he's most vulnerable. Just as with "instant coffee" there is "instant femme fatale". <br /> <br /> In "Film Noir, An Encyclopedic Allusion to American Style" by Silver and Ward, the authors call Criss by "Cross" "one of the most tragic and compelling film noirs". I beg to differ. To have a tragedy requires characters of great depth, and to be captivating requires a story that is plausible. Criss Cross has none. It's an overrated "B Movie", somehow in the pantheon of the Art House Noirs. Once again, the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating yesterday's images.
