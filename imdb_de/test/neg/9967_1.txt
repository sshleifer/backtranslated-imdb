I was encouraged to watch this movie because I've heard a good word about it: it should be this exciting milestone of true crime, disturbing, shocking ... all jazz. Well, I'm worried because I spent money on it, and I'm shocked that something so dreadful was actually released. That's it. <br /> <br /> This is a supposed "new look" for Charles Manson's crazy family of insane loser junkies and their murders. But if this is a "new look," it's probably "new," as in "fresh and totally incompetent." Just looking at it made me headache, and I had to give it up to make any sense or even to understand what that is The director wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I think I should say something about the plot, but the fact is, it was so stupid and incoherent that I hardly remember if there was any action at all. There was something about a "Manson band" being delivered to a radio DJ (or a television producer?), Then an hour of pointless random footage from "The Family" ('69), then the Polanski murders (which a bad school play look) and finally an idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads falling apart in an alley (I do not fuck you) in an alley and then it ended (thank God) (do not ask me to understand that I remember Just remember what I saw!) The performances were also terrible. And how hard is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Get a short skinny, skinny guy, put on a dirty wig and a shaggy beard. There's your Manson. But this "Manson" does not even look right. He looks like he's a guy in a cheap wig and a glued-on, black-painted Christmas beard. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie is about it: Manson's family makes no sense, so this movie does not make any sense either. It is symbolic! (Yeah, right) I'm still so angry that I spent money on it. I've stopped my normal lurking on this site and just voted for this movie to vote for this movie and release this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. Stay away, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent US TV production "Helter Skelter" received bad reviews, but I saw it last month (I also saw the original from 1976). I can tell you, compared to "Manson Family", that the new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS. And I was disappointed! So bad is "Manson Family": It makes a flawed and mostly disappointing TV movie perfect.
