After watching the movie, I feel that both the father and mother are a reasonable person, though not perfect. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's diary an accurate portrait of himself? Mostly, people just write problems in their journal because they want to solve the problem. A journal is always a negative side of a person. In this film, the author judges his mother's life through her diary. No wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is ugly, outwardly and inwardly. First, she said her father's second marriage was "not fair" to her mother. Then she said that she does not love her mother. So she does not love father and mother. I doubt she loves anyone in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Throughout the movie, I feel that the author and his sisters lack love and respect for their parents. However, I have the feeling that the father loves the mother very much to her children, even the author tries to portray her as a cold, deceitful person.
