Riccardo Freda may have a good reputation; but as we now know that many of his best films were actually directed by the late great Mario Bava, it is clear that in the 1970s he was not one of Italy's most gifted filmmakers. This film pretty much proves it despite the simple conspiracy; It's a huge mess, and overall, I'd even say that the tragic ceremony is BAD than Freda's bland giallo effort, the iguana with the tongue of fire. Freda obviously refused this movie, and I do not blame him! The plot simply follows a group of children gasping in the middle of nowhere. They pass a house while they search for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice as the owner is currently performing a satanic ceremony ... ho hum. The film stars Camille Keaton, who was to star in the exploitative classic I Spit on Your Grave a few years later, but does not leave an impression here, despite playing alongside talented performers. The film has a decent gore scene towards the end, but this is not enough, considering it takes eighty minutes to get there. I have a high tolerance for Italian garbage that makes no sense - but even I could not stand it. Miss it, do not miss anything!
