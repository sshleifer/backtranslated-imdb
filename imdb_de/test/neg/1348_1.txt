I was very disappointed in this movie. Ms. English, who says she is a fan of the original film, seemed to have done a great piece of art work and turned her into a frilly "bumblebee". I tried to like Mary Haines from Meg Ryan, but she was just boring. She seemed to feel nothing of her husband's affair. There was no emotional struggle, no deep pain. In the original 1939 film, Mary Haines felt betrayed by Norma Shearer, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The production of 2008 was more about a wrong sorority theme (actually my wife's words) and it did not make you shed a tear or even laugh. The only performances that have proved worthy are Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more from Bette.) There really was not a protagonist in this movie. The Sylvia Fowler figure had too many subtopics. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The remake of the department store encounter with Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. The pace was slow too. Obviously, the 1939 version had to be updated, but it was not. The reason the original version worked so well was that the characters had "man" problems. By the way, an issue that is not outdated. The magic of the original movie was that this movie was both sexes, while you never saw the men.
