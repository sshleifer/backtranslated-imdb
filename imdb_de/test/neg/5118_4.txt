Bare Wench is another softcore parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen such things). It has 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain) and a Dorky guy whose sole purpose is to make comic relief. Okay, so I think "Cool" Great-looking women who have softcore lesbian sex with each other a good 10 minutes or so. That should be really good. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers have screwed it up, there is nothing in this video that is actually suitable as a sex scene, there are a few false starts, but the majority of the action is just the women taking the camera I think that once the producers spent their money on the women and spent more on taking off their clothes, they did not have the money to make them actually do anything, and I guess they did also used up all their assigned nudity time too soon, because at the end of the video there are a lot of unnecessary dialogues that are obviously used for no other reason than to balance the runtime. "You're a liar! No, it's you! You go to the cave! No, you go! I think we should go home! Well, not me! "It goes on and on and on. <br /> <br /> There is much better than this.
