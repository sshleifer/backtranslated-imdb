Terrible in a bad / good way ... This movie is officially the worst "Made for TV Movie" in my book ... aside from the camp value it offers, I give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. Suggestion: Have a look with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you want to throw something on the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth from his "Sex in the City Days" ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point in the career of all actors ... frankly, I do not know how they controlled the laughter when the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pathetic. EVERYONE attended the School of Over Acting; and poor Joan Van Ark, I think she was the only one who took this theater of the absurd seriously ... but she is considered a producer. Her "Mom" jeans and her vicious plastic surgery are scene-stealers. This film also transgresses the oh-so-delicate line of social impropriety by introducing a mentally handicapped character into the plot. This is an obscure movie listed on Lifetime as {With Harmful Intent} .... has anyone else had the pleasure?
