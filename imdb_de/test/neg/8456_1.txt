So you have a lot of models on one island and one after the other in Agatha Christie style. We get someone lost at sea, hit by a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, driven off a cliff, blown up, and so on. Nothing terribly graphic about a murderer in a strange human face mask. The owner of the magazine is a slut who had an affair and someone had taken pictures of her before she was of age. In the end, it's all about business or something. <br /> <br /> There is an 80s montage of a photo shoot. Most swimsuits are surprisingly one-piece. A few are pretty translucent. During installation, there are camera clicks where the frame of the camera is displayed as a white square or rectangle within the image. The photographer is pretty bad in the design!
