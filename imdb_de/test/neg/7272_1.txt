Finally, I can connect the dots between the return of the Jedi and the phantom menace. We see here where Lucas lost touch with what made the original Star Wars movies great, and began to get involved in the story where the tricks of episodes 1-3 were ruined. This movie is one of those cheesy low-budget swords and wizarding movies of the 80s, rather than anything else worth associating with the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar Jar figure, this seems to be geared towards children (and the toy market). The fight scenes are especially bad. It was depressing to see how Sian Phillip's incredible talent was so wasted after her classic performance in I, Claudius.
