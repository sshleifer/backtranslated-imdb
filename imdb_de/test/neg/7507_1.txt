Just when you think you've seen the worst that the zombie subgenre can offer, another up and coming Romero and his team of talent mates come to prove to you that you're wrong Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy, Enduring Death Valley: Revenge Bloody Bill sat half-comatose through The Zombie Diaries and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and truly believed that amateur filming could not continue to decline. Having just seen Zombie Planet, a two-hour-long, burning pile of the drivel by writer / director George Bonilla, I believe I've found the utmost in horrible zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terribly amateurish effort is part of Mad Max and part of Dawn of the Dead (but ALL bad), Frank Farhat plays as TK Kane, a tough fighter who fights zombie ass for a hobby armed only with knives, a machete, some hand grenades and what he is obviously perceptions are really evil. <br /> <br /> After a desperate opening episode involving a horde of dodgy looking zombies, Kane works with a group of survivors who not only have to ward off attacks from the undead, but also have a gang of appease vicious thugs that have taken control of the area (by searching for and handing over valuables that they find). Of course not, Kane is not the type of man who accepts a bunch of post-apocalyptic bully boys of the Z class, and he begins by teaching the bad guys a lesson (usually threateningly threatening) by just pausing to make friends regularly save from zombies. <br /> <br /> With terrible spectacles from almost everyone involved, a terrible script, ridiculous effects and inferior production values, in this movie, there is practically nothing worth the clock. To be honest, I like the basic assumption that the zombies are the unexpected result of a very popular slimming drug that blocks the craving for carbohydrates), but this is the only vaguely interesting aspect of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I have a certain respect for all who manage to finance and film their own film, but if the results are poor, this respect is lost when they decide to make it public to make accessible. I would have kept this under lock and key if I had done it.
