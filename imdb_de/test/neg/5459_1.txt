The success of Anna Kokkinos with 'Head On' now looks like it's all about the script and Alex Dimitriade's outstanding lead performance. The extent to which this recent book, The Book of Revelation (apart from Tristan Milani's excellent cinematography) is both distracted, overbearing, and completely unoriginal, seems to prove this. , <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were already some Aussie films that dealt with such topics, some were vilified for sexism (and / or explicit sex scenes) in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century. It's worth it to look again after this lint. If you introduce the whole world into the world of ballet and make it painfully slow (and in his choreography, like an experimental Dutch Ballet number from the 1960s), Great Art is a good idea if you have not traveled much - and then only if you have never gone beyond the art theory 101. <br /> <br /> Add the claim, turn the dialogue on badly ("You'll do what we tell you to ..."), and the whole shebang falls onto his well-funded face. Then there are the "sexy" bits: directly from Dario Argento. Given the beautiful but cut-off performance of Colin Friels - how about a real primal city thriller? <br /> <br /> All in all, with "The Book of Revelation," the feminist project was set back by another decade - and with the willing and deeply imitative (by male writers such as Henry Miller, William Burroughs, or even Bukowski) Collaboration of a collective in Melbourne, Oz, suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelations await us here.
