One day, I was ill and overflowed canals, and I came across this awful ranks movie. The drawing and even the signatures (if you can find one) were done to extinction.

Her only competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in everything she has done (or done halfway). Maybe she played exactly as the script suggested, or maybe (groan!), That's the limit she has on her acting area. Either way, in the first 30 seconds of the movie, they had a paraphrase and killed (eg, the girl who fell off the balcony in Lethal Weapon (I) (but at least she had beautiful breasts)) /> <br / > Most Humble ...
