It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. It made me addicted to begging and then totally lost myself. The acting was gone and then it went away. Do not watch this movie at any price, TRUST ME WITH ALL MY HEARTS !!!! The directors who are brothers are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS who made really great films like DEAD PRESIDENTS, FROM HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. The only person who made me observe this was the acting of Paris Campbell. One day a great actor, when he makes better films than this one. Christianine Caparoula has also done a good job. What she got. I hope THE FITTEST is ten times better than this piece of crap!
