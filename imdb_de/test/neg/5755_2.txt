Return to Frogtown was a difficult movie. Well, I have accomplished this mission and she sat on the shelf for a while. I wish it would stay that way! First of all, Sam Hell is not Roddy Piper, of course. He is replaced by a guy with a big face and less charisma, and this poor actor is very quiet for the role! Sam Hell should be rebellious and ingenious. Here he is caught THREE times! What kind of hero is that ?! Spangle is also replaced by another actress here. Why did not we get different characters here? That was stupid! Lou Ferrigno plays the lead role in this movie and he is not even the hero. Common sense says Lou is the hero of the movie! Bad effects, bad acting and just a memorable movie. Funny, as they photograph with Ninja Turtles 2 with the entire concert scene in this film. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted Return to Frogtown, but I'm just banned at the beginning of the fight scenes. This movie makes Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid this, or you will be the one who "mean, green, turtle TV dinner!" Sings.
