Not so long ago, I bought a cheap VHS tape titled "Just Rambling Along," which allegedly featured Laurel and Hardy. Since I was somewhat familiar with their output and did not recognize that title, I made the torturous decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it. While playing, I identified the movie as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast and made the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. Worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like it was deceived by an 8 mm film source. It had a somewhat appropriate music. In all seriousness, the band is worth a price if you just want to get an idea of ​​what the movie looks like. In my opinion it is a decent, but unusual short form. IMDb was supposed to add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as the alternate title for this movie, which by the way was the name of a 1918 Stan Laurel movie!
