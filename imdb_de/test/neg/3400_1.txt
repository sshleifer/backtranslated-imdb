It was like someone wanted to shoot a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was terrible, the plugs for the directors, another movie that seemed to run every other minute. The video of the actual ghost hunt was more of a scary movie than an investigation of what happened. Thank you for 2 hours of my time! If there was evidence, it flew over! Most of them were just people talking about the place. The episode of the Ghosthunters show that went there completely destroys the way this show was. I'm so upset about the sci-fi channel that I played this, I have not seen it since the broadcast.
