OK, one night I and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie. Unfortunately we chose Ernest Goes to Africa. I've never laughed so much in my life. This movie is more than bad. I literally shit better movies than Ernest Goes to Africa. (I shit movies) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie for me was at least the opening sequence, as Ernest makes stupid faces. When they showed him with a peanut-sized head, I lost him. Maybe I thought it was so funny because at this point I was the highest. Maybe you are right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I'd guess it's "Ernest Goes to Africa." I have never seen a movie that relies more on the stereotypes of the 1950's colored people. There were times when words escaped me and I stared in awe. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, I could not help wondering if this movie was for kids. Do adult adults actually watch this? How could there be a whole bunch of "Ernest" movies? Is that really my life? Is that real? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
