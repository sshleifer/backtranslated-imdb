Why did Jeffery Combs take the lead with several well-known actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker)? Henrikson would have been perfect for the lead role, as well as Warner, Baker or others in the movie like Charles Napier. Combs was a failure in this regard and did a poor job. Everything he did seemed fake or artificial. <br /> <br /> The script is bad. In other words, if Lance Henrikson (or any other) had the lead role, he might have saved the movie (removed from my "waste of time" category), but it would still have been a bad movie. The video game was completely missing. The director should have recognized this and helped the film.
