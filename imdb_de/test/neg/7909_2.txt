I completely agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theater manager and told him, "This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen." I've seen a lot of movies with this person and he's pretty forgiving, so I was really shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was offended by the humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was high on the list!). My friend and I are white and saw the movie mostly with black people. For a while I thought, maybe I just will not get this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that nobody laughed. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; The timing was almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> There were a few funny moments, there was just too much time between them. Even Airplane Two was weirder than that, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt like I was enjoying this movie. No. <br /> <br /> DL Hughley was funny as always, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments as "the white one", but most of the other attempts at humor were far behind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I could not rate this movie with negative stars.
