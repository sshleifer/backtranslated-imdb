*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Mark Piznarski's "Here on Earth" holds the record for one Film with the most recycled material in 96 minutes. In the truest sense of the word, here are every device, every cliché and every known action element. There is nothing unique, original or fresh. God, what a tormenting movie to go through; I wish I had seen the movie during its theatrical release last year to earn on my worst list of my year. This is the kind of movie that makes the story immediately obvious and goes down from the opening balance, and worst of all, it takes it seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible and painful films that have come down the pike for some time. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a youthful heartbreaking movie, so it must contain some Hollywood movies The most valuable young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to take on such a bad role in a movie. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett fit this different description and take the lead roles by storm. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and outrageous student with a wealthy father (cliche # 1). He will graduate as a Valedictorian and Ivy League College in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson) visit. It sets up the stereotype "I do not want your life," in which the father tries to control his son's life while the son rebels against him. Throw Kelley's deceased mother, who committed suicide some time ago. When his father brings another woman home, he brutally questions his intentions (the cliché "no one can replace mother" counts as number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the other side of society at Kelley. His family owns a local diner. Join in his longtime love interest: Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), a waitress in the diner, covering for her sister (who has no purpose, instead of directing the following scene) when Jasper and Kelley behave like childish idiots by driving them with their cars and racing cars (oh no) crashed into the diner and set it on fire. (Conflict between rich and poor is counted as cliche # 3.) <br /> <br /> The battered chase brings both Kelley and Jasper into a constructive and plausible conflict. They get into trouble with the law, but since this movie feels the need to exist, the local judge gives them an alternative to pastime: they need to work together to rebuild the restaurant. <br /> <br /> The two boys work hard in the summer, get hard and have a nice tan. Samantha's gaze starts at Kelley and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants the best for his true love (cliche number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of her little romantic triangle (cliche number five), but she continues two timing Jasper without another thought. Her dad happens to be the local sheriff too, as surprising (we're counting melodramatic clump # 6). <br /> <br /> The fictitious romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there be a romantic tension? If the film is going to evoke involvement in Samantha's decision between the two young men, we need to see both characters from both sides. The film shows Jasper as a distraction from her "rightful love" Kelley. It is clear that Jasper really loves her, but it is also clear that she does not love him back. This makes the romantic tension at the beginning of the story absolutely bad. Leelee Sobieski does not harm here; However, her charm and friendly performance do not match a two-timing character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the movie does not give him anything to do except fight with Kelley. Chris Klein makes a name for himself here. He spends a large part of the movie shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately, he does not show his acting skills, maybe because he has very little. The minor cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood delivers the best performance in the movie, but does not have enough time to save just a few brief moments. I also enjoyed the performance of Stuart Wilson, who fits perfectly into the role of a rich, controlling father with a high social status. Then we lean exactly over an hour and ten minutes in the movie about Samantha's knee problems (another spoiler ahead). What's that, she has a serious, incurable disease (another device in the picture, about number eight). Her deadly illness brings the two competing young men together as friends. Well, at least I think the movie wanted to show that the loss of a loved one by two Nemes people can bring both together (cliche number nine). <Br /> <br /> Klein tries his valedictorian speech to show that his character is more than just a flat stereotype, but we've seen it so often that I prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental character would hide the actual feelings (cliche number, er, were it ten)? The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and crazy. A "Your Mother" comment triggers a fist fight as they rebuild the establishment. There is a retreading of "Armageddon" as Samantha and Kelley spread out in an open field, so damn horny as he slowly moves his fingers around their bodies and names areas after US cities (why not call the number eleven). The film uses alcohol as a means to enhance the romantic tension: A drunken Kelley makes a fool of himself after quarreling with Samantha Date, Jasper, but the following day he just wants to dance (cliche, oh no, I count no more).
