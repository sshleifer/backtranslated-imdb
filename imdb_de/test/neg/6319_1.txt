A meek New York lawyer (George Segal) is slowly getting crazy. He promised his father on his deathbed to NEVER send her senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later, he takes care of a senile, dangerous psychopath. He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fall in love. But his mother constantly scares her away. Segal is ready to kill her ... Ummmm ... THAT is a comedy? I have nothing against sick, black humor, but come on ... there must be limits! This film goes to the trouble of rubbing any tasteless joke he can imagine and rubbing his face in it. Too bad that none of the jokes is funny. The jokes include rape, nakedness, public humiliation, senile old people, curses and racism. Basically, this is a movie that thinks he's smart, trying to shock people and thinking they laugh about it. I was disgusted and did not even laugh. The film is pathological, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The cast was the only thing that watched me. Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is pretty good too. But the script is against her. The only interesting (not funny) was a pointless court scene with Rob Reiner Jr. (and tried to see his then wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie could have been worse. -The original ending had brought Segal to bed with his MOTHER and pretended to be Poppa! That was (fortunately) changed. <br /> <br /> A really lousy, sick movie. Bottom of the barrel. I give a 1.
