Following on from the popular and beloved comeback classic that touches the lives of adolescent teenagers, George Lucas' American Graffiti, we have Cooley High. A kind of adaptation by Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular CBS sitcom Good Times of the 1970s. Cooley High was and is considered a black version of American Graffiti. In American Graffiti we have the black slum of Chicago Cabrini Green as the background for the story here. Instead of America in 1962, Cooley High is in 1964. The movie stars Welcome Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman are the main protagonists of the film and its main characters. Garrett Morris is the lead actor who tries to keep most of Jacobs' and Toweran's characters, called Coceise and Preach, out of trouble. <br /> <br /> You know, Cooley High is a worthy comparison to American Graffiti or that it's a great movie, but I can not. The problem lies in the fact that the producers of the film could not or would not hide the sad bottom of black life in America. The movie in the Cabrini Green section of Chicago does not help. <br /> <br /> Also, crass gross attempts of humor here are not. When Coceise looks for a letter of intent from a college, he finds that his little brother has thrown down a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of the gangs called Pooter is doused by a monkey with dung. When the character of the Turman, Preach, is hunted at school (two dirty and oppressive places where one can meet far fewer people) at school, he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl relieves himself he escapes through the Window of the same bathroom! The gymnasium, the houses of the characters, the bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film shows the unfortunate view of urban decay and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, that would be the gross portrayal of humor in the movie. The use of violence and obscenities in film. Although Cooley High is a grown-up movie, it's a harsh and rugged film image with little or no joke and a love of nostalgia that made American graffiti so popular and appreciated. <br /> <br /> Motown Records was involved in the film. The music of the company was part of the film's soundtrack. But even here you get the same old feeling, as if you had heard these songs a million times before. Not that they were not great songs, but black music. At the time, it was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song nearing the end of the film was released by the Spinners' G.C. Cameron was not that impressive. There were better Motown ballads that were undoubtedly made by better Motown artists than Cameron. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie shows where the characters went to pay tribute to the movie Cooley High, American Graffiti. It shows that Preach, an intelligent but below-average student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have been designed as a towering figure. The last shot of Preach leaving before the funeral of Coceise lasted on a dark, rainy afternoon and all the desolation that was Cooley High. Eric Monte had through Preach and this last scene a little lesson for us all when we saw Cooley High and for the love of the past. Do not look back.
