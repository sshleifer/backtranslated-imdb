Personally, I have not really won much from THE ACT OF SEEING OF EES EYES. I've found a lot of really high rated reviews for the movie here, and I'm kind of surprised. Maybe I missed something that made other reviewers feel "moved", but I found the movie rather boring and basically pointless. <br /> <br /> The "action" of the film is a pile of autopsy footage that is filmed in a movie art-house style - lots of extreme close-ups, weird cuts etc ... and no sound or dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think the act of seeing with your own eyes can be considered as a study of human anatomy or maybe (if you really want to dig a bit) some kind of commentary on the fragility of humanity or whatever - but personally I found it a bunch of semi-interesting, but ultimately boring autopsy. If that's your thing then this will be a winner for you. As for me, I have seen more interesting ER material. Not a "bad" movie, as it's not really a "movie" in the traditional sense - I just did not find anything really special about it - 4/10.
