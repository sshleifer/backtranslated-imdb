Let me start by loving the book and loving the A & E miniseries. I had hoped to love this movie, and I was absolutely ready to grant it a moderate artistic license to interpret and abbreviate the story itself. However, this film hardly resembles the original book. If only "the names had been changed to protect the innocent," I might have enjoyed the film as an entertaining, if inaccurate, periodical piece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name "Mr. Darcy" refers to an emotional and weak character who gives the name of "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, sneaky, often tearsome guy who does not care about the rules of society interested and "Mr. Bingley" to a completely ruined fool makes the idea that the director Jane Austen had read original story. <br /> <br /> There are some really outstanding moments in this movie - maybe 10 minutes are really great. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins proposal starts wonderfully. She is 27 years old (pretty close to the time of hopeless bachelors), she becomes a burden to her family and she is not romantic. She just wants "a comfortable home". The beautiful dialogue, however, is ruined when she bubbles: "Do not judge me, Elizabeth, do not you dare to judge me!" and runs in tears. Later you see Charlotte in front of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who did not stand in her character at all, as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good moment is when Darcy arrests Elizabeth at home while traveling around with her aunt and uncle. This was done well in the A & E series, but the film version starring Keira Knightley made the audience feel just how humiliating that moment must have been for Elizabeth. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The ending also showed a liking between Elizabeth and Darcy, which was not so obvious in the miniseries. I really valued this scene simply because I like to see a happy ending instead of just knowing it happened. Overall, however, this film has eliminated the subtlety that was an integral part of Austen's pride and prejudice. The characters speak a horrible combination of Austen's dialogue and modern sentences and colloquialisms. Information that was only suggested or suggested in the original work is clearly noted in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's just a short movie, Yada Yada. But making a superficial love story out of a complex, beautiful book is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some have said that they loved the moment Darcy first saw Elizabeth because it's so obviously about "love at first sight". Love at first sight? Huh One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth should not be a traditional beauty and Darcy loves her for her wit and liveliness. He literally loves her for her mind. <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first suggestion) when the two of them yelled angrily as they leaned closer ... and came closer ... and almost kissed ... but suddenly step apart fuss! What a sad clich√©. They are angry and disgusted with each other but so dressed that it does not matter that they do not even like each other (at the time)? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really looked like another story. Mr. Bennet was grumpy, Elizabeth was usually as stupid as her younger sisters. Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own - as opposed to the intelligent, somewhat scheming woman with a wealth of common sense of romance. Jane and Elizabeth's relationship is up-to-date rather than the deep-rooted love and admiration that they should have for each other. <br /> <br /> All this I could have accepted as a mere interpretation of the novel, but I declined to accept all this in addition to the many, many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley walked barely dressed (her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight underwear). Elizabeth walked naked to Netherfield and was allowed to fly everywhere. The family lazies one morning, although the morning should be reserved to call acquaintances (or called at your home). Elizabeth went barefoot into her nightgown. And in a really horrific scene, Bingley went into Jane's bedroom and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she got sick. <br /> <br /> Most people would consider this insignificant, but I wanted either either a historically accurate film or B.) a precise representation of the characters of the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / one who sacrificed accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a banal love story at first sight. I can admit that those who have not read the book or are unfamiliar with the social conventions of the time can easily like this movie, and there is nothing wrong with that. I simply could not overcome my desire to watch a movie that included more than just two pretty faces.
