A former IMDb reviewer has stated that "Rafter Romance" is a "rip-off" (that's the name of the other reviewer) of a German musical called "Me By Day, You By Night". Apparently, the reviewer does not know that * both of these films have borrowed their premise from 'Box and Cox', an English play written in 1847 by John Maddison Morton. This piece is about two craftsmen renting the same room from an unscrupulous landlady. Every man believes himself as the sole tenant. Since the two men have different work schedules, the list is not discovered immediately. This piece was once so popular in the UK that "Box and Cox" became a general term for an arrangement in which two people agreed to share accommodation intended for one person only. <br /> <br /> The innovation of 'Rafter Romance' (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance. As usual in these Cornball films, the guy and the girl loathe each other until they fall into each other's arms. Hoo boy. <br /> <br /> The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney, a character actor who specializes in playing Jewish clichés that should be sympathetic. George Sidney has never been as annoying as the hideous Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but Sidney's depictions of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing when observed. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable thing about 'Rafter Romance' To my knowledge, this is the first Hollywood film to refer to Hitler and the rise of National Socialism. At one point in this movie, landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his adolescent son Julius chalking swastikas on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are supposed to be Jewish. Although no one in Hollywood in 1933 had a clear idea of ​​what Hitler intended for the Jews in Europe ... yet it is surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who considers swastikas a joke. His father is quite angry about this representation of the Nazi symbol. A very shameful aspect of Hollywood's history is the documented fact that all the major Hollywood studios continued doing business with the Third Reich until 1939. Hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as "Aryans", leaving their films in Nazi Germany and Austria could be disseminated. For the same reason, Hollywood's leading men were documented as "Aryan and uncircumcised." With the exception of Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all Hollywood studio executives involved in this policy were Jewish ... but obviously did not mind doing business with Hitler. I am surprised that "Rafter Romance" contains a scene in which swastikas are adversely represented, as this sequence would have made the film banned in Germany and Austria. (Perhaps the scene was cut out for the German release: it's not critical to the storyline of the movie.) Besides, the movie does not contain anything notable. Robert Benchley does his usual dull, confused characterization: I never understood the attraction of this man. I will rate 'Rafter Romance' with 4 out of 10 points.
