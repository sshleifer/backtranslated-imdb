Sex, drugs, rock & roll is undoubtedly the worst product of Western civilization. The monologues are both uninteresting and meaningless. In the rare monologue, which attracts the attention of the audience, he is quickly lost through overly repetitive and unnecessary additions (The Hells Angels of McDonalds). I think Bogosian's One Man show needed filler to give you the length that justified it for the ticket price. <br /> <br /> I would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained from my blood, than to see sex, drugs, rock & roll again.
