It's not often that I give a horror movie two stars because horror is my favorite genre. A movie can be bad in that it is not a masterpiece, but may be entertaining due to inadvertent wit, bizarre characters, and so on. An example of this are numerous horror / science fiction films from the 40s to 80s. They are a pleasure for genre-connoisseurs and connoisseurs of guilt because their "badness" is entertaining. However, this film has none of the humorous or effective bloody scenes of the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I suppose it was the heyday of political correctness in 1995, so the gore on television was kept to a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with the C.S.I. shows, TV is an absolute blood festival! (Good for us horror fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original stars of 1978). It's not the mistakes of Katt and Paul, but the writers and directors who created this lukewarm turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I will not say because that's part of the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> This TV movie probably had a bigger budget than the original, but flopped as a good horror, according to users' reviews. Stick to the original from 1978 when you're in the mood for a killer fish movie!
