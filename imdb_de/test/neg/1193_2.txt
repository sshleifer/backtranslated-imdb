I'm a big fan of the LoG. I thought that the first two series were the best comedy this country has ever seen, and the third series, though different, is wonderfully dark and resourceful. The thought of seeing Tubbs, Edward, and Briss on the big screen made July 3 a wait. But somewhere everything went terribly wrong. The authors had no history and no real ideas. The part that plays in Old England shows the brilliant shimmer that we know they command the League, but these scenes did not go well with the movie. Geoff delivered the best of too few, mostly bad jokes, and the performances of Lipp and Briss were a big disappointment. If you love the league, save yourself time and money and watch episodes from the TV series again. And again. A massive disappointment.
