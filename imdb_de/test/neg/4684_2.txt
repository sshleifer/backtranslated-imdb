That's terrible, you just could not believe it. The score is annoying, the filming is bad, for example you sometimes see the shadow of the cameraman on the faces of some actors. The quality of the film is extremely bad, seems to have been done in the 1920s. It is terrible. There is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the film, but always too dark filmed. No gore no impact. The director did something better like Blood Rites. But out there is a follower of the man: Finding this cheap movie is not that hard, but you have to pay hard earned money for it. Surely this will get into my top ten worst horror movies of all time. I do not know if I would call it horror. There is too much talk, after watching you become bloodthirsty
