This is a family movie that aired a few days ago at 1:00 am on my local ITV station. This may be a strange decision on the part of the organizers, but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange movie that is so strange that it does not want to upset its audience. Come on, there's nothing kids like more than sadism, so Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children. This also explains why DOCTOR WHO has been so successful around the world. In this script, you just die because the pulp fiction author does something bad to the kids, but that does not happen. I'm not advocating child abuse, but seeing how Howard Spitz lost his rag to the kids would have made the movie a little better. Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had all gone PC? I mean, if you're shooting a movie that revolves around an author of kids who hates kids, should not show the story and not tell it? <br /> <br /> Much of the problem is with director Vadim Jean, and you feel he does not know how to handle the material, which is bad news for the movie. As mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden. I suppose he was trying to play the blind spot just like in this show he's famous for, but it does not work here and there are many scenes with silly, ridiculous camera angles that seem inadvertent but very distracting. But at the end of the day, the main problem remains that the potential is being ruined because nobody wanted to offend the sensibility of the audience
