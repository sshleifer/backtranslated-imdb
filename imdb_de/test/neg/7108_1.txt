My poor tank maid, they ignored everything great about you. Why is there as little as possible to do with the comics? I loved a movie that followed the plot, or at least had the characters right. <br /> <br /> WHY WAS TANK GIRL American? She is Austrian, damn it! And she does not live in a post-apocalyptic war zone, she lives in the outback with Booga like a savage. She does it because she wants to live that way, not because she has to do it because Malcolm Mc Dowell plays the idiot. And why does she care about these children? The only children in the comics are suffocated by her violently, it is terrible that they have made her a lame mother figure. <br /> <br /> And my poor Jet Girl and Sub Girl! In the comics, Jet is a sarcastic Wisecracker and Sub Girl is ... another sarcastic Wisecracker with a funny sense of humor. In the movie Jet is this miserable little thing and Sub is this fat, middle-aged witch. And Booga does not look or behave the way he intended. Although was the hot love for the US box office too much? The humor was so lame too. What happened to all the stuff about the Smiths and that brilliant slang they used all the time? What's that line? "Will that take a long time? I do not want to miss Baywatch."? Even programs for small children can come up with better material.
