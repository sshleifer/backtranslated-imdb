I'm not joking: There's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits its head on a tunnel key and explodes (without a fireball) into a million pieces! It made a kid scream in front of me! ... in a G-Rated movie! <br /> <br /> This film could be used to convince children that Santa Claus is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, exaggerated and mean! When Santa Claus appears (here an anagram of Satan!), All 200,000 elves begin to sing, "Santa Claus is coming to town" as if it were a Druidic war song. Then, in the reflection of the "Rosebud" object of this film (a jingle bell that whispers why you do not hear it ring: "doubt ... doubt ...)", old Saint Nick, who looks like one Donald Sutherland stoic, his face radiating like Moses' from "K10C". When we hear him speak, his thundering voice sounds less like a happy old elf and more like James Earl Jones' voice, which declines by about 20% br /> <br /> The syrupy music is inappropriate, boring and repetitive and does not follow emotional threads (as in "Titanic's very effective score"). It does not seem to be thrown in at certain places one after another. It does not create a feeling of warmth and magic, it does not move, also because it does not fit with the pictures of the film in the happy, childish POLKA about the title locomotive that sounds like the whole movie as if he had gone into production! <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm back with some other reviewers on how, well ... "dead" everyone looks. Sometimes it seems a bit macabre. The motion capture technique is good for the Kings Island-like roller coaster train sequences to be convincing from afar, but close up "real" actors should have been used. All in all a nice eye-catcher for the time in front of the TV, but not much else.
