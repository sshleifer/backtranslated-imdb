I agree with what so many others have said about the flat and offensive nature of the racism investigation in this film. It is confusing to me that so many people seem to have been betrayed by their presumption. I'd like to cite the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most angry about this movie. Here is a man who, in contrast to the film's underlying message that we are all a LITTLE racist, effectively rape a woman in public, cruelly humiliates her husband, and purposely motivates him to take that step, like him It does know, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after he pulled the couple for no legal reason, but because, as we understand it, we are black and rich and he is an injured little boy who is now the police and therefore can do what he wants. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing for me that this extreme of racism is held alongside the behavior of another character - with its paranoid stereotypes about gang violence - to show that everyone is a LITTLE racist. Later, we feed some delicacies on Dillon's poor old father and how black people drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain or explain this behavior worse? And is Dillon's character supposed to redeem himself by committing the totally unmotivated and unbelievable, ridiculously random act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the night before? You're welcome. The fact that so many people seem to feel a kind of self-belief in this film makes me saddened by the superficial understanding of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and end it.
