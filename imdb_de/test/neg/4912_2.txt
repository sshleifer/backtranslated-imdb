Emraan Hashmi's post MURDER played some good roles in Bhatt films, but another director was just using his kisses and his cheeky image. AKSAR is one of them and came to AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row and I was there I already had enough of him and such roles. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice twist at the beginning. I felt like a Abbas Mustan movie, but then it becomes a routine movie with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climax. <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a horrible movie Music Saves Grace Camera work is fabulous <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi just repeats his act of his earlier films and has two expressions in Dino that look stark. speaks as if he practices Hindi and is okay in some scenes. Udita is expressionless and irritated
