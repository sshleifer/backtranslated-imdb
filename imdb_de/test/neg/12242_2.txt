The spoof genre, which has been lacking in creativity and humor for some time now, is once again spat by hacks without talent. No point, no fun, no originality; Only a few cheap dollars for the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It takes more than just referring to some recent movies and assigning names with double meaning as satire; Make people laugh. Every lump can take a camcorder, and some bad buddies in cheap costumes have imitated someone. As this genre is an inspiring sports movie, there are a few lame references that are rejected on films of this type: The jokes are so weak that the characters have to highlight the references in various ways to laugh hysterically. It does not work. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy. The same old, worn-out "jokes" that were ripped from a middle school washroom (even simpler than usual) are all here. If that is not enough, a "gag" of a bus overflows someone. So funny, right? In addition, a pathetically bad scene performs more product placement than Michael Bay. again with the same listless results. A musical bit flutters miserably. Too bad that Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now had such roles in the torrent. <br /> <br/> Lousy beyond words. Watching a snail at the marathon would be less boring than watching this movie. Probably also much funnier.
