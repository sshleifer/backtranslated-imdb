Veteran TV Director Ted Post treats us to a plotted, confused and ultimately pointless story, taken from Column B of Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. In front of a smoky Phoenix skyline, Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith sees off a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times" while JFK imitator James Franciscus lurks at the edges. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models lean against vintage cars, and Smith is constantly staged by Sybil Danning until a giallo-style wrap-up puts the whole sad mess to a bitter end brings. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bob Mitchum is there too. Somewhere.
