The adventures of Hercules must be one of the lame excuses for a movie I've encountered so far. You would have to search far and wide to find something that would approach the level of incompetence displayed in this movie. Acting Art ?? Bad. To edit ?? Bad. Direction ?? Bad. Special effects ?? Bad and laughable. Plot ?? Bad. Lighting ?? Bad. Cinematography? Bad. Costume Design ?? Bad and stupid. Everything else ?? Bad. Seeing the adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real test of endurance. This is one for masochists or Lou Ferrigno completeists (if any). <br /> <br /> Eight things I've learned by watching the adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you do not have the budget for real special effects, a scene from the previous one rotoskope Movie. It will look great - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. Take time for frequent stops to oil your body in search of Zeus' flashbulbs. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions. <br /> <br /> 3. Every sword fight, the use of magic and almost all other everyday activities in ancient Greece produced a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to replenish the duration of your crappy movie, expand the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and add some overly grandiose music. It's also helpful if you have a previous movie from which you can draw scenes. <br /> <br /> 6. Fighting scenes move much smoother as the bad guys attack Hercules one after another. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did everything for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I did not think so, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first movie, Hercules (1983), look like an Oscar winner.
