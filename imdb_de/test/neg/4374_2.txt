Chuck Norris plays the lead role as Danny, a police officer who has knocked down a massive serial killer. When the killer escapes, Danny knows he's the only one who can stop the terror. Danny, however, holds a secret. He knows that the terror was arrested and even more fortunate that Danny survived. Now is the last fight, but is Danny ready? Right there my description says what the problem of this movie is. Norris plays a wimpy hero who is still suffering from mental trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller. In the hands of a Norris thriller, it just makes him ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. Also on board is Steve James of American Ninja and Ron O'Neal of Superfly, but any attempt at character development is defeated by the hideous script. There is also hardly any action and I have always preferred a Norris movie with more fights and less speeches. Given the rating on this site, I can not be alone. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bath)
