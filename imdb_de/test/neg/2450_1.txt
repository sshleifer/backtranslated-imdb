I ticked the box "contains spoilers" if I say anything that is a spoiler and do not realize that I said it until I read it again after I posted it. Well, it's just in case. Anyway, back to the discussion of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie earlier this afternoon on skymovies, and by the description Sky gives you (these people have to be acidic), it sounded pretty good, but when I did actually had about 30 minutes, I was horrified. This movie, in my opinion, has the worst script and actors / actresses of all time. The young girl, who falls in love with the boy from LA after about 3 hours, is a really stupid, lame figure, who has an annoying, whiny voice and baffled hair. -.-. Then there is her lover, who is an idiot and also very weepy. Actually, maybe they fit together. Then there is the mother of the boy who is on vacation with him and surprise, surprise - she is a doctor and - oh my god, wait, there are more unexpected surprises! On the island suddenly breaks out a virus and she knows everything about viruses! = O. SHOCKHORROR! Yes exactly. Lol. Then there is this insane religious boy who is constantly talking about "inheritance" or something and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love him, but he's actually a stubborn, arrogant body pumped with steroids (you really only have to watch this movie for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a bath, his head is tiny and His body is MASSIVE, it's hilarious, a buffoon who drank way too much. <br /> <br /> Despite all these crazy characters, including a stoned-looking taxi driver, the religious guy finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood test, and they immediately set about finding the cure, because for some reason he has been dramatically saved, all on "Erbs and God." AND OH MY GOD YES, there is one more surprise !! You will never know what! Only eleven minutes before the end, until all on the island are dead, including her son and his girl, she finds the remedy and injects everyone and everything is done !!! What a wretched F ilm I mean, I knew it was going to be an obvious ending when I started to look at it, but actually I thought it was good and had some subplots somewhere, but no, no, it was just boring and dry / > <br /> Do not look at this movie. You'll end up like me in the end - baffled for 3 hours and then claiming the one and a half hours that you've spent in your life.
