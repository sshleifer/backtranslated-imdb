I know that curiosity killed the cat, but I just had to see Psycho's remake, especially after I recently went on a Hitchcok trip and knew his work. I've been watching the Original Psycho since I was a kid, I knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent movie! In fact one of the best! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was "How do you recreate perfection?". I stuck to that, too, but I think I'm more open now, thinking that maybe it was a way to introduce Psycho to a new generation. <br /> <br /> But this became a total insult and a blow to the face of the original psycho. I know this was said, but I watched the genesis of this movie, and the director was like, "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot every scene like the original footage," what's the damn point? ! OK, but I want to judge this movie for yourself, although the original is insulting. I mean, the acting was not up to date, but honestly, it seemed like the actors just watched the original and memorized the lines from there and made it their own crappy one. <br /> <br /> In this movie I wanted to beat Anne Hasche, she said, "I have never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, that made me mad, because honestly, it's not just that, she really took that role as Marian, she was not convincing, not to mention that her shower scene was really awful. Vince Vaughn did not do ... just let's just say it, the movie was terribly wrong. This was a sin against film and on its own, that was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what a new generation could have been a new launch. But to Gus, let the movie do the one who KNOWS WHAT YOU DO! <br /> <br /> 1/10
