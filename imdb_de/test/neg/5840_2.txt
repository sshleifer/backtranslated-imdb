This film has a premise that is good enough to make someone talk and a starting point for a safe conversation. "Would you sleep with someone you do not like or do not know for a million dollars?" While the movie had a lot of potential, the bad execution makes it a b-grade soap opera. The movie has a big head start, and after the proposal was made, we're really into the movie, but it falls dramatically. The last three quarters of the movie are spent by characters moaning, complaining and regretting what they did! The end was so stereotypical that I had tears! This is a very similar premise to Honeymoon in Vegas, which is much better. See that instead.
