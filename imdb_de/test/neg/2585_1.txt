Well, of course everyone has the right to have an opinion about something ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film from the year 1968, student manifestations, general strike, youth, ideals, love ... etc. I'm sorry, but I felt no love, romance. A lover with whom his girlfriend is okay, no matter who? This is love? But not only that, the movie is very long and for no reason I had to stop several times because I just lost interest. I was waiting for something to happen, but ....... NOTHING. The only thing that impressed me during the movie: Gypsy-Fiddlers play in the street, that was nice. I do not think that art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Big disappointment and a waste of time!
