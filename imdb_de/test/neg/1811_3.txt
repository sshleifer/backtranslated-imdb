To be honest, I've never been to Congo or even Africa, and after seeing the movie Heart of Darkness, I do not think I want that. The film completely shames the book to the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best I've ever read, I seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more. Nicolas Roeg, the director of the film, has done a terrible job and portrayed Joseph Conrad's novella in a movie. I give some credit to Roeg for trying to make the impossible possible by turning the book into a movie, but this may not have been his job. The film could not express any other part of the novel than the fundamentals of the plot. The stage setting and the scenery also lacked the beauty that Conrad portrayed in the book Africa. Marlow had seen so many great wonders in the book, but you did not have the same experience in the movie. No, I do not blame the director for everything; The acting in the movie was just awful. All actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the movie, I felt like the actors were not emanating emotions, as if they were reading from the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not portray Marlow's sense of adventure for his trip to Congo. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz should be daring, but I did not experience that in the movie. I would not recommend the movie, especially if you have already read the book. It does not come close to the approach to Joseph Conrad's novel. Conrad's words captivate the reader and take him on a journey with Marlow, in search of Mr. Kurtz, where the film did not. A great novella, but a very bad movie. Heart of Darkness, the movie, is based on the book by Joseph Conrad, also known as the Heart of Darkness.
