I'd heard a lot of bad things about this movie before I saw it, but I thought all the negative comments were probably due to the movie's low budget and bad acting - both of which I can handle when it comes to zombies Films goes. What I did not expect is that this movie is really boring; If there is one thing to rely on for low-budget zombies whose thrills and entertainment - but unfortunately, this movie has none. I'm pretty surprised, because the last two horror movies I've seen of director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both very inventive and entertaining films, but children should not play with dead things. The plot follows a group of young adults who travel to a funeral island to engage in rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they soon learn that playing with things they do not understand is a really stupid idea, if their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island revel in their blood! <br /> <br /> The acts sound as if they could lead to a decent movie, but I did not mention that the interesting parts begin only in the last twenty minutes. And since this is a ninety-minute movie, I'm sure that's not a good thing. The opening hours and ten minutes are filled with bad demeanor and even worse characters. I can understand how to set up a situation so that the horror gets stronger as soon as it comes; but please, if you spend so long, you have to make it really interesting. All the characters in the movie are exaggerated and annoying, and I wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. The movie is not in vain, however, as the atmosphere is extraordinary. Seven years later, Lucio Fulci showed how an isolated island and carnivorous zombies mix well; but Bob Clark has already done it with this movie. The direction is also not bad, but is affected by bad makeup effects and a pronounced lack of blood, which fans of zombie movies will probably not like. Overall, I really can not recommend this movie. But if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you can make a kick out of it.
