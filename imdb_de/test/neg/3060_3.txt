It is too kind to call this the "fictional" Barker gang account. They had the names right, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Russell is still hot, I'll give it to you, but that's not the true Ma Barker, who basically took care of the boys and cooked support, if they have moved around the country, not through planning or participation in the crime. I think it would have been far more interesting to portray the real story of a middle-aged woman involved in the criminal activities of her children and her cronies. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with those reviewers who do this The shoot-out scenes were absolutely incredible. The Barker / Karpis casualties were a combination of innocent and law-enforcement agents who persecuted them, but they have not mowed half a dozen FBI agents each time they were cornered. (On the other hand, the FBI of that time, as several books have described lately, has emphasized the idea that agents come only from legal or accounting circumstances, provided that many agents have little experience with law enforcement agencies or firearms trained agents we introduce ourselves today.) <br /> <br /> But the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically boring. Nobody changes, nobody grows. We know that the end of the road is ahead of us, we just do not know what shooting result it will be. <br /> <br /> Only for diehard Russell fans.
