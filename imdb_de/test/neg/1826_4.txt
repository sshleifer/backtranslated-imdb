I had high expectations for this film, but I feel disappointed. I bought it for $ 5 on a used VHS slot, and the version I bought was the English dubbed version. The synchronization is terrible, so watch out. "Lola" was not as good in this movie as in "Run Lola Run", and the villain just came out of nowhere. And "Lola" starts to understand what's going on when she gets to university. Seems to me unrealistic. I also wondered if the original version contained American songs in the soundtrack ... they seemed extremely out of place. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it would rock.
