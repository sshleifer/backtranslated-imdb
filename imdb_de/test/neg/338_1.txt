I have over 10 years old computer games with better special effects! The plot is choppy and very predictable. Most actors seem like experienced extras! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like seeing a crew of "Scotties" from Star Trek without the personality or the charm. Unnecessary scenes of people setting up tents! Tents with the supposed high-tech equipment! Actors who looked as if they were not sure if the camera was aimed at them. Nothing that interests you, whether these people survive or not! Looks like somebody was doing it in the backyard and in the garage with low-end equipment! Nothing seems original or even entertaining. Do not waste your time!
