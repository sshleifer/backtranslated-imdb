The film is perfect for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Beautiful landscape. The only highlight was the alligator during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end, when Caribe drowns, is definitely a Hollywood prop. There is no specific action. It goes from the Venezuelan landscape to the rip-off of a simple rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter who for some reason goes crazy and ends up getting it. A film with a very low budget that could be shot anywhere with Venezuelan outtakes. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made some very good movies. Like all actors, everyone has to have at least one bad movie. Do not waste the $ 5.00 on the DVD.
