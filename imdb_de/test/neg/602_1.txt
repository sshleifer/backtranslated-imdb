This movie had terrible lighting and terrible camera movements. This movie is a nervous horror movie of no importance. The slashes look totally wrong. It looks like a 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old boy made it. With the worst acting you can ever find. People are tired of the knives. At least for weapons or fire. It has almost exact lines from "When A Stranger Calls". With cruel murders only crazy people would enjoy this movie. It is obvious that the author has no children or cares about them. I mean at some mercy. To sum it up, this movie is a "B" movie and it's shitty. Just for your own sake, do not think about spending your time watching that crappy movie.
