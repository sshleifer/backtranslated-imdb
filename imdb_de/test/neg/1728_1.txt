I got madder as this movie progressed. <br /> <br /> Basically, Dr. Ing. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor will hit Earth. The "rulers who will be" do not believe him, so he sets up a survival home in a mountain for a small gathering of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a fortunate reporter for a trashy tabloid that gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead, something is going on in the mountains. He sets out to search. <br /> <br /> While he's trying to get into the secret survival home, Jake spends a lot of time killing people or beating them within an inch of their lives. He spends the rest of his time with Dr. Crawford, who gave the doctor the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. I thought I wish Jake would do a great favor to the future and make a gun on himself. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this turkey.
