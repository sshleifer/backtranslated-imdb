I had high hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD: "In the Spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After I had gone through that, I realized that I only blew $ 2.50 to to rent it. This movie started slowly and slowly slowed down. Short and fleeting moments of lightness proved that it was in the spirit of American Pie to mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or funny! Do not be fooled as I was, and expect something that is barely visible, because this movie will oppress you more than entertaining you. "I have to fill three more lines for this stupid movie that does not deserve the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorant nonsense." This movie hurt, even the short nudity was shit!
