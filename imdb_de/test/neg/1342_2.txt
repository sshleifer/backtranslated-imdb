George Cukor's The Women is still one of the glittering gems of 1939, Hollywood's goldenest of the golden years. The film crackled and ignited and the absence of men was a subtle touch that was barely noticeable due to the good conversation. <br /> <br /> Flash Forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City in front of Saks. Large crowds are bustling along the avenue ... but there is something going on. The picture shows only well-dressed (attractive and young) women. More sinister than I Am Legend continues the visual concept in the store and later on a major fashion show. Which NYC fashion show does not have at least 5 gay men? The rule "No men" is rammed through our throats and creates a strange world that is out of balance and distracts. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, who first sees dug in her backyard with a ridiculous get-up and her retro locks and banging arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. Later in the film, she transforms into an older Jennifer Aniston look and holds her arms at her sides. This purposely seems to be like saying, "Look, I can still be relevant!" Ryan's character is packed with a bunch of missing friends (insert here the comparison of sex and city), which would despise each other if it were real life. Annette Bening plays the power slut who realizes in the course of the movie that her lifelong dream does not really make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power lesbian who has no use for the men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice for the bad girl, to say the least. She looks wrong, looks wrong, and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat. Someone's comment that she saw Trans-Gender was just right. Other stars appear to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved that would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have called their price, stuck their tongues firmly in the cheeks, and pulled out something very clever and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks too much for this kind of exploitation. Instead, we get this thing that comes awkwardly without twinkling. Entire dialog sections from the original are raised and brought into a scene with terrible results. At one point, Ryan calls something in the direction: "This is not a movie from the 1930s!" No, that's not it.
