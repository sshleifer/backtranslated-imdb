I will only write more because it is required. However, the summary I attach above is far too verbose for what this movie was. You know pretty well who's in it from the start. Despite his attempts to plan twists and turns - to work "talent" that strives to show shock and dismay when a twist occurs, you never really have to wonder about "Whodunit" in this "mystery". <br /> <The more I write, the more I feel bad that I have to write so much to have a comment, but rules are rules. I feel really bad when I say that, but this is the lowest I've ever rated for a movie ... I think. I wonder why I save the votes of 1 and 2. However, I thought this movie deserved a 3 because I believe the movie has a talent. Johanna Watts (or is it Watson) did a pretty good job. She cried and was upset in one part and I thought that she would convey that feeling well. The man who played the character who was "the drummer" was also good for his short role. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors did an "ok" job. But lead actor David - forgetting his last name (awful by name) - was pretty bad. I think he must have thought he made dramatic productions for The Boys and the Troubled or Days of our Life. If you try, you can just imagine him in a white lab coat and play a doctor with several personalities in the General Hospital. It does not help that the movie is even shot like a soap a day. I am pretty sure that I could shoot this movie synonymous with a camcorder. but without the obvious and soapy sound editing. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I thought the money to rent this movie was wasted. However, I would not look at it again unless I received a large sum of money.
