I can not believe the number of reviewers who think this is realistic. I am a million miles from an expert, and I will never climb a mountain. But even the basic knowledge gained through reading Into Thin Air and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and several other Everest documents meant that the film became more and more ridiculous over time. At the beginning there are some good climbing photos; and when the billionaire Head of Mission asks early in the film, "How much experience do you have over 8,000 meters?" I was encouraged to hope that this could be a fat and accurate human-nature odyssey. Instead, you have a number of climbers who climb up a mountain without acclimatization. Climbing in full sun with full glasses, and they are barely out of breath to perform miraculous endurance. A bit of fatigue is suggested only near the summit to dramatically emphasize the physical performance of the rise of such a monstrous summit, almost like an afterthought. If you have no knowledge about mountaineering, take a look at it: Be prepared for some clichéd exploits (though no smarter than a hundred other passable distracting streaks), and for a clichéd conclusion. I developed a little fascination for the high mountains and was looking forward to seeing K2. But apart from a stunningly beautiful landscape, it was a flop because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that some experts were busy creating this movie, but were ignored in pursuit of the heroic and sadly fantastic plot. You would also sound like a tit when you say "welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
