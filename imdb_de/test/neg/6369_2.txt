I recently went to the cinemas to see the new (2007) version of Bridge to Teribithia. After that, I went to the library to rent the older version without having to pay it again. I have to say that I was extremely disappointed! I thought the older version had both terrible acting and hackneyed lines, including Jessie, who said, "I know Daddy, but I hurt so much after Leslie died, it was pretty gruesome, and the casting was in my opinion Not much better, I watched in amazement all the time and said, no wonder they did it again, the story is great, but trust me to spend the money and see the new version See old ones, you may never experience the true magic of Teribithia.
