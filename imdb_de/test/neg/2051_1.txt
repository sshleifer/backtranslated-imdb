Bled begins when young artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham). She lands in her studio, where he gives her the bark of a tree that is used as a hallucinogenic drug when melted down. Sai quickly becomes addicted as she enters an alternate fantasy reality involving vampiric creatures. Sai's photographer friend Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic) worries about her as she drifts away from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug. Can Royce kick her or will she ruin her life and why did the mysterious Renfield addict her? in the first place and the sophisticated fantasy dreams like travel have a meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced & directed by Christopher Hutson. This anemic Arty vampire strip is pretty boring for 95 minutes and pervades all bad comments earned. The script was written by the interestingly named Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell do you pronounce that at all?), Which is also referred to as a production designer. Its unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in Bled, I suppose. The creators wanted to make a very serious fantasy-based horror movie with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and date rape. Most of the film is spent on the drug issue, with Sai's first introduction to the drug, how tall the first time was, and how she becomes hopelessly addicted, ultimately destroying her life and the lives of her friends. It's never explained where she gets this drug since Renfield only gives her a little at her first meeting, but hey, who cares? The first twenty minutes of Bled are really boring and boring, the next hour is not much better than the last ten minutes when a vampire monster and Renfield make a resurgence. The moral elements are condescending, the fantasy elements are retroactive and the horror does not exist. There is also a dialogue that is awful, each sentence trying to be profound, having a lot of hidden depth, trying to be so meaningful that it gets boring to listen. <br /> <br /> The concept of the movie is terrible and so is the execution, as there is absolutely no anger or violence to talk about, and the whole thing is in an apartment that does not seem to have any lights. The fantasy environment looks a bit better, but is sparsely seen and little used. There is no fear here, no atmosphere. To make matters worse, the creators have decided to use muted colors that I just hate and find it annoying. What's wrong with a nice, colorful picture? It seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to make the impression that a movie automatically cools down or adds an atmosphere that it certainly will not do, most of the time it just makes your movie boring and drab, like Bled shown here , <br /> <br /> This probably had a low budget and was filmed in Los Angeles & it has reasonable production values, but it's all so boring. Acting did not impress me, I was not interested in someone who is never a good sign. Bled is a horrible vampire movie that is suitable for psychological horror as well as physical purposes of all kinds of parallels with addiction in real life and what little or no effect it can cause because it's so boring. There might be an audience for a movie like this, but considering the other comments that are not that big.
