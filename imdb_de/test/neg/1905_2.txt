If Colin Firth was not, the film would be ready for the dust bin! So predictable, so stupid and so bad traded !! Only Colin Firth, as always, seems the only light at the end of the tunnel through this mess! <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Jennifer Rubin was acting! Maybe it was this script (did they really have one written or was it just "on the way" ???). <br /> <br /> To make a long story short: <br /> <br /> It's just a must for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) because he's incredibly sexy and good at acting (tough fighting against this "spiritually challenged" script). These minutes of Colin Screen Time make up a big part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not spend too much money on it. Try to get it as cheap as possible (an auction or similar) and then stick to the Colin Firth scenes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie can be dangerous to anyone's mental health.
