I rented the DVD yesterday, and most of all, it started badly, it's a 4: 3 aspect ratio movie, and it just keeps getting worse, acting is so bad and the movie itself is too predictable, I have that Seen film and told myself: this will happen next and guess what happened? Right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good action boxing movie, do not watch this movie. You will be disappointed with this low budget movie like me. Go and see Ali, how it feels better!
