I love the so-called "Blaxploitation" movies and have seen dozens. Some, like COTTON COMES TO HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values ​​and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and stupid, but still entertaining, like BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY. But DOLEMITE creates something rare for the genre - it's just cheap and stupid and not a bit entertaining! It's like blaxploitation for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago I saw that the Dolemite movies started on "Mad TV" and unfortunately the real DOLEMITE is not better. As with the parody, the play is just cruel. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and radiance of a balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke - with his kicks the goal obviously misses again and again. As for the rest of the actors, many could be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy, who could not even remember his lines and was really struggling to get them out - though he did not even bother to film those scenes again! In fact, so much of it was inappropriate that I found it hard to figure out if the movie was meant to be a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite terrible acting and acting something worth watching this movie, you are wrong. Even for the perverts hoping to see skin, they will be disappointed. The naked women in the movie really look like prostitutes and there is nothing remote sexy about their limp bodies. I think seeing old people naked - REEEAALLY old people naked - is no worse than looking at these "ladies". As for Rudy Ray, he has "man breasts." No black super hero or antihero should look so naked! For God's sake, put on your clothes and make a script that does not look like it was written by Winos. <br /> <br /> For your information - Apparently there are sequels to this movie! ! I can not imagine looking at them, so you just have to find another one to check them out. I looked at PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE, and ROBOT MONSTER, but I do not think I can convince myself to see another Dolemite movie - they are so bad!
