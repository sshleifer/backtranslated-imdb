Oh man. This was probably the worst movie I have seen in years. I mean, what else can you do with the old story "Woman in Mans Body"? it was full of clich√©s, for example the nerd came in his own sequence, the "boy" got what came to him, etc. I do not call these spoilers, because everyone could guess what happens !! The only thing it had to offer was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. And as for the dream boy, this was the wettest spectacle of all time. Even the bad guys were instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
