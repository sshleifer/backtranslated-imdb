It is said that some directors make small budget images look like blockbusters. Albert Pyun makes small budget images look like high-end A / V project films. This movie was pretty much missing in all departments. Practically every scene draws excessively, the "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, Rob Lowe is apparently equated with acting and the poor, dreary Euro-pop numbers bring the film to a standstill. On the positive side, Burt Reynolds is pretty good with what he has given (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent and Ice-T is using another longtime B-movie gangster. Not the worst work of Pyun (Urban Menace), but certainly not his best work (Mean Guns).
