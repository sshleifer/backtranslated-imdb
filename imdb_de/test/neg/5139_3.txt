I have just dealt with "Disappearances" at the AFI FEST 2006 together with about 30 other people in a mostly empty auditorium with 1000 seats. After seeing the lack of audiences, the festival programmer started with an opening commentary: "At least some of the festival's visitors have a good taste in film." Well, Mr. Programmer, after watching this movie, I have to answer, "No, we do not, and so do you!" This piece "Back Woods" follows the young (not so) Wild Bill as he and his mystical family lead dangerous Canadian whiskey across the border during the US ban. The old outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and her company) not only need the money to save their shaky farm in Vermont, but want to introduce the little wild bill into the virtues of masculinity. What makes films of this kind good is "tension" and credibility. Kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream I once had when Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I just did not care, and when Wild Bills' mystical grandmother came out of nowhere to give him advice, it just did not fit. Yes, I fell asleep almost more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job as Cameron Frye in Ferris Bueller; The Big Bill's brother-in-law, while teenage Chris McDermott uses those piercing blue eyes to his acting advantage. <br /> <br /> But overall, expect Jay Craven's Disappearances in a Block Buster $ 2 bin near you.
