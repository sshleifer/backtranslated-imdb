I came across this movie by accident and searched the IMDb for more information: Score 6.7, well ... not so bad. Genre: scifi ... well i like scifi. So I got the movie and was looking forward to a relaxed Sunday night. But no. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a movie. It is a religious advertisement that includes: putting forward about Jesus, God, the devil, the end of the world, etc. The movie begins with an epic kidnapping story: driving at night, car stops, bright light, and so on ... Well, that was actually the movie. In conclusion ... honestly, I do not know what to call it ... was a dialogue about the end of the world and the final judgment. Pretty much the same stuff that these televangelists tell you, but they are "good". <br /> <br /> If you want to see a scifi movie or something with UFOs, please stay away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear the opinion of a cuckoo's head, what the Bible has to say and what you should do. Then look at this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect cop. (and Gospel Christian propaganda, as other users said = Well ... I should have received other comments from other users before the movie. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters rated this "thing" as 10). Yes, please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda.
