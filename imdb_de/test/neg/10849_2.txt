As I mentioned in other comments, I have become a big fan of David Bradley since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". This guy is great at martial arts, has a kind of charisma and is a cool guy on the screen. Sadly, since his debut in the DTV section, he remained until 2001 one of the television kings, where he has apparently stopped making films. Well, one thing is the reputation of cyborg cop or hard justice, which are really crappy cliché movies, but they're really fun (they're entertainingly bad, if that matters), but another thing is watching a tasteless one Boredom like total reality. I mean, this and Crisis are the two biggest pieces this guy ever made. I would not even recommend that to the biggest bradly hardcore fans. If I had known that and Crisis was so shitty, I would not have spent the 3 or 4 euros they cost me. Total Reality is just as boring as the crisis, even though it starts to be funny, promising. A group of military prisoners will have a chance in the future to stop a disaster in the past (I'm sorry, I did not really pay much attention to this cruelty) and they only have 24 hours to come back or anything like that if not, they are stranded there forever. The poor director who oversees this, "tries out" some funny (?) Clichés, like those convicted on Earth who do not know what a truck is (wow, weird ...). The film follows David Bradley, who has teamed up with an Earth Girl for the rest of the strip. This bored me so much that I had to force myself to see it in 3 or 4 installments to use at least the 4 or 5 euros it cost. That's every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if David Bradley gets you a movie with just a fucking 10-second fight scene, this is the finishing touch that would help throw you off a 100-foot-high cliff to never see him again. I wish I could meet the "director" of that pile of poo on the street and I swear to God I would reclaim it for 5 euros. I would also like to meet David Bradley to ask him why, in God's name, he chose to make this poor excuse for a movie. Do not bother with this movie, I mean it with all my heart, do not lend it and especially do not lend it.
