[Warning includes spoilers] <br /> <br /> I had no sympathy for the characters, including the main character who overcomes the death of his girlfriend v.quickly (but it's alright if he interferes.) A former prostitute from the casino where he works). The protagonist is portrayed as a wonderful intelligent writer who is drawn into a web of deception while the monologue of the book he is writing is conducted. I can not say I would buy the book, a much better condition might have been if the voice-over (which annoys to tell something about the movie you may not have understood about its book) had 52 different personalities ... to represent each card in the deck, but I digress. In the end, there was a twist where the main character was set up by someone close to him, but since I liked his character so much (I found it impossible to like anyone in this movie, the characters are all one-dimensional zombies), that I really did not care, and I was glad that the movie was over. Pros: The English actress of ER playing a dodgy South African accent Minus points: An irritating movie
