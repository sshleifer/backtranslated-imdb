Rutger Hauer is helping with a movie that can basically be summed up in the youth category, and that's obvious, so he needs a lot of help. <br /> <br /> The beginning promises much more a movie that could turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's a pity because I really got stuck in the beginning. Then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from great and fascinating to nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's fun enough with many curios and interesting characters that have done well. I'm sure that's enough for many people. The problem is that everything feels like confusion and empty, which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self-fulfillment. Not the movie itself (it's not a self-confident movie), but the character should realize that his own life is fictional and empty.
