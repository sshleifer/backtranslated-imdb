This movie really starts out strong. We know Roberts was sent from Atlanta to Australia to solve Coke's marketing issues. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' good acting convinces us quite fast. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so weak that the development of fine characters is negated by voids, inconsistencies and downright boring movie sequences. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of bold and distant plots. Examples that I like very much are "Dark Star", "O. C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". In connection with the fact that I have to admit that this movie was well played, I'm surprised that I can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The total collapse in this movie occurs approximately in the middle of the movie. All comedy is lost immediately and the movie gets dark. After that, the movie trots along. The movie's attempt to get the comedy back on track is unsuccessful. There are more surprises waiting for the spectators, which are even darker. <br /> <br /> But mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. With this film, however, the result is as successful as "New Cola".
