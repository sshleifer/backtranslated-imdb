Apart from John Krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. The love story of Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan was as clichéd as possible, full of unbelievably bad statements that their parents never let them be together and look super hammy eager. None of the "emotions" had any depth or reality. The two accent characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and whoever the weapon expert) ... once they saw how bad the accents were, they would not have decided to just drop them and rewrite a few lines, to avoid causing the audience a headache? Apparently not. I do not even know where to start editing, especially in the sound editor. If you hate obvious dubbing as much as I do, do not look at it. That being said, Krasinski was great. I admit that I'm a big office fan and that's why I rented it. But he's pretty entertaining as an off-the-wall friend with crazy ideas. He has a clichéd role but still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. The end was terrible. Just terrible. The idea of ​​robbery had potential, but Keegan, after being shot, fluttered to his studio to fall upon a painting by Chabert (which does not resemble her), the most terrifying scene.
