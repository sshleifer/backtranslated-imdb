"The Quickie" tells of a decadent Russian mob family living in Malibu and ... frankly, this terrible attempt at a drama does not deserve a comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces himself Mr. Mob's guy is from "Pacific Exterminators" with huge letters on his back that say "West Coast Exterminators". Eventually, the mob types get suspicious because they exterminated in a bedroom. (moron). <br /> <br /> In another scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette and gives a hooker $ 4000 to bet if he will live or die. She has 5 out of 6 chances to keep the money if she bets "live". Well, she bets "die". (double duh) Later she complains that it is not fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh). <br /> <br /> The list of mistakes just goes on and on, while the movie that offends the intelligentsia stinks in a swamp of bad music, mediocre camerawork, bad alignment, boring story, etc. and sinks into this loser , (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The barebones DVD I rented did not have subtitles or subtitles in English.
