From Kreestos: <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, terrible, constipated. Bad to act Many plot errors. I do not recommend that at all. <br /> <br /> From Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic Licenses The work manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both of whom were male, not female, as depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> The copyists have neither influenced nor changed the score. In fact, they were abused by Beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score. <br /> <br /> The film is played in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Throughout the film, Beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In fact, Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; His condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's hearing deteriorated considerably. At this point in his life, most conversations with Beethoven were facilitated by the use of notebooks. However, it can be argued that he could also read man's lips, which is proven by his persistence that people toast him when they speak with him Sonata. This is an anachronism, as the Sonata No. 14 "Quasi una fantasia" was only a few years after his death called "Moonlight".
