I just wrote a commentary on "ACES HIGH" (1976) that reminds me of this movie I saw as a kid when it was released. since then, I have only seen it once and that was more than enough. As Kevin says well, "It's a complete waste of time." Apart from the dog fights, which are nicely done, the rest is a series of badly patched scenes with actors fighting a lousy script and a lousy sense of direction. I can not remember the stupid German accents Kevin mentioned in his comment, but that's another pathetic mistake; If Corman tried to make the characterization of German pilots more convincing, why did not he use German actors or synchronize those parts? On the other hand, a good example of the frightening Hollywood style of filmmaking, whose "villains" are so clearly recognizable, not only by their cruel actions, but also by their grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> Cruel Actions "The ridiculous scene was that Lieutenant Hermann Goering's English nurses were murdered during an air base attack - an absolutely disgusting propaganda that was carried out with" historical aftereffects. " If you want to see moving, well-played and directing films about the air war during the First World War, check out "ACES HIGH" (1976) or the wonderful classic "THE DAWN PATROL" (1938).
