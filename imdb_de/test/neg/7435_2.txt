LTL is a kind of formulaic, hopeless comedy that sheep like them enjoy when they come across a band playing in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember that Murray LTL in Larry Kings shit has promoted CNN, where he says something like "If this movie does not become a hit, I will not make any more movies (or comedies)". He was not nearly as happy as one might think; He must have felt that LTL was a total hit and his failure meant that his status as a star had dropped significantly - hence a kind of ultimatum live-on-air for his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb money elephants comedy. (The comedy is stupid, not the elephant ...) Or maybe during filming (or when he saw the last cut) he just realized what that turkey was, so he desperately tried to convince everyone how he had a lot of optimism about LTL quality. "Look at it, it's really good!" Actors are prostitutes mingled with car sellers. LTL is a kind of lousy project that comes from the "Friends" school of comedy; Her motto: "If you ever run out of ideas - or did you have none at all - then you're putting an animal into the plot, and that brings at least a little bit of cuteness." Cuteness = a sad substitute for the lack of funny jokes. The other motto "Friends" was: "Always meaningless, boring sentimentality", with which this film ends so predictably, as Murray says rather pathetically: "What they have forgotten is that you never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I could easily forget this turkey that I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded of seeing a scene on television today (hence this equally meaningless review). Murray wastes his talent for this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he is not 'almost as uninteresting / evil as McConaughey (or as that man's name is written); One might think that M.M. I have an easy time playing myself, d. H. an ankle, but he is so painless and unconvincing that I could hardly bear to see him making such an ass out of himself. It was scary. To top off this nonsense, we have the Generation X buffalo Garofalo in a rather useless role. On the other hand, everything about LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After LTL, which, as far as I know, was bombed, Murray became a "serious actor". What's wrong with these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it just about getting prizes, d. H. "Recognition of peers" (say: Voices from their idiots)? This piece of crap marks the end of a series of good and great movies that Murray made in the early and mid 90s, such as "Groundhog Day," "Quick Change," "Mad Dog & Glory," "Kingpin," "What's With Bob? "And" Ed Wood ". Recently, we had the immense pleasure of seeing him in garbage / mediocrities like "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you just can not get away from these "ultra-talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers". Compare these two stacks. <br /> <br /> One guy called LTL "funny as damned". Well, THAT is the kind of audience this movie hoped for ... shopping malls and trailer parks ...
