I have loved Milos Forman's movies since seeing "One Flow Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair," I kept wondering if this was the same Milos Forman , This movie is boring and uninteresting, to say the least. OK, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it just seems to be a bunch of drug addicts dancing around (wait a minute ... that's really it!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part of Milo's talent, is the last 15 minutes (SPOILER !!) since Berger transferred Claude to the Vietnam War as a soldier. These fifteen minutes are moving and purposeful, but it's a shame we have to endure so much horrible stuff in front of them. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe this is one of the movies you have "in the cinema" need to "enjoy" theme (the theme is marijuana, acid and other drugs that glorified the movie). I am not like that...
