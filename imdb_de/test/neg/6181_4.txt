Ok, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance and was unimpressed. It took a good fifteen minutes for a cut or a dialogue line to make sense, and it took another 30 minutes for the script to switch to a working copy that did not depend on the end. by Ryan Gosling's smile or invented moralizing. After the first 45 minutes, however, the script developed into a clock, which was not quite entertaining or thought-provoking. Highlights include both Goslings and Morse's acting, Gosling is a rising star, and Morse is a well-established character actor with a good sense of different emotions. As a side note, after talking to some of my friends, I talked a little bit about the movie when David Morse walked right behind me - he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2-inch and probably outweighs me at 50 pounds, I pulled my foot out of my mouth and promptly changed the subject.
