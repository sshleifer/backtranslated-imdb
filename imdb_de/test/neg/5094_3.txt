A good example of reversed, politically correct racism, where white men are presented as pointless thugs to be massacred only there, and their aborigines as noble heroes superior in both appearance and ability. Apart from making the story excessively boring, it also prevents the neutral viewer from identifying with one side or the other - it's just too easy. The repetition of the score is unbelievably annoying (just like the voice-over), the characters lack depth and the viewer soon loses himself between questions like "who is this character" and "what does that mean?". The photography is wonderful and overall there is a lot of atmosphere, but beautiful shots of misty landscapes alone do not save this movie. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an eye-catcher. In fact, his character could have been played by another player because he is essentially just an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters) and disappears around half of the movie. But if you like Jack Bauer in a kilt, that's your kind of movie ...
