SPOILER Wolfcreek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre ... If you've seen them, do not bother with this one. Typical Slasher movie, nothing new here except the "Visions" by SPOILER, which give fluff to an already weak plot. I would recommend this film if you have absolutely nothing to see and either watch the movie or stare at a bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only half-interesting part of SPOILER is when the chick in the empty sheriff's office starts drinking. I say, it's interesting, because she at least used this liquor well, instead of using it stereotypically to make a fire to kill the villain, even though she went this way towards the end. All in all, lame, bad and worth no effort.
