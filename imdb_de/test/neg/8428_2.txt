Historically awful. Hardly an exact moment in 4 hours of ridicule. You can not track the discrepancies while observing. As with all untitled and un-titled films, it's no problem for anyone to ask a track advisor. It shows events and techniques that were not created until the next century. From the recordings of runners jogging 400 meters to the overweight actor who represents the high jump and long jump winner, you would not need to know anything about the track to be even mild. Probably thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just before the Olympics in LA.
