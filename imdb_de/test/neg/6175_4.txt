There are many different problems with the movie "KillShot". For one thing, there are far too many coincidences. The husband is a hunter and hunts on the day the main killer turns up, along with someone he knows. Okay, I'll take that. The child calls the real estate agency the woman works for and asks for money when it comes to getting it. Okay, I'll take that too. Before he wants to get the money, he has decided to rob our murderer, who does not kill him, but takes him to work. It's starting to get very weak. Then they turn up on the day the husband conducts an interview with their wife's boss. No one is there except the wife and husband who decided to go to the empty office. They make their way to the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right man. That's only in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this movie than I want to talk about. Why the murderer in the real estate agency did not kill everyone, I do not know. Why he did not shoot the woman on her porch, I do not know. I do not know why he made this stupid kid do so many stupid moves and messes up a lot of crap. Why the girlfriend ever was in the movie, I do not know. I do not know why he decided not to stick the gun and simply leave it on the counter. I do not know why they even entered the witness protection program. What I know is that the casting director did a great job, the director of photography did a great job, the location scout picked great venues, and the production designer was worth every penny. My advice to anyone who chooses a script that is so well worked out by the crew ensures that any attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not prevented by a peak through an open window.
