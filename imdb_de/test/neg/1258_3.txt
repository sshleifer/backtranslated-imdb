"Michael" is for the most part a disaster? ten minutes of charm and ninety years of missteps. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often talking about Nora Ephron's dazed-banal writing. But the movie moves like a snail. And even in their fantasy context, the characters behave regularly implausible. (Reporters who routinely left behind the story of a life, a seeming angel living on the earth?) Out of their eyes? Someone forgot to tell romantic comedy master Ephron that William Hurt in so many brilliant other films is not a Tom Hanks. The "climax" of the film redefines the fictitious word. Ephron turns for the sky, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long, long drive through the cinema.
