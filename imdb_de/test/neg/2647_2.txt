In the dark days of 1990, the hoped-for legacy of the Spielberger Throne (after the failure of the alleged Whiz kid Phil Joanou) was falsely considered to be presumptuous Spielberg wannabe David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to bundle the studios for over a million dollars, which led the creators of the Baby Boomers to believe his script - a combination of nostalgic references from the 1960s and a disturbing drama about child molestation - that somehow made a good one Storytelling and a decent movie equaled. <br /> <br /> When Rod Stewart once sang, "look how wrong you can be." <br /> <br /> But the artist-fartsy, "ET" -inspired script of the newcomer convinced enough people he was next Chosen One - the new Spielberg - and so a deal was made, not just the script for more Buying money, as 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lives, but also that Evans should also direct the film - even though he had never directed anything in his life. <br /> <br /> Hey, how hard can it be to be another genius filmmaker? <br /> <br /> Two weeks after shooting, Columbia found out. His dailies were described by the studio as "totally useless" - or at least those who were thoughtful enough not to go under the E.N.C. (Emperor new clothes) spell. His entire material was scrapped and recycled into guitar images. <br /> <br /> So, what's a studio supposed to do after sinking $ 10 or $ 20 million into something they still thought was the resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Rent Spielberg himself to save the day? Columbia probably tried that. <br /> <br /> Enter the old pro Richard Donner. Hey, he may not be a cinematic genius, but he does the work. After all, "Superman" was not that bad - and the first "Lethal Weapon" was pretty good. <br /> <br /> So Thunder enters and grabs the direction. Luckily, he manages to convince Columbia that the worst of the movie's bland fantasy sequences - which would have turned out to be like a ten year old acid trip - has come to an end. Unfortunately, he leaves the Crying Buffalo (ooh, how poetic) and the ridiculous, pseudo-Spielberg fantasy ending, complete with Clueless Mom, who is completely satisfied for the rest of her life to get postcards of her missing son while he's around the The world around him is driving a red car. <br /> <br /> But Donner has managed to get a decent performance out of Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco as idiot mom was not bad either. Maybe thunder should be reevaluated. Maybe he's not such a fake Hollywood hack as everyone has always believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I rated this exaggerated Misfire as 2 is that someone was smart enough to fill the big John Heard (but in the wrong part, of course). The kids are okay ... even though Tom Hanks's terrible, overly explanatory narrative destroys almost every scene he invades. <br /> <br /> One might think that after David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffy of the World, the studios could finally be wise. One might hope that these hype-driven film debacles could cause Emperor's New Clothes syndrome to never revive its ugly head. <br /> <br /> Doubt!
