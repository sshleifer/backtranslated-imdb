I have to admit the movie is not the best I've ever seen, but I'd like to mention that the actors portraying Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the actual Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The movie, based on his famous split, would have been better if professional actors had played the roles. Many films shot during this period took advantage of the popularity of big bands. Mostly the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors. Most moviegoers did not go to Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey playing themselves; They went for the plot and the music. I've never been a big Dorsey fan, but the music is still good today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on a previous post to the actors who played Mom and Pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as Reverend Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Mrs. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheap By The Dozen.
