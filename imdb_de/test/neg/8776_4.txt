I loved this movie when it first came out (but I was only 12 years old then - and I had forgotten that this movie existed until one day I found a used one for sale at a gas station.) I bought it and could not wait) to watch this movie that I loved as a kid, and when I saw him again many years later, he met me ... Why on earth did I like this movie as a child when grown up became Myself Clearly, this movie is awful, and the saddest thing about this movie is that it had everything to make it the biggest western ever, and they blew it away !!! The costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 scores in the orchestra is wonderful and keeps alive with the classic spirit of the old age Lone Ranger, the second score is a series of songs by country musicians like Merle Haggerd and The Statler Brothers and bad songs like "The Man in the Mask" that they are funny. These movies are the strongest, having a Briliant storyline and one of the best vests. It's fun to watch him while John Reid recovers after he and his other rangers are ambushed. He enjoys seeing his identity grow in his new life and identity as a Lone Ranger and seeks revenge to blame the gang for killing his brother and all his other rangers with whom he has been killed rode together. But as good as the story is, Merle Haggard ruins everything. You're telling everything you're seeing (out of love for God, why did they do that?) Between Merle Haggard's narration and the Statler brothers singing crazy. Songs like "Ride little cowboy" playing in the background make it impossible to take this movie seriously. I'd like to see a really good producer take the same script and story, and repeat that movie properly because the heart of this stupid movie is a great western. I would describe this movie as a beautiful women's dress the ugliest clothes. I give it 4 out of 10 stars - if you're 12 years old, and you do not know it better then maybe you love it.
