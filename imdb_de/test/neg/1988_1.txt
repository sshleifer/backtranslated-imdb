The premise of this movie is ugghhhh. The guy is married, and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "Yeah, that's funny, cute and a good movie." What the hell?!?! What is funny about immature girls having fun with a married man with a newborn? What's cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife? What was wrong with finding teens with whom they could have sex before they started college? No, that's not good enough, the guy has to be married, off-limits, off-the-market, that's what we have to have. Stupid GIRLS! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. No, she simply "loves" the way he makes her feel. Two of the girls enjoy it, they find it funny and nobody seems to have any moral issues with what they do. It's just shameless, but yes, that's all fine with every one of these sites. The dark-haired girl even has the audacity to let her father pick her up from the boys' house under the pretext of having babies. This is a morally disgusting movie and where is the woman? Poor woman working and paying the bills while screwing the babysitter.
