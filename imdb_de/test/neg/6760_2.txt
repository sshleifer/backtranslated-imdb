This film is a standardized stupid sci-fi ride from the 50s. In his favor, the conspiracy creates an alien invasion without producing the aliens themselves. But come on, if aliens needed energy and could take them from sources like hydrogen bombs, why should they come to Earth? Why do not you just suck it out of a STAR!?!? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on Earth society, not the mere accumulation of energy. Nothing like this is even hinted at; Kronos may have been built by a superior race, but its activities on earth are the most primitive. The end that the Scientist-Hero Plan for Kronos plans is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. This is the gambit "reverse polarity" that has been used so often in bad scifi that it has become a joke. In fact, it causes our unwanted visitors to release their accumulated energy. Nobody in power seems to be interested in the effects that the release of so much energy (which at the end of the film includes, among other things, the total yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the environment. And by the end of the movie, the environments are unfortunately the suburbs of Los Angeles. Oops!
