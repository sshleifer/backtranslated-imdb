CORRIDORS OF BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> London, 1840: In an attempt to formulate an anesthetic solution, a committed surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotic drugs and is blackmailed by local body snatchers. <br /> <br /> They ride the Rocks of Tails in a gothic revival caused by the followers The recent success of Hammer's CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), Robert Days CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, is a curious mix of historical drama and Grand Guignol Theater. Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff from Hollywood, where his movie career had stalled in a B-movie rut (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for some scary shockers, where good men are hindered by circumstances outside their control. In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who encounters a terrible secret while researching a series of murders from recent history, while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD he is a drug-addicted surgeon who belongs to a group of criminal criminals Victim falls from East End Pub landlord Francis de Wolff. The movie is not so much a horror movie as a melodrama with creepy ornaments and secures its commercial bets by bringing with it a series of bloody experiences (a cut leg, a face ruined by acid, etc.), but the narrative is mainly influenced by the altruistic Persecution of Karloff motivates anesthetic formula that will relieve the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. The finished film was produced under the title "The Doctor of Seven Dials" and was not published until 1962 due to indifference by the distributor MGM The then co-star Christopher Lee had earned an outstanding patronage, although he played a small but significant role played as 'Resurrection Joe', an eerie Cockney bat who murdered carefully selected patrons of de Wolff's seedy pub and sold the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this glorious cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international fame, which is his limited time on screen, though his intense performance is one of the movie's highlights. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) excels as De Wolff's partner in crime, and there is a festival of well-known faces in supporting roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE OF THE DARKERS), Betta St. John (THE CITY OF THE DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Superb Art Direction (by Anthony Masters) and Cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
