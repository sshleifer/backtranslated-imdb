A terrible travesty of the Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz has done very badly as a Cephalonian Greek (there are many attractive, well English speaking Greek actresses, so why choose a Spanish lady for a lead role and an English actor as her father, supposedly a Greek doctor!)? Many The actors were well-known actors and actresses from Greek theatrical and television series, and the only foreign actor who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as plutocratic) shipowner in the Greek tycoon and as Greek colonel in the cannons of Navarone. <br /> <br /> There are some historical facts that are reflected in the film: people who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans Mussolini's forces were defeated in the Albanian campaign by the Greek army, as indicated in the film. After intervening in the Balkans, the Germans allowed the Italian militia to occupy certain parts of Greece, including the refusal of the local government to surrender to the Italian troops and not to the Germans. As shown in the film, is quite plausible, although I'm not sure if that actually happened.
