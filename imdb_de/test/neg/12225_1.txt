This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If I had not looked at it for free, I would never have finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed. It seems that this is a movie in the style of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls over, someone is hit by a bus, and so on. None of the ideas is smart, basically the worst condition for a movie that's ever been shot. The act (or its absence) is completely delayed. The plot seems to be about the coach and his family, but there are so many other things going on in the movie that it's completely ridiculous. Terrible, horrible movie.
