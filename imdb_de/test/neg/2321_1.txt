Absolutely crazy movie with Abbott and Costello. Even our little kids would be more and more annoyed with this complete mess of a movie. Abbott as a Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Sure, he had to be part of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that Costello's mother sounded and looked like Fay Bainter in the movie? Fortunately for Mrs. Bainter, that she was not in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really no fuss for kids. The jokes, if anything, are pretty stale. Some of the songs are well done, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
