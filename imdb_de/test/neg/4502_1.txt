As a longtime Godzilla fan, Gamera was a cheap knockoff for me to benefit from the success of Toho's # 1 Kaiju Star. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was an almost painful visual experience for me at the time (1975). <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla Feast, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA VS. VIRAS, published. Of course they showed this movie. It was one of the hottest bad movies ever made. Of course, you have to be in the right mood to see it. For example, in a scene, the Boy Scouts, who are being held aboard the alien spacecraft, can escape by distracting the non-light aliens. When they realize that they have been "deceived", one of them says, "That's funny ... I think the kids lied to us." Even PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE can not boast of this dialogue. <br /> <br /> This can not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this is a decent waste of time if you look at it properly. <br /> <br /> However, if you want first class Kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 of *****
