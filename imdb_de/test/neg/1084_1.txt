I'll say it again ... one of the worst movies ever made. It was made by the director who made one of my favorite movies - "Excalibur". I was on the ground to see that it got a mark of over six. This movie is shit. It looked awful. It looked as if he'd been shot in 18 days, and Boorman must have slept when he ordered it. Arquette did not do anything. Just awful, lazy, unbearable and probably the only blemish in Boorman's famous career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
