CONGO is probably the worst big-budget movie of the 1990s. It is so bad that it can be observed again and again. A bunch of people with different goals dive deep into the darkest of Africa where, like in KING SOLOMON'S MINES, they find a temple of wealth - but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding this wealth. On their side, humans have a "talking" gorilla named Amy, who at one point or another saves the day. So much for the plot. The dialogue is thoroughly funny, the action almost equally disgusting, certainly belligerent (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both available to ensure the Schinkelfaktor) and the special effects miserable. Wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there is a volcanic eruption that completes the grand finale? Laura Linney is on these bumpy rides. What could she have thought? This is about the same time as she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a film that has helped guarantee their fame.
