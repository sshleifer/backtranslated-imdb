This last episode of the "Airport" franchise was so incredibly horrible that it took me a while to realize it was not a slapstick comedy, like "Airplane." George Kennedy, firing a flare gun out of an open window to distract heat-seeking missiles, was funny. What would happen to your hand if you kept it out the window at two speeds? They lose the grip on the weapon and get a broken arm. The passengers were unintentionally funny, as well as the interior of the aircraft. The nifty French woman who came to the connoisseur George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy, who came to Ernest Borgnine. Will not happen Susan Blakely, a talented and unrecognized actress, did not receive any points for her CV. Robert Wagner also not. This movie was so bad that it seemed unreal.
