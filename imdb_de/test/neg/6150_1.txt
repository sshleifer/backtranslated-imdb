AWFUL Wot I can say more, I remember seeing it in the cinema (see how it remains painful in memory) as a 16-year-old boy. Mark Hamill was the Skywalker of the older generations and that was not good, that was worse. Add a grumpy soundtrack to Then Jericho AAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHHHH. There is a movie as bad as I saw it in the Arthur 2 cinema on the rocks. Funny, like that question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" is easier than "what's the best movie?" By the way, varies between The Italian Job (original), Untouchables, Casino, activities in Denver, Goodfellas (get a sense of what I like!! Please never watch this movie, otherwise it will remain in your memory!
