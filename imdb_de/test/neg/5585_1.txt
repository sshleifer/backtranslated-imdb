6 out of 8 comments on the subject have looked worth the movie, so let me restore my balance. <br /> <br /> If this is the best thing British Independent filmmakers have to offer, then they have to pack away their cameras now and find jobs in another industry. Unfortunately, that was 82 minutes I'll never see again, and hopefully I'll save some of you from the waste of 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> Although the idea behind the movie is interesting, it's not developed enough to capture the viewer. The student characters are boring and uninteresting, and honestly, you do not care what happens to them. The soldiers are virtually caricatures of all the bad guys ever seen in the movie. I've always been waiting for Captain Markovic to whirl an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were pretty good and showed some imagination, but these were ruined by the shockingly bad drama, bad script writing and erratic camera work. The budget could have been spent better on the "actors" (and I use that term loosely) in acting classes, or the Thomas Brothers in the film school, or perhaps in a spelling checker, because the subtitles were misspelled. The fact that the spelling errors were not picked up and corrected speaks volumes about the immaturity of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments are either staged by the filmmakers They saw a completely different film. I implore the Thomas brothers never to give up their daily jobs, because if they continue to work in this area, they will surely starve to death.
