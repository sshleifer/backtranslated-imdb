This program is useful for training hard human emotions. Apart from this purpose, the show has no other value than to fill the bandwidth that would otherwise be wasted in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a stronger sense of excitement and anticipation as I listen to a computer-controlled voice chip that endlessly displaces the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, helpful and frequent music hints show viewers how to feel if they can not fully internalize the predictable and flat plot line. I found Amy to be superficially positive as she is a role model for young women who can use them in traditionally male areas. Unfortunately, her total subjective dealings with the law are governed solely by the arbitrary personal policies that Amy chooses, which makes Amy's trial more reminiscent of the personal grace of a tribal despot than of a genuine administration of justice. This show is inedible in every way, although after two episodes, this is somewhat mitigated by God-given filtering processes of the brain, thankfully leaving the show in the memory of the viewer like a dead-center TV.
