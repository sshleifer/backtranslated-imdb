I should live this movie, but I do not do it. It has won international awards, it's foreign (I usually like those movies), it's slow (something I like) and it does not have unnecessary sex or violence. The problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey, one is "successful", the other is not. the unsuccessful comes to Istanbul to stay with the successful one to get a good job at sea. Both live a fulfilling life, meaningless and petty. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not the first time that this kind of movie has been made. I have not added anything new to this tired topic. There are long shots in which there is only someone who looks at the sea or sits in a caf√© or watches TV. I understand that such a thing shows the emptiness of their loved ones. While it does, the idea came to me in the first 15 minutes. I do not have to worry about the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> The symbolism is also a bit cumbersome. the plate of live Minnow-style fish with one of the plates fluttering around in his death. Symbols are best when they are not obvious, but create a mood in the background that is slightly below the viewer's attention. The movie is so apathetic that it does not even score a rating of 1, so I gave it a 2. To score a 1, a talent must be bad. This movie did not have that much energy.
