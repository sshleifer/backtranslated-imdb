An equally wealthy and insecure woman has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, which was undoubtedly backed by a good-natured gigolo husband who openly cheats on her. Of course, no one believes her claiming to have been approached by a huge man who stepped out of a giant satellite. Much to the delight of her husband, this could be the incident that finally puts her off. <br /> <br /> Already in the first scenes with their ridiculous newscast and the ridiculous encounter with the satellite you will probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this film is that it is so bad that it is funny is. While not too far from the target, this is definitely not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most films of this genre, this is not really a sci-fi movie or a horror movie, but a serious drama that is smart adds a sci-fi scenario to the storyline. It's not a good or mediocre drama, but it exceeds your expectations if you did not expect a legitimate drama at all. Acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget and, most importantly, it is well prepared and well timed. It never gets boring and creates more than a little interest in what's next. Still, this is still a movie for those who do not miss the chance to see a 1950s movie titled "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"!
