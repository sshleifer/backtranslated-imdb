Last week I saw a Royal Shakespeare Company production by Macbeth. It was 25 years old and filmed with props except swords, no furniture except chairs. It was exciting. Acting was awesome - all the actors trained Britons. Compare this feat with this ... Yawn Yawn Yawn. Al Pacino was tragic, heavy and could not quite lose the New York accent despite the long .... breaks .... between ..... lines. The whole thing was tired, even the "comic" scenes were hardly worth a smile, make a lonely belly laugh. That should be funny. They tried to make it tragic. It was not boring. I give four points for costumes, sets and Jeremy Irons, who plays well a boring, depressed, deep-voiced guy (can he be something else?)
