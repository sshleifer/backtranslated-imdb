That promised to be an interesting movie. The topic was certainly promising - the excesses of the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation. Not only was this not developed (except for an introduction to two paragraphs), but many things were not explained - d. H. The Gypsies, the Anabaptists, the Inquisitors and their relationship to the one true Church. Also the policy was not explained, d. H. The relationship between the Catholic Church and its followers such as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Although this may have been obvious to an Austrian audience, it makes Americans confused by the lack of explanation. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's good that they did not stress the story because what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway. Torture instruments, bloody executions, witch and heretic rampages, big shiny swords and pretty golden relics are the stars of the movie. It could just as well have been one of those Conan-style sword and magic movies, with only historical costumes ...
