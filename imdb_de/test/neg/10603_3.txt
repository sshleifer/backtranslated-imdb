I really wanted to have this movie, but I just could not. It had the potential to be a really cool, hip remake of a cool show, but then it fell apart. It was too hip, too cool. First, all the cool lines and scenes were shown in the preview trailers that I had often seen. And the cut was very incoherent, so the scenes did not flow together and all seemed out of place. Claire Danes, whom I greatly appreciate as an actress, did not succeed in breaking through to the acting roles beyond high school. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His somewhat stupid, but actually intelligent style was funny and refreshing. All in all, though, I would only recommend watching the previews instead of watching the movie and wishing it was more.
