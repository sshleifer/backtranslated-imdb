The glorious Edward moves in the world when his boss tells him he can drop the dirty Swedish drama films and go up the stairs to the bubble room. Delighted by his great anticipation of the new kind of films he will soon be working on, he asks all sorts of questions about the salary, his job and the lunch break. Not really. Edward may be the opposite. Calm, stuttering guy, he got glasses on. Except when he's crazy. I guess that created a much scary atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is a Swedish film for a reason, but somehow a magical force hit the good actors and turned their beautiful Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I think that's something an actor needs nowadays. Acting is very wooden, as they are inflexible and unbendable (well, what did you expect?). In addition, the film has a jamming techno title song that sounds like its E-Type. In any case, the movie experience only gets worse. Since I am pretty tough on this movie so far, there will usually be a break point where I put the degree of happiness higher. But there really is not much to say. The plans look good, but somehow 'Hanz' wrote and partly destroyed coffee. That's how I see this movie. If the movie ended, when Edward was taken to a psychiatric institute and they redeployed the parts where he goes insane and kills people, the result would have been much better, but that's just my radical view. I would also like to see more footage from the Lost Limbs movies. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this film piece. Let's say that the actors are really American and live in America. Why should they then work on a Swedish film, as Edward did? And why, this supplier, why does he never use the doorbell, which is right next to him? Instead he knocks softly on the door. Good old Edward had really good ears to hear all this while he was working. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly had its moments, it's a pity they were not that many. That does not mean that I would not recommend it. It's a pretty cheap movie, just buy it. It's almost as if I see a pattern for the price and the movie. On the other hand; If you like watching dubbed movies that get crazier every second, this could be IT. My conclusion would be an absolutely solid 4.
