Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and not good looking. In this movie he is like a drug to women in their twenties. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been labeled as sexist, but if ever movie deserves this title, it is this one. <br /> <br /> I can not even count how many breasts were shown in this movie, probably more than hours that Larry Bishop spent on the script. <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, Bishop and his gang fight, bike, party, have sex, kill people and the next day they fight, bike, party, have sex, kill people and on the third day come up with the idea /> <br /> I like ERIC BALFOUR and considering what he had to work with, he was pretty good as a Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is Larry Bishop's character Pistolero, who is so one-dimensional Not even funny. <br /> <br /> He's also a terrible actor and apparently never meant to play the lead role himself, but everyone he asked said no. What should he do? Realizing he was going to play the lead himself, he probably rewrote the script so he could edit more ladies. <br /> <br /> Although it looks good visually, at least it looks good on biker scenes and Eric Balfour is not bad. This movie is just a big mess. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Bishop will never be in front of the camera again.
