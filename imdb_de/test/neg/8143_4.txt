This movie is perfect for cheesy zombie lovers. It's a movie that lets you laugh from acting to horrible zombie action. That being said, I gave this a 4 out of 10 for trouble Cos Horror is a tough genre to make. Going down the bad points of this movie are as follows: <br /> <br /> #Bad make #terrible sound and sound effects #really bad continuity #cheesy dialogue #a song that was played through the entire movie #stein and not act in my opinion one of the worst I've seen #terror end #racist moment and simpson character named <br /> <br /> the good points #good costume #police officers seemed to have the best acting expert #the actor with less lines or small rolls seemed to be better #good try with gore <br /> <br /> i do not want to see the movie badly, it's funny to see cos of those bad spots and i think that's it What makes this one Movie okay? If it were better, I do not think it would make a difference, but it would not be interesting to see a remake with all the cast, as I believe they may have improved in the last 7 years.
