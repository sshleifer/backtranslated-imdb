This World War II film set in Borneo tries so hard to work on so many levels that it is a pity that it fails at all. Nick Nolte is a volatile American who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the Japanese. He wanders deep into the jungles of Borneo, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds Nolte's adopted tribe. Nolte, who now looks like Robert Plant, has become the new king of his tribe. He defeated a convinced warrior in a bloody battle and had a tattoo on his chest (a dragon) show. Before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a plane ticket to Borneo, things are not going well in Nolteland. Havers wants the tribe to fight the Japanese invading the island. He teaches the natives how to use machine guns, and a whole series of shootings begins. As the tribe becomes more successful, they encounter a new squadron of Japanese who are not like the others. This force can turn the villages they capture into cannibals to increase their strength (talk about their sushi), and they move through the jungle faster than the tribe. Since we know the outcome of the war, we finally know that the tribe triumphs, but with heavy losses. Here come the spoilers: Havers is hurt and returns to "civilization". He gives the place of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then bothers to release Nolte, and the credits roll. Milius' direction is certainly sufficient, but the script is rather vague in his motives. It presents story ideas and then gives them up again to get to the next story idea. Nolte is terrible when the soldier becomes king and desperately tries to channel the spirit of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz. He talks about the freedom and beauty of the jungle and the wealth of his people, and you will not believe the words he says for a second. He is often unintentionally funny, especially his initial mistake in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the movie like a hippie. Nigel Havers spends the movie looking at Nolte as if he were Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship and sexuality and enters into an unspoken relationship in which the natives must have talked. Havers often stands around and has an inner conflict that has knocked back the headhunt of the tribe, but made Nolte aware. His brave soldiers, who are now laced, are settling faster than the Bounty country party in Tahiti, but all I have seen about Borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green. <br /> <br /> The climatic treachery that Havers gives away from Nolte's location is completely without any reason. There is not a single thought about why Havers does this except to keep the movie going. I was furious when Havers and Nolte accidentally land on the same ship that goes to the Philippines, the ship crashes and Havers runs into the hold to free the fresh-cut Nolte. No goodbye kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king and explains the title. <br /> <br /> If you were to wage a war and an enemy squadron was eating your allies, would not you freak out? This Japanese elite unit is not shown enough, though their eating habits are so terrible that I would immediately become a conscientious objector. The same kind of ghostly enemy was handled much better in "The 13th Warrior." Other interesting ideas are discarded. What about the fact that then modern technology causes the death of so many backward people? Why did King Nolte let the British use his subjects without hesitation? Why can not Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In the end, "Farewell to the King" is a flop that is not anchored by a strong track and too many people try to think things over and explore their possibilities. I can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is rated for strong physical violence, severe violence, remorse, some obscenity, sexual references and adult situations (PG13).
