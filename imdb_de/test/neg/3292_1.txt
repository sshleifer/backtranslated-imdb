How can this be done? Did not Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office, etc. kill this old-fashioned, listless crap? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Michael Rappaport and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles (Copland, Friends), but he sucks, but everyone would struggle with this script. <br /> <br /> My wife enjoys it. But she is Brazilian. And if you have ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com, you would understand why she would find it so funny. The next 3 or 4 plot developments / lines would be for a while and were almost word for word right! I felt very smug. That annoyed my wife when she hated it when I did (can understand why, but I felt good, fuck it!)
