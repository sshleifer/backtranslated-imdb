I picked this DVD out of the Cheepo bin at Walmart because the cover shows one of the planes I flew during Vietnam (C-123k). I did not fly for Air America, but I knew that as a C-123 pilot, I knew many, including those who flew home in my reserve unit. I'm not a film critic, but I'm surprised at the subliminal motivation of directors and writers making such films. The best thing about this movie is to go to the cameraman. The flying punches and stunts (although they are totally cartoonish) are excellent. The movie begins with Hollywood's favorite hangman in 1969. But the fact is that Nixon Air America did not start, he did not start the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war and Air America. It is not fair or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar with respect to Air America. All presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. Nobody clever enough to fly a C-123 was stupid enough not to know where he was. That makes the Downey character incredible. A C-123 was a rugged aircraft. It could easily fly with an engine or the two auxiliary jet engines. It is more likely that the three jerks shoot down a duck with one shot. Pilots who had flown with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA, they were not ruthless lucky knights. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous job. They received twice the time for a retirement pension. They did not have to sell drugs or weapons to get a good pension. Dope was legal and a way of life in SEA, as it is in Afghanistan today. If individual pilots wanted to earn money on the side, it was not a CIA policy. The CIA waged a war against communism, not drugs. The author based his story on "War Histories". Pilots love anyone who will buy them a beer and listen to them. The author and director who had an ax about Vietnam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts - it makes Nixon what it has been for years. Remember that he was appointed president only on January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the landing on the hill in the jungle. Air America pilots place aircraft in locations that airplane designers never thought possible. There were many funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the director chose the oversized rubber scene to show how stupid the CIA was. This scene shows that the director and writer has fallen in love for a conversation with the pilot pub and the joke is on them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
