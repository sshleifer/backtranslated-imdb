Enjoy the opening credits. They are the best of this second-rate but harmless time killer offering walk-in services like Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. However, the main part goes to newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who looks a bit small for this type of action, but occasionally projects a Banty-Hahn style of warlike tendency. The first time we see him, he's naked, sweaty and busy with this favorite activity, "Beefcake" - chopping wood. After that, he has seven more scenes without his shirt, including one in which he is hung on his wrists and wriggles with a torrent of Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon". He could use a better script because the way he uncovers the truth about corruption and violence in prison is never very convincing. It also talks about millions of dollars that appear to be linked to this investigation, but never explained. However, there are a few pluses. "John Woodrow" under the guise of "John Wilson" is an amusing game with the name of a president, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as an inmate who hanged and beat his wrists at the beginning of the trial is from a burly guard. One last note: The film's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of extras. Despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 inmates! (Note: end-of-charge staffing is not very helpful.) Bill Fishback and the young blonde guard who manages play the burly, bald-headed guard who uses Jody Nolan as a punching bag Electric shocks to Tommy Lee Thomas is played by Marc Chenail. )
