A cheap, cheap police-character thriller, which is bearable by some fair, humorous things, the beautiful chemistry between the two main roles and especially of James Remar's satisfying turn as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and of course indestructible) villain. Obviously a low-quality image, both visual and dramatic, with a rather resigned Burt, but not unsurpassable. (**)
