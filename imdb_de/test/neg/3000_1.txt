This is the most boring, presumptuous and dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I saw it at the Beverly Hills Academy, and there were quite a few people in the lobby who left the movie screening and took refuge there. Everyone solemnly shook their heads and looked as if they had come to a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who gave this overbearing Blimpel good reviews. What about you? Are they just afraid that they will not be considered a "hip"? Were they bribed? This movie is amazingly bad. Do not get involved in an in-depth conversation at the Cheesecake Factory. If you've seen this movie, your idea was to surprise you and guide you through the rest of your life.
