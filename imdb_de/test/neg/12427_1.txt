I think that's one of the few films I want to rate as low as possible, just to compliment it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for about 25 years, so I can not really say that much about it. It still seems to be very difficult to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled somewhere in the venomous brew of the late UHF television in the mid-1980s when I was about ten years old. So I never really saw the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple is sneaking off a campsite and rowing them on an island to understand it, and then they are attacked by an insane Scotsman in a kilt with an ax! They manage to escape from him, but are attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, which in this movie is just a head and a neckless body. The monster's eyes and mouth do not even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br /> I mean, I've literally never seen anything on that scale and it totally blew me away. I had seen some bad movies on TV in the early '80s, but I had never seen anything so completely inappropriate and so casual and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who did it were less Spend time and effort when we saw it. I had already seen some of the Troma movies and things that were supposed to be "campy" on purpose, but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with really great, bad movies. This movie was like the last breath of the drive-in era, and I had a hint of it just in time. When we actually saw it, we could not figure out if it was made in the 50s or 70s. It turned out to come out only a few years before I saw it. <br /> <br /> Later I came in contact with Mystery Science Theater and found out a lot about the old B-movies and series, but I already saw it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I've never laughed so much at Monty Python or at Bill Murray or any other comedian. After watching this movie, I always tried to look for the "good" movies and I got a lot of my friends involved. But this film was and is basically impossible to find. I never really figured out what it was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s when the IMDb took off and the internet was taken down and information was passed on. However, this film still has to be discovered by many others who appreciate their transcendental qualities. Search for it.
