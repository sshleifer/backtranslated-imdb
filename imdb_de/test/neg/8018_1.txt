Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some really wonderful movies have come out of his novels ("Far from the Crazy Crowd", "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", "The Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had high hopes for them. The Hallmark of Hall of Fame-ification of "Return of the Native" has completely destroyed it. The cast was great, the photography excellent, but the script was bleak and the direction positively ruinous. People approached people, lines said, walked away. A meager excitement developed when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a little meat-oppressive, but even Clive, an outstanding actor, could not save it. It was full of the usual Hallmark "romantic" string background music and fake idiots that offer a plot show, and what dynamite could have turned out to be awful. The wealth of the above three films was completely missing.
