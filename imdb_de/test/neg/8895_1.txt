I was a fan of Buffy, hoping that it would come to a real end when Angel got another season. But as the end approached, I was excited to see that. And what did we get? This episode called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the very last one. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed with this episode. This is absolutely the worst way to this series. Why could not there be a happy ending? Why did some main characters have to die? Why did not Angel become human and was reunited with Buffy? No, Angel has to sign this damn sheet of paper so he never becomes human. How stupid. <br /> <br /> And the end is a cliffhanger. <br /> <br /> What could have been worse? The Buffy Show started as great as Angel, but the whole universe ended up so fucked up. Someone should cast a spell over the man who wrote the script for this episode and make sure he gets lost in hell. Overall 1 out of 10 points.
