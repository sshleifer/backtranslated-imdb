Although this movie has earned a lot of praise, I personally found it boring. There are some beautiful Brazilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they relate to each other, even though it's very unusual for us, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie for so long. The central woman works closely with one man after another and puts the interests of her children in the foreground. When the tolerance of the different men is stretched, we see how their characters evolve. The story unfolds in dignity and is supported by excellent acting. It's a rare glimpse into the Brazilian hinterland, far from the city, but barely exciting enough to keep your eyes open.
