The IMDB plot summary falsely gives the impression that it is Noah Taylor's film when Fairuza Balk is the central character. It is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish, meaningless nonfilm. Balk separates from Boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I think - played by Dempsey) and kills Taylor by mistake - who pursues her as a ghost behind the rest of the movie. Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen.
