This is an end to the barrel-type of B-movie from one of the Armor Row studios, Monogram, mid-1940s, a kind of double-counting. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked at was to see JACKIE MORAN starring as a pageboy on a radio station trying to solve a murder. He played Phil Meade in GONE WITH THE WIND only two years earlier and this was one of his last teenage roles. He is not a Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is just as unhappy as the production values ​​and is full of cliché situations with a cast of people made up of inequality. WANDA McKAY is the switchboard girl "discovered" by a radio producer, and SIDNEY MILLER is the hero's nerdy friend who is afraid of his own shadow. Fortunately, in one hour the murder is over after a summary of all the suspects. Terribly dubbed, JON GILBREATH as Tex, the cowboy, gives the only quiet performance he cares about, but he bites the dust off after a too short performance. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but all are forgotten, as well as lame jokes and dialogue.
