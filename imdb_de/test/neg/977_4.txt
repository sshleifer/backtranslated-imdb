I dropped off this car for the first time by Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and especially Murphy, but after seeing it again recently, I can see that it has some very funny parts. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that this is the biggest buddy comedy ever, but what can you do with the already exhausted subgenre? The director Tom Dey has tried to make him a satire of the cliché of the buddy comedy and the media. At the beginning of the film, the head of a cable network asks, "How's that different from cops?", When Chase Renzi staged the idea of ​​a reality show starring De Presto's character Mitch Preston (by the way funny boring name). There I saw it in a new light that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of the pals comedy and to shoot them. De Niro's reluctance to play on the show and work with Murphy is right in any cop movie you can imagine. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself and asks, "Why am I making another movie to play a cop?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood affair, but if you look at her opening scene again, she's just doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of her work, but she still wants to be successful. One line says it all: "Who does not want to be on TV?" Maybe you read too much into something, which is essentially a light movie that's just for entertainment, but there's a little twist that I did not notice before. <br /> <br /> Like Murphy. You have to applaud him for making you look so ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he wants to sell everything he comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it hit the nerve that everything is so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The action with the gun is of course quite boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end, which requires a lot of effort from both cast and crew. What I've noticed about the villain is that he's dressed like a '80s pop star. George Michael comes to my mind and that boosts the entire media spiral. <br /> <br /> So I did it the first time, but what the hell? If you do, you should tell us how ridiculous it really is, and De Niro and Murphy had a great opportunity to do that.
