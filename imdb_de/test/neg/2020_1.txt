My goodness. And here I thought that there are no directors who are worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine the number of decisions required to produce a movie. Conceptual approval screenwriting. Dialogue editing casting set and prop design. Site selection. Acting. Timed coordination. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Sound and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that every single one of these decisions was done wrong. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For an allegedly used film In the 2900s, this film looks surprisingly like a cheap Gangsta stripe of the 70s. The set is ridiculous for that time. The dialogue is cruel. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. The spectacle is beyond terror. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Take props, for example. If you have a movie on a spacecraft built in 2900, how likely is it to have the exposed piping and hydraulic doors of a 1960s oil tanker? What has not changed the technology in 900 years? The "Professor" uses a standard tandy keyboard and radio-shack flip switch to "reprogram" the computer. What, have not you found out the voice control yet? Of course, the Prof is tied to a wheelchair. With wheels. They have an intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, let alone a swimming or bionic leg or anything. And apparently, this freighter had an intergalactic load of rosewood caskets. How convenient. Then there are the weapons - the crew carries standard weapons from the late 20th century. In a ship In the vacuum of space, where a bullethole would kill them all. Nice planning there, prop department. Oh, why is it going on?
