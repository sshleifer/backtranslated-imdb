I love the Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game. If there was a game, I wish I had never heard Super Nintendo. <br /> <br /> How can a movie based on a classic movie be just too awful? And to make matters worse, I was scared of this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How stupid that was, but then again I was a kid when this game first came out. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just odd. One minute it's an action game and then a shooter. What in the world is wrong with deciding when to make a video game? <br /> <br /> The sound in the game is just terrible to hear. <br /> <br /> The music is just too sick to listen to. <br /> <br /> The controllers in the game usually do not work. Jurassic Park The game is just a waste of time and money and will not work Be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
