That could have been great. The voice overs are just right and fit the characters to a T. A little problem; The looks of the characters, mostly the support or guest characters, look exactly the same. The same bored look in every face only with minor changes such as hairline or weight. It looks kind of weird to see the voice of a really big guest star from a lifeless shape like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too funny to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are a few other problems, one of which is the family plan. The Simpsons did much better where they could buy most of the situations the characters themselves were. Here we get too many annoying distractions, for example, if someone has a weird fantasy and then we should find that funny, but for some reason the delivery is a bit worn. As you can probably say, it's hard for me to say exactly what's wrong with this show because it's basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more with "Married with Children" when I point my finger at it that should show what is absolutely wrong, it is probably due to repetition. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character, but neither one of the others. Lois should have been called Lois Lame because it's somehow one-dimensional. Seth Green, the kind of backward son, is the best of the show, and that's the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> What else can I say. There is not really anything wrong with this show, but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons have been doing for almost two decades.
