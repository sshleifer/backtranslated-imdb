Of all the films I could choose, it had to be that way. The last time I was in New York, I went to a Times Square store, and out of the hundreds of DVDs, I picked Joel M. Reed's Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) on a two-movie DVD, too Seeds of Sin (1968)), have I regretted it? Read on to find out. The film begins on an island (near Milligan's home in Staten Island) where two lovers walk on a massive parasol that looks like paper. Once he gives her the grass as a gift. Out of nowhere comes Colin (Hal Borske), a backward humpback, killing both for no reason. After the opening credits, which include some of the worst headaches I've ever heard, I've gotten used to it, as it's been used throughout the movie, and we're being introduced to three couples. The wives are all sisters, Vicky and Ricard, Veronica and Bill, as well as Elizabeth and Donald. They each receive a letter from Attorney H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) requesting a meeting to read the will of their deceased father. Dobbs tells them that they spend three days in their Crenshaw House and have to fill it with 'sexual harmony and marital love' that they never knew because of the strained relationship between father and mother. He informs the couple that the will is very erratic, but legal. After three days, the inheritance is regulated. The couples are also greeted by the servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the backward Colin, who greets the couples by killing and biting buns from a rabbit in front of them. Later that night, the leftover rabbit is found in one of the beds of a couple. The note reads, "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit." This begins with a series of events ending in a gruesome murder, revealing dark family secrets. <br /> <br /> Written, photographed and directed by talentless Andy Milligan. This is an absolutely horrible movie in every way. Let's just go through some of his mistakes. The music is terrible and cause headaches. Sound, you can barely hear what the characters are saying, and certain scenes have no sound effects, and in certain places you hear Milligan giving orders to his actors, oh, and the soundtrack is always audible. Acting, probably one of the worst I've ever seen. The very unusual effects, Colin pushes someone's eyes in the opening sequence, is the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied and has opened the belly with a saw, looks just as terrible as the various hands and legs that are choppy become. Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene. He regularly cuts off the top, bottom, or side surfaces of people's heads and faces off the screen, and the camera shakes and shakes as if it were being operated by someone constantly stumbling over it. There is also at least one scene so poorly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen. The film is often so dark that you can not see what happens. Editing, again one of the worst I've ever eaten, seems to cut scenes before they're done, and cuts off while the characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if any, was credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (it took two people to write this!). It is everywhere and incredibly stupid. There is an unbelievably bad sequence in which the killer follows a victim into the cellar, the murderer passes right behind him, in one place the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to avoid detection? They slip out of him, the killers are close enough to give the guy oral sex, but he does not notice them right in front of him. You have to see this sequence to believe it, I still can not believe what I saw. Bizarre undergrounds just pass and then disappear completely. Look at the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and co-author Hal Sherwood), who turns out to be a gay priest who has an incestuous relationship with him brother before he was married! A strange scene that is there for no reason. Martha, the housekeeper, responded to the first murder. She is more bothered by the fact that she has given up her meal plan! There are also a lot of insane dialogues, Patty and Martha discuss Colin, Patty says, "If I had not beaten him so hard," Martha responds sympathetically, "You must be Patty, you must!" And do not start with how ugly the wallpaper looks in the whole house! The only good thing I can say is that the costumes look reasonable for the period in which they are to be used. I could probably talk about how amateurish it is all day, but I think you have the idea. One to avoid, unless you are a serious masochist! I did not regret buying or seeing it for a second!
