I liked the Far Cry game, nice graphics, good level design, interesting and clever opponents, above average length and even a decent plot. I am not against film spin-offs of games by default. I found "DOOM The Movie" hilarious. What Uwe Boll did here is to take the game and modify each of his good points and turn them into something awful (not the length, the movie is just a merciful 90 minutes), the game that is quite a feat. The entire plot is told without any twists or puzzles. Several completely ridiculous scenes tell you everything about the story. And come "Genetically modified soldiers"? They could have imagined a better name. <br /> <br /> However, this film should receive a prize for the most idiotic love scene. I have never seen anything like it. I could not believe they were seriously trying, "we have to leave the wet clothes" "I think I get hypothermia" (though all wear T-shirts) "we need to cuddle together to create body heat" "is that your weapon But ... but ... were not there people who made that clear? There must have been a scriptwriter, a director, an actor, a gazer, an electrician, a food man! Why did not anyone jump into this scene to prevent evil? Was this film made of devastated, inhuman, genetically altered movie people? I'm not going to talk about how many logical mistakes, inconsistencies, and scriptwriting scripts exist, but even for the die-hard action fan, this can not be anything but offensive. <br /> <br /> This movie I actually asked for 2 out of 10, so I'm doing this favor. But I have to explain where the second star comes from. Special effects? Nah acting? Not really. Notes on the game? You wish. Waiting! They used the font from the game for the title and the credits. That was neat. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for a bad movie night, choose "2012 - Supernova", this is just - sad.
