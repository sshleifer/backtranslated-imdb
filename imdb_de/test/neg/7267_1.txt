Honest to God, the outline says it all. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) goes through a cheap strip club from L.A. There are no strippers, so the last male visitors go out to recruit strippers. <br /> <br /> The men are considered kings or arrested for espionage of women (although it is a women's planet, though we have only two women, women taking part in sex scenes of girls and girls), and finally, As is the case everywhere with science fiction clich√© movies, women are convinced that men are good for something. Well, not the men who made this movie, at least not! <br /> <br /> But boy, we can see a lot of it in amazing amount of softcore sex and nudity. This one has less plot than usual for such films. So switch channels if you do not like that kind of movie, and clench your teeth if you're interested in these kinds of things.
