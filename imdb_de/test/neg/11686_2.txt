I have never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I have no choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid historian of World War II, I do not even know where to begin, how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carabiners with Korean war bayonet noses, K98ks missing cleaning rods and visor hoods, German uniforms that did not exist, the list could last forever. It has been added that it is filled with flaws, has literally no conspiracy or peak and is on par with your local college theater. The epitome of cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... There are too many good WWII films to waste your time on this garbage.
