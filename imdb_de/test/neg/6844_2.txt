A cinema with a bad history of gruesome murders of the past will be reopened. Of course, the bloody killings start again. This uniquely talented Rick Sloane (who later fell out of favor with celluloid celluloid Hobgoblins) wrote, directed, shot, scored, and treated him with a terrible lack of flair and finesse. This dreadful attempt to wipe out a Slasher Spoof strike rots in every conceivable way: the agonizing lethargic tempo, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there's a stinking surplus of gloomy master shots), an annoying droning and superfluous hum'n 'shiver synthesizer score, the apartment (not) directing, a boring, talkative and uneventful screenplay, the timid, plaintive, comedic sense of uncompromising murder, a pathetic, nonsensical murderer (he's just a crumpled old guy in pasty shape) , the consistently offensive and unsightly characters, an unsatisfactorily abrupt ending, and lifeless performances of a strangely uninspired cast, make viewing this fluffy swill about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels soaked in sour vinegar. This raw material lacks the necessary raw charm and sloppy energy needed to enjoy junk. Instead, it's just a bland, trampling and meandering rigidity that never catches fire or even amuses in such a shabby, smoking manner. Only a small part of the nakedness and the delightful presence of the ever-reliable Mary Woronov as a snappy, sardonic secretary relieves the general stinginess of this miserable loser.
