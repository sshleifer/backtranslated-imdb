I am amazed that so many people find this movie almost good. Let me make it clear that I'm a HUGE Hitchcock fan who took the trouble to make as many of his films on video as I could, but in my opinion, this movie was not just for Hitch's films. I'm too nice here. This picture was really shitty. I do not care that Hitch did a favor to the very talented Carole Lombard, but I've seen 50's sitcoms with more wisdom and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? I like mashed potatoes and ice cream, but I do not want to try them together. I saw better chemicals chemistry chemistry on the highway than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, you should avoid this movie and see one of its better ones. The screams that Hitch made in the old TV series was funnier than anything this movie fails miserably.
