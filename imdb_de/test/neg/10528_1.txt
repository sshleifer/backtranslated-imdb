This movie is sometimes a wild college sex comedy of the 80s, others a sweet, romantic ... Then he has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in sayings of science fiction ... It's so uneven that it's almost ridiculous < But I would hardly count it among the worst films I've ever seen except for the fact that they've cast Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing for him to work with here. Bad dialogue, bad performance, bad work ... And yet he is fantastic ... There is nothing good about his role and yet he does it when it comes to pure charm. <br /> <br The fact that he accomplished so much with so little seems to highlight how much everyone else in the film has failed, making him even worse than I suspect it really is ... <br /> <br /> If another actor were in O'Toole's role, I would have forgotten this movie as a crap and never thought of it again, but a good performance by Peter O'Toole, despite all the contradictions, ensures that I am myself Time to come to remember this movie ... If only as a film, it might have been good if someone involved was almost half as good as Peter O'Toole.
