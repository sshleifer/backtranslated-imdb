Aussie Shakespeare for 18-24 with blood, blood and more blood. And a good dose of nudity. This will not be the case for everyone on many levels, too cheap for some, too cheap for most. On a low budget, they try and do it best, but it only works sporadically. And this Macbeth just seems to be missing, it just is not compelling. Although there are some that work well for most, you can not get heads, especially the mecbeths. The best performance came from Gary Sweet and the strangest Mick Molly. If you are in Shakespeare, you will see it, but if you mature your cheese you will love it. It's not a bad movie, but not so good either. sam peckenpah would love it, that is, if it were filmed as western. I expected a lot because I loved onesie. This was an empty attempt.
