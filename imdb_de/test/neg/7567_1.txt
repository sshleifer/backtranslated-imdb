If I could give this movie less than a 1, I would certainly do that. I read a review of the movie in the LA Times, and when I passed the theater, I remembered the review. My wife and I were a game, and we thought it might not be as bad as the critic said - you know, critics. Sure enough ... Give me a break with the terrible acting, the terrible camera work, the inadequate use of the budget (which has been repeatedly referred to as an apology). I've been working on movies with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It's the director and the producer who make the films work - they pick the teams. That's it. If they do not assemble and get it up and running, it just will not work. So they do not - and they do not. I do not think they can do it ... I just had to take the time to write this review ... although I'm sure the film crew does not appreciate this review - I hope I'll do you a favor with it all My wish that you are well, but - in another career. Good luck.
