And one of them is bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of human masculinity, not to fish. This is not Dante's "Piranha" of '78 (who had the fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha". A trio of photographers, two men and one woman, meet a local hunter-trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they do not know William Smith's film resume playing Caribe. Otherwise, they would have known right away that he was the villain of the play. Smith may also have refused to film or cut the end before filming is complete (see the end of this commentary). As mentioned above, this image contains many full-length images of native wildlife (birds) - and the central set, a motorcycle race that takes too long. The reason I get a second star from me, of course, is William Smith, who can not really save this mud, but he proves once again why he was the 'go to' 30-35 years ago, if you're a really bad man needed a rogue; In his best form, Smith could be really scary. He's the type who likes to kill, possibly in a sadistic way, and you get the feeling of the evil grin he usually puts on when a mood hits him. Physically it's very impressive, and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much lost within the first half hour. This was what brought Smith to most of his roles; It seems hopeless for the other characters against this manly monster. Unfortunately, the film still muds until the end, as if a minute of material had been lost - a confusing, incomplete climax.
