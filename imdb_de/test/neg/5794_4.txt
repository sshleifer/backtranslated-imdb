Even Disney is guilty of cash cow disease. Following the success of The Love Bug in 1968, the House of the Mouse was redeemed by Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. Neither the sequel that captured the charm and unofficial appeal of The Love Bug in '68, we find racer Jim Douglas and his buddy Wheely Applegate, who contest Herbie at the Monte Carlo Rally. Of course, things outside the race start to take precedence, they are involved in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car! The car stunts are of course pleasant and good to the eye, and it would be a pity to really give vent to such a friendly piece of lint. It's just that the movie goes nowhere fast and now personally I see it for the coin motivated work it is. Nevertheless, you can see how Herbie takes a bath, penetrates the bad guys and of course dances for the lady in his life, so there is something for everyone, I think ................. .. .4 / 10.
