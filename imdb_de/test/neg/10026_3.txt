Supercraptastic slasher fare that feels too long after 80 minutes. Years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain were burned in a forest fire. Years later, motorhomes from the fire area disappeared. A bunch of horny kids is of course on the way to this area to make their own camping trip. Despite the ominous welcome by the forester (Jackson Bostwick), the children are definitely on the mountain. After a short while, the children begin to be picked up by the monster, which is not visible until the end of the movie, probably because the make-up was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to talk about: they are killed in exactly the order the formula dictates for these films, and the "last girl" has to defend herself, even though the last girl is imprisoned in a refreshingly dejected denouement situation and being impregnated by the monster. <br /> <br /> The story itself could not match the weight of the feature length, so it was filled with seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects that were obviously filmed for another movie and randomly inserted as a means of doing so Film long enough for a video release. On the positive side, the animal pictures are pretty nice. Highlights include Bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent climbing death sequence, OK Gore and the Great Jackie Coogan in his final movie role as a bumbling local sheriff. This is a long way from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. This only applies to slasher completeists.
