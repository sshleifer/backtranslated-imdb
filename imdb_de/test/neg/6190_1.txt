Algiers is not a classic, but a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, which is staged by Duvivier and plays with the much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers, I recommend you do not even look at this movie and instead see Pepe le Moko, because it is much more elaborate, nicer filmed, the lines are not clich√©d and the characters are much more portly in reality. In addition, the end is so dramatic and crucial to Pepe's character that the Algerian version is unbearable. Although Algiers imitates each scene almost perfectly, the actors miss as well as the credibility of the characters. In addition, the wardrobe is really breathtaking in all scenes, especially in the last scene of Pepe and Gaby (at all times), but also when she is on the boat. Honestly, Algiers is cheap in terms of imitations.
