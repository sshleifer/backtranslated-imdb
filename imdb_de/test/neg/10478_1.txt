First, I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course I am against any attempt to adapt it for a feature film or a TV movie. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to doubt it. Although the original version from the early 1970s was shot at the Phillips Exeter Academy, where the author of the book attended the school, and although she remained as faithful to the book as possible, they really lacked depth and succeeded not to capture the essence of the characters. The original just seemed to go through the movements. If you read the little things about the movie, you find that it was mainly cast with non-actors. Therefore, the original has an amateurish feeling and ultimately fails. <br/> <br/> This new release, though I'll admit that it captures the look of time better than the original, seems to have thrown the book all together. Scenes are rearranged, characters imposed where they do not belong, characters that are not in the book, and no attempt has been made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the main sin of all: The tree is not treated as a vital, almost central character in the book. This is an inexcusable mistake by the filmmakers. How could they downplay the role of the tree? Why was not it introduced immediately? Why does the dead poet start? And what about God's accent in God's name? This film is, to be blunt, garbage. A separate peace should not be a difficult book for the stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine, linear style. The filmmakers should have trusted the story as it has already been written; Make changes, sure; beautify here and there, sure; Take a mild dramatic license, for sure. But are you destroying one of the pearls of American literature? What did they think? In their falsification of the plot they take every opportunity of tension or drama. The whole movie falls flat and fails miserably. <br /> <br /> If you're a high school or a student assigned to read this book, and you think of the ranting and watching the movie ... do not even think about it. This movie will not help you. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we have to wait even longer for a version of this story to come to the screen that really does it justice.
