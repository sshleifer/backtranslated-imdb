This show bothers me. it takes slots in Nick that could be reserved for the fresh prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. They are all better than home improvement. First of all, my mother Jill annoys me so much. She is a hypersensitive crying baby and I really despise her. Brad is a big toad, and he's annoying too. and the youngest brother, I do not even know his name! I do not notice him at all! That's probably not the fault of the actor, probably the writer. Tim is just a stupid butt. Although Jill is definitely my smallest favorite, I do not like any of them. The only reason why I gave this stupid show three stars is a star for cool. As a middle kid, he's still an annoying little brother, but an older brother, and I like his funny character. the other star goes to Al. His character is sympathetic as a chubby friend. Apart from randy and al, this show is shit.
