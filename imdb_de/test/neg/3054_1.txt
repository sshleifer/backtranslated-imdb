Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenney intended to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's RETURN OF LIVING DEAD from the same year. The cinematography was bad, the movie was very dark, so I had to set the brightness to maximum. In fact, horror images must be dark, but not like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The entire film was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger and terrible make-up effects. An average vote of 5 stars for this movie? I can not believe that. Maybe the users were happy about the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were actually worth 5 stars. Greetings, Hans-Dieter
