Jean Claude Van Damme's film career seems to have gone to hell in a handcart. How ironic it is when he plays a character who meets the same fate right at the beginning of the film! It is also interesting to see how much, very similar, the actions of his films, regardless of who producer, director or scriptwriter are. Van Damme usually plays a character who lives in France. Due to a number of circumstances, Van Damme is in another part of the world where he has a brother who is dying, and it is up to Van Damme to take revenge on a figure he just struck. Watch AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films with the headline "Actor Jean Claude Van Damme", and they all have almost the same kind of story structure. That does not mean that they are of course identical, just very similar, and if you've seen a Van Damme movie, you've basically seen everyone. With MAXIMUM RISK it is the same
