Probably not the same version as most other reviewers, as there is no real hard sex. What do people mean by hard sex? The kind of explicit hard sex in movies with Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Well, that's a really bad movie. I doubt I've ever seen so many well-known actors in a movie. The script is really bad and devious, the direction and the cinematography are terrible and the editing does not exist. It's really an absolutely terrible movie. You could see this ten times and still not understand what it is. The only memorable scene is the one in which people are buried up to their necks and a huge lawnmower comes along and depilates them. Yes, you read that right, a Roman-era movie has a scene where a giant lawnmower is hacked! <br /> <br /> Worth knowing. Many years ago, a pirate version of THE THING (1982 version) made the leash lessons on my island and was copied onto a loaned book by CALIGULA, which means that the pirate version of THE THING begins with the first few seconds of CALIGULA the man's wife walks through the forest , then the title sequence of THE THING begins. This caused the people who had seen the pirate band to believe that the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 movie, and was very confused as to what it meant. Well, that's what you get when you rent pirate videos. But since I've seen CALIGULA, I do not know what it means
