At first, I was watching a movie called Survival Island on SHOWTIME. It is said that it was a movie with Billy Zane in 2006, and since I like him and could not sleep, I thought I would watch it. Looked interesting. I looked at it and decided to look in the IMDb who this new face was. Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG. I could not believe it. It will play back in 1 hour and 30 minutes on Showtime Channel. This date is May 28 and the EDT or Florida time. You can check and show your Showtime entries by title. I will not go into detail to see the movie, but at some point there is a woman in a white bikini going into the water, taking everything off, you see her naked body ... when she runs out of the water again she sees you her underwear on. Funny, there are many other mess. I can not believe by chance that I have decided to look it up. I wonder if the people who renamed it sold it to a movie studio, but it's already on Showtime, ha ha. Good laugh I'll give it 1-1 / 2 stars. C, D + film.
