I've seen every episode, and the characters have all remained the same selfish, tiny little brats, there's no character development in 5 years (getting pregnant is not a development, if you're still the same daddy girl, only Delinda Danny itches. ) Because dad is not there. Sam never changes or never grows, which makes her boring, repetitive and annoying after Season 3 so annoying Danny is a typical soft character that is ruled by everyone in his life (he has no directors own morality), especially Mary and Delinda. The old boring clich√© they want is boring. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is fine, only to be seen, only he is another wet dream of hacking scrimmers a former CIA man who has great contacts and training etc, so that he can stop any thief or swindler known to man, even if the cameras do not make up half of the material they make up for a while, but in 5 years the writers seem very stupid Why? Because they have all these expensive and advanced technologies, but no simple walkie-talkie (communicating is quick and easy), you'll never see safety walking around on the floor, just when there's a situation and suddenly everyone is there. <br /> <br /> The storylines are moving very quickly from the cheating and robbery of the casino in one way or another, to horrible typical American boy-girl relationship ships, as well as death material that can be seen around the world, they have sex, but I hate you, I've always loved you, I think I do, but I love them instead, but what if someday I might be blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would recommend 'Hotel Babylon' to people who like Las Vegas has so much more to offer, simply because the characters are interesting and will not be sidelined for 6 months of the year. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to be British? I would rather see the same actors in 5 different shows than 5 years, which were consistently the worst on the same show.
