Without really being the worst sci-fi movie ever made, or the worst I've ever seen, 'Time under Fire' is still way below average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not so bad, it starts as an X-Files story, combining Bermuda triangle secrets with time travel. Shortly, elements of other genres (too many) mix together, but the story never awakens beyond the interest of a television series. Soon, "Time under Fire" quickly turns into a series of clich√©s. Not only are too many genres mixed, but it's also not possible to create exciting or special effects that might remind the viewer of the movie. Acting is bad and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.
