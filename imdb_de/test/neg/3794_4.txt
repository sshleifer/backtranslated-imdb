I saw this 3 days ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere of it, in the tiny cinema at the Triskel Arts Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found "Strange Fruit" as a great movie. It's a bit rough on the edges, but for a low budget movie that's to be expected! In general, the acting (especially by lead actor Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and direction are excellent, and the script is extremely entertaining and thought-provoking, with some nice setups and witty dialogues. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit abrupt, without the characters and events coming to an end after the finale. But maybe the filmmakers wanted that? It certainly made the movie disturbing. I thought it was good that the main character never got on the screen with his mother. It makes you wonder if he will ever do it or not, because sometimes these things are never clarified in reality. This was a good choice to leave unresolved instead of wrapping it sentimentally! <br /> <br /> Taut and exciting, "Strange Fruit" is a very ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what the writer / director is doing. Kyle Schickner is about to start. He - and his colleagues - are a talent that should be seen. <br /> <br /> I hope "Strange Fruit" will soon get a broader release as more and more people watch this movie, an above-average thriller with some original revealing phrases about homophobia and racism in America's Deep South. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
