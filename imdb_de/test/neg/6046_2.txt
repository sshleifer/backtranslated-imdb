A sci-fi network original. Not the best. Not far from the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) encounters a "key" that can open a gate to a parallel earth taken over by mutated spiders. The mutations have been controlled over the last thirty years by an oversized alien queen. It has already eaten up the population of this parallel world, which resembles Chicago without a resident. Guess what? Now she has to find another world to feed on. The electrician manages a four-member team that reluctantly deals with the task of saving the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the entire movie. The cast also includes: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would have thought that the sci-fi network could have spent more money on special effects.
