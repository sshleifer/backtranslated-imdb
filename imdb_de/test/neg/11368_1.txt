This was the worst TV movie I have ever seen. The visuals were so choppy that I felt dizzy. I hated the constant enlargement and reduction as well as the frequent change from black and white to color. I also thought that the story made no sense at all, and it was another clich√©d action movie with a hero, a bad guy, and a few hostages. I could make a better movie with my own camera, why? I can keep it quiet, which the director could not do. All in all the worst thing I have ever seen. You thought Disney was bad? I did not even look at the whole thing, because I'm sure I could guess the result, and the visual was the worst I've ever seen.
