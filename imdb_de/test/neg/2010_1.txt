My original commentary on this title was deleted by an IMDb user or staff just because I just did not like this movie so much that I had to honestly write what I felt after seeing this bad excuse for a movie. Where is my word freedom? Of course this movie was made by students because it was so lame and amateurish. Of course, they also have to start somewhere? The script was incoherent confusion and acting too. What can you expect for low-budget and B-class players? In some places CGI is so bad it looks like an old PC. Some may say that this is something like an "Alien" clone, only this time Dracula (in a vintage costume) is sucking dry at the other one after another. The sets are not convincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), though the story is set in a big spaceship. <br /> <br /> It would be fun to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought after the release of the film ... Coolio must be the worst rapper ever to be an actor has been ! <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time and money. I do not know why I even bothered to rent this strip. Honestly, I just hate this movie. With Uwe Boll's House of the Dead, Dracula 3000 shares the dubious honor of being the worst movie ever. (Well, I've seen even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Every other movie will be better.
