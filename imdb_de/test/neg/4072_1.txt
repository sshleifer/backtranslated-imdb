This movie is so bad that it is worth seeing. In this film, viewers will get into a coma within the first 10 minutes and out again. It all started when a few writers came up with the idea that a plane was abducted and a passenger who could fly a small plane had to land the animal. However, you know that this has been done many times. To do it differently, we do it very badly! Major Masters takes its name from the 80s movie "To Live and Die in L.A." robbed. played by character by Willem Dafoe. This saves 10 minutes of writing and production time. The aircraft should be a Boieng 747. This aircraft has a unique silhouette, even in the dark, with its characteristic forward bump above. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan, who lamented this point when Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the 1980s. However, when the plane takes off, it is clearly not a 747 that looks more like a 767. This well-researched film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfortable rumble seats. No flight engineer is required in this complex aircraft! The heroine is played by constantly pouting Gloria Lynn Berg. After the kidnapper was handcuffed by people in this jumbo jet despite several busloads, nobody bothers to watch this guy who nearly killed everyone. He just has to enjoy himself. <br /> <br /> The crippled plane that runs out of fuel from all the abducted shenanigans will not return to Hawaii. Only the track is 300 feet short! Four army corps with small bobcats (the kind you hire to carry a load of horse manure all day behind your barn) will be able to make a 200ft wide and 300ft swath through the jungle in 20 minutes! You do not need a bulldozer here! Where can you find such people? These guys could build a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in only three hours, with only tablespoons, a compass and a duck. After this hellish barrier has been fixed, Masters will try to land the plane as a heroine pouts away. The hijacker chuckles to himself and can do more unattended effort. He is, after all, subject to an extremely reserved manner that I can not tell you. But can you tell Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many delayed scenes in this movie. The wounded captain is parked at the bar adjacent to the plane, while Masters, who is said to be barely able to fly, puts the plane in 60-degree benches and drops 20,000 feet per minute. The pilot should kiss the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but he does not move an inch. <br /> <br /> I think if they chose other actors to play those roles, that movement could have been a lot better. If we need a pouting heroine in the movie, why do not we choose the more famous actress, Bernadette Peters, who is constantly pouting? Besides, she can sing and the busty, well aging Peters could show some free cuts. Now with the vocal angle this could be a hijacking, let's leave the airplane film MUSICAL! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as pilot. You can sing a duet in the cockpit before the abduction, and it is impossible for the tenor tenor to fly to the ceiling, while Masters conjures up magic on this big bird. According to the musical theme, Masters could then be played by Andrei Bocelli, with whom Peter Can sing while landing the plane. Not only is he totally blind, he knows only a few English words. That's a conspiracy! Remember the margin of your seat conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the air traffic controller: ATC: "Sir, please throttle back to 180, the flaps are set to 25 degrees. Keep 230 Headings" <br /> <br /> Bocelli : "What?" <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, arm spoilers now confirm the brake pressure at 250 psi. Retain the descent at 500 fpm" <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> The kidnapper may have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield, who can spit a plethora of his one-liners while he's sitting, tied up and sitting unguarded: wife is in group sex. Yes, she screwed me up in front of the judge and the jury! "Get the idea? <br /> <br /> MISSING OPPORTUNITIES The film has its usual weeping and moaning passengers that were never developed, and Woody Allen could have offered one of his neurotic monologues in the background:" She said I was great in bed. I told her I practice a lot ... "Now this is a movie! <br /> <br /> According to the similar film" Executive Decision ", the lazy gaze Steven Segal is graciously killed at the beginning of the movie and The film has a chance to have 747 massive attics at the top.The plane was introduced in 1969. Who knows what has accumulated there in almost 40 years? My uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all sorts of stuff would it not cool when Masters opened the trap door and saw a teary-eyed Chevy Chase in a woman's dressing gown looking at old Super 8 films of his childhood? Just a recommendation. <br /> <br /> So give him a chance and imagine how great this movie could be if I had my hand in it ...
