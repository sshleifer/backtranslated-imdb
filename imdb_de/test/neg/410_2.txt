This review tells the story of 4 little friends who watched Angels and Demons the first night they came out, even though it was a school night because "Angels and Demons" is worth it. Two of the four had read the book. Of those who did not, one man wore pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful part of the evening after the vile angels and demons were observed. <br /> <br /> The film starts in a lab where antimatter is created while another process is in progress. And apparently someone knows something about it. Notice how confused I am .. I do not understand what happened: they made only antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on the chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They take out CERN and its symbology. They take out the Hassasin and replace him with a religious British guy. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They defeat Vittoria's rape scene. They fight Langond's fight with Hassasin (now British guy on crack). They take out the press guy who follows them. They eliminate the death of the fourth cardinal. They eliminate the fact that the Camerlengo will be Pope. They eliminate the big program of Camerlengo. They take Langdon out of the helicopter and land towards the end on this island. They exclude the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take Langdons fun and mostly they take out Vittoria's sexuality. <br /> <br /> Apart from the film, which completely loses focus on the details, the film HORRIBLY is played. You have to admit that there were some good things. For example, the recovery of the Sistine Chapel must have been extremely difficult and it was done extremely well. The explosion scene was MIND BLOWING. Besides, screw this movie to ruin the book for the people who have not read it.
