The plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus, and October) are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decide to split up the belongings of their deceased friend. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better way to show their grief than to attend a small virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor old Loomis. <br /> <br /> The Production: This film is just another entry into the latest Hollywood madness of low-budget The horror of PG-13 was aimed at capturing the audience of junior high school. The direction is sluggish, with the short cuts in the style of music videos that make it difficult to follow the action. The dialogue is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never know where the game came from or why those who play it die. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this movie was not original, but promised a lot. But the bad execution on both sides of the camera makes this one big guy. <br /> <br /> If you ever have a desire to "kill someone in a video game, kill them in real life" - horror movie Take my advice and skip Stay Alive for the superior Brainscan.
