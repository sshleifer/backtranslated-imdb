It's hard to decide if this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if it's only portrayed by crap actors. In any case, it suffers from storywriting, which is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Although the film was filmed in the late '80s, it is played like a' 60s screwball comedy (apart from the lack of real humor)), especially the part of the "good girl", who makes a Doris Day character as annoying as one might wish / fear, including a slightly rickety opposition to anything their friends want to "joke" about. The net effect is that after a while you begin to hope that she bites it, so you do not have to listen to her voice anymore. <br /> <br /> Some obscenity and unnecessary nudity, as well as some really '80s clothing is the only indication that this movie was filmed in the' 80s. Oh, and pretty passable music too. <br /> <br /> Storywise, that's pretty formula stuff. A couple of horny teenagers (apart from "Miss Nice Girl") decide to celebrate the Halloween night by hosting a party in a haunted house. It is celebrated and faked, along with a miserable "seance" that triggers the demonic possession frenzy that is the theme of the movie. After that, the only exciting part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will expire. They certainly do not care if they do it or not. The actors are so bad that getting demons / zombies / dinner actually improves their performance, and the ridiculously stereotyped dialogue is so annoying that you have to squirm in your seat. <br/> <br/> Gorewise, this strip is not crazy especially, unless you think cheesy is somehow "special". For example, the demon's head, which occasionally appears, is so screamingly fake that you wonder if it's a 5-year trick-or-treat. Part of the music is not half as bad, and the first of our bland Scooby gangs who take possession of it performs a wonderful and really sexy dance routine at one point before turning into a nasty affair. <br /> <br /> Also, and I do not know why, towards the end of the strip, I actually managed to get involved. The tension, which was largely absent in the movie, made a late appearance, and I began to wriggle out of discomfort rather than causing trouble. Which is what a horror movie should do. <br /> <br /> Consequently, I can not bring myself to rate this movie as a low point because of an inexplicable miracle (I can not rule out being obsessed (demons) I was actually a bit crippled br /> <br /> But do not pay any money to see it, it's barely worth your time, and yet just cash, look at it on YouTube when it's there.
