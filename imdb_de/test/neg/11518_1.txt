I'm in a movie club at my school, and I had to watch this totally dark movie. The story of the film is not bleak, but the entire film itself is extremely bleak. The acting was absolutely terrible. The children cried excessively. A metal mast could have done a better job. I desperately wanted to fall asleep, but because the TV was so loud, I was saved from peace. The monkeys are neither sweet nor funny. The drama is laughable. I can not remember when I saw a horrible movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely unreal. The adults try to be good actors, but they do not seem to break stereotypes. The girl even seems to want to leave the movie by falling off a hill during the movie to leave him. I do not blame her. Micheal Anderson should publicly apologize for this movie. Not just for me, but for all the others who were forced to sit through this horrible movie. I have to apologize. Although I had nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this film, because that means at least it will become somebody. This film even surpasses the disillusionment of the films of Rob Schneider and the Cheetah Girls. I would even go so far as to say that it is even worse that Hilary Duff's film collection is, but that urges. Please do not watch this movie or you will be urged to write a similar review to this movie about how awful this movie is. I am very sorry.
