I received a copy of this movie from a friend on my 21st birthday, whom he obviously picked up for 99p from a cheap video box. <br /> <br /> I've never been so frustrated watching a movie - that was boring, Adam West was (literally) wasted, and in retrospect I can not remember it. My lack of enjoyment rose so much that the second the rewind rolled, we shattered the cassette and hung the tape in the living room. Only for a good measure, we set the lid on fire.
