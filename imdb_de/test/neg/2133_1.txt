This stupid, eco-friendly "Jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly dubbed and stupid. There is nothing redeeming about it. <br /> <br /> Plot follows a shark / octopus creature thing that appears off the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a crying wife and a dumb husband) for some reason with a fork stings). His rise to the surface is always represented by a vague side view, which is always bumpy. It does not make sense, it's terribly boring, and the conspiracy is shit. <br /> <br /> There are moments of the camp that can not be ignored: the same view of the boat of the couple opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor strikes the breast of a dying patient twenty times with a dibibulator without stopping, though he is clearly dead; the porno-like soundtrack; the attitude of the lovers on the beach, with three different themes ("That we move forward!") Do this; the ancient computer that sounds like Kermit the frog; a beer-eating scientist screaming "I know!" a la dr. Smith; The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (much noticed by Mike and the Bots). , , <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is her best episode, but she's definitely better than the movie itself. "This is how I like to go fishing, people ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Crow <br /> <br /> A star for "Devil Fish"; seven for the MST3K version <br /> <br />
