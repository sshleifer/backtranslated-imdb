This was included on the floppy disk "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather boring collection of short films. Shorts are one of my favorite style of movies, but somehow it was difficult for the people who put together this second collection to find high quality content - and they were nowhere near as good as the first band or other short collections. <br /> <br /> This short film feels like imperfect. There is a story, but so much unanswered, that the viewer, like me, feels a bit hilarious and unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (that's a dog, by the way) going to a secluded beach. The lady speaks with an accent that is sometimes hard to follow. Since I'm hard of hearing, I would have loved it if the title had been closed. In any case, the friend goes swimming while she takes a nap. When she awakes, her dog is gone. She panics and lets the guy follow her, looking for the dog. They spend most of their time arguing and being uncomfortable. Then they stop out of the blue to have sex. Later, they find the dog at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters are concerned, they both looked pretty dysfunctional and unlikely. She was a demanding and demanding woman and he seemed to despise her. When they wondered why they were together, her little break in sex showed what bondage she held together. Some may like the characterizations - I found people always irritating and unreal - more like cartoons than the people you may meet or know. Besides, it's not worth the profit for all of that (unless you want to see the guy naked).
