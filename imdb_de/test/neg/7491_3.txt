The cast of the C-Class and badly altered scenes, along with terrible drama, have led me to believe that this would lead to a good TV release like the FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. However, my local blockbuster has about 9 copies on the shelves, none of which was checked out when I rented the title (I wonder why ...). Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the director's "fear factor." The whole "death curse" at the bottom of the screen sometimes completely contradicted the conspiracy, for example, when the helicopter drove over Angola and the toll rose at a rapid pace of 23 million 24 raced. However, if the movie ends (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the helicopter has landed), the counter of the number of offenders will be reset as it was when the helicopter was in the vicinity. The end of the film has left a big whole in the whole plot, and God knows no one is waiting for the sequel. Do not rent it, I recommend it only if you have the title without loss of money and are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.
