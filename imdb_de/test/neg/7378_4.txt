First of all, I'm in the USA. <br /> <br /> When I saw this for the first time, I thought it was obvious and disgusting from "The Office" (UK). I would have given it zero stars, but behold, it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series. Even so, it is difficult to compare these or any other shows with a similar dynamic (including the American "office"). It just is not nearly the same to be the same. <br /> <br /> I will appreciate that it is original and ahead of its time. I also say that it - and the US "Office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satires. The British "Office" is something grand and transcendent, as if it were populated with real people in events that felt like they had actually happened. However, unlike this or the shrill Christopher Guest "Mockumentaries", it is not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" is definite. <br /> <br /> However, "The Newsroom" It's very funny. It's distant and self-confident, but with a cast and a crew that are not nearly smart or talented enough to load the goods. It is a weighty comedy worn on weak shoulders. Praiseworthy, but not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what about the lack of an anamorphic DVD ?! I know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen because I saw the pilot on one of our HD channels. CBC, come with the program. ; )
