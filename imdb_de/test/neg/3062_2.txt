Wow, quite amazing that such a bad thing could actually be done. I'm giving this movie a 2 because it's so bad it has some kind of "car wreck" claim. It's so weird and funny and that has some entertainment value. There's also a bit of nakedness, and that's always appreciated. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? The drama is more than terrible, it's like watching a high school drama film. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad to make this film, and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess The cast of Dan Cortese as an FBI agent and the cherry on top of that bitch. I had to laugh aloud at his acting. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the direction, C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester should simply be taken back and shot.
