This is what shows Disney Channel to kids who are more stupid than sentries. It goes well with them. It's not funny, acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than actors, and everything about this show makes you moan and roll your eyes. Do you want to know why? This show is not just a waste of airtime; leading actress Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character has to visit a strip club and be wasted. The author of the show is also inconsistent. In one episode, the guard is referred to by one character as a "sir" and is referred to by all others as a woman. <br /> <br /> Hello? It's called proofreading and editing. Do it, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the promo for the new "four-part blood-sucking saga"? Disney wanted a separate version of the Twilight Vs. Harry Potter thing. Except a million times Lamer. The Wizards of Waverly Place Movie? Think about it for a minute. The family goes on holiday and the 16-year-old daughter wishes independence from her parents. SAME PLOT by The Proud Family Movie etc ... Worse still, all are Emmies and ALMA's. And most viewers are between 4 and 13 years old (and not teenage teens). how many more years? before Selena Gomez shows her tits? <br /> <br /> and Disney shows are all crap ... shit..hack shows..hack shows..the mind and purse of today's youth ..
