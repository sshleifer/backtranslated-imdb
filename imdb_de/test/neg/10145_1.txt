While it would be easy and accurate to see why Reba in his heart points to many "family-oriented sitcoms" in the way it is subtracted from other better sitcoms, the true truth is that the show is constantly reiterating stereotypes funnier and groundbreaking shows, and the lead actor is completely out of their element. Although I'm sure that Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports it, in a sitcom she shoots Zinger and calls her the next Lucille Ball, far from reality. Reba. <br /> <br /> Reba herself has no presence here to determine the fact that she is thrown as the woman on whom her entire family is concentrated. After a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. I could not care less about their adventures because their overall character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence, and a show around her seems to be short-sighted, pointing to most "family-oriented" programs: a sitcom with many stupid stereotypes that do not appeal to anyone but those who can not afford cables. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it has at least better production values ​​than your standard PAX rip-off.
