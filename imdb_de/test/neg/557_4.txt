Just like its predecessors, "The Next Karate Kid" is a thoroughly predictable film. Its predictability often leads to a feeling of impatience of the viewer, who often wishes the story could move a little faster. Despite its lulls and extreme fame, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost entirely due to the presence of Morita. He does not seem to be too tired of his role, and he gives the film some life and humor and is the best reason to see him. Not terrible, but not much.
