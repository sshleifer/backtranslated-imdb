This show reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons," in which Smithers was just fired by Mr. Burns and was forced to live a miserable life as an unemployed person. All he did was the way the hours were to drink Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a miserable television channel for miserable people who had nothing else to do. "Mind of Mencia" is slightly better than most programming languages ​​of Comedy Central, but it's still an example of why this channel is an inferior filler for people without life. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Mencia is a pretty competent comedian, throwing out refined, soft ethnic jokes and mild stereotypes of people based on their race, gender or economic status, or a combination of two out of three these features. If you've heard one of these jokes by one of your friends in a bar or at work, believe me, you've heard what comedy is all about on Mind of Mencia. Carlos also tries to make fun of the current events, but lacks creativity or originality. That's not to say Carlos is spitting all the time. I found some of his sketches amusing, such as his rap video as Oil Sheik. If you find in your alley bland, normal comedy, you will probably enjoy "Mind of Mencia". For those tired of repetition, pedestrian comedians who trudge the same old jokes stay away.
