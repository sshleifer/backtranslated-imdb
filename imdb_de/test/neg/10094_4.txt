In short, the film is a gang war in the 1950s. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, begins the gang after his brother OD's is on "junk". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is just coming out of jail seeking revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie did not really do it for me. The "Good Guys" were no better than the "Bad Guys". Very little was shown that the Deuces really took care of the community. I suppose the authors chose realism here, but I do not care which side won. None of the characters was sympathetic or even able to show my sympathy. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the advertising between Annie and Bobby had a brisk dialogue, and acting was good overall.
