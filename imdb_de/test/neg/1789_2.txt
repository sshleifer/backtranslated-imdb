A handful of young college sororities decide to camp with a professor. A huge Druid wants to sacrifice her to prevent the Apocalypse from the year 2000, they also have to deal with bikers, an Indian and a Lochness monster. George 'Buck' Flower (a sadly un-sung B-movie clip) is seen as a hobo, and the other two belong to the stunning Savannah (in one of only 3 non-porn roles she had). Both have very small roles. Too bad, everything else in the movie is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Original Trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 breasts, 2 asses
