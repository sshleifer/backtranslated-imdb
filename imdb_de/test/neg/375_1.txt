This time, The Beastmaster (Marc Singer) only meets a new enemy Arklon (Wings Hauser), but due to an annoying teenager (Kari Wuher), they are transported to the future, where they fear it. This is followed by many (lame) fish from water jokes. You honestly do not get such corrupt extensions. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie. The references and "hipness" date the movie badly (this was done in 1991) and who wants to see The Beastmaster in the modern era? Noteworthy is also Wings Hauser, whose embarrassing performance is the best asset of the film. The singer looks awkward, Wuher is irritating and the slang of 1991 makes the film simply unsurpassable. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * by 4- (Awful)
