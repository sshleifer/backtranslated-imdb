Alice Dodgson, a New York-based doctor, gets her driver's license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unauthorized drug, resulting in the patient's death. Without work, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica to look after a rich man's brother. The brother considers himself a zombie and is deeply involved in people's voodoo practices and rituals. "Ritual" is a mediocre horror movie. The action is pretty boring, the actions are stupid and there is no tension a bit bloody because someone kills white people with a machete, but not too much. The cinematography is decent, but the spectacle is really sad. Definitely one to avoid 4 out of 10.
