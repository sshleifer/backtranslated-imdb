I've seen this movie and all I can say is this ... I'm not a film student nor an artistic intellect trying to look for a deeper meaning in anything I do not understand. IF I did that with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yep! He's taking drugs and I can imagine now ... He stumbled one night and sat there with his buddies and laughed and said things like, hey ... would not it be funny if nuns could really fly? How about just falling off a plane and falling free for a while, jumping to the ground, getting up and walking away? * cackles * or whether buckwheat has bathed the Pope? Oh my god, I stop thinking about it! Buddy! We have to do a movie about it! And then he says to his friend when he laughs ... Oh, and would not it be funny if people loved it and called me a genius? For me, this happens when a man takes too many drugs, writes a script and produces a movie. Should I have made LSD to understand what this guy was thinking so that I could laugh too? Because I have to tell you, I did not laugh. I yawned and checked the time. <br /> <br /> I think everyone who does their best to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I had never heard of this director until I read the reviews, what I did because I was crazy, that I had lost the last 2 hours or how long it took (it felt like 12 hours of my life) and I can not get it back anyway ... I read that this guy is a hero addict and he wanted to die for art? what the hell is that? My point of view is somehow proven. This guy is not all there, he's a drug addict and his movie is proof of that ... So, please stop trying to find a deeper meaning for him. If you really want to understand everything in this movie, drop some LSD and sit back and relax, then it might actually make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the time when I saw Gus Van Sant's last days. another movie that I saw insane. I can not wonder what the reviews for this movie would be if the same people who rated the movie rated the movie. It looks like the director of the movie is completely out of his rocker position, or if it's a French movie with sex and subtitles, or if it's a cartoon, he gets great reviews, everything else is boring and was already done boring. BLAH, please bored!
