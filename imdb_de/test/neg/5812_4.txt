Hedy Lamarr, who may have been portrayed by more men than any other actress, is again the tutored mistress of Kent Taylor, the playboy of the society and the general rat race. On a boat from the Yucatan, after Taylor has given her the brush, she tries suicide. But Doctor Spencer Tracy rescues her from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is an all-round medical companion. I think he never heard the word specialist. He runs a clinic for the poor in Manhattan and his journey has been a supporting role in medical research. Lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him to their world, and he even becomes a partner of society doctor Louis Calhern. Of course, Kent Taylor re-enters the picture and the inevitable Hollywood happens. <br /> <br /> When I take this woman, it seems to me that the authors have been heavily influenced by Tracy's Oscar-winning Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role as Doctor Karl Decker is not a patch to what he did as Father Flanagan. Perhaps in this film, so to speak, they tried to give Father Flanagan a little romance in his life. Tracy and Lamarr did not get along well. In fact, this film was referred to as I Retake This Woman because original director Joseph von Sternberg had left the movie, presumably because Lamarr did not work like Marlene Dietrich. She made Lady of the Tropics and then MGM did that with contract manager Woody Van Dyke, known for the speed of his productions. And a completely new side cast was introduced. Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles for both.
