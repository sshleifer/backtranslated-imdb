If you are a Christian or a Jew and hope to see an accurate biblical (or Torah) account of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed with this film. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible were "created" for supporting characters and play a major role in the film. Jethro's role has completely changed and he becomes a worthless father-in-law instead of a shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advice. God is largely removed from the film, and instead the viewers are given the impression that Moses had to find out for themselves. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic twist on biblical things and tries to give Moses the most responsibility to understand what God wants and what He should do. Those who know the Book of Exodus well will not only see inconsistencies in the film, but also blatant events. Most importantly, they see God's dialogue with Moses almost completely absent, which determines everything that Moses does after the Burning Bush. Far from being alone, as depicted in the film, Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even Hallmark does not seem to recognize God's direct role, and without his spoken words to Moses many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has actually changed some things. For example, God plagues people for the golden calf and they have to look at a snake's symbol to live. Instead, Hallmark creates a civil war, and the Israelites choose sides and butcher each other. Of course, Moses side wins. <br /> <br /> Unbelievers may be of minimal value in this film, as they may cause them to seek answers, but the faithful should stay away. The twisted events and changes make it a danger to anyone who does not know his Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
