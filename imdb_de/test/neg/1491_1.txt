It was hard for me to stay awake for the two-hour opening episode. It had come so far down, I doubt I learned anything. The graphics were rudimentary. Every little idea was repeated ad nauseum. Compare this to the Cosmos series by Carl Sagan. That had a good musical theme. There was NO music from these hellish 10-dimensional strings.
