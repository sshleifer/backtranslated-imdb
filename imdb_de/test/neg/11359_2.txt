This movie is really bad, and trying to make scientific explanations for zombies reduces the credibility of the movie's story. There are so many things I could say about the film that I could almost write a book about how much the movie is shit. For example, about 50 people were on the plane, they killed like 100 and they kept coming back, apparently the "virus" leads to hepatic complications, since everyone had yellow eyes. Also, the virus makes people run like lions or something and the virus does not only regenerate tissues, since there is also superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes up people's hair. It's also important to know that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only in airplanes), that person will be thrown into the air. Remember, if you accompany a prisoner on a plane and lose him, always look in the drawers and cupboards in size. They never know where these bastards will hide. And if you happen to be able to land and survive a plane full of zombies against a mountain (happens all the time) after you've killed dozens of people, just get off the plane, watch the sunrise, and make jokes about the flight's dating companion :)
