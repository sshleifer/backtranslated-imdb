"The Man From Utah" starts with a singing cowboy playing on the back of a guitar. So we get to know John Weston (John Wayne), drive to the city and look for work. When he punishes Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) with his failed shooting with a bank robbery, the marshal offers him a covert job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Obviously, the annual winners of the big prize money at Rodeo are a tight-knit band of vicious guys employed by Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also heads the Rodeo Committee. Serious challengers of domination by Barton's best henchman Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) are critically ill or dead. <br /> <br /> As early as the 1930s, Lone Star Western's John Wayne had a charismatic presence that indicated future star quality. Seeing Wayne so young in these films is a real treat. The film itself is shuffled in fifty-three minutes, most of which consists of stock rodeo footage of abseiling, bulldogs and Indian parade and dance. At the crucial rodeo event, Weston avoids a disaster by detecting a poisoned needle inserted into the saddle of "Dynamite," a previously intact Bronco on which he must outlast Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The end is no surprise as Barton's bad guys are giving up on winning the rodeo events and opting for the entire thirty thousand dollars of prize money deposited at the local bank. But the Marshal and Weston are here to thwart their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen in films like "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone," Wayne excludes the character with a pretty young lady in a clinch, this time the daughter of Judge Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young). who searched for him throughout the movie.
