The Patriot (unrelated to the Mel Gibson film of the same name) discovered that Steven Seagal was still "protecting the environment" in his films. Which is good. But it is not good for an action. <br /> <br /> When the storyline (?) finally started this movie, I saw the phrase (?) Leaving a mile. Seagal's anti-warfare and mother nature attitude is not very subtle. For a film that originally debuted in the cinemas, he is, despite some wonderful land footage of Dean Semler, the photographer of Dances with Wolves, very similar to a television movie shot. Steven Seagal makes it like a fight scene throughout the movie and it's totally boring. As an action film it fails, as a drama it stinks, as an environmental message it is obvious. Avoid like Ebola crossed with pestilence.
