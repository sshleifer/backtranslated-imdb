Ewe, the opening screams zero budget. The titles, which look like my grandson, were released with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you will experience the old days of the 80s boobie movies. NEE! Hardly a nudity from a movie that sets Traci Lords in scene! This movie really needed nudity. Instead, you get lots of Lords perkies showing through a shirt, but they seem to be activated by hot steam. That's weird, in my world, the headlights continue in the COLD scene. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind guy is just kidding and no funnier. His antics are so forced and predictable. He stumbles over things and you see him preparing for the fall. He has to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that looks like she was shot and taken months later to get a dealer. And the nakedness is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; It's only a matter of time before Starbucks sues. Not even funny. When Billy arrives in the city for the first time, they come across Namoi Bucks. He says, "Wow, they have these everywhere." That makes you think it's a parody of Starbucks, but surprise behind this switch is Namoi. Apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain has decided to work in a tiny, cold city. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie promises is the snowboarding material from Warren Miller. Yes, that's all Warren's stuff. So if you want to see great action, you should get a Warren Miller movie. Leave Frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie. There is no reason to rent or buy it, and if a friend offers to lend you a copy for free. Beat him and end the friendship.
