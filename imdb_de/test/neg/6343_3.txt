I know that this kind of movie sells tickets and makes a profit to the filmmakers, but it's just not a movie about Vietnam. Vietnam was full of terror for the men who lived there day after day. <br /> <br /> This movie star Gene Hackman, a Korean vet training a group of Rag Day Vietnam veterinarians returns to this country to rescue a group of American prisoners of war who are being held in a local camp. These men include a former tunnel rat, a crazy, acid-gliding sailor, a blond tanned California surfer, and an inexperienced boy (Patrick Swayze) who had just killed a father in Nam. They first train in a camp in Texas, and once they are in Nam they are found out and lose all their weapons. They can find replacement weapons and set off to free the prisoners. Most men are found and rescued, but the rag tag group is largely wiped out. <br /> <br /> This movie was like a video game where you can find out what would happen next and who would burst behind what bush, and who would die and who would live. I think Vietnam was not a video game ....
