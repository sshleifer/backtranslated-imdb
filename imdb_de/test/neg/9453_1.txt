A friend of mine loves crunchy horror movies, so I often get low budget stuff. However, this is the first time I've been forced to write a review ... <br /> <br /> Simply put, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent in the middle for a short scene, when dr. Klaus stands in this chamber and does everything vampirically. <br /> The only good thing is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
