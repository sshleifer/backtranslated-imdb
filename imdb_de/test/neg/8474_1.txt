The satirical film website Dateline Hollywood joked that "Son of the Mask" was just a practical joke star that Jamie Kennedy played in the New Line Cinema for his show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment." If only. And if the movie was only half as funny as the piece of satire. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for the Jim Carrey, who was pulled face to face and saw so many spectators; It also pleased men over 12 years with Cameron Diaz. So it was not a good idea to have a follow-up without both. Also, you would have thought New Line had learned her lesson on Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd. But no ... but to be honest, a completely new cast is the original comic (in which the mask went from owner to owner). However, as written by Lance Khazei under the direction of Lawrence Guterman, there is nothing against it, other than a steady stream of admittedly decent FX through the usual squadron of homes (Industrial Light and Magic enhance the "Ally McBeal" Dancing Baby and her own "Baby's Day Out "(featuring the Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension, etc.) and an even bigger game for cartoon fans, with our hero working at an animation company (responsible for jewels like" Siamese Popes ")., Names his Character after Tex Avery and works not only on references to classic cartoons, but on real clips. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the last approach does not really work, in part because most attempts to bring cartoon trapping to live action fall flat (especially the cars are in party mood) and most of all because the tributes to the Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and, above all, "One Froggy Evening" show how weak this film is in comparison. In addition, the film fits into a Shambolic slapstick and a tense feeling (the underlying theme of the story is family, our hero is not ready to have a son, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Nordic god Loki) is far from Odin's apple Eye ... and what makes Bob Hoskins here as Odin, even after "Super Mario Bros.", is beyond me), and Kennedy is not in the same league as Carrey in the crazy stakes - though he is not like that gets any Help from the script. Also note that the very sweet Traylor Howard (as the mother of the mask's son) does not have much to do, unlike Diaz. Giving him the mask could have helped the movie. <br /> <br /> Further points will be lost if you throw Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski away; for a suspiciously shortened running time (which seems to be missing some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); And for an unbelievably bad try of an inside joke, when our hero could not sell the concept of the "green guy" as an animated TV series - "The Mask" became an animated TV series in real life and was a much better episode up as this sequel. The fact that this actually opened up in front of the US in the UK should tell you everything ... what seems to be about this and "Blade: Trinity" seems to be New Line's intention with Cast members of Two Guys And A girl to bring the market on terrible sequels. "What about" The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone has to stop.
