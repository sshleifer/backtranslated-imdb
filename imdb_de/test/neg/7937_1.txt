Is it just me or is this a WONDER movie? I'll go along, it's a WONDER movie ... <br /> <br /> I know that this is a guy movie (usually defined as a chase, crash, shootout, explosion, etc.) Credibility. If I somehow can not believe in the premise, the movie will NOT work. Therefore we come to the problem with "Assault on Precinct 13". <br /> <br /> No problem for spoilers, I never report details of the conspiracy. However, I will make an exception here, since the presentation SO is inan. Villain is locked up in Precinct 13. Buddy's buddies want to kick him out. Surprise. The pals of the bad guys are actually corrupt policemen. A brooding, restless but heroic young policeman rescues the day while accompanying the girl. POOH. Yes, it's really that easy, and that's stupid. <br /> <br /> "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. Not a bad environment for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Nevertheless, it is outrageously violent and insulting to the police and citizens of Detroit. I spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can not imagine how the final chase ended in the Detroit forest. I must have missed it. <br /> <br /> There are NO refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money. In 2005 there were too many good movies to even lose $ 3.00 at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> FINAL ASSESSMENT: 1 <br /> <br /> (Just because I saw worse movies.)
