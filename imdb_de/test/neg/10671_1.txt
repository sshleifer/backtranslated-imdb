I have to hold my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) who saw this movie. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction was of course the soundtrack. Which is self-evident is brilliant - that's what Himesh does best. But as I said, do not give up your day job - HR definitely should not. <br /> <br /> HR's acting is simply awful. Even if the movie had an action, the thing that baffles you the most is why this man is on the screen and what the hell is doing there. Two advice to the Human Resources Department: Stop acting and secondly, use the Chapstick. <br /> <br /> HR has no screen presence and no acting skills, and the female lead role just looks too young for him. Malika Sherawat - exactly the same old Bollywood vamp crap. <br /> <br /> You can package the product as much as you like, but it can not be used if there is no substance. Do not waste your money ...
