... but unfortunately nobody thought about killing Van to save this condemned production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his beautiful singing voice ... too bad, the songs are mostly bland and juicy. Why did I hate Van so much? Throughout the movie, it seemed like he was doing a Soupy sales imitation in third grade with a lot of raiding, bad jokes, and too much energy trying to make everyone laugh. The worst moment was when he "taught" the class - these kids laughed about EVERYTHING he did. Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos that would probably have laughed! Now, Van was not the only bad casting decision in the movie - he was just the most obvious. Of course it was ridiculous to have John Gielgud (a charming actor) play Asian, as well as Michael York's brother Peter Finch !! The bottom line was that the film was doomed to failure from the start due to these crazy casting decisions ... and the worst of them was God-fearing Bobby Van. Now in real life he may have been a lovable person, and it is sad that he died so young in real life, but with the material they gave him here, I just wanted to rip out his tongue to calm him down bring. > <br /> Now I mentioned the songs as well - egad, those terrible songs !! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle pleasure through and through - and not just a single song and dance number in the movie. Why did you decide to add tons of songs that are of no use to the movie? They only served to make the whole thing look like a mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE in combination with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a pathologically sweet children's film - not one that can be enjoyed by over 8 years. If you can eliminate these problems, you have the foundation for a decent movie. After all, the plot is beautiful and still hides under all the goo. Peter Finch is especially good (although in the original he is certainly not comparable to Ronald Colman). But considering that the original was a near-perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection? Who wants to wade through the syrup ?! <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this movie was included in the book "The 50 Worst Films" by Harry Medved. Even though I did not like the movie, it was not bad enough to be included in the book. I think it was mainly added because it was such a big box-office hit and released just a few years before the book was published. An excellent book - just not one of the best choices for the "holy room" of filth.
