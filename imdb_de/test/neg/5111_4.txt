When I typed Savage Intruder into the search engine of the IMDb, Savage Garden was one of the following options: International Video Collection: The Past Story (1999). I mention this just because I'm a big Savage Garden fan and you should do yourself a favor and try out some of their music like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back instead of dealing with this average pot boiler, sorry, I just wanted to say that. Anyway, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of MGM musical & premiere footage & a couple of revolving portraits that have no meaning in the long run. Hollywood is in the late '60s and amidst the glitter and glamor is a serial killer at work, which involves selecting aging actresses, killing them, and dismembering their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield as John David Garfield) gets off the bus and seeks employment as he arrives at the home of retired actress Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who was "one of the world's biggest stars." But now she lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), a personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young girl called Geta (Virginia Wing) .Catharine broke her foot recently and needs one Vic gets the job done, Vic slowly enchants Katharina's affection, and especially her big purse, Vic turns against Katharine against the other employees, but Vic does not seem to be Vic, a drug addict who gets Greta pregnant. while he still has sex with Katharine, Greta threatens to tell Katharine and Vic to spoil the vile plans, but she has a close encounter with an ax. Nobody in the house is safe as Vic brings drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll party and gardening to the Parker Villa as he takes his sinister plan to become more and more obvious ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Donald Wolfe. I thought Savage Intruder was a bit chaotic, but at the same time a little entertaining. The script is everywhere and can not really decide what it wants to be, Savage Intruder is suffering from an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a severed head and limbs right after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) was killed by a mysterious, unidentified character, but then the Slasher movie elements that she has just built are completely destroyed without that they return to them. Savage Intruder then becomes a feel-good film when Vic befriends Katharine and shows her how she can enjoy life again and has an implied sexual relationship with her. It's really disgusting to think about how old she is to be his grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a hermit and gives up alcohol. Vic seems to make her happy as they go to the party together and arrange banquets for Katharine's girlfriend, as she did. This part of Savage Intruder would not look wrong in a Disney movie! Now and then, the boredom of well-being is interrupted when Vic jumps up and has stupid hallucinations about his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and chops off her hand with an ax. He also has sex with Great sometime. After Greta is murdered, Savage Intruder turns into a bizarre horror movie when Vic is revealed for the madness he is. Savage Intruder simply does not flow well because it mixes different genres with little success. Similarly, the elements of the murder mystery do not work and are, to be honest, a bit of a mystery. Why should one hide the identity of the murderers during the murder scenes, but then make it clear who will oblige them anyway during the rest of the film? Vic as a character did not work for me either. In a moment, he's a cool, quiet, smart, and deceitful cheater. Then he is a total raving madman! Why are all his other victims killing, but are Katharine trying to trick them? What is she doing so differently? If it's because she has money, why not go after her? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the '60s dialogues are pretty funny these days when Vic Greta offers a painkiller and in fact hard drugs. Greta says, "Why do I need a painkiller?", Vic answers helpfully, "because you're a pain," wow this guy knows how he charms the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic works in the garden and asks, "Do you have green fingers?" he answers "no, but I am good in grass!" There is not much blood in Savage Intruder, some severed limbs and a few decapitated heads. There is also a pretty impressive attitude when someone has cut off the hand with an ax, which is probably the reason why it is repeated three or four times. The dumb-looking drug hallucination scenes must be seen to be believed. Technically, Savage Intruder is fine, the locations in Hollywood's grandiose mansion and hills probably give the movie a better look than it deserves, acting is average, as is the rest of the production. All in all, I would say that Savage Intruder has the feeling of being a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away and simply does not work as a result. It's a mildly entertaining one-off watch, in the best case a complete mess of a movie, and you decide which one!
