Imagine, you'll do it: Four teenagers have the task of spending the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to check the existence of the paranormal. If you see this in the dark and late at night; You may have the hair on the neck a few times. Otherwise, this apparent documentary is a very lazy rip-off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What dialogue is supposed to be is very lame and the actors look pleasant, but do not seem to have a real personality. It seems to take forever for something really spooky to happen. This movie is great for 'Sleep Overs' when you have barely opened both eyes and everyone has yakin' and snacks.
