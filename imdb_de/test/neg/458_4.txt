After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (for most of the time) made his best films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, YOU WERE PRICED, THE WOMAN IN THE LAKE, THE PINK HORSE, THE SAXON CHARM, THE JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be observed (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery always wanted to produce and steer more. In 1949, he made his last movie performance - he played Collier Lang, a selfish movie star forced to help the authorities investigate a young girl's friend. This film is a minority viewpoint. Most views are positive. I thought it was a boring, witless script, with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine as a character not being very appealing. She admires Montgomery as a star, and this "helps" if he supports the authorities, but after a while I found out that there was no chemistry between them. The script was also not much fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters have tried. The only thing I remember as a joke to this day is that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth and an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always disguises himself as Churchill, and we see him wearing a wide, fluffy hat, smoking and painting a big cigar (Holmes' bald head helps in disguise). That was the most memorable joke in this movie - not a real memory. Montgomery went into early television and eventually gained the attention and respect he always deserved in movies. His last contact with the films was directed by THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William "Bull" Halsey with his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better movie than this. For his entire film and television career, I give this mediocre film a "4". That seems generous to me.
