Now the television programs (at least in England) are full of home improvement, bargain hunting, house hunting and afternoon cooking shows, and the odds of a terrestrial broadcaster finding such homelessness to occupy a couple hours of video on a slow afternoon are around To say the least, scarce. But in the eighties, the BBC did just that, and you know what I've seen. And it is proof of the overwhelming comedy of this Hungarian-American co-production that over twenty years later I can still remember a great deal of it. First, the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening title to disappear for at least half an hour. (Imagine an American TAIL that has been reworked so that Feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you'll appreciate how confusing it is.) There's a most bizarre animation in which one of the characters artfully waxed Mustache with the necessary fingertip gets a boingender sound effect, which causes him to have boss eyes. Probably funny, if you are stoned, but for a child, quite worrying. Speaking of which, the infamous "Hippo Cull" scene is presented in an abstract way - clouds in indefinite hippo forms are struck by lightning - but still quite uncomfortable. In fact, this movie is rather cold and indissoluble, a sad state that is hardly convincing due to the strange-looking production design, all muddy colors, shaky lines, bloated shapes, and the uniquely European melancholy that reminds of Jan Svankmajer. Then we get songs from the Osmonds! This is not so much a horrible movie as a deeply misguided one, not so much a phantasmagoric as a rather bad trip.
