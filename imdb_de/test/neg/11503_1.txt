I think it was just like Lizzie McGuire, only that it was much worse than the original. The only thing that's different is that she likes animals and science and all that geeky stuff. everything else is the same. She likes a guy she asks too nervously. and later she finds a guy who likes her and she has no idea. I think people have to stop doing these kinds of shows. and another thing that's the same is that it's always dew that the friends are two girls and one guy. People do not think these things are getting old and tired and these ideas are used over and over, and they still use those ideas. but i know people who see this show and i know they like them.
