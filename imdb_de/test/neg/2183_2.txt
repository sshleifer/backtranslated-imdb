"Rose Fish" rightly or wrongly awarded "Go Fish" the reputation of a filmmaker with promising success. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand how she could develop a movie that's made up of stereotypes paired with inferior sitcoms. The whole movie sounds hollow. I writhed all the way through. <br /> <br /> It should be a look at the human sexuality of the nineties. Here you can not learn much more than "In and Out". In the meantime, most of us actually know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women, and men who are sexually attracted to men, and there are even men who are sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rarely has this revelation been presented on the screen with so little humor and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
