No feelings. Bad music (and I'm a reformed 80's metal guy, so I'd be prone to good stuff.) Everything's half done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold onto except to see what horror from the eighties pulls her next. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity in the cause, but does not have enough time. Wahlberg is fine and Aniston slumbers. We know that she did not need the money. Is that the only role she could fit into her summer vacation? Sure, she has to face her every time she shows up on VH1, which is just a little less than Ozzy's. It is hardly suitable as a TV movie. It's hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.
