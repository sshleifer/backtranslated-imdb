The Wolf's Curse begins as reluctant werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) escapes from her "pack" and heads to the city where she works with a vet six months later. The rest of Dakota's pack is unhappy and wants her to come back. Their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says she will come back to them, but the fat werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up their scent and the pack decides to force the problem back and get their affection for their human friends including her boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of her werewolf pursuers? I doubt you will care. <br /> <br /> Produced, written & directed by Len Kabasinski who also had a pretty big role in the movie when Stick I was afraid to see Curse of the Wolf since Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005 ), which is certainly one of the worst movies ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed and it must be said that "The Wolf's Curse" is in every sense a really horrible movie, both conceptually and technically. The Wolf's Curse is a kind of movie in which the low budget dictates the action and the script, not the script that dictates the budget. One has the impression that everything was written and designed to use the few sets and actors, one can almost imagine that the makers say we have some actors, basic equipment and a few locations, so a horror around them filming around. The story is terrible (Michael finds Dakota's position by looking at a big dog two women are walking for), the characters are terrible (a big, fat werewolf who fears a lot), the dialogue is terrible (almost every line There is never any motivation for anything that happens (why is the pack so desperate to get Dakota back?), people seem to do random things, and since director Kabasinski's background is in martial arts, he insists there are many contingencies Add martial arts fighting sequences in the plot. No offense, but this is supposed to be a horror movie, not a martial arts, is it? Apart from a few werewolves, it would be hard to describe Curse of the Wolf as something approaching a horror movie. With almost two hours it feels like it's going on forever and is so slow and uneventful that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> Director Kabasinski obviously worked on a low budget, but filming should be so bad crime. There is no continuity between the recordings, the fight scenes look awful and are so poorly staged that it is untrue. It is sometimes impossible to track what's going on, whether it's through the choppy editing and poor camera angles or the fact that it's sometimes so dark that you literally can not see anything Seriously, there are times during the "curse of the wolf "where the screen is completely black and you can not see anything. I would not hate it if I had to assert myself and see it on a blurred VHS with low resolution. The sound is terrible too, you can hear the wind and the breeze against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted ambient sounds in almost every scene. Did the production actually have lighting equipment during production? It does not feel like it. The special effects usually consist of werewolf masks that look like the stores are selling on Halloween for kids, basically they look awful. Technically, Curse of the Wolf is as bad as they come, I'm sorry, because I know this has a low budget, but it's really terrible to sit through and try to gain some entertainment. This is high school film student quality. I'm sorry if that sounds unfriendly, but it's a fact. Acting is, well, you can probably guess, so I'll stop here before I say something negative. I mean, I've already done enough and I really do not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The curse of the wolf is terrible, both conceptually and technically, this is a real job to hold on. The Wolf's Curse is the kind of movie where time seems to stand still. The type of film lasts almost two hours, but it feels like two years later. One of the worst films you or I will ever see, definitely one you should avoid.
