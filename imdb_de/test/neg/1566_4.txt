GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin-off from the sit-com mid-70s. Although I have not seen the show since the last broadcast, I remember that it was pretty weird because most of the comedies come from the eponymous couple who will live next to the snobbish Fourmile family, a kind of LOVE THY NEIGHBOR without the cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> After seeing this "big screen version of the show", I wonder what this big screen version is about. Certainly not from a popular sitcom com of the same name. For some reason, the film throws off all the interaction between the characters on television, leaving George and Mildred on the street they live in, and engaging in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something, that George inadvertently picked up, causing a squeaky situation and lines like: <br /> <br /> "Did he give it to you?" No, this is the first time a man has resisted my charms. <br /> <br /> "I meant the envelope" <br /> <br /> You have the impression that scriptwriter Dick Sharples (who has never written an episode for the original sit-com) has never seen an episode of the source material and the Show has been confused with the CARRY ON film series, and in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter LOST IN SPACE movie that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it
