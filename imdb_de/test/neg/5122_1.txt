I give "Flashdance" the lowest rating of 1 out of 10, as it is nothing more than a series of music videos with a short movie around the music videos to watch as a full-length movie. Since when does that count as a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer who has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. No line of work that most older women find, let alone 18-year-olds who have left high school. In the meantime, she works as an exotic dancer at night, never really undressing, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. If you look at the well-choreographed and sophisticated dance routines the girls make at Mawby's every night, you might think they worked in the Las Vegas Strip's best casino. Alex has a predictable romance with her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice his age. Having resisted Nick's progress because it's not good to go out with the boss, she wastes no time to go all the way with her after her first date. Alex and Nick do not make an effort to hide their relationship at work, which makes no sense as they will likely look for Alex's colleague. <br /> <br /> If Beals is not doubled sequences for the many dances in the movie, her character spends most of her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to receive an audition call at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss / boyfriend helps her get the audition she dreamed of, she throws a tantrum. She says angrily to Nick that she does not do the casting because of his intervention, and then gets out in a busy tunnel. This is just a scene where you wonder what the hell the creators were thinking when they did that. Of course, Alex finally gets an audition at the conservatory. She puts on a dance routine in front of the Conservatory Board that is so ridiculous that you'd think it's a movie being commercialized for the MTV generation. Oh yes, it's a dance routine in a movie marketed for the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can judge if Beals can work really well, based on what I saw in it. "Flash Dance". That's because the character she forces her to play is so poorly written that I do not think that's a fair test of her acting skills. <br /> <br /> You must tell the creators of "Flashdance" though. This film proves that the poorest film productions can be covered by a smooth marketing campaign. In this case, a bestseller and award-winning soundtrack and music videos for the soundtrack in strong rotation on MTV. If they had been more involved in writing the script, they might have had a plot and a story with characters that were important to me. Instead, we get character characters in ridiculous scenes that every viewer with a functioning brain can not take seriously. A truly unforgettable "movie".
