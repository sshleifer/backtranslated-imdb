BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror film allegedly based on real events between 1817 and 1821. <br /> <br /> This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie with Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other film instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's terrible performance on Friday the 13th. Therefore, I believe that even on a bad day, she would perform better than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> In terms of my headline, this movie is not painful to see because the content bothers. It's painful to look at because it's just boring. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive reviews for this movie I could only make three choices. The first possibility - these authors were involved in some way in the production. The second possibility: The authors, although not directly involved, were paid to write positive reviews after the production was completed. The last option - none of these authors has seen enough horror films and is therefore inexperienced with the concepts that make successful attempts. <br /> <br /> The scene for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston is visited by two journalists who want to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin in the home of John Bell and his family. It soon turns out that a vengeful spirit is behind it. <br /> <br /> Superficially, the plot seems to be a standard poltergeist, albeit based on real events. <br /> <br /> Where Execution It's all about the ingenious concept, everything that could go wrong goes awry. And then some more! <br /> <br /> First the acting. Acting is terrible almost everywhere. This factor most seriously damages production and undermines the possible credibility of the viewer's belief or interest. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl who suffers from teenage anxiety than a powerful demonic force expressing evil intentions. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, that voice quickly became very annoying! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but it is incredibly hard to believe that every young woman living at this time speaks in the way that "ghost" does! Second, the direction. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes show promise, but the clearly inexperienced director wastes the potential. With the camera, the sound or the lighting, nothing is done to enhance the scenes that are supposed to be scary. The atmosphere is just as flat. A vengeful spirit is said to be behind supernatural events. But the effects are so incredibly inappropriate that nobody who has seen a real horror movie would get involved. I will give an example. In one scene, the mind attacks someone. Convince yourself of the scene. It's almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the script. It may be that the events shown are true to reports of real occurrences, but it can not be denied that most scenes are incredibly shallow and boring. Scenes of only two minutes feel much longer due to the poor dialogue - dialogues that do not lend depth to the characters or the story. This movie is far too dependent on conversation to drive the story. While this style was also the case for British films from the British horror of the 1960s and 1970s, it can not be denied that the dialogue exchange in these more professional earlier works has always been interesting. For example, Peter Cushing could read a directory and still attract the attention of the audience. The same can not be said of the actors in THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Finally the humor. The poorly conducted attempts of humor in this movie are agonizing. An obese boy is the heck of many jokes. In a particularly horrible scene, the said boy goes to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been recorded - but it comes complete with sound effects in case you do not understand what he's doing! <br /> <br /> The only positive aspects of the film are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the image near the original location contributed to its authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE HAUNT is a terrible movie. It's not even in the "that bad is good" league. It's just boring instead. I advise everyone to save his money and avoid this movie like the plague. Do not bother to see it for free! <br /> <br /> I have never seen another movie about the Bell Witch. But it really could not be worse than THE HAUNT. It can? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I would advise anyone on this site to watch some horror movies about ghosts and hauntings. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good starting places.
