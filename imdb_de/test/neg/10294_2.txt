I have to say, when I saw this movie on a 6.5 on this page, I felt it was worth a look. I was very disappointed. Almost as in the opening scene, it is obvious that the two alleged FBI agents are actually the killers. Could they have made it even more obvious? If that's the intended "twist" in this movie, that's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talents are no match for a badly bad script. Pullman cleverly acts as a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There is no change from "I play FBI type!" to "I've just killed 12 people and boy, my arms are tired." You can not blame the actors ... the story fails in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, however, I was convinced that I was wrong, that no director / author would do so. Always be so obvious about a plot. Ormond and Pullman just have to act strangely to distract the viewer's attention from the real killers, I thought ... which gives the creators of the movie far too much credit. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before he passed the 15-minute mark. To Lynch's merit, she managed to bring in many things that make up a good movie: sex, violence, humor, and well-educated actors. Too bad they were in the wrong configuration. Hopefully, Pell James can recover from this role ... I found her performance particularly impressive as the dazzling drug addict became a savior. She should have rewritten the role for the "crack whore" to win. <br /> <br /> Those who have compared this movie to Natural Born Killers note: Tarantino made the characters of Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, yet sympathetic. The art of this film far outpaces the gussets, and this is not even visible in Surveillance. The monitoring only wants it to be Natural Born Killers. In fact, she has a dream of being just a fraction of the movie. People who have not seen Surveillance ... stay with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
