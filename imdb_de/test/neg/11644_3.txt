Jim Brown plays a lead role after the Japanese invasion and produces a story in the Philippines. In the story, the Japanese have captured several naval men, including divers, with which they can retrieve the gold that MacArthur threw into Manila Bay. Racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's war in a not so subtle montage). The benefits are appropriate at best. Jim Brown is okay, but he does not really show a certain amount of bandwidth in a performance where he just gets annoyed. The sets are usable, but look rather cheap. The film suffers from a lot of stock footage from the beginning, including many of the most famous footage of the Japanese attack in Tora! Tora! Torah! The use of such a large budget sequence makes the remainder of the film effectively anemic; It also reminds you that there are better films to watch. For me, the film seems to have half a real plot, the salvage of the silver, and a half-action just to fill the time. Despite the explosive finale none of this is particularly exciting. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I would take a pass.
