Surely this movie was hacked by the studio? Maybe not, but I feel there were serious shortcomings in storytelling that, if not attributable to the editorial process, could only be caused by really bad, criminal writing and writing. <br /> <br /> I understand the effect Burton wanted With the stylized drama, similar to Edward Scissorhand's gothic fairy-tale atmosphere, they unfortunately reach flatness and do not reach a mythical depth of the tropics, only the insulting affect , ie bad acting and superficial characterization even for a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Not so scary, after all, only slightly amusing in his experiments. The use of the dialogue as a vehicle for the background of the plot was cumbersome and unnecessary. The mystery of who the headless rider is would be enough, the myth of a German mercenary would not be necessary, although Christopher Walken made a dashing figure, but not so threatening - when he sees the head of the rider, he seems far friendlier than a inhuman, nine-foot-tall man spirit as in the original legend. <br /> <br /> Never established a true rhythm or universal tone and not a classic in Burton's Oevure. stilted and cut off as my shot shot ...
