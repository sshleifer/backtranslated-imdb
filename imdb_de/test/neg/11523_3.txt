I should have learned more about this movie before I lend it. It was one of those movies where you constantly watch that you have to get better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid because you have wasted valuable time in your life that you can never get back. Ice-T did his bad thing and that was the highlight of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle look like they were made with a small toy in a box, and the space walks were funny because you could see the strings of the spacesuits. The script was missing and the chase with the bloody and unconscious guy was unbelievable because he had done better on one of my best days than I had. All in all, I have seen worse, but that is certainly not one that I would recommend or remember.
