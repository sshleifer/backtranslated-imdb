Nothing special to see, the animation is dated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This movie has an original story, but if it has no original plot or characters, I do not think it's worth watching. I'm not saying the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I had seen this movie a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original, you will see another thing.
