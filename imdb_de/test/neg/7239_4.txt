During the summer, the queue for this attraction is very long, as it is a water ride. It's a very good topic, but many artifacts of the ride do not seem to be in order. All in all, the trip is not worth it if you have to wait almost 2 hours. in line. The descent at the end is exciting, but the whole ride could have been better. Creators for Indiana Jones could have a problem. helped these Hollywood designers. Often the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting times for others. It is also very uncomfortable if only one raft has left the dock and not the two, as they should. During the Halloween horror nights, you ride in the dark, and it's exciting when it's the first time, but if not, do not wait in a four-hour turn.
