... and that says something. No matter how bad a movie gets, usually I can see through it to judge the entire movie. Through this I have done about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the DVD or maybe my laptop, but I could not hear the dialogue even though the volume was quite high. The sound effects were okay, and when the volume was increased to hear the dialogue, I blew my eardrums out with the effects. As much as I wanted to see through this thing, I would not sacrifice my hearing for it. <br /> <br /> From all that I could say about the plot, the movie was a big flashback the character's daughter It seems that the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because it turned out that the one person on her ship she trusted was an enemy, and now he is pursuing her on a desert planet. The only thing I liked about the movie was the look of the main character; There was something I liked about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Well, looks like he's going to the dumpster ...
