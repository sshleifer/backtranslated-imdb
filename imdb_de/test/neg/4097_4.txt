One hundred and seventy-five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend even on the biggest blockbuster in the summer. Even Michael Bay did not have such a high budget for Transformers, so it's a mystery how Universal Pictures spent so much money on Evan Almighty earning Evan Almighty. You certainly did not spend it on the script because the movie is not so much a classic comedy as Christian flag waving and one or two soft snickers. You probably spend your time asking about the budget, or why Steve Carrell felt the urge to put it in the slum in a very average movie just as his star profile started to rise. A sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty sees this movie Evan Baxter (Carrell), former ancillary character who pushes the ladder in the main playground. The story begins with leaving the news bureau to become a public official and moves to Washington with his wife and three generic sons (a weird elementary student, spirited middle school student, and grumpy teenager). Evan's attempt to change the world through politics, however, has a kick in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's an update to the old Genesis story. Evan fights cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. While the premise is reasonably promising, it does not bring many laughs. It's a bit of a joke when Evan's easy-going MP tries to juggle the demands of the civil service with the unwelcome animal packs that follow him, and a beard that withstands all shaving attempts. When he accepts his divine mission, the movie suffers a dive , <br /> <br /> From this point on he will become a message movie. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity, and Morgan Freeman keeps popping up to offer friendly wisdom as he gently presses his chosen one in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance, however, the only trace of the comedy remains in the form of a few garbage pats and John Michael Higgins' role as Evan's irritated right-hand man. Higgins may show the same rich comic potential as Arrested Development did before, but his enthusiasm can not save the sinking ship, especially as Carrell has gone beyond all his incredible improvisation skills. <br /> <br /> In a way, the Passion of Christ is a bit like it, but unlike Mel Gibson's movie, which encourages everyone to believe in bloodshed and debt to God, Evan Almighty seeks a softer approach. The film simply tells us that we should believe in God because he believes in us. Unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the Passion. Carrell is on autopilot, the jokes do not exist and Wanda Sykes tries to become the most annoying person in the world. It may be cute, but someone threw over $ 175 million overboard.
