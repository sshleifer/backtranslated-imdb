I'd like to say that I really liked this movie, but when it comes down to it, it was just too boring. It looks promising, and even if they get into the mines, the scary atmosphere and mood is great. The problem is the monster or the absence of it. As people say, it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion may look good if you do it right). The problem is that we do not see enough of it and see no deaths. This should be a horror movie, so lack of monsters and missing deaths boredom. There were scenes I liked, such as when a girl works with the camera in the dark and the monster approaches. There are also a few other scary scenes, but there are far too few to arouse your interest, and it's definitely not worth watching the movie. It's a shame, because I can see that if it had been done right, it would have been a really scary horror movie. The saddest thing is that films like this one will never be made again, because filmmakers are polishing their films today and relying on crappy CGI effects.
