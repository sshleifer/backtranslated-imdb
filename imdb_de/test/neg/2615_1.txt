AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN DOES THE DAMAGE STOP? I said that somewhere between the beginning and the other part of the movie that was really crappy. This movie has almost wiped out my life and I've been through some really bad movies. If I came from a real Puppet Master fan, I would expect to say that myself, but it's true. The plot is crazy, the special effects are awful, the soundtrack the most indescribable, hellish game I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot the acting, it was so bad that I forgot it was there at all, Nuff said. The only redeeming factor in the movie is the dolls themselves. They are really the stars and could outwit any but Guy Rolfe (he's the puppeteer). Although you can see their wires and strings, they carry me during the painful initial finish of Retro Puppet Master. Finally, PM7 is recommended for real fanatics who happen to be masochists. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
