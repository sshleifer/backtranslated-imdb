Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of kids so disgusted with his actions that he leaves the IRA and flees in London is <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie is quite disturbing as the lives of little kids end up in a fireball. This happened in the 70s and 80s and in the 90s in Northern Ireland, which gives a PRAYER FOR DYING a crass realism. However, as soon as Fallon decides to give up violence (What is he a terrorist and he never blew innocent passers-by?), Realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous conspiracies disappear. Martin is employed in the London underworld (do not they have their own batsmen?) To make a hit while wearing an IRA "uniform" (Never knew the provos wore uniforms) in a graveyard in broad daylight (Would not IRA man uses a bomb under a car?) Where he was discovered by a priest who recognizes him in the SAS. Hands up, who thinks I'm lying? I am not and we are halfway through the term and there are still some clichés. <br /> <br /> This sounds very stupid and yet what do you expect from a novel by Jack Higgins? Everything is clichéd, unconventional and stereotypical, and the not-so-simple things are just bizarre. The critics slaughtered this movie when it came out. They said, in particular, that they could have some potential if Bob Hoskins played the gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates, who would have made the SAS soldiers a priest, and for once the critics would have been right. You should also note that the movie might have been less bleak if Fallon were played by someone who was able to play an Irish accent. Rourke may be a hunky and a macho (Oh, I've seen another movie with an IRA Uberhunk), but accents are not his strength any more than acting. To give you an idea of ​​how disappointing PRAYER FOR THE DYING is, the director has turned it down, which is always a bad sign. <br /> <br /> As a footnote, the original release of PRAYER FOR THE DYING in the UK was delayed by several months due to "The Enniskillen Bombardment". In November 1987, the Provisional IRA exploded in the center of Enniskillen with a bomb that held a Memorial Day parade reminiscent of the British war dead. Eleven (11) people were killed and more injured. It was no coincidence that nobody left the IRA
