This film had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was only hampered by a good 20-minute script that was mostly consumed at the beginning. After that, holes appeared in history through which one could drive a truck. The movie followed a descending curve from good over ordinary to bad to ridiculous. It is not recommended.
