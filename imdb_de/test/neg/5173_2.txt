After having more than a few buddies, I suggested that I check out Rise of the Footsoldier. Finally, I finally came to it. Undoubtedly, the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and did so in his autobiography) is a compelling story of a man rising from the Terrace Boot Boy to the Connected Underworld Rogue. This film is unfortunately compromised in quality due to mistreatment, horrific accents and wistful spectacle. Ricci Harnett in the lead role of Leach gives a judicious job in conveying the transition from brawling to a serious criminal, but his accent is omnipresent. Since his voice delivers the narration of stories, it has made me crazy after ten minutes. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker provided the unintentional comedy with a disheveled wig (or the worst Barnett dialogue) that was so explicit that it bordered on teens and a towering vehemence in the line delivery that forced Tucker to parody. What troubled me the most In this movie, the story was about the real story of pre-shooting in Rettenden, Essex and Leach's formative years for crime fans and fans of football hooliganism. Therefore, this story has sabotaged me by the lack of credible accents and acting feels like an opportunity was missed. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper deliver the films only as a source of authenticity. On the positive side, some of the films went well and kept the attention on the steps and the build up. The violence was well choreographed, and apart from over-reliance on red bullet syringe for spattering, all in all, it was realistic. If you enjoyed the movie, it's worth watching the Essex Boys, who tell a similar story from a fictional point of view and also introduce Billy Murray.
