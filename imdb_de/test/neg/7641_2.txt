... I have no choice but to employ it at least once during my review of Respiro. What defines the claim is, in my opinion, a lack of emotional sincerity of the author. Respiro seems to be made with an all-too-fictitious and self-confident intention of being artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... mythical, even. But fortunately for all true artists, there is no predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth. Breathtaking natural settings (yes, these remote areas of Southern Italy look exotic to even the most Italians), handsome actors and some amusing, brave, spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children will not lead a vain film beyond a beautiful sequence of imagery. But this insincere and futile and ultimately hollow film wants to be art and succeed only to a very limited extent, perhaps even by accident. I admit that the conceptually pompous ending has a certain visual poetry. However, I believe that this has been achieved in a way that has more to do with the beauty of the Lampedusa Sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (as a connection to so much myth, mysticism, religion, archetypal, etc.) with the talent of Crialese. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is extremely histrionic in her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman of modest and provincial proportions, she certainly has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering, flowing flower dresses and attractive, sun-kissed beach hair could have graced the pages of every Vogue summer issue. The fact that she was a "nut box" could, in a way, only have been a fashionable addition to her trendy appearance and appearance - so her "condition" seemed close to me. Golino's two-dimensional cliché of the innocent, natural woman, misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community, was tiresome and irritating as he got worse, leaving me, at best, motionless and indifferent. I agree with the London reviewer who wrote that mental illness is very poorly served by the cinema. Throughout the film, we never have a sense of Grazia's disease and do not know what's really wrong with her (other than her being) a tiring stereotype of a "free spirit"). We do not know why she has received injections and needs to visit a specialist in Milan. This generic spelling for mental illness is one of the main telltale signs of the film's overall surface. <br /> <br /> Another rather insulting aspect of Respiro is the strangeness of his place. I had trouble figuring out if this movie should be shot in the present or in the past as it aimed to make even an admittedly backward part of Italy (in the comparison) a dozen times more quaint and more comfortable primitive than it actually was is. Again, this smells of superficiality and a complete lack of sincerity of Crialese. Some non-Italian viewers will happily pick up on the picturesque backwardness, cliché of the obsessed macho Italian, as if it were a common place, so they continue to consider my country as a culturally stranded country in the 1950s. Question I want David Ferguson Reviewers from Dallas, Texas ask: Did your country's mentality get stuck in the 1950s? No? OK, then should mine be?). Unfortunately, this aspect of Respiro is ridiculous and spurious even to those who still want to look at Italy in such an anachronistic way, even in the eyes of this Italian observer. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was just as boring and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexist-affectionate husband. I especially hated the scene in which Grazia accompanied her husband and her male friend in a man-to-man joke over a beer bottle, to the macho embarrassment and displeasure of her husband. According to this film, it is not the place of a woman to participate in the conversations of a man. Ah, but our "lovable" "free spirit" is too good for this place and does not understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of the Lampedusan patriarchy! Not only is this scene something so spurious, it should be enough to discredit the credibility of the entire film. It also gets completely the wrong end of the culture it tries to reproduce and clearly shows that it was written without a clear understanding of the place or its population. I would challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian filmmaker who deserves to be listed among the greats of Italy's glorious film history (which unfortunately is not), not the shadow of his former self!) Do not look further than Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his latest La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most contemporary Italian cinemas, which are unfortunately rejected and stagnant, Amelio is a fresh and independent creative voice. Despite my harsh criticism of Respiro, I am now more than willing to believe that Crialese's new Nuovomondo, which is now being shown in Italian cinemas, will be worthwhile. So I'm looking forward to enjoying it, though it will not shock me too much if I do not (considering my feelings for Respiro).
