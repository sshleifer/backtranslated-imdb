As I read the book, I was once again drawn to Castle Rock (Needful Things was the last part of the rock trilogy), and the storyline was a twist on the story King likes to tell. All the characters were described in loving detail, and it was a good psychological and bloody horror. The movie, on the other hand, is terrible. The interactions between the characters and the clever plot have disappeared and are replaced by a story that tries to be exciting, but misses a mile. If you have not read the book, you can enjoy it, otherwise avoid it, as with most movies from King's books.
