Sometimes changing novels when made into films is not only necessary but also a good thing. In the case of Northanger Abbey, however, this is a very, very bad thing. The story itself is not only torn to pieces, the satire is almost completely gone in the film, and the mixture of romance and intrigue does not even touch the biting comment that Austen makes in her work. It is not amusing or satirical, but makes the fascination of the character with her fantasy world mostly a drama. <br /> <br /> This also affects the romance. It is slim and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons why Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, and the audience has to wonder what he sees in her at all. <br /> <br /> Hopefully one day we will get a more faithful version if Austen's satire.
