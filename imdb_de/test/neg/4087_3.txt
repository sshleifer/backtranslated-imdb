If you, like me, enjoyed the first movie "Bruce Almighty," my advice is not to overstate your hopes. In fact, ignore any hope you have for this film if you are over 12 years old and have any sense of movie at all. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much away, the story sees Evan (Bruce Nemesis Co-anchor from the first movie) move his family home to the suburbs of Virginia to "Change the World" with one new political path to change. What follows is a pretty far-fetched and rather "stupid" plot that is obviously geared towards young children as their main target group. Unlike his predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film whose ambiguous genre "comedy" stands in its misleading position "sequel". Some would consider a modern comedy classic that a more mature, upscale audience can enjoy. <br /> <br /> In general, Evan Almighty has terrible cinematic values. The acting; Omitting Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman was inflexible, and many of the characters seemed to have thrown in to consume the unnecessarily high budget spent on production. In addition, the cast includes the actor John Goodman, who appears as a heel and only appears a few times in the entirety of the film. However, I did not quite buy the figure and thought that the plot he was involved in was not enough even for a family comedy. Any other character in the movie (especially the wife and kids!) Deserves a mention because they look so cheesy they could fill a kiev king. But be forewarned; It's the typically Americanized Cheddar's Fear associated with many family-oriented mainstream movies. Therefore, I would advise you to defend yourself with the next grater in sight. <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie is so far worthless has some promising aspects. The CGI was outstanding and it was clear that much of the time was spent modeling the Ark and creating water effects and animations of computer-generated animals towards the end. The particles, plasters and textures used were aesthetically outstanding. Although a part of me could not help, I think that these were undeserved to a movie with such bad ideals and in my opinion for this piece of cinema were "too good" and carry the movie everywhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, I see this movie as a disaster in terms of continuing a franchise with tremendous potential. Unfortunately, he was in the Almighty series to a poor result and just before the end of the film, I had uplifted my expectations of an epic and somehow meaningful finale, to make up for the mediocre content that I had previously seen. This was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused when the credits came off. When I sat dissatisfied, I could not help it, but I think the movie was not as "Mighty" as I had hoped. In many ways, the film reminded me of a watered-down "Night at the Museum" because it had similar styling and features, but unfortunately it was even lower. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 points. as you can see, but it is definitely to be avoided! If you need to watch this movie, prepare for disappointment, as "mild entertainment" is the best you can hope for when watching this production.
