Thankfully, this has not been renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, while popular (god knows why), has a very simple - 'look, I've found another body behind the flowers / bushes / trees / wherever you work - for the sixteenth time in this series. The dialogue is as simple as if it had been written for children - talking to the viewer and explaining every plot point. <br /> <br /> You are "happening" when someone is doing something extraordinary - and nobody notices them. <br /> <br /> Every time they investigate the murder of someone and investigate the murder, they stand in the way of everyone else - who messes with the lives of all - including the most innocent. <br /> <br /> They break into people's homes and steal items and evidence (even firearms) that are curious and get into people's lives, spying on them and going through their belongings. They never apologize, they never get caught or arrested (and if they do, they can talk themselves out, even if another character doing the same goes to jail !!!). <br /> <br /> You always trump up. Now I know that this is an uncomplicated series, but I think that should not have made the first episodes more realistic! Simply put, it is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> I think they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where they are every other week), so I hope it never comes back. <br /> ITV should get some action on the screen, rather than all the years of the sucker - "someone was murdered at the village fair - again" type series.
