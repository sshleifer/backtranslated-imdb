This is the worst movie I've ever seen and what makes me the most disappointed is that this movie is Yash Raj. So, if you see the promos, you think that's definitely another Yash Raj hit disappointing the story is stupid and stupid we've often seen boy marry soon and turn into a girl blah blah blah blah in love. If you see this pathetic movie, do not go to your family, there is too much exposure and kissing scene. I do not even understand why you would see it on your own. All in all, this is a shameful disgusting thing and anything else that's bad and starts with a d-movie, you should not see that you hate Yash-Ji and Yash-Raj films
