I could not make heads or tails out of this horrible movie Noir. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the acting was okay, but the picture quality was terrible! I bought it at WalMart in a "Gansters Double Pack" (8 movies on two discs) for $ 5.50 and when you put the DVD in, it apologizes for the horrible image quality some of the movies may have got The Plot wherever I could not understand it, and I had no idea what was going on. Then "The End" came out and the movie was over. <br /> <br /> What a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I say, do not waste your money or your time doing it! Or if you also bought the Gansters Double Pack, just skip this ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
