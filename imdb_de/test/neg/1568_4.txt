George and Mildred is a really listless movie. This attempt to bring the successful TV series onto the big screen was, as so often, a terrible failure. <br /> <br /> The joke and the clever one-liners of the TV programs have disappeared. The plot is a typical English farce of confused characters and false identities, which is neither funny nor funny enough to provoke many decent laughs from the couple's production (Mildred died of hepatitis before the movie was released), but others should have theirs Use time wiser.
