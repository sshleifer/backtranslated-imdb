Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and enticing woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies I've seen her, she seems to me the same character. Be it THE DOWNFALL, NAKED, LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE and now WHERE'S FRED! She is (plays?) Always the young, kind-hearted woman, who is a bit naive and does not know how to deal with the things that happen to her. She has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions, with which she works abundantly. Personally, I find it hard to believe that she could play a mysterious and somewhat vile character because he just is not here. So she's the nice girl next door, which she is, but she does not feel like it when it comes to acting. Til Schweiger: The same! The movie: downright stupid. Since it was an American movie, it would have been a big role for Adam Sandler, which I also dislike. I was not offended that this is a movie with disabled people. I just thought that the resulting jokes were not funny at all. I chuckled twice or three times, but when I was halfway through, I was just bored and annoyed, and wanted this strip to end.
