Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in movies like "Licensed To Drive" he was more in his element ... carefree humor. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" was one of his earlier works and probably still the best at the time. Unfortunately, this terrific fairy tale is cruelly slaughtered by a brilliant dog, a confused mutant, and a failed gene experiment. Acting is so lifeless that you think you're watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to watch a decent movie about a dog you should see "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... okay, maybe not CHOMPS "<br /> <br /> If you've read the book, avoid this movie at all costs, if you have not read the book, read it and avoid this movie, and you'll thank me later. <br /> <br /> A slightly better translation of a Dean Koontz book is the capable thriller "Phantoms".
