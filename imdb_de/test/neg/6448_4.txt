Amanda Bynes is a hugely talented actress and I've really enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "She's the Man". That's why "Sydney White" was a big disappointment for me. The real reason for my aversion to this movie is the bad handling of characters. In a good, funny teen comedy, it's perfectly alright to cast all the pretty realistic teen characters. In "Sydney White" this idea is thrown out the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes a good Sydney, but she really lacks a lot of what she usually lights up as an actress. I blame her with the script, which makes her character too bland and reserved, and the hairdressing / makeup department, which gives her a hideous plastic look and a nasty hairdo. The seven "dorks" that Sydney finally makes friends with are much worse. They are so crazy that it is impossible to like or even respect them as characters. They are essentially repugnant gag food. Like the "Prince Charming" of the story, who is absolutely incredible as a character and as cheesy as possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest star of the movie (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is actually very good as Rachel Witchburn. It's just a shame the scriptwriters did not make them any grayer than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially that of "Snow White". What it kills is that it is too dull and obviously a new staging. The connections to "Snow White" are thrown so much in the way throughout the movie that they are ultimately annoying and exaggerated. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is way too hatefully funny, the seven "dorks" are too dorky and Sydney is just too pure of heart. That does not mean that the movie is all bad. Although Bynes is forced by the script, she still has her moments. Just like Sara Paxton, who brings to life the physical comedy in her scenes. Sydney's roommate named "Dinky" is also a lot of fun as a character. It's a funny movie that's too cheesy and clich√©d to recommend.
