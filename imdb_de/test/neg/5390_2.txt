Most other posts have beaten this movie, and rightly so. I just have to include the technical inability of filmmakers. It would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a weapon was because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU WAS WARNED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> Specialized Ops team composed of various military units whose members have never met before. <br /> <br /> Maybe two people in the unit had guns that used the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. The sniper's schoolteacher uses a machine gun (pistol caliber) as opposed to a rifle that we would expect to control better. <br /> <br /> The night vision of a poor team member weighs more than the rifle. You realize, if he gets along, that it is VERY difficult. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends a team member to "challenge" the Skeleton Man when they first confront him. A 200 year old revived Native American skeleton with a long spear and attitude riding on an undead war horse with a heavy nosebleed? I do not think so, Bubba. <br /> <br /> Bullets do not hit trees, Mr. Director. (Some people mentioned that before.) <br /> <br /> The "Air Support" teams are made up of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", only this one has some Sidewinder missiles underneath. Someone forgot to tell the Helo Crew that the Skeleton Man is not flying, and they are over the American heart where there are no enemy planes. Instead, they should have carried some air to the ground rockets. <br /> <br /> The helos' ground weapons are made up of a door handle with a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say he only hits filth. Should have brought a light machine gun with belt. <br /> <br /> Door Gunner later realizes that a grenade launcher is pretty useless. <br /> <br /> A wooden arrow from a crazy recurve bow helicopter not down, Mr. Director. <br /> <br /> I could not stand this very well after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You really need a drop of morphine to survive this streak, it's just so painful.
