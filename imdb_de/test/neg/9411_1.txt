Very bad script and drama. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature student". The characters are neither interesting nor likeable. Artistically, it is so empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be appealing. Al Pacino strives to bring depth to his character, without success. Too bad, because the sports betting can be a very interesting topic that many could refer to. But I can not have a complete commentary on this film when I came out of the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was a time travel ...
