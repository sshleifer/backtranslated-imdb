Shot in Arizona by a mostly foreign crew, "Nightkill" is one of the most awkward crime thrillers I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) is following the recently widowed Jaclyn Smith and hopes to find out if she was involved in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy". It seems like someone is sure to get involved in the American myth that all Westerners talk and dress like descendants of John Wayne! The screenplay by Joan Andre and John Case may have worked better when approaching as a parody. This mystery thriller just plays tame. Director Ted Post sleeps at the controls. Do not be fooled by the video card art of Jaclyn screaming while showering. She actually takes a shower in this movie, but it's not enlightening (nor does the ludicrous plot make an iota). NO STARS of ****
