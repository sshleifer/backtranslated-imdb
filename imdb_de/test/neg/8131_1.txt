I unknowingly went into this "trap" of a movie. <br /> <br /> If I could turn back time or just get a refund, I would be happy. <br /> <br /> It was 7.30pm and Cinderella Man did not start until 10pm, so I stormed into the theater to watch the movie, which started at 7:20 pm. I dare say that God wanted to extend his hand (or withdrew it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony when you sit for this movie. <br /> <br /> It may be unfair to criticize a film that was not aimed at my heterosexual male cohort, but there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing. This film was worthy of a high school project budget at best ... and I think I have seen better in these French shorts that we played in relation to Louis Laloupe. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this movie was for the LA Fudge Packing crew and their sympathetic ladies. I was aching when I realized that the entire audience was saving me, with all the jokes and intentions ... I fully understood the hint of humor ... but I could not deal with it. <br /> <br /> This show did it Show me how gays dating and building relationships. But even if it was the purpose of the film, I feel that "Gayness" was too focused ... the humanity seemed to be missing ... but maybe that was the point ... just to be avant-gard. .. and to make a splash. <br /> <br /> I think that with a small budget and bad equipment, you need to make your movie as "noisy" as possible to get back masses and money. I really wish I just read my Sheldon Van Auken instead. Hehe ... I was totally wrong.
