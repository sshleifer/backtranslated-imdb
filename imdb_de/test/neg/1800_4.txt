Heart of Darkness Film Critic Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is quite dark, deep and profound. I would say that reading the novel is much better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was absolutely the wrong actor to play the role. He adapted the character in "Of Mice and Men". The film has omitted the most important parts of the film, which I consider important to preserve the true message of the story. The film is badly edited. It shows many unimportant and annoying flashes. The novel has a very exciting atmosphere, but the film lacks that feeling. In the book, so much is left to the imagination of the reader. For example, when Marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and excluding the entire scene from the movie. In the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to fix his boat. This was a great source of futility in the novel. The film added more parts that were useless and somehow made no sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz grabbed the monkey's neck and killed him. This species just ruined everything, made no sense to me at all. So my suggestion to you is not to watch the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
