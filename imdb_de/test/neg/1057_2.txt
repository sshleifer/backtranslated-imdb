(Attention: some spoilers in front of us.) <br /> <br /> What an awesome fucking movie. Iron Eagle 2 seems to be good. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) is shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to prevent him from bombarding an Iraqi airliner innocent civilian. Six years later, Holiday returns to avenge himself. Among other things, he hunts in a tank, Banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife across a field. He manages to fire grenades and at the same time drive the tank. After blowing up the tank from a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet. He shoots down a number of allied fighters before he attacks NATO headquarters to kill Banning's wife. An added bonus is that Major Baxter (the Holiday is hanging in her office) ranked badge on the right shoulder back. Elegant.
