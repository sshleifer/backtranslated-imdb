I read all the reviews for this movie directly. I can agree that the movie is not "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact". However, if you are looking for a chance to spend ninety minutes or so, this is a bearable film. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie early in the morning when I was a bit geek stuff. It was very nice because I can switch back and forth between what I did and the movie without missing a beat. It's a predictable movie, and acting is not appropriate for some of the seasoned actors (such as Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I should point out that I only paid $ 2 for and for myself, as the old saying goes: you get what you pay for! If you're looking for a deep movie that keeps you watching, this is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you're looking for something to pass the time, there's nothing wrong with Tycus (which, incidentally, was called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico, where I found this video).
