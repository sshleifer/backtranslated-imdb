, , , and never see it. Now I have been watching bad scifi movies for years. I like watching bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason why I could see this movie all the way through. I was underlined by "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and this terrible "Fantastic Four" movie, just to name a few examples. Usually I have to hit my head against the wall after seeing a bad movie to eliminate the pain. No, not here with this. With "TDB" I had to hit myself in the middle of the movie with a shoe in the head. Temporary correction I can not believe that I wanted to see that. I cried. When it was done, I cried. It was terrible. It was worse than seeing Wheatton's "Shudders" in Wil Wheaton's underwear in "The Curse", which by the way never saw. Aside from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his tight Whiteys, it's just so bad. However, this review is about TDB. The worst part is that someone wrote this movie and said, "It deserves to keep going! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "Oh, I want that in my movie history!" I'll watch "Indian Superman" until the cows come home, but I'll never see that steaming bunch of Drens again.
