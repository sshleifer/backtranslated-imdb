The most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original film. The acting was bad and the premise of sexual scorecards was outrageous. The effects were minimal at best. There were no outstanding achievements. Amy Irving was included in the film to win part of the Halloween H20 audience. The original was much more pleasant and enjoyable. I'm sorry to say that this is not one of the best 10 years ... so far it was at the bottom of my list. Do not bother with these people !!
