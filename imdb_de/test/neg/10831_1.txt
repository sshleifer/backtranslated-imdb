When I saw this movie for the first time, I literally rolled on the floor and laughed (especially when they were hunted by the water, and as the guy drove through people's gardens, I mean, it would hurt to close the clothesline drive?) The special effects! This movie obviously did not have a big budget. Either that or the man has left his toddler responsible for the controls. the water coming out of the damned water looked like a close-up of a can of beer piled up. What did the actors think? Did you really think it was a good movie? or did they really need the money? not that they deserve much. When I saw this for the first time, I was like, "God, how old is that?" When I looked at the information and saw that it was done in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> This is really a disaster movie, in more ways than one.
