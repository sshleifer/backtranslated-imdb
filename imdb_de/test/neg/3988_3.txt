For a country that has produced some of the best dramatists in the world and has such a rich musical heritage, it has always been a source of confusion to me why so much of Ireland's domestic cinema was so appalling. Perhaps because the Irish cinema talent has inherently left home quickly to make a career in the UK or America (Colin Farrell is a current example) and the truly successful Irish directors have continued to work in Ireland and their Irish subjects Filmed films with international money and a look at the international market. I am thinking in particular of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternately alternate films with an Irish backdrop and projects filmed abroad. "Middletown", however, is a very Irish film, even if it is about two of its main characters are English. It's certainly well done of its kind and could have refuted the trend that Irish movies are not really good; (Paddy Breathnachs "I Went Down," written by the brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately, this history of fundamentalism took place in a fictional Irish city, probably in the north of Ireland for accents (Mid-Ulster Bible Belt, if you ask me) and probably in the recent past (the fifties - the sixties)?) so over the top that it's really ridiculous. Nothing in the film is true and one can not help but believe that the writer Daragh Carville was heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that the whole thing might have been more meaningful if it housed in the American Bible Belt and not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never so outrageous. It's all meant to be grim in a great way, and it certainly is, though I was more prone to giggling than Frissons at the right antics of Reverand Matthew Macfayden. He has the accent on Ulster and there is nothing wrong with his acting or even Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as May's wife, but the script is so distastefully distracted that good acting can not do anything save the movie. So rather a step up for the Irish cinema "Middletown" is, I am afraid, just another nail in the coffin.
