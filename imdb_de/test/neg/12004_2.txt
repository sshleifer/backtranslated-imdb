As a children's film, it's great. It's just shit for the family. I was really hoping for something like the Goonies, a great movie for all ages. This movie was just too focused on the kids with the stupid script and the characters who call each other little names like Booger Breath. ??? Alan Cummings, however, was a pleasure. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie? Just because there is a title song that is very similar to the Willy Wonka song, this movie does nothing like Willy Wonka.
