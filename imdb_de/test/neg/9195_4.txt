I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and bored with this movie. The acting was fine, but Joaquin Phoenix was a bad casting choice, to say the least. <br /> <br /> What bothered me most about this movie was the Celtic music, which continued to whine at the worst moments of the movie. The direction and continuity were also pretty bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** After Phoenix has dropped several stories and been seriously injured, for example, he can barely talk to his captain on the radio. Then he miraculously manages to crawl through a huge room covered with debris and fire to make a man-sized opening into a double-thick brick wall, with only a foot-long remnant being needed. And as a coronation, he will then again extremely weak and broken. <br /> <br /> Did anyone also notice that throughout the movie, when you fight Joaquin's fire and save people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I would think the smoke should be quite thick in a flame-littered building. <br /> <br /> I was also tired of hearing from the search and rescue team that "I need some equipment here !!!". <BR /> <br /> I really thought I would like this movie, but I found it a feeble attempt to portray the true life of a firefighter. The intent was there, but I honestly believe that this movie could have been so much better. I could not help but believe that the producer was trying to make an appointment with this movie and was in a hurry to get it released. There should have been more time for editing and for a good flow of the film. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. A bit like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. <br /> <br /> Call me critical, but I just can not see what's great about this movie. At least it was not as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards," which is by far the worst movie I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope that there is no ladder 50 manufacturing!
