Rollerskating Vampires ?! I'm sorry, but even for the 80's, that's just too cheesy to be scary from afar ... You can not apologize for the original kitsch moment because he's parodying old movies and TV shows a little less camp once more failed! The first film also featured Chris Sarandon - a man who even made discos in casual knitwear seem seductive! - that this one is painfully lacking, so there was no "danger" in everything that happened, it just seemed silly fan of the original I remember that I was disgusted. For me there is no continuation of Fright Night, just a cheesy parody that deserves no judgment.
