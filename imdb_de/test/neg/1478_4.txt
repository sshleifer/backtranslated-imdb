Once again, I seem to be the only person on earth who can criticize Japanese films made before 1970. "Fires on the Plain" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless series of "classics" that receive all sorts of praise for seemingly good reason. As much as I love to generalize and psychoanalytically analyze all those moviegoers who have such a terrible taste in the movie, it's still almost impossible to explain why anyone would ever think that badly crafted bottles are some kind of " Masterpiece "should be called. What I find ironic is that fans of derivative "classics" like "Fires on the Plain" are so focused on "in the box" film productions (orthodox valuation standards like screenwriting, acting, camerawork, etc.). It always seems that way to be as if the most revered "classics" were the least adequate in these standards. For example, one of the laziest copouts of a filmmaker involves a forced verbal rendering in which the characters essentially explain everything to the viewer, even if the constructed scenario is completely artificial. Surprisingly, the very first scene in "Fires on the Plain" uses this indolent tactic to the utmost. <br /> <br /> After a funny slap in the face, the following useless dialogue attacks the viewer: "Why can not you understand the situation? We landed under heavy fire in the west to reinforce the units in Tacloban Our artillery was sunk in transit, trying to reach the Burgen airfield by crossing the central mountains, but impossible without artillery, the enemy's counterattack forced a fanout through the valley, you know that. " So why does one character say something to another character that he already knows? Oh yeah, that's right, the makers of this movie are too lazy to think of more natural ways to convey that information. You see, a quality movie would actually show these events, or at worst involve a dialogue involving a character who does not know these events. Heck would even have been an introductory summary in paragraph form that was directed at the viewer, had been better than what happened here. <br /> <br /> Such cases of bad filmmaking are scattered throughout Fires on the Plain to the point where this movie feels like it was written by Imbeciles for Imbeciles. For example, the main character encounters some skeletons wrapped in Japanese costume. Instead of doing the natural thing? oh I do not know? With a depressed mannerism, the character blurs "Japanese soldiers". Thanks, buddy, but I could have found that out for myself. Worse still, this movie is steeped in overly dramatic tricks. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Imagine that. A soldier walks along and finds worn boots. One might think that such a find is utterly useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and drops his SUPER worn boots. Good, I understand the point. The soldiers are in rough condition? a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, he finds the SUPER worn boots and hints of the previous soldier? Get ready, because this is where it comes from? that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, he takes the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots back. But you see, that's not all? because then comes the THIRD soldier! He finds the previous soldiers wearing SUPER DUPER-worn boots and inspects them along with his own SUPER DUPER-worn boots. As both couples suck, he throws them aside and smiles as he goes barefoot. At that time, I was ready to throw my TV through my living room window. The hard handedness, the overdramatism and the overwhelming absurdity of this sequence are beyond the bad filmmaking. It's SUPER DUPER, a bad filmmaking. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments. Like at the time when the main character asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" As if the guy answered "yes" when he actually stepped into the bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the underperformance of the lead actor, who is the quintessence of the artificial response. I laughed violently during that first slap in the face, with his head put back in position with that stupid, stupid expression. However, the fact that this trivial lint piece receives an average IMDb score of 8.4 is certifiable as a masterpiece such as "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003) gets just 7.5 the amount of mass stupidity. And to think that some people actually pretend that "AToTS" makes no sense. Well, not every movie can have totally outrageous SUPER DUPER-worn boots on the side.
