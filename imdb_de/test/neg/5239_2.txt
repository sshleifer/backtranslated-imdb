I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He has starred in several good films (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I do not think he played in this movie. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are very bad and also the actors. To continue the film, all I have to say is this: It's the first time I see a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes.
