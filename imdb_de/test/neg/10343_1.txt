Stealing is a crime, and these people, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, look like they're getting away with it. I have not even seen this movie yet, but I do not just know it's shit. The fact that he steals the story of another movie or two films is such a crap (and if IMDb would allow much more profanity.) Than just bullshit) that I feel angry and feel like I should Just throw it out the window and finish everything. OK, that's a bit much, but stealing is worse. <br /> <br /> Ever seen Pontypool? It was this great little zombie movie from 2008, this radio host is working and then this zombie attack happened. We only see what's happening on the radio station, and the only guess we have from the outside is the occasional phone call from her eye to the sky, Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment in the movie in my head) and the BBC call to update the situation. From all the reviews I read and from the conversation I had with my friend (who saw this movie and Pontypool), this movie was just like in the story, with minor changes here and there. So throw originality and creativity out the window. As for the zombies or the infected, whatever you want to call them. They are exactly the same just because they got infected, it does not change the fact that they run around mindlessly and have a never ending extinction for meat. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Okay one to many, but back to that crappy movie. The zombies from what I've heard are similar to those in 28 Days Later, another better film, with their mad rage and an even crazier patch of flesh. Zombie movies are defined here, history plays no role in a zombie movie (as long as you do not accept the idea of ​​another movie). Of course, a zombie movie can be improved through the story as in Pontypool, but the zombies must be original in some ways. 28 days later, the insanely angry zombie started. Pontypool I can not even explain the boys without ruining the movie. The Evil Dead, I think all I have to do is enter the name again because it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master and experienced all manner of zombies, from the painted face zombies in Dawn of the Dead to the raging zombies in Diary of the Dead, and each of them has his own unique style. <br /> <After talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time to explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This film steals the original story of Pontypool, which I believe is plagiarized and illegal in this country, and many people are thrown out of school because they did just that, but in Hollywood that's allowed and obviously approved , This is not the only movie that takes the outlines of another movie and tries to say it differently. The '90s are like the worst time for movies, sure it had some jewels, but not for a decade, and all movies were exactly alike. My favorite movie, the thriller that is so big that you can not guess it until the end. They force you to bring a suspect, make it impossible that it is none other than him. Then, bam, it was this guy all the time. You just had to look at the scenes where he was not there and when he would do it. Turn up out of the blue and say, "Hey guys, what did I miss?" OH! DOES NOT SEE THAT COME YA! Well, I leave a cliché as my final statement. This is a movie you certainly want to miss.
