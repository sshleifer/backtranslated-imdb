They said it would be a movie bigger than Turkeys. How dare you <br /> <br />? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad Action The only character I sympathized for was the one played by Angela Schijf. Her acting was the best in the whole movie. The story could have been interesting, but it was not. Some scenes were filmed very nicely (lights and camera) (for example, the opening scene), but the bad drama made the magic disappear. I really do not understand why so many people chose this movie so well. <br /> <br /> good.
