Like another user, I got that cheap - I thought. 85 kroner (8 lbs). Although it's not worth the money, it's a total classic that I - like the other users - saw for the first time when I was a kid and was looking forward to seeing it again 20 years later. The story is surprisingly thin (which is why it may have worked for children), but the overall language of the radio and the trucker makes up for it. In the coming years, it will look good on my DVD shelf. First consideration (1980): 10/10. Second visit (2002): 4/10
