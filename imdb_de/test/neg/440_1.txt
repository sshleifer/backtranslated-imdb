This DVD lacks her vocation as a Heineken coaster. This is a great example of why no one should ever see a sequel with a different director / writer than the original. Two hours of this turkey made me beg for Exorcist 2 repetitions. <br /> <br /> NO legitimate laughs. NOT a decent fear. The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they had had sick relatives at home or monster kitchens or something). <br /> <br /> The original was a milestone for the make-up. Of course, the producers of the sequel said it would be a good idea to do away with make-up FX and instead make CG werewolves. These CG werewolves made me laugh a lot harder than the "comedy." It was just a total failure. If you want a night entertainment, you can rent the original again. Or take a film class and make your own horror movie. You'll be better than those fools.
