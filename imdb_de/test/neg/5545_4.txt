Academy Award Actor Sidney Poitier of "Lilies of the Field" renews his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs from the Oscar winning 1967 Best Picture "In the Heat of the Night" "With no one the equivalent of Rod Steiger, with the Obviously both "Bullitt" starring actor Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "Cape Fear" were out of their game when they drafted this predictable police potsilk for the police, the dialogue is monotonous and none of them Characters is interesting, not even the prime suspect - nothing exciting, exciting or surprising happens in this tame whodunit, things have changed significantly since Virgil was last seen in "In the Heat of the Night." He worked as a homicide detective The Police Department in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs." Our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair of "Change of Habit") and a family, a young rebellious son, Andy (George Spell of "The Naked Kiss"), and a younger daughter named Ginger (Wanda Spell) of "Hickey and Boggs "). Tibbs drives a medium blue Mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over her two children as he does not have much time for them. Literally, there are no surprises in this foot murder mystery. In fact, the best thing about "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" is the fantastic orchestral sound of Quincy Jones, with a catchy opening theme that is more memorable than this forgetful crime thriller deserves prostitute Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of "The Adventurers"), an invisible assailant Bedroom of her downtown apartment beaten to death. The apartment artisan Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez of "Intruder in the Dust") enters Joy's apartment and finds her dead on the carpet with a bloody forehead. He briefly picks up the statue, places it back on the floor and reports Joy's death to the apartment superintendent, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of "License to Kill"), and Weedon hands Mealie a handful of dollars and sends him packing. Afterwards, Weedon anonymously informs the SFPD that People's Minister Logan Sharpe had beaten Joy to death and apparently left Joy's home. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") instructs Tibbs to handle the case. it seems that Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbs wife Valerie can not believe that the well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to describe the film, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word "sperm," no doubt a controversial term to be mentioned in a movie from the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Tibbs asks Weedon, who he thinks he's either a drug trafficker or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no records of Joy Sturges because she has rented the apartment from another real estate company. Tibbs visits the real estate company and real estate agent Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") flees and leaves, essentially missing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes his car after a long but tame pursuit. When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he lets him go with his angry Mrs. Marge (Norma Crane from "Penelope"), who is ready to move into an apartment after the revelation that he has paid a hooker to stop. <br /> <br /> Tibbs selects the artisan Mealie and frees him from the crime, and then he follows Weedon. Fortunately, our hero for Tibbs catches the evil weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. One of Weedon's followers attacks Tibbs, but Tibbs briefly abandons him before embarking on a long chase to Weedon. At some point he brings Weedon into an underground car park and they shoot him. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the Tibbs household are more interesting than his investigation. Andy is running wild, beating his sister and smoking in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean up his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs slaps him on the jaw three times. These scenes of parenting could probably never be handled today as it was in 1970. At the end of the film, as if the family sequence would solidify, you can see Tibbs with his wife and children. Valerie and Virgil are in a confrontation about the well-being of their children and how their long working hours have affected them. Director Gordon Douglas leads in a competent manner. Surprisingly, the filmmakers never play the racing card for a movie released in 1970. In a scene in which Tibbs searches an African-American billiards salon, we see a mixed race that scowls at the hero as he finds Mealie and walks with him. <br /> All in all "They call me Mister Tibbs" is a bad follower of "In the Heat of the Night". Mind you, Poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. All sets look spotty and there is not much physical violence: a shooting gallery in an underground car park that does not last long, and a fight. Beyond Jones' groundbreaking jazz score, the only surprise really is not to call a big surprise, more like a convenient set-up. Donald Medford's "The Organization" followed "They Call Me Mister Tibbs" as a second, action-packed successor.
