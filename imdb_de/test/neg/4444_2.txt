Altman's quintet is more than flawed: as many other critics have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, and some of the possibilities to present those ideas, should work - and yet very little is possible in this difficult film. The partially fogged camera lens - I told my wife that it must be the most distracting director I've ever seen - never allowed me to "immerse" in the world of film. Generally, there are serious problems with the staging used here. It is clear that not a little thought has been given to factors such as costume and production design, but both are not very effective in creating a credible world. Maybe it's a question of scale; The movie is so stage-like that I laughed loudly when it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the film's budget.) Matte paintings here and there might have helped.) In all the most disappointing Altman movie I've ever seen. Great ideas and great metaphors are not always present in art - they are only part of the game.
