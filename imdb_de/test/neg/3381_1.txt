This "space snippet" was kind of stupid. I suspect it should be an unexpected end to the shock, but in my opinion, it was just a huge flop. Joseph Campanella and the other earthbound actors are doing an excellent job in this regard. Their performances, however, do not do justice to such a stupid ending. How this end could ever have come through a review by the producers is incomprehensible to me. The other comment here is not correct, the tongue-in-cheek vignettes came only in the second season, this thing should be taken seriously! The producers and authors could have been a bit more creative to justify the rest of the episode.
