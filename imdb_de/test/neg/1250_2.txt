How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work on The Sopranos, I took this to blockbuster by his name and a story that sounded as if it had promised. It still does, but this movie does not do it. <br /> <br /> Every turn of the story is absolutely predictable; I kept looking for the lifetime error in the lower right corner of the screen. It's all there: the noble woman who comes out of difficult times, the guy despite his best efforts not fully exploits his potential, the boy who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc. The identity of the mysterious stranger is it I really felt like Throwing things into the TV - I would have been happier with little Stuey, who woke up and realized that everything was a dream. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers could also have a "The Moral" of the story is ... "a bit before the credits because, as another reviewer noted, this thing really rolls like an afterschool special. Do not play, do not drink, do not use drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... Come, how about a little nuance, how about some interesting bad guys? Writer / Director AW Vidmer should be highlighted: Not only is the dialogue groundbreaking, the tempo (within the dialogue and at each end of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than necessary (and believe me, it feels like that) longer The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and a few minor characters (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that hold this "1" rating, but all their good work is almost offset by the cruel work of the young Stuey. I am not sure if it was a casting error (hey - it's a mob movie, so let's throw somebody out of Blue's Clues who can not do anything but exaggerate with a fake grin) in the Disney movie) or just terrible directing, but these scenes are really painful to look at. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in another filmmaker who deals with this character and his story. It is a shame that Imperioli has already been used up by this movie. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
