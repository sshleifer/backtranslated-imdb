OK, I have to admit that I really enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well-documented mistakes. However, this was the worst movie I have seen since Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD, the effects are far superior. The plot, however, is weak, the acting reminds of everyone's favorite, the pornographic film, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" are consistently based on the nonsense. I'd like to try Uwe Boll's latest film outings to get some perspective on HOTD2. I'm not suggesting that it really is the cure, more like a case of another disease, but if your senses have been insulted in such a heinous way, the only way is the only way. OK there it is. I've made the minimum of ten lines and will not waste any more time on the waste of celluloid that is the House of the Dead 2.
