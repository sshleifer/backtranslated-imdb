I've seen a lot of horror, splatter and monster movies in my life. And of course many monster movies from the 50s and 60s. When I stumbled upon this piece for the first time, I thought it was the 60s until I realized it in 2007. <br /> <br /> Actually, the character of Jack Brook is interesting and acting is all good for a splatter movie, but .... I expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about an aggressive plummer. The movie runs 80 minutes and I think the first kill is after 65 minutes. Though it takes hours to explain the story, it takes at least 3 minutes from where the monsters come ... and we have another 20 minutes of boring dialogue and finally, in my opinion, not so well-made splatter sequence. Although Robert Englund plays the lead role here, I only recommend these real hardcore horror fans.
