This film was childish and ridiculous in its visual effects. Scenes in which Father Merrin throws himself into his bed and his gaze on a simple-minded natives are signs of bad acting and bad imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves the fantasy no facts and leaves no room for tension. The doctor once said that she believes the city will "explode" from all the crazy events soon. In fact, there was nothing in the movie to make this line relevant. Because of the awful work the film had done, I never knew there would be tension in the village. If you're interested in cheesy movies, you can rent this here, but if you want to see it right, check out Exorcist: The Beginning
