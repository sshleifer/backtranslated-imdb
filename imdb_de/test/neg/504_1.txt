The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look like the historic photos and all the sounds of the old western bustle. Too bad that producer and writer / director Michael Cimino has not spent time with the historical facts of the Johnson County War. Much of the war was about how public land should be used for grazing. The Cattlemen did not want the poor shepherds in the countryside looking for food on this cold, windswept plateau. Throughout the epic it is not mentioned that grazing sheep were one of the main reasons for the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the fight between farmers and hired killers. You can see the farmers orbiting the armed men as a lot of Indians would do in earlier Hollywood movies. The real fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red Angus), with a group of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and locked them up in a barn on the TA Ranch. I doubt that any women participated in the siege. Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a lynch mob three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was propagated by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) to discredit them. The fact that the act makes her a brothel woman serves only the interests of the WSGA. I reject the use of names of real people in an action that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino used real names of people loosely associated with the Johnson County War (and the events that led to it) is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much more interesting if it had stayed on the political ramifications of federal intervention in a state government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were rescued by the Golgotha. Some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible for the lawyer in Johnson County. But with Johnson County unable to afford the court costs and Wyoming Governor Amos W. Barber supporting WSGA, the charges were finally dropped. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the movie was just an excuse to be shown Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hour runtime on the DVD version.
