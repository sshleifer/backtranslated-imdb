OK, I could only find three reasons why this film is worthwhile given the extremely low budget. <br /> <br /> First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, they gave me four good reasons to watch and watch what I did. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to watch is that many of them were shot on the street right away. Now I did not know that before, but I saw a car trailer in Orange County and said, wow! This was shot in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the flashback to the past and ancestry of the young child, but it really was. The killing by the pumpkin man was pretty lame, except for the cyclist. If you want to see Quigley and Carter is OK, but the return of the living dead will make a more exciting impression.
