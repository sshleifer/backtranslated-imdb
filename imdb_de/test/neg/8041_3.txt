I would think that this was one of those films whose director did not read the book he was writing on, if not the fact that they are just a bit similar. It's quite possible that a great movie is loosely based on a book, and this was certainly the latter, but not the former. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes. On the one hand, it tried to be too similar to the railway children, probably because adults would expect it, since they came from the same author. Another is that it was similar to Harry Potter in terms of music and setting too much emphasis. I have nothing against JK Rowling or the movies, but the book is none other than Harry Potter's. I thought that the Psammead, although well-uttered by Eddie Izzard and also in his character, was almost unfounded in a totally inappropriate environment. I may have missed something here because the comments made on one of the characters' own books may have been an indication of the inaccuracy of the adaptation. There was also no need for the additional characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they were not. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other one does not. The one who knows it was fine, but not as enthusiastic as the one who does not. I'm not sure what that means.
