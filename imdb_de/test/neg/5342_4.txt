"A young man who was recently betrothed is a traffic accident victim and dies as a result of his injuries." His father, desperate to revive his son, agrees to try to rescue a fellow scientist to save his experimental transmigration process When the young man comes to life again, the father and the fianc√©e notice a dark and violent change in the young man's behavior that leads him to believe that something in the revival process has gone terribly wrong, "the compilation of the DVD cover says. At some point, Edward Norris (as Philip Bennett) is asked, "What do you think, Boys Town?" Mr. Norris should know, since he was in Boys Town. "The man with two lives" is more like "Black Friday" minus Karloff and Lugosi. You do the math. This film could have been a candidate, with a revised script; it has a fascinating final act. After a lukewarm "shoot", wait for the drama to play with a well-played scene between Star Norris and Detective Addison Richards (as George Bradley). <br /> <br /> **** The Man with Two Lives (1942) Phil Rosen ~ Edward Norris, Eleanor Lawson, Addison Richards
