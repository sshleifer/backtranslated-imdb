As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the films based on them, I have to say that the 1980s version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour was better. It was written better and more attached to the spirit of history than to those who seemingly went out of their way to get people shot. This new adaptation is less carefree but does not have that much depth. Although there is a good acting, the actors did not have much to do. Nice costumes.
