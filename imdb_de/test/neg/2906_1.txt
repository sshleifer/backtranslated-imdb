This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I've seen such crap as Manos, Space Mutiny, and so on, and I can honestly tell you they do not blame Science Crazed for a candle. Science Crazed has no identifiable action. Something about a man who makes a woman pregnant by a turkey Baster and the child who was born * hours later * is adult and ready to kill. Of course, as a newborn, he needs an hour to kill people. The director goes through the footage constantly and takes about fifteen minutes to achieve an unpleasant death. There is about one dialogue page for the entire movie, but the dialogue appears about a minute after it has been spoken. <br /> <br /> Example scene: The monster walks down a hallway. We know that because his feet are wrapped for about ten minutes. Between the loops, two women are trained to exercise. Repeat the fall for about 20 minutes. When the monster shows up, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in the spotlight as the monster takes another 10 minutes to kill them. At the level of acting you would suspect that people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know that my description does not seem so bad, but believe me, I can not fully describe the pain that is science, crazy. <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott all the video stores you are in. :) <br /> <br />
