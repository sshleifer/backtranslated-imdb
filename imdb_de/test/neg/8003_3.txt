Boring, clichéd and predictable. The only original was Brighton's site for gangsters. It's certainly not a "lock stick etc ......." Hannah was sympathetic in "sliding doors". In "Circus" I did not develop empathy with his character and could not throw what had happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this movie was so clichéd and predictable, the end came as no surprise, but I was so uninterested that I did not even care why the movie was named "Circus" ... Booooring ....... Don 'I visit this great top.
