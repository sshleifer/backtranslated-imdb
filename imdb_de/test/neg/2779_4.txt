First I'm in my 40s. I've watched horror movies since I was a kid, so I've seen a lot of variety. IMO, that's not as bad as the masses who gave it a 1 or 2. Yes, it is a horror strip on a low budget. The dialogue is sometimes so soso and tolerable. The basis of this movie is actually quite good. For those of you who are old enough to remember, or lucky enough to have seen on DVD. This is very similar to a 70s movie of the week. Just add blood and small bruises, minor T & A and swear, without big names. That's it for a T. I'd rather watch that than Jason vs Godzilla or whatever the other uninterrupted crap is. Not so good, EVIL DEAD was a low budget movie. At least credit these guys for trying. With a few MIL budget, this could have been a pretty good movie. My score is an observable 4.
