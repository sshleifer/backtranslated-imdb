Really! This is where French cinema hits the low point, and by comparison, the least responsive American horror movies of the US, such as "Friday the thirteenth," "Freddy," and others, are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> <br /> It is all the more annoying when there were exciting original elements: The Forêt de Brocéliande and its legends, the Druids and King Arthur were all excellent conditions for a fantastic fantasy and horror movie. Filmed as a user aptly stressed in a fake forest near Paris, the film is fake horror, fake Celtic history, fake footprints - you should see the professor (Wilms, a wonderful M. Le Quesnoy in "La vie est un long fleuve tranquille) are crying out for the "priceless scrap" - which the production probably bought in a dime store - fake figures, false excavations ... <br /> <br /> The boys disguised as Druids are unintentional very funny; the girls who seem to be martial arts experts. And what can we say about the professors of the monster? A ten-year-old would write a better script than this grotesque farce. To believe that people can spend money on such drums if they are artists I'm still waiting for a producer! <br /> <br /> Word to the Wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote a wonderful story about Druids and ancient ceremonies in his Arsene Lupine saga entitled "l'île aux trente cercueils". A mini-series was made 30 years ago. Avoid this "Broceliande" trash and try to see it instead.
