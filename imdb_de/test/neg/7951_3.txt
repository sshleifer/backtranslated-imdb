Have you ever seen a movie when your left thought about what the world was about? Well, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story is complex or anything like that, it only runs in three completely different modes ... 1. A funny drugstore movie of the 60s ... 2. A much overplayed soap opera ... and 3. a horror movie (with very little to "scream"). To my great surprise, I found out that it was written by one of my absolute favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I think that even the best has to be learned by trial and error. <br /> <br /> If you spend something by H.G. Lewis (only with minor effects), this "bad" movie has its advantages. For the most part it's a pretty cool jazz note, and there are a few memorable scenes ... one of which is a group of kids deciding to experiment with acid and take a nice long motorcycle tour to the zoo. The camera tricks that the director uses to indicate that the hallucinatory state is simply left behind are amusing. Trust me when I tell you that you do not have to run out of doors to catch this!
