You might suspect that the plot of this movie was written during the shoot. It starts off as a "Punks versus Vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the movie the plot changes abruptly as the Vigilante evolves into a honest man with his honest girl and honest gym fighting the corrupt "business people" I want Reject the gym at any cost to build a mall or something. Then the story changes again and we forget the corrupt guys. The villain is now the friend of the leading man who considers himself a ninja. The guy becomes a "crazy bad guy" and wants to win a martial arts contest at any cost. Watching this movie is like a nightmare with the TV on.
