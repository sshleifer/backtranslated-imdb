Although this starts promisingly, a woman in a car in the middle of the night is teeming with dark woods in the middle of the night until she almost meets a man holding a lizard! This gave me the impression that we would see something special, something almost David Lynchian (if there is such a concept), but unfortunately the film starts to be somewhere else without having a core center, just a kind of moving story a woman trying to solve the puzzle of a small town. The character study goes everywhere and I was not really interested in the characters, especially when part of the story suddenly switched to Flashback mode. I had some hopes for this movie, but all in all, it was a bit disappointing.
