A few years ago, I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are actually the same: beautifully shot, but awfully slow and boring. I saw this movie in a preview and left after half an hour. Could not stand it anymore. How do you make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling themselves how happy they are and how perfect their lives are .........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American GI who was still roaming the Vietnamese jungle, not knowing the war was over. How he would suddenly appear in the movie and empty his M16 with the characters in the movie. The red of her blood would make a nice contrast to all the green plants in the movie ........... So I was not so much of this movie packed! Time to go!
