This movie (even if it's called a movie is an exaggeration) is ridiculously horrible. Usually a big fan of Eric Roberts in movies on the "B" list. This tragedy of a strip lets me question its true B-list clout! And Charlie, please go back to the revival of Diagnosis Murder and not this one ..... You can not blame the nameless eye candy (uhhum ... beauty contest members) for taking part in this weak movie, but YOU are one former TV starman! Pull yourself together. Do not even get to know Stuart Pankin. For all that's good, Stuart, you should have seen that this was not necessarily a real movie! Absolutely brilliant is Bryan Michael Stoller only because he could bring everyone to invest in this picture (money or time). <br /> <br /> Really, that was not a parody or parody movie, though he tried it 2nd Class Mostly it's bad writing and acting and cinematography and editing and .... all bad. I looked at this because I read an article in a magazine about Agent MJ's involvement and I had the highest interest in the lawsuit he was involved in. I wonder now if the only reason they are showing him off the shoulders in the movie is because, as in the trial, he wore pajama pants and was barely aware (wait a second, he's ever really considered clear ? ... I digress). And agent MJ? Is that the best thing you could find for a name for your character? Sheez What a startling piece of originality! Or maybe that should be funny? Bringing Marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first, but overstated and annoying is finally said and done. I warn you.
