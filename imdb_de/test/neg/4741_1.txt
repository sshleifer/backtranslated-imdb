Ed Wood rolls around in the grave. He could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this garbage hole. The worst script in memory ("X-Men 3" sparkles like "Citizen Kane"); most amateur directing; Pre-K-cinematography; the cheesest "special effects" (I'm talking about "Friday The 13th" Sequel Territory); and take a meaningless, abominable, deeply disturbed delivery sequence. The lack of talent or sensitivity that brings this rubbish to the screen is amazing. That "industry" could reward anyone involved in this celluloid clarifier with future projects should be a matter of serious concern.
