Consider "I Know All". Action hero lights a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide the bad guys. (Probably a signal light to say here, I'm coming) <br /> <br /> This is one of the 100 scenes that you can laugh about. (I think the movie should be in the comedy category.) Horrible Director, Terrible Screenplay, Bad Acting, Cheap Special Effects. (They used a tunnel so they can hide there when they operate in the dark.)
