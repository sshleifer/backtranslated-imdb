(As a note, I've seen this movie in my annual church camp, where the entire youth group laughed about it.) I bought it when I saw it on a shelf a year later, if only for fun.) I'm from one a bad attempt to make an evangelical film.) Lay it Down is beyond the expectations of many film fans at various levels. Most problems are in impersonal action. Regardless of the beautiful cars in the movie or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie AND witness tool, Lay It Down does not deliver much. <br /> <br /> Most of the good opinions of the films are supported by Christians who agree with the message. While it is easy for a Christian to agree with the points given, the audience hardly experiences life outside of a clich√©. The fight scene between Ben and his brother is terribly synchronized. And in the subtitles, there are at least three obvious typos. <br /> <br /> I'd like to encourage everyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's comment. It really helps to understand why the movie was written as it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposite to the needs of a moviegoer: he shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians as well as some points of religious conflict; He admitted that most editors were hasty but "satisfactory"; he considered the overused transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely satisfied with the acting. <br /> <br /> He also added motifs that he was quite proud of: -All names (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = "Destiny", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. The car that makes donuts is a symbol of the circling nothing that is a life without Christ. - When Ben goes on Peter's bike, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross." <br /> <br /> I do not do it. He throws things like this in between while he says street runners and the like "hammer their brains with guns" and how "God is in control of when you were born and when you die." Yes, that was not a typo. He really says that. <br /> <br /> I have reserved (little) forgiveness for this movie. The "cool cars" and the "good message" do not make this movie good. However, the film was made by a group of unprofessional individuals with a budget of less than 1/100 of the "The Fast and the Furious" movies, and the deadline was adamant. Considering that I give him a score of 2/10, instead of 1:10 I think it's so expensive.
