Your idol will fool you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is misunderstood as a young German student who still leans on his father's orders, though the actor is apparently nearly 40 years old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes basically) to a very young-looking girl all the more disturbing. The characters have no dimension and the war presentation serves only as a backdrop for these softpop wannabe. Nichols, who is one of the best TV channels of the day, shows no passion for what the main interest of this film should be: watching him watch sex with this girl. It's like watching two animals doing it. If you are a fan of this actor's actor in other projects, do not rent this because you will never see him in the same way. If, on the other hand, you want to see Stephen Nichols orgasm in front of the camera, you might like that: Stephen shows you his bare ass, lots of tongue work, his groaning reach, but not his talent character, who is obviously as sex-driven and misjudged as he was because he wanted to do such personal things in front of the camera. He may have found it confused, but I did not - a BIG illusion!
