I have to give this movie a 4 because of some things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I'll call the "stupid victim syndrome". If you have the killer on the ground and have his gun, shoot him, please. If you're a cop and your shotgun is aimed at the killer's back, shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a stressful situation with your finger on the trigger of a weapon, your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach you in hand art training, and the reason why you do not press your finger on the trigger before you can shoot - ask a hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract, which squeezes your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It's really hard to lie on the floor completely still for eight hours without two other people - one of them a doctor - not realizing that you are not dead. This is even more so if you allegedly die of a brain tumor and were in the hospital only a few months earlier. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - the guy he injected poison that needed the antidote. If you poison someone, it's murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson he should learn? Yes, the doctor had to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something. <br /> <br /> Apart from these things, I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was pretty good and the way the killer killed his victims was very resourceful. I can even forgive the terrible action of the doctor - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the end seemed to work well and did not work for me. Luckily I did not have to pay for it or I would have asked for a refund.
