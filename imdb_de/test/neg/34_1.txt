Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketers individuals Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) dismisses her for personal calls at work, however, that's not all a bad news lawyer who dismisses her Noting that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) died recently and left her home and fortune (why does it never happen to me?). Very excited, Jackie goes there and immediately goes home while she searches for the thermostat late at night. Jackie stumbles into a secret room where her grandfather puts the gaudy red formula he invented and who can drink it to change his appearance. Jackie is finally a bit perverted with the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), but Jackie's better alter-ego begins to take control ... <br /> <br /> Posted by Rolfe co-produced Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was total scrap from start to finish and so simple and straightforward. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", frankly, whether Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done here with his story his grave. First of all, I think Jacqueline Hyde was / should be a horror movie, the IMDb certainly lists it as such, but there's no horror at all, except how bad it is. I'd say that Jacqueline Hyde is more of a softcore porn than anything else and extremely tame about sitting down and watching that smoother porn when you can see the right hardcore stuff that actually delivers the merchandise? Why, that's the question I'm asking here. It's not even a good porn. Besides being too soft, it's boring, boring, and the unremarkable sex scenes are few and far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title, which would have been pretty wise, if not the fact that another movie in the last century used the title of Jacqueline Hyde (1998). According to the action summary of the IMDb this sounds much better than this piece of garbage. This is one of those movies you need to see for yourself to see how bad it is, but hope you never get the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Kanefsky obviously worked on a low budget, but that's no excuse. These days, shot on a digital camcorder, the movie looks cheap. The few cases of CGI seem like a Nintendo Gameboy. The final "shocking" twist probably has the worst morph effect I've ever seen, laughing like the scene where Jackie's breasts are growing through dreadful CGI. That's another thing, the movie takes itself too seriously. The subject is shit, too predictable, and makes a bad movie, but if the dialogue was deliberately funny with a dirty porn talk, the movie might have been more fun, but that's not so. Forget about any decent horror, violence or horror, because apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end, there are none. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, Jacqueline Hyde is a homemade footage, photography is flat-handed. The point-and-shoot variety keeps the music, production design, and special effects appropriately low according to the script. The acting was terrible, seriously, that's bad. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Hyde I think a lot of crap, there is nothing positive about this movie that I can think of. Any film lover will find it almost impossible to find a redeeming value in this crap that is definitely to be avoided.
