Originally a sequel to the "The Slumber Party Massacre" series, this film has a new title in the face. First, if you include the word "massacre" in the movie title, you deliver better. This one certainly does not do it. There is no thrill, no murders on the screen and no chainsaw, as you would believe based on the box art. Instead, we get a paperless, exaggerated conspiracy against a group of cheerleaders stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football match just to lose one by one. This movie could have been fine, too, if the Gore quotient were raised a bit. Why directors, especially those who are directly on video, are afraid to show EVERY Gore is not mine. Well, I'm not a big fan of excessive blood, but come on ... why would anyone else make a movie called "Cheerleader Massacre ??" lend? Apart from this problem, the film suffers from the cheap acquisition camera. It looks cheap, sounds cheap and the actors are not very good. It's trying to get us out of the track of who the killer is, but that too fails. The end is a ridiculous mess. People, if you watch this movie, go away and find the original "Slumber Party Massacre". 2 out of 10.
