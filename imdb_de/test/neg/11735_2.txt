Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to transform Psycho into color so he could make it accessible to the modern public who would probably go into cardiac arrest if he was ever forced to watch a movie in black and white while simply forgetting Both Employees and Schindler's List were shot in black and white and are great movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same close-minded people who do not want to watch a great movie just because it's in black & white White is the same people who would not like "Psycho" anyway, because there's not a murder or sex scene every two minutes, and the murders are not the gruesome blood / guts / gore / bone snapping that people do are used to seeing "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," and "Nightmare on Elm Street." For this reason, the remake of "Psycho" should not work almost exactly as it was originally intended it really only f is of interest to people who are fans of the original. Everyone else just looks to bridge them until the next "scream" episode pops up, so they'll be disappointed. "Psycho" relies on tension and mystery, not on blood and courage. (And just so nobody thinks that I have to be an older citizen if I like older movies.) Let me set the record by saying that I'm 21.) So, when the movie turned into color, that was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just colorize and re-release the film? I mean, what's the point of making a movie new if you * change * nothing? The least he could have done was shoot his own director instead of just copying Hitchcock - or better yet, a new writer who adapted a new script from the original "Psycho" book. However, it does seem that Van Sant could not decide whether or not he wanted to "make psycho" * exactly * again. This should have been an all-or-nothing project - either redoing the movie or doing it differently - but it looks like this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few small touches that have no purpose. As Norman masturbates while spying on Marion while undressing. The plot is not at all, and the only reason why he brought her into the game was that he * could *. He wanted to say, "Hitch could not show people masturbating in 1960, so I'll do it." Whoopee, big deal, as if I was so shocked to see someone masturbating. And what was the point of showing single shots of clouds and livestock assembled into the murderer scenes? And then he leaves off an important scene in which Lila and Sam meet the sheriff in front of the church. <br /> <br /> In addition, the entire movie appears like an anachronism through the almost same script. The opening credits say that the year is 1998. So what about Marion's 60-year-old dress or the umbrella she's carrying? Why do Marion and Sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room, when nobody is shocked by what they do these days? Why is not there air conditioning in Marion's office? Why does Bates Motel have no TVs in the rooms and apparently no automatic locks on the doors? Why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the Bates Motel? Because of this, it was a mistake to use the same script, just a few words to change, and there was not enough to modernize it. It needed a complete overhaul. While Vince Vaughn performed well as Norman, he just did not seem right for the role. Part of what made the original "psycho" so scary was that Norman had that innocent quality next door, so no one could believe he was capable of such terrible crimes. If Vince Vaughn plays the role, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic murderer? That said, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original "Psycho" movie and wanted that to be a tribute. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that this is the only encounter with Psycho. I really think that you should only see this movie if you have seen the original. Since I'm a fan of "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake that I occasionally watch. The original movie was a filet mignon while the remake is a hamburger. But even Filet Mignon would be boring if you had it every day. So it's nice to have a hamburger every now and then.
