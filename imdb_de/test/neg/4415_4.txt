There are a number of films my high school friends and I have always made fun of. It's mostly the Campy works of the 50s that appeared on the late show on television. This was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native is brought to life in a tree stump with a sinister face. Now, my friends said, if you looked closely, you could see that the thing had shoes. I never saw that. Most striking to me is that the natives appeared white men with black grease on their faces. some looked Italian somehow. They also spoke with the strangest timbre that did not seem to suit their situation. As with the mummy movies, the mobility of the matter did not seem to be a big threat. In a confrontation one should only have to go fast; I think it's the old element of surprise. If you see that, do not take it too seriously. Be happy that we have a bunch of old horror movies that gave us so much pleasure.
