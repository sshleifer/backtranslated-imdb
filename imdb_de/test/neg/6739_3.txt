If you watch a Seagal movie, expect good action. You expect fights, not just a lot of shooting like in this movie. And: They expect a rather simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story, though it's a Seagal movie. But this is, I do not know what to say. It is very, very confusing. At the end of the movie, I had big problems figuring out what had happened. And I know that I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of action holes that it is almost impossible to keep track of the events in the film. There are a lot of people in the film, people are constantly changing sides, and the place changes too often. Awful. I just do not understand why it looks like Seagal is going to be a continuation of this.
