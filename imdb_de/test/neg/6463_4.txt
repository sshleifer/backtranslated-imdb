On a Thursday night at 22:00, my local ABC member from the West Coast aired the pilot episode "Northern Exposure." The ABC network normally broadcasts "Men In Trees" in this time slot, but the program was pre-determined for a live sports event. Despite the two shows being played in Alaska and filmed in the Pacific Northwest (Exposure) in Washington State, Trees in Vancouver, BC, reminding me of "Northern Exposure" (as well as some episodes of "Sex and the City ") of how disappointed I am with the ill-conceived hybrid" Men in Trees ". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately, her role as a writer who lands in a small town in Alaska is on her nerves. Maybe because I feel like heck is wrong, I'm not convinced of her fish-from-water character. <br /> <br /> I also feel like the supportive cast matches the typical quirky stereotypes. The hot-looking locals, the friendly bar owner, the bush pilot, the local police, the weak but well-intentioned radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only incident that may have been broken was teddy bear and the experienced " ER "actor Abraham Benrubi as a local bartender who falls in love with two different women. Considering that one of the executive producers is the filmmaker James Mangold (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" had leading actors who were big men), I'm not surprised why Benrubi was played in a non-typical role. <Br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can see why there are many dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It fits into the quirky niche for the television audience. I wish the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows.
