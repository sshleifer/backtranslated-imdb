Documentary Definition: A work, such as a film or television program, that presents factual and informative political, social or historical themes, often consisting of recent news films or interviews with narrations. The keyword here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants and have hardly learned anything about them. <br /> <br /> The interviews with all the celebrities were pretty worthless. I do not care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anyone and irritated Syd Straw. And do you listen to people who recite TMBG texts as if they were funny / interesting? It was neither. I think that was the problem: There is a lot of talk in the movie about TMBG's love for coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material funny? No! There was evidence that both men are married, but they never talked about it. And what about the solo material they did? What motivated her? These types of questions are neither addressed nor answered. <br /> <br /> I could continue with the negatives. I found the segment on Dial-a-Song very interesting. If you want to learn more about They Might Be Giants, just buy some CDs and listen. Serious. This movie is a huge disappointment. I can not believe that so many people have given him a 10. Incredible.
