Number 1 was really a great summer popcorn fun. It was the modern Jaws. <br /> <br /> Number 2 is best summed up by Jeff Goldblum in the movie that he is the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that) /> Number 3 is the obituary ... JP has achieves everything it will ever do. <br /> <br /> As soon as they realized that they had no new ideas, they should have just let them sleep. <br /> <br /> That said. The movie is fine if you do not mind knowing that you've seen it before. <br /> <br />
