Japan gets under the sea due to the dubious plate tectonics. First predictions say it will take about 40 years for the country to be flooded, but a rogue scientist adds a little more dubious science and realizes it actually takes less than a year! The government thinks he's a nutcase, but the evidence soon curbs his theory. <br /> <br /> This big-budget movie follows the formula set forth in a series of Hollywood movies of the late '90s (I suppose I did not see any of them), with the extent of Catastrophe and the tragedy that bring forth the nobility of the human (near Japanese) spirit in exploits and sacrifices and prove the power of love or something similar. That is, it is as naive in its psychology as it is in geology ... We all know that half the population would be raped and plunder the minute that they thought the police had turned their backs and the other Half would only panic and be useless /> <br /> The film has some very nice special effects, but is not as smooth or expensive as it would be a Hollywood production. It's at least as nationalist, humorless, and self-conscious as the Hollywood movie would be, and he probably has worse drama. It has the hot evil chick of Battle Royale as one of the main roles ... but it is not even a little bit evil and therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The movie is much too long at 132 minutes. and gets worse, the farther it comes to a conclusion, in which I could puke into danger. I certainly did not care if Japan had dropped or not, and I tried to find ways to speed things up before the end, to speed up the process should I ever be in this situation. <Br /> <br /> But it has nice special effects and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot, so I'm generous with it ... 3/10.
