... and boy, is it soft. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a Saturday night on the cable channel Bravo, and here in the UK we often have these horrible "erotic" softcore movies on Bravo late at night. This follows a WEIRD SCIENCE plan by two college freaks who create a virtual reality headset that triggers sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> If you've seen any of these movies, you've all seen them with a bunch of Bimbos that look like they're offering silicone implants. Come on, I've actually seen breasts in real life (I'm sure some of us have too) and they wiggle around, unlike here, where they contradict the laws of physics, if not gravity. The sex scenes are those boring affairs in which a well-honed geezer rubs against his co-star with no dialogue or noise except for a few muzaks, and when they reach their climax, it looks like they both have a bad constipation. The girls themselves are very pretty, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted in this kind of softcore movies. <br /> <br /> And if it's fantasy then I recommend the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy
