The sound in this movie is a nightmare. That's the best thing I can say for this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost at the beginning of the film. The premise of the movie sounds good. A playboy who deals with the people around him. The plot is predictable and very boring. The wet T-shirt contest is possibly the worst scene I've ever seen, and is almost worth seeing in a mystery science deal. The sound is sometimes hard to hear and the lead actor does not seem to speak clearly. His accent makes it very hard to understand. The only bright sport is the spectacle of Penelope Ann Miller. Her role is underdeveloped, but she plays well. Do not waste time.
