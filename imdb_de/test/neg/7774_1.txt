I do not know if I should be amused or insulted if the Drivel is spent like "Lifetime: Television For Women". It's not a potion. This movie was no exception. You know a movie is going to go bad when the biggest headliner is Tori Spelling. A completely bad invention of plastic surgery and spoiled privilege without any talent. Everyone else agreed with unbelievably bad acting, and the plot was beyond stupidity, as if anyone could believe any of it. If I had not been helpless on the sofa, I would have changed the channel.
