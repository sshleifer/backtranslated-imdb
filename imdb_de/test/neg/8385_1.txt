This movie was so bad If someone who has starred in the movie reads this, including the director, then I hate you! LOL, that blonde woman who ran away and ran screaming through the woods. At least CRY RATHER THAN SCREAM AND KEEP THE POOR HEAVY ATEM !! and oh god, if it was the director who sorted out the cameras for this movie, then return to a normal job. Nobody wants to look at the chin of a frightened woman in the whole house. Do not fucking think or buy or have a copy of it within 100 yards of your house, as it can be harmful to people who like good movies ... When I got home, I thought, I I would have rented a Pron film for drama and style of the camera.
