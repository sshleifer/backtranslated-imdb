I am sorry that I disagree with you, but I found the DKC series very appealing. So much so, that I've invested in the SNES system and my own copies of the games. This is, mind you, almost ten years after the first release of DKC 1. The graphics were groundbreaking for their time, the first vector graphics for home systems. The music and characters are all memorable, and the games brought me and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. The second game was better than the first, and the third might lack the "advantage" of the second installment. But all three offered different games, and I still enjoy them today. Incidentally, I'm old enough to remember when there were NO video games (and the TVs were black and white!).
