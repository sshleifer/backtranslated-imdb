Only ONCE do I want to give Koontz's work to a decent screenwriter, director and producer! JUST ONCE! <br /> <br /> This is a good try by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pristine garbage. The scriptwriter should be filmed to do the same to Bast Koontz's work, and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> The story is a well-written story, but the script is pretty boring, unbelievable and terrible. The only elements that work are the performances of LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> Personally, I wanted this to work. I love Koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's work that they shovel at the full kegs in King's shovel, Koontz would rise quickly. But unfortunately! Without powerful people believing in his work, I fear he will never get a chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was an absolute blast. As a stand-alone film, it was not so bad, though it was extremely weak in many places, with huge holes in the holes and awful, stiff, unprofessional dialogues that should never have made it to the final cut. This movie failed miserably at its potential. If they had followed the original work of Koontz a little closer and had invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a much better undertaking. <br /> <br /> However, I can see it all, it could not have been that good. <br /> <br /> It rates a 4.3 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
