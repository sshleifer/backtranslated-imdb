This movie would have been a lot better if he had not used Brian Conley as a gangster and would not start the movie with Christopher Biggins. When I saw this movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were too many double crosses and phrases to make the movie believable. The movie deserves a 0, but since I do not have 0, I gave it a 1. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, some rusty scissors, than to watch this movie again. I tell you, that was one and a half hours of my life, I will not come back. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, you do not understand that. Instead, look at "Big Time" or "Locks, Bearings, and Two Incense Barrels."
