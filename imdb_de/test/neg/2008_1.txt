Well, it is about 1,000 years in the future and we finally broke the long distances between the galaxies !! But unfortunately we still use rifles that shoot bullets, black men still call themselves brothers and become tall, stoned, struggling etc. Ordinary stereotypical, urban black men still have the end of the stick! Babes in tight black rubber pants who look as if they are from Baywatch share the investigator and the crew. Crippled people still need wheelchairs, no fancy remedies, implants or robot legs. Dracula still looks gay. I need to go on ... In short, this shot was shot on a typical sci-fi set with low budget, actors and no real special effects. The beginning, the middle and the end were pathetic. I have to go and shoot myself, there's nothing left to live on.
