If you are a healthy person and have already seen movies, you can not tolerate this idiom for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there longer, then it's not because you expect Akshay or Paresh (please do not Govinda!), But because you appreciate your money too much and you at least want a quick nap on the plush seats in the multiplex in return for that Money they robbed you! It's hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult movie like HeraPheri can fall to such a level. Okay, he repeats himself, but now he comes out of the third bar and expects us to laugh because he brought Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. No, sir, that will not work now ... especially with this stupid script! Even comedy films can have meaningful screenplays (anyone at Lage Raho Munnabhai?). Govinda not I have a lot to do, I can not comment on it..Akshay Kumar was bored, Paresh Rawal broke some of the worst jokes that were possible. Lara Dutta had real leeway, but she failed miserably ... the only highlight of the film (possibly) is Tanushree's acting! But she is only there for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie is worth more space ... (probably not even that much!). So last warning - do not look!
