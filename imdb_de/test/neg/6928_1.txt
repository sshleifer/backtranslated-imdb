I absolutely despise this movie. I wanted to love it - I really wanted it. But man, oh man - with Sara they were SO off. And the living father was pretty cheesy. That's right out of the Shirley Temple movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend THE BOOK. It's amazing In the book, Sara is honorable and decent and she's doing the right thing ... BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT. She has no spiteful bones in her body. <br /> <br /> In the movie, she is mean and malicious. She does trifles to come back to Miss Minchin. In this book Sara is talking about such things. She gets up to Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not intimidated by her. But she does not do the stupid, malicious things that Sara does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is really quite disturbing for me that so many here say that they loved the book and love the movie. I can not wonder ... did we read the same book? The crux of the book was personal responsibility, behavior with awe and integrity, ALWAYS telling the truth and countering adversity with calmness and integrity. Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the connection with his partner who sought her. In the book, she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep - this part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> Seeing all the praise for this miserable movie bothers me. We praise a film that glorified with a few tips of kindness petty, malicious behavior? Sara in the book was good-natured and full of integrity. I do not even recognize her in the movie ... she is not there. It's a good thing Mrs. Burnett does not see this terrible thing anymore. It is terrible and undeserved to wear the title of her book.
