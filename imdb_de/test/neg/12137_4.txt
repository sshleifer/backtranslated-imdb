Boring as hell and a kind of chick movie. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a neurotic woman struggling with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one-night stand and uncertainty pitfalls of true love. <br /> <br /> Many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other current KST films (such as English patients), but are far less popular. <br /> <br /> After the first half - I started to look at my watch and wondered if I could make it on time to watch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I passed "Gladiator" to see that!?!
