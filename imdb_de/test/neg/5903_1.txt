This movie could have been so much better. It is a beautiful story that plays in very difficult times, and yet it was performed so poorly. The lead actors have done a great job in the past, and in this film they mostly do a proper job. At times, their dialogue seems to be stilted and forced. The director could have been scarcer. The bulk of the criticism was to go to the authors, who recorded a good story and became boring. In short, there are thousands of MUCH better ways to spend 2 hours.
