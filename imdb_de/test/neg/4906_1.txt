I respect Mike Hodges and loved Get Carter for his bleak prospects, but The Croupier just seems like a particularly boring ITV drama. <br /> <br /> The restrained, cold drama is not just a matter of the main character, it also covers the entire cast, meaning that there is nothing that relates Owen's character to himself. <br /> <br /> None of the characters evoke any feelings except boredom. The end of the film is at best too messy. <br /> <br /> The camera work, etc. is pretty good, but if you want to see Hodges best, you should look at Carter, do not fret with this uninteresting, unimaginative confusion that he had over 20 years ago mastered better
