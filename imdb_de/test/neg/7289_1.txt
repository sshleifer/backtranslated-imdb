This movie was horrible and does not even deserve to be called a movie. As I see it, it's more like three mediocre Disney episodes that are loosely drummed during the day to produce a single video purporting to be the sequel to the first Atlantis movie that's much better and more entertaining. And where do I start with the problems of this DVD? The history? The characters? The pictures / animation? For me they are all bad and unsurpassed. First, the story of this direct-to-video DVD is ridiculous and pointless. The only good thing is that it is consistent - that is, consistently bad from beginning to end. After the film, I still do not know why Milo has returned and how the incidents in the three little stories are related to each other or to Atlantis itself. And all I could remember about this movie was how bad I feel after seeing it. The characters feel wooden and lack personality, and the drawings look a lot different than the first one. You realize that they obviously did not come from the first animators. When the DVD was playing, I was less and less concerned with what could happen to the characters, and I just hoped the movie would end soon. Aside from the story and characters above, image quality is also poor in this case, probably one of the worst in these direct-to-video products that Disney has ever released. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I could not be disappointed in Milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. Luckily, I rented it first instead of buying it. Still, I still wished I had never seen or even known this crap.
