If I put this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwig, I'm sure it sounds like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four guys at a private high school are good friends AND they're witches." < br /> Hollywood: "That sounds like The Craft. <br /> <br /> ME:" No, no, I said four guys, not four girls. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood: "That still sounds like The Craft, with only boys instead of girls." <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, but there's this fifth unfamiliar boy who comes into the picture, and he want more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Still no big difference, because one of the girls in "The Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I'll make these guys a part of the" crowd "they'll be rich AND the school is on the East Coast Hollywood:" That sounds originally on. This is nothing like "The Craft", here's a billion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This movie was so clich√©d and uninspired that even the drama that had been made between Chase and the Ipswich brothers was a blase, a bunch of rich kids whose biggest problem is the color Bentley used for their 18th birthday. Birthday (and 18th car) does not interest me at all, even if they have powers Every single child in this movie looked like he came out of a magazine And of course it had to be the superfluous male nudity and a female 80% Nude, just to go home, the shape you are in. I wanted to rename that movie in "The Witches of OC." Oooh, rich children and their problems .. let me pretend it's important to me. <br /> <br /> This film was totally unimaginative and predictable, the last fight was lame and leaked and the ending was very anti-climatic, this was a film that has remained best in the cutting room floor.
