This is a boring movie. The real bad guys are the chunky adaptation (it's embarrassingly easy to say that the source material was a novel) and a witless script. <br /> <br /> On the credit side, the budget was tight due to the conflict in the war, the movie is not bad at all. And the performances are broadly OK, except for Phyllis Calvert, who is great - a marvel at the potential for victory, a pit she definitely will not fall into. Ms. Calvert, with much less to do, is as successful as Olivia de Havilland at Gone With The Wind. <br /> <br /> The absolutely unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the awfully imaginary portrayal of a black boy. No matter that he should be a sympathetic character. Played poorly by a white boy in black make-up, it is impossible to circumvent this example of condescending racism. <br /> <br /> Grim.
