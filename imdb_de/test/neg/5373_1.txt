For a while, I was addicted to shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and such, and although I thought they were full of crap, I found them interesting and entertaining, and that's why we watch entertainment television. It's fun to turn off your brain and believe that any shadow captured by the camera is not just a shadow, but some tortured spirit or something, when you retreat to the real world later. <br /> <br However, if you enjoy the paranormal state, you need more than just turning off the brain. It requires that you regularly consume lead in large doses in childhood, then suffers a repeated head trauma and receives screaming paint in the teenage years. Then you have to get up / get drunk and watch. <br /> <br /> Paranormal State is beyond the pseudoscience (which I can enjoy with critical thinking) that you find on Ghost Hunters (which I still find.) to be a pretty interesting and entertaining program) it's pseudo ... everything. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of Penn State University students (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell as they set themselves the task of demons and ghosts with exorcisms from any religion that seems most dramatic at this time (ranging from Catholic exorcisms performed by college students to Wiccan spells thrown by socially awkward gothics to American cleansing rituals becoming credit performed by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca or are Catholic or followers of traditional Indian religions, you want you to have their cleansing rituals performed by someone who is ... not an inappropriate college student with some free time. I do not remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests pushed their hands up and said, "It does not help! Call a tutoring club from the state college, which is too much for us, they probably have Wikipedia read articles on exorcisms. "The show openly offends the intelligence of the viewer. In the opening episode of the show, Ryan talks about PRS (Paranormal Research Society) and says when he came to Penn State (you do not see any shows where the host says the same thing, but instead of Penn State, he says, "When I came to MIT "or" After completing my theoretical physics studies ... "), he found other people with a similar interest in the paranormal. He says that sometimes they are "warriors". I remember pretending that I was a warrior and fighting against ghosts. I was six. Then the unemotional Ryan brings out the extravagant and disgusting chip Coffey, who claims to be in a trance and obsessed by scolding the cast. Brilliant. I thought people had a sense of how ridiculous the idea of ​​media and media is after "Crossing Over" blew up. The show takes itself too seriously, as this small group of social playfulness pretends to fight against an ancient, cosmic evil. The production values ​​are low, the stories are boring, and unlike Ghost Hunters, who occasionally pick up something unusual (though probably explanatory but interesting) on ​​their gear, you have to believe that the sounds and noises they hear are proofs Demons, ghouls and possibly goblins. The only scary thing about this show is that there are people who take it seriously. The only thing paranormal is that people on each episode are able to make each episode while keeping a straight face. <br /> <br /> Call me exhausted, but like the great secrets of the universe and the hereafter, I feel too big to be solved by a student journalist at a public school on a half-hour television program. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I recommend everyone to watch this show at least once, if not for anything other than the sheer entertainment that comes from watching a really horrible movie or TV show. Or you can make a drinking game out of it. I think the second one would be preferable.
