Pacino and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I'm an avid moviegoer and fan. I've been a fan of most of this abortion people at one time or another. Until now. The Story Crap The Drama Crap (Rene Ruso Major League was Good) The Plot Crap The Subplot Rubbish The Teenager Tries to Refer to Sports Betting Junk <br /> <br /> I swore to Romy look and Michelle's high school reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning off that colostomy bag of a movie after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and that mung bunch cost me $ 9.99 and 2 hours. I was cheated This director should be in jail for fraud. <br /> <br /> Get in touch with me if you have any further review questions. I am always right.
