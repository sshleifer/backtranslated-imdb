I can say with certainty that this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I usually love foreign films. The movie is nothing more than bad pornography. If you want to see it, prepare for endless sexism, baseless nudity shots, and a stupid, sensational rape scene that I think is the main incentive for people who like the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot snakes aimlessly and none of the characters is sympathetic. Many scenes are filmed from the forests around the river, where the girls are located, to have a constant sense of persecution, which was a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of history. <br /> <br /> Maybe I would not have wasted my time watching the movie if it had been described in reviews.
