The idea of ​​nine stupid prisoners escaping and traveling on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. Especially because it's supposed to be funny and I think it's kind of heartwarming somehow. The problem is, the movie was rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and unnecessarily rude. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes kept coming up, but no one bothered to finish one - there was no profit. In addition, the film was mindless and the rogues meandered through Japan, even though they had left so many victims of crime that it's hard to believe they would not have been caught right away - especially as they continue to use the same stolen camper for days. And as far as it is disgusting, I just did not need to see scene after scene, in the guys pee on the roadside. Plus, believe it or not, there's a scene where four of the boys rape sheep! <br /> <br /> All in all, I really hated this movie. And that's a pity, because I love Japanese movies almost always - just not bad-made and uninteresting films like this one.
