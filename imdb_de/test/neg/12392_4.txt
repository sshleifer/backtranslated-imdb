Big Pointe Blank was really a below-average movie. The hit-man theme is very dry and more like a romantic comedy than a hit thriller. The spectacle is very normal. The performances are sometimes extremely embarrassing, many characters seem very "eccentric" and that really annoyed me. The whole reunion and the "Wow, I have not seen you for 10 years!" element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just pass by, especially at the end, when they're at the actual reunion party and the characters go through each of their former classmates in turn to greet them. It all seemed very cheesy, futile and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's role as a "rival" assassin is very sparse. He only seems to appear at the very beginning and at the very end in a 'final show down' that is extremely high but does not work at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. Most of the songs included in this movie are straight from the 80s and are very bad except for two or three. Listening to duff songs about a pretty stupid movie only adds to the negativity that surrounds this movie. <br /> <br /> I could always talk about how small things were annoying and how the few action sequences were very bad that came and went very fast, the lack of character development and how bad the whole thing was built in this department so that you forget half the time that Cusak's character is a hit at all, since the item does not exist like that <br /> <br /> Even if the comedy thinks it's funny; but it is not. I did not even laugh during this movie. Sure, maybe I smiled every now and then, but my only REAL feeling was when I realized the movie was almost over! high (but not correct) IMDb rating. I've seen movies that are better than this movie, which have a lower rating on this website, telling you that there are better movies. Do not bother with this one.
