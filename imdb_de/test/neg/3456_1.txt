It is unbelievable to me that the best rendering of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but it is true. Here another clumsy attempt triggers confusion, and alienated ones are spectators with admirable efficacy while successfully counteracting those of us who have actually read the story. Irving's original work is short in every way, and making a feature film is certainly a challenge. You can either completely rewrite the story Ã  la Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another time, or pad up the bust of the old girl with unintentional details. The latter is what is being tried here and, if I may say, compassionate. Imaginative and thoroughly modern facets of characters such as religious zeal in Crane or Wanderlust in the good old Bram Bones ruin the intent of the story and betray a talent shortage of filmmakers. As the famous climax of history approached, I completely lost interest. It's the kind of movie where you expect a stagehand to smoke in the background.
