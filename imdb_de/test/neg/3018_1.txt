Although it hurts to some extent that I've taken the trouble to name the comment panel for this new series - especially because I might give the wrong impression that there does not seem to be a public interest in it - I feel compelled to get my chips on this. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, never before had I been so confident in using the quick and merciless cancellation of a television program solely because of the merits of their promo ads. And if you're wondering, I'm a guy. <br /> <br /> Listen, Comedy Network: Although your existing original program already exists, we should politely say a "questionable" quality (I) I look at you, "Girls Will Be Girls"). You really excelled yourself. Whoever lit this thing green could not be further away from what's cool. <br /> <br /> Good luck.
