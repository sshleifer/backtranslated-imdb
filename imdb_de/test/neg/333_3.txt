I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review that gave this film a suspiciously high rating of 9/10. I say suspiciously, because it looks less like a review, but more like an advertising slogan. Maybe the filmmaker himself or one of his colleagues wrote this "review"? Naughty, cheeky. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Sky TV Propeller Channel expecting it to be really awful. The special effects used were, frankly, very good for a low-budget movie, and some of the acting was not that bad either, but most of the acting was really horrible, but good for trying, I think most of them were Friends of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker did a really good job trying to beat his weight. I found some of the movie funny because it tried to be super cool, even though it just was not. <br /> <br /> If you do not take this movie too seriously and treat it drunk with some friends Maybe a good time, but probably not as it was intended. This film is by no means a 9/10, but it's worth looking to laugh, considering it was attributed to those involved in its production on a very low budget and for fairness reasons.
