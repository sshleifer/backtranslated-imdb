Monday, October 02, 2006 So, as usual, I met up with my dad. We ordered a Japanese take-out, turned off the lights and pressed play. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. The Cavern, which was released on DVD this October, was undoubtedly a flop. It seemed promising and met all the standard requirements of a horror film machine: starting with an antagonistic character, a sex scene that can not be missed, and the all-too-familiar preflop (if they scare you unexpectedly, but it turns out this is the Case is the idiot buddy). When it finally happened, I was ready for real action. The director, I admit, was thrilled. Of course, you would need to plan in for a full 81 minutes, when people walk back and forth in a room about 10 feet wide. It all starts when some college cavers come together for another cave dive. They all look like seasoned professionals, very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience. This time, they bring along a newcomer, an annoying photographer too blind to his cover of National Geographic to understand the full dangers of cave diving. As they descend deep into what they call "hell pit," they quickly realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. I will politely omit all spoilers if you are naive enough not to follow my advice and not waste your time. Although the atmosphere and background music was scary; and there was certainly a lot of blood and blood as the moments approached to witness a real dismemberment, it was more like watching porn without the full front. The camera work was deliberately dark and sketchy. I think the director used it for the effect. I think I like the moving characters most about the movie. They earned Acadamy Awards for these touching scenes. I almost shed a tear when they finally "understood" it ... A tear of joy! If you like dry horror, gentle porn and hated Braveheart. Then this is the movie for your next Saturday night.
