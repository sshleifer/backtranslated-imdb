Some movies are just stupid and can not be explained. This is one of them. Words can not do justice to the wooden acting, the stupid action and the always predictable result. The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing in half are the scantily clad women (and the mute for you ladies). The Warriors and Valeria leaders are very appealing to the eye. But that's about all that this movie promises. <br /> <br /> A few stupid things: A scene when they start to travel to the cave of the Dark One, they leave an allegedly destroyed country. But we clearly see a New York of the 80s behind it. About 2/3 of this movie looks like it was filmed in a basement cellar. The deadly sock puppets look as scary as a street monster made of sesame seeds. I have to agree with Latronic that many 1950s Trash-B movies did a better job. The only one I can imagine was not teenagers from outer space.
