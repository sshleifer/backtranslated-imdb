This film is a shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) It was hurried in production to quench the poker / Stu Ungar craze. <br /> <br /> The story is inconsistent from the start. Vidmer spends too much time with Ungar's childhood and not enough with some legendary stories - like counting cards, his blackjack escapades, and the role of money as Id. He also omits mentions from other poker greats like Chip Reese, Brunson, etc. The film is a mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you think the movie is good, read the book and change your mind.
