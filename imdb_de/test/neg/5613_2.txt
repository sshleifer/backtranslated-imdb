This movie was made because the concept can be well translated into a two-sentence abstract that can be used to attract investors. That said, the premise is interesting and sellable. I mean, I rented it because of the overview. The problem is that there is nothing but the original concept. There is no coherent storyline, no full fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises and no good performances (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It's as if the people who lit this thing green never read the script, just the summary. And if there are enough people like me, it could even have made money. <br /> <br /> To the future spectators: Do not waste your time, there is nothing funny or interesting here. To the creators of the movie: Hey, you made your movie, what if it's not great? Most people never see themselves or their work on the screen.
