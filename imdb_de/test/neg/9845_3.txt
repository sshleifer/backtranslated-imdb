"Ripe" is one of those horrible indies that manage to circulate and give indies a bad name. To tell a stupid, incompatible story about teenage twin sisters crawling out of a car accident in which their parents are killed as they take to the streets in cheerful shoplifting, staring at a guy with Goo-Goo eyes and landing on an army post no army would want to give it up (yes, right!). "Ripe" is an obvious attempt at age stripe. He is an almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly as players drift in and out of character and eventually awkwardly end up with only a trace of credibility to be found everywhere. Recommended for anyone.
