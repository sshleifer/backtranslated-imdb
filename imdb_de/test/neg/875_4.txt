I had high hopes for this movie, even though I did not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - should be alright. But the movie does not keep the promise. I always waited for the depth of the characters and there was none. I have no problem with it being just a weekend before they fell in love. It can happen. But we never really get to know the characters. I would have focused more on her. The movie reminded me of places in Bridges of Madison County, and this movie was much better. I really felt the characters in this movie, and between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep there was a chemistry (much more passion) that was not between Gere and Lane. Each of them is a very good actor for himself. Just not the right movie for you.
