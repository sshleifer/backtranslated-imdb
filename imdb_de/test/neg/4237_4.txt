The premise of the movie had a lot to offer. Despite the novelty of the models that have sold furniture of others to live the high life, this film has nothing to offer. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully scripted that it's hard to hold out, and if there were jokes in the movie, I missed it. Marilyn Monroe, who walks in walls because she does not want to wear glasses, is absolutely incredible and not funny. Grabe's stupidity is too shitty to be believed. Bacall's Gold Trench is so forced that it's annoying to listen. Why someone would like to go through this, is not me.
