When a missile from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals in a small town in Texas crashes, people begin to die. The County Sheriff is attempting to investigate, but is hampered by other government officials. It turns out that there is a mutated space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the forest. <br /> <br /> I like low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought there was a good chance that I would like this movie. Unfortunately, I did not mind. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the bad drama, the annoying dialogue, the gruesome music score or the huge storylines this movie has. There are a lot of movies that have the same problems that I have seen and enjoyed so badly. It's a good kind. <br /> <br /> But where others of this kind and night fright differ, Night Fright has a terrible pace. And that's why it keeps on going. There are scenes that just go on without anything happening. Searching the forest for clues only consists of people walking in the woods for a long time. There are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting is going on. If those scenes were shorter, the movie might not have been so boring (though I do not think cutting these scenes would save the scene) that I gave it a shot before I slammed it in this review. Unfortunately, it got worse with each clock. There will be no fourth.
