How much do I love this movie? Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that is so bad that it's good. That's one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great butt, looks great on the screen and definitely does not make a bad turn on his acting debut (I think). Billy Zane is appropriately mean and moody, though I still feel there is something more in him. I could feel it in the Titanic, the expression on his face when La Winslet spat at him, for example, totally broken, shocked and downcast ... violent! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... no, seriously, I think that's it! It's worth it to see this to see a really hot guy, some big bra-fillers from Brook, Billy's snarl, laugh at the dialogues, indulge in the scenery and the madness of the whole affair ... I'll do it Now look again - yes, I bought it !!!
