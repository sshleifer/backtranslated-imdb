Few videos in recent history have been made as amateurish as this one - at least not one released by such a respected distributor. Every frame of this movie is a plagiarism of the better films of the past. The word "clich√©" takes on a new meaning from a talentless writer / director who should use his imagination for lesser masturbation efforts not falling victim to the movie audience. The Amateur Night Horror effort is helped by a number of less capable technicians who contribute to poor cinematography and ridiculous make-up and special effects. Unfortunately, the one or two amateur actors in the film have a touch of talent that will go unnoticed because of the reputation these atrocities produce.
