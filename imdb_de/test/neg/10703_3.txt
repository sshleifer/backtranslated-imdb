From the beginning to the end a pure blow. The average 12-year-old may have an interesting attitude towards discrimination. Otherwise it is a pure camp endurance test. Like one of those so-long episodes of Star Trek's The Next Generation that thinks she has something important to say. <br /> <br /> You will see every conspiracy in this number-centered trump. However, it is worth seeing for its portrayal of Drag King prostitutes, a brothel in which young women pay old men to have sex with them (what about role reversal) and lesbian soap operas. The spirit of Valerie Solanis is alive!
