1. watched 17.03.2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Stupid, sex-filled Master & Slave with too many intimate relationships. This movie seemed more interested in sex than the story and the way he worked the story around sex. Laughable Synchronization of the Italian original language in the version I observed with a ridiculous ending, where it was tried to make an anti-slaves statement (or should I say a line). What a waste of time for anyone looking at this garbage.
