I generally will not play movies that I have not seen for some time, so I'll throw them in or lend them to give a full and fresh look into the movie. In the case of 'A Sound of Thunder', I remembered my vow never to see this movie again, so I'll just be remembered. In fact, I did not think about how bad this movie was made until I read another review and remembered my experience in 2005 when I actually saw it in the theater. My buddy forced me to see it, although I was not interested and wow. (Later, I forced him to see "Basic Instinct 2" in the theater and reminded him that he had made me see this crap, and I think that even irritated us.) I certainly had some of the deep Lachens (at the expense of the film, of course) which did not make him happy when he really wanted to see it. The time travel / butterfly effect movie had so many bad graphics, the loudest giggle of mine was whenever he showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dino and they were scared of it - it was weird!) Or just only Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us how human actors can be: from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to this one. (Even a Meryl Streep can make a 'she-devil' from time to time, so they'll be forgiven.) For months, I pulled an MST3k with my buddy, consistently referring this movie to any cheap science-fiction movie or Kingsley movie Yes, the movie would be a great movie to watch drunk (or otherwise stunned): terrible over-the-top acting, "special" FX that would even turn Nintendo64 away, and ridiculous plot changes. The biggest disappointment was that the razzies did not even nominate this film for an award.
