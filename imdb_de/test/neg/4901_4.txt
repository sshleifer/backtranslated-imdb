Inspired by a true story, the story is full of seventies emotions, but in storytelling it is disconnected. This is the story of a black college swimmer who ends up in Phillie at a final rec center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts together a swimming team. The film staggers blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, as our hero, brings the kids to the pool. At this point he starts by getting a bit energetic, though he still stumbles around. There's a good story on this, and it's clear why Howard and Bernie Mac took part in it, but the script is bad and most of the direction seems to make it feel like you're feeling something, Rather than us feeling something for the story /> <br /> Not the disaster that has made some reviews, she suffers from all the recent sports stories (Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc.) that at least knew that you did at least have to do the story work to make a movie instead of just letting the audience suffer because it's "true".
