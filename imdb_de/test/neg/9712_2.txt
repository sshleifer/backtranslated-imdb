As mentioned by others, could there be another reason to see this movie than to see former Wayne's World star Mike Myers play a serious role? The plot is interesting, but they lack development. It is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there were good landscape shots of Ireland, there would be another reason to see it. Instead, she focuses on a small, normal village, apparently surrounded by the "green pastures" of Emerald Island, which are often featured in Irish films. If there was a cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality," it would be worth seeing, even though it would have been shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but this one can not please or satisfy the heart of anyone who ever wanted to visit the land of Guinness.
