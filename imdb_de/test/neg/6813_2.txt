After reading the reviews, I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and wanted to know more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I guess I do not know enough about Bach music and the comments were not enough to understand the importance or the music that was played. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be appropriate under the guidance of an expert for Bach's music who can explain the film. <br /> <br /> I've really tried and seen that the whole movie is jumping, that I can at least enjoy some of it, but I have not. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk.
