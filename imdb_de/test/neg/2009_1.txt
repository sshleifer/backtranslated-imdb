Hmmm! is it the worst movie ever? well, for some of the actors, it's a shame to see them in such a movie, but hey, if she pays the bills, why not, as far as the movie is concerned. Ok cg effects not bad for such a cheap movie, music is just OK again for a cheap movie, credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> Bad to list many, but cast, drama, sets, script, ending. What the hell, Drac .......... worst Drac EVER !, much more, but it can not bother to knock them all down ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all bad points, however, I say to watch this movie, so you can say "what the FU% $ was all this", while the loans run a kind of must, just to see how bad it is.
