If you look at the reviews, you would think that this is a classic, but this is just another example of poor independent filmmakers trying to get their interest in their film. You are not even wise about 10/10 in the votes? I think to curve the curve and put all the 1/10 values ​​it will get. Is that better than any decent zombie movie? <br /> <br /> Acting, nonsense and garbage. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, cheap and evil, if the actors did not look there, they would not know where they would come from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people behave as though they borrowed their father's camera after looking at the matrix. Less is more, but more of this team is absolutely ping. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also garbage. I do not doubt that most of these people will never be heard again, and with good reason. I hope zombies eat their eyes as these were 90 minutes dad I will not get back. <br /> <br /> And forgery of ratings only makes it a million times worse. <br /> <br /> One reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he's seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his latest cornea transplant was a success at that time. <br /> <br /> Look at the trailer, because that's a warning about how bad this movie is.
