It's the best movie that takes first place and a useful movie ever made in this poor country. You do not even know what the word cinema means, and you cast votes for films. I'm really curious how many films by P.P.P. or you have seen L.Bunuel. The score of this "faield experiment" reflects a lot of ways to understand things and recognize a good quality movie when you see it. We, the Romanian people, have only ONE movie and to this day the status has not changed. The film is called "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I do not lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it. This is a movie that takes into account all the required quality features of a movie. From the script over the frames to the quality / clarity of the picture even 41 years have passed. I recommend that voters search for better films and then vote. KuDos will see you later.
