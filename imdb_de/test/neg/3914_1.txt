Okay, <br /> <br /> I realize that there is some doubt that Thomas is out there ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this masterpiece of celluloid can say that the scene, in which George Wendt is sucked out of his spaceship, let me tremble. Sometimes I sit upright in my bed and scream like an old man on the table of a proctologist and think about it. If the director reads this, I would pay for it being extra in the sequel.
