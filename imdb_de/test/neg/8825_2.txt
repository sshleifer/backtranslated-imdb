Othello is supposed to burn the eyes of the audience of this movie. The poor portrayal of Shakespeare's characters and the terrible rendition of love that Desi & John had made that movie a terrible mess it is. By far, Othello, led by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocrity and cruelty. <br /> <br /> The film Othello is a miserable drama about the love between John and Desi. Their loyalty to each other is checked by the man's friend. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparably inseparable. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend shows up on the screen, startling the audience and instantly showing them how much he is a liar and power-hungry man. <br /> <br /> This film was far more terrifying than the Shakespeare novel itself. After that said, it has a tiny amount of good parts. For example, the love shown between John and Desi was very well represented, and it looked like the couple was so inseparable; as it was explained in the book. Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it did not show the jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi, as it should. <br /> <br /> Love, jealous, cheating, this movie is based on all three main themes of the Shakespeare novel. However, the novel really explains how all this came together much better than the movie could. For example, the conclusion of this story in the book ends much differently than in the film. Much more details are also included in the novel. That's why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who read it will disappoint it too. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie was by far the most terrible portrayal of any novel ever released by humanity. By avoiding this film, viewers not only save a second hour of their lives, but also one or two eyes from the hideous face of Ben Jago approaching them.
