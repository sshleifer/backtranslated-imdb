OK. Well, I guess it was worth it to get through this time, but I will not look at it again. There are some things in this movie that irritated me. <br /> <br /> First man ... I really hated the characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. It's hard for me to rationalize, spend a good deal of time following characters I really do not care about and can not understand. It's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; It was that the characters were written in such a way that I just wanted to despise them, and as the movie progressed I almost wanted the sky to fall on them. And that leads me to the second problem and a question that I think is the focus of this film: was it the intention to easily document this generation and these types of bohemians who (presumably) roamed Europe in the 1960s? ? Was the intention to criticize and lambast them? Or was this movie a kind of warning? My final assessment of the film (that is, finding something to save here) depends on this question. Regardless of these characters are really unlikely and therefore also hard to really crap about the plot or what happens to them. If this was some kind of statement to this generation, the movie becomes a bit more bearable. It's clear that Schröder is not a kind of geriatric Establishment place, so the way he goes about it has more weight than the countless stupid AIP films that play in or around the 60-year counterculture At least this movie has two things to offer - first, the soundtrack (obviously). I like the way Cymbaline is used here, and others mentioned it, because it's the front-line in the movie. I suppose if you're a Pink Floyd fan and want to see it for that reason, nothing you read here could stop you from watching it anyway (it would not stop me either). The curiosity to hear Pink Floyd in a movie can be enough to get you through this problem. <br /> <br /> Second, there is a beautiful landscape. Ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. Maybe I'm just tired of watching movies in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, but European films that take the time to show us Europe (the beautiful or the ugly - mostly pretty) - are always welcome. <Br /> <br /> But I really do not see any special genius here. No revolutionary camera work, not even a moral, a tone, a message, a sensibility or a conspiracy that has something new to say. Perhaps the only thing revolutionary about it was that it came from a guy like Schröder, a film that criticized a way of thinking that made his films at least partially marketable. So it's an honest movie; There is no glorification of the evil excesses of the 60s that you might expect. Indeed, the portrayal of the characters in this film accurately reflects the (in my opinion somewhat distorted) modern cultural memory of this generation. Oh yes, a bunch of (yawning) nudity and sex here; nothing new, if you look at such films from this period. I think it was considered new or provocative or something at the time. I do not find it offensive or nervous (I doubt you will do it too); it only extends the life of a lengthy film anyway. This particular use of sexuality in films of that time (especially in Europe) has become a cliché in its own way. But I think, in retrospect, you can not blame them. They were just able to "get away with it" in this decade, and I suppose that this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself was part of the life in which this generation was not as strange as her parents would be). <br /> <br /> Should you see it? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, sure ... I think it's worth a clock. In any case, The Valley is a better movie. I went into this movie and largely expected what I got. If you do not usually see these kinds of Arty avant-garde films and do not know what to expect, this will inevitably be annoying. This is a normal, healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a Pink Floyd fan, I'm not sure why you spend your time here. I noticed that a colleague who left a comment really enjoyed this movie. Maybe I just miss something. I do not need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions, or anything like that to enjoy a movie. But I need some sort of grip - I have to find something that appeals to a movie, and in general I have to sympathize with some aspects of the characters' plight (apart from some novel movie productions will work, camera work, etc.)). There's nothing here, except for Pink Floyd's splendor. Which is * just enough * to make it bearable. At least if you're a Pink Floyd fan, you can do something with Cymbaline, I promise.
