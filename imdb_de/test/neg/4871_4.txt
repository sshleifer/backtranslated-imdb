1. watched 25.02.2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): Predictable action thriller where a frequent moviegoer could guess what would come next. Charlie Sheen is the good old boy of the president who is simply not liked by the rest of the presidential staff. Of course he is involved in a situation where he is framed over and over again and he has a friend in the White House who is played by Sutherland, who of course does not stay that way for long. His other friend is a reporter, played by Linda Hamilton (who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role), and of course his biggest and best friend is the President himself (Sam Waterston), who, despite all the people, is up to End his buddy will otherwise be killed around him. Brainless and action-packed, meaningless offense despite numerous acting talents (all rather wasted).
