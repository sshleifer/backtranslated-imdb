The other Boleyn girl - should not be confused with the book it seems to refer to. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand how they changed or did some things. The book is not perfection, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make a little more faithful to what Anne Boleyn really was, but in fact it is not nearly historically correct. It's just fluff. Mindless, painted fluff. A real shame. <br /> <br /> At first, the author and the director seemed to think it was a good idea to stage the story like a reality TV show. Serious. They have the Boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing how REALLY they feel, what's happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confessional (not in the church but in the real world) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she just wants to sit on and smile about. She looks stupid when she has to use such a modern film machine in a fifteenth-century film set. It's "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after "The Aristocrats" and "A Turn of the Screw" I became a real fan of them. But she should never have been cast as Anne. I think she would have been a better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a bad choice. She is a good actress, sure, but she has very modern features and does not seem convincing in historical costumes. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the movie figuring out if she was "that girl" from "The Truman Show." She was too.) She's too old to play the youthful Mary, for some unknown reason Maria made the oldest of the sisters. It makes no sense, I know. It's as if the BBC seemed to forget that these people actually lived. They turn the story around and do things left and right. I think it's ridiculous to have to correct the BBC for historical inaccuracies, but REALLY! <br /> <br /> Apart from the two sisters, the rest of the cast was actually well chosen. Steven Mackintosh seemed to me a brilliant choice for George, and his casting was the real reason why I decided to go to the movie. Big mistake. He's doing a great job, sure, but he's barely there. How can anyone pretend to fit The Other Boleyn Girl and barely mention George Boleyn? That's just absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but once again he was barely in the finished product. <br /> <br /> The real problem is the script. You just can not get over that. It's bad. It is really very bad. It's too melodramatic and not appealing. Anne is depicted as an airhead, Mary as leader and George as successor. Maria's first husband is barely mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they just do not tell the story that Phillippa Gregory wrote. The whole thing looks like a big waste. I do not feel like seeing this thing a second time. I think I need to reread the book and hope the next year's Natalie Portman release gets a lot better. <br /> <br /> * Note: At the moment this is the only way to achieve this The miniseries in the US is on the final disc of the miniseries "The Six Wives of Henry VIII." This is a great miniseries, but can cost $ 50 to $ 60, and that's far too much if you're just looking for that rubbish.
