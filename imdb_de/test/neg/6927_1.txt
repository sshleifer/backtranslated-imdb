I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is wonderful. This movie is very far from the book. The book is great - this movie is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong and NEVER does anything to come back to anyone. That's the point of the book! It behaves as a "prince" regardless of the circumstances. When behaving like a princess, it is important not to become rude. It is honest behavior, no matter how you are treated. <br /> <br /> In the book she does a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after witnessing their kindness and ability to endure without feeling defiant and vindictive. Sara does what's right just because she's RIGHT. Outside the bakery she meets a beggar girl who is poor and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot rolls. She is very hungry. She gives this wild-looking girl, who is crouching outside the bakery's door, a roll. Seeing how greedy the girl is, and watching her devour the bun, she gives her another. She keeps going until she gives 3 or 4, I think - I do not remember how many. <br /> <br /> The baker looks through the window. She is so moved by what she has seen, she picks up the mendicant and teases her as her own daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara. <br /> <br /> And in the book her father died. The man next door is her father's partner - he was looking for her. Her father did not lose his money - the man is thrilled to find Sara; He takes her and Becky home with him and raises them up as his daughters. And of course Sara has all her inheritance. <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she stays in the same position at the school. But she is humiliated when Sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she has received. And Sara ends up talking to Miss Minchin - Miss Minchin tries to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a calm, steadfast attitude, telling Miss Minchin that she was cruel to Miss Minchin. She continues in her miserable existence. It does not matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her best friend in the world, Becky, is now her sister in every way. <br /> <br /> The book is about love and honorable behavior in the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. It is a wonderful book. This movie NOTHING to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted that she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to go through it. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can not for a moment think of a reason why the film should change this excellent book in such a bad way. Maybe it was the influence of the scary script from the book Shirley Temple played in. I do not know - but this movie is so far removed from the book in terms of character and values ​​that I do not recognize it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a father!
