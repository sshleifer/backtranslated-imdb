The usual disclaimer - I do not give movies starred that are harmless, bad, low budget and stupid, though they may deserve it. These films are often funny and rated 2-4 for their entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film art. This movie fits perfectly with this model. It's a Mexican monster movie interspersed with voice-over narrations and extremely weak special effects. The make-up is not so bad and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining, but this movie is almost as stupid as Aliens vs Predator and the script is not half as smooth (Aliens vs Predator could get a 1 of mine, but I want to see it again, before I commit myself). <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous but deliciously devoured. If you've read this far, you really want to know ... A group of remarkably unscientific scientists consists of the main characters. Most are heroes - somehow - but of course one is crazy and pretty perverted. This crazy scientist invents a ridiculous nuclear-powered robot (which looks a bit like Wizard of Oz's Tin Man, but has an inexplicable human face in his head). An Aztec mummy discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife happens to have been an Aztec princess in a past life (do not ask) is exposed to the robot for the grand "climax". The fight scene alone is enough To bring the most stoic movie observer in the stomach laugh on the floor, he laughs. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth given the budget and the complete stupidity of the script, this is a very entertaining, cheap fool monster movie. If you are interested in something, do it.
