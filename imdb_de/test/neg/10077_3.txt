(A possible small spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but stupid movie that did its job and was actually pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had some decent moments, but these were ruined by the lame ending of the movie, which ran amok in San Diego with a T-Rex. Well, in "Jurassic Park III", the little story that existed in the first and the sequel was thrown out the window and replaced with just 90-minute action without interruption, which would have done so poorly without the movie working. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as a dr. Grant proposed by a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to an island to help them son who has been lost for over 2 months. But this island happens to be populated by dinosaurs, and of course the plane they're on crashes and leaves a bunch of Dinos exciting ride, with no story, but even at this level, the movie does not deliver. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to take the little magic left over from the "Jurassic" films and squeeze life out of him. It's just standard fair and not very scary. The bottom line is that it's not a very good movie, even as a thrill. * of 4 stars.
