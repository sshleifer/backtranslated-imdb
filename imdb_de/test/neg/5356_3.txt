Normally, I would applaud a movie trying to do something different or original in a genre. It's obvious that this movie is a kind of parody of Ninja movies. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just could not. The jokes are not funny enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese films, and most of the time I like and understand the humor of these films.) "Red Shadow" is just stupid!) The characters portrayed in this film know that this is not the case for a serious movie and show that it's about the fun. Watch the characters of parodies like "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is straight-faced and never falls outside the character! And that's why certain scenes are funny and funny. In "Red Shadow" the actors never do it. The Shadow Ninjas should be very skillful and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors do not do their best to convince us of their talents. They do not do things with a straight face. The jokes would have worked better if they had! The bad choreography of the action scenes also affected the viewing experience for me. I like humor in martial arts films as long as the action is good. Red Shadow simply fails in this department. So what else is left to enjoy? Well, the music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be like the action that never makes it exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. The use of humor, lack of history and depth make me think that this movie is for kids. But I wonder if kids really would like this movie. Waste of time!
