This movie is an incredibly headstrong character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story. It was extremely painful to watch, and if I had not been attracted to John Travolta and the positive madness to buy the DVD, I would not have finished it. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing that resembles an interesting premise and seems to rely on a weighty (and honestly cumbersome) characterization. There is an altercation scene between Purslane and Bobby Long destroying a TV set that, when played, is incredibly limp and bad. <br /> <br /> I was less and less concerned with the characters than I saw it. It probably was a lot of fun doing it in relation to film school. But it is terribly boring to look at. An indulgent and demanding film school project for which you should not waste money.
