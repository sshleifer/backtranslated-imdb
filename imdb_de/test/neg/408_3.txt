Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Ron Howard has obviously something bad happened. I do not know exactly what, but something went very wrong. Howard has always been a decent director. Although he should never be confused with an artistic scholar, both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films, but Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons Prequel / Sequel The Da Vinci Code was a jolly trumpet. Besides, none of his films was downright horrible. (Note: I have not seen either the Grinch stealing Christmas or his newest film, Heidi Montag, No to Plastik.) Howard did more to maintain that quality is as ingenious as the star-spun Oscar bait ( A Beautiful Mind), the star-driven costume drama (Fern und fern), star-driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). Angels and Demons is at its center a badly directed and filmed film. Scenes are too dark, camera angles are wrong, the actors block each other and the whole thing is often blurred. This makes the story of an already confusing story even more confused. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is chosen a lot, but I found The Da Vinci Code for a fun, readable trump (so sue me). The film version of the Da Vinci Code remained unchanged where they will go next, adding an attractive cast and attractive filming locations. However, Angels and Demons is in the claustrophobic borders instead of the Vatican City and as Howard was not allowed to film at many real locations, we ended up with a lot of CGI back lot. The entire movie is as if Rick Steves had made a Vatican special. Instead of visiting the holy city and showing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second-hand handicraft that erased all his boobs. <br /> <br While the Da Vinci Code re-sues what I still consider to be a fascinating central mystery, the story of Demons and Angels consists of a conspiracy by the Illuminati (Now Rolling the Eyes) to destroy the Destroy Vatican. Her idea was to get the deaf around the world into positions and rape every student repeatedly. Oops my bad; Apparently the Vatican needs no help. Anyway, their plan is to infiltrate the Large Hadron Collider in Europe, kill the high priest, and steal three vials of antimatter. This raises more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider produce anti-matter? Can you capture the antimatter that was once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Maybe they are afraid of a Godzilla attack?). Why does the head of antimatter collect a Vatican priest? Once they have received the antimatter, they will use their incredible destructive power to conquer the world. no, I'm just kidding; Unfortunately, the Illuminati have not quite understood Pinky and the degree of brain intelligence. Instead, the current Pope has just died and it is final time. The most senior cardinals for the final four-pont tournament are all kidnapped, and the Illuminati kill them one after the other in the Seven style. They are good athletes, but with every murder they leave clues like a Latin American Riddler. Oh, and the last kidnapped cardinal has the antimatter, and if he's not found in time, Rick Steve's next year will have to go directly to Venice to see decent frescoes. If only there was a Latin-themed batman to save the day ??? Okay, the story is really terrible and badly narrated, but maybe this is one of those movies that have been saved by great performances. A true character study? (Okay, you know where that goes). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and just looks terrible (he's too old to play the character for about twenty years). His love interest The Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the pope's personal assistant / cabana boy as an Irishman who looks like he's about to break into a musical number, assuming nobody steals his lucky charm. SkarsgÃ¥rd is a good turn for the head of Vatican Security and as far as we are concerned know, were during the filming of this film, no deaf -born children raped, which make him in at least one area superior to the Vatican critics.
