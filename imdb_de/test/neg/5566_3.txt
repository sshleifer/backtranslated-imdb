The actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, are quite OK. Apart from that there is nothing to save on this film. Incredible bad behavior, stupid tears dialogues, much-anticipated conspiracy, a lot of inconsistencies and inconsistencies (for example, a pretty young girl is hit by a morning star in the head and she not only survives, but hardly scratching!) ... To be brief Because it's not worth it anymore, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
