This film is about a struggling actor who tries to find satisfaction in life, especially in regards to the love he has not known for 5 years. and he says wrong things all the time. The plot is hollow and designed. The main character James is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not sufficiently explored. It is rather an empty statement from which other negotiations originate. Sadness and disappointment after departure are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotion in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not funny as a comedy either. There are a few funny liners, but that's it. It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with a happy mood. I think "I do not want anyone eating cheese" funny.
