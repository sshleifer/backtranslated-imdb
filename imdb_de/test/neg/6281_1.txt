I felt like I saw an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director filmed it in his garden! There was no real conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Terrible script. <br /> <br /> Terrible spectacle. <br /> <br /> The worst production I have ever seen. A few bad CG effects and the rest of the movies were spent running around in a junk yard. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews in Movies One. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to lose time with this movie!
