This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> We're supposed to be and like an arrogant, all-knowing all-rounder, trashy bank robber played by Dale Robertson A timid tease played by the exceptionally beautiful Linda Darnell in a red dress of a fire engine. She must have been sewn into this top! <br /> <br /> A senator in the film says Native Americans and whites should try to come to an agreement, but the bigots win the day. I could barely sit in the endless dialogue of bigotry that emerged from the mouths of the other characters. Except for Wounded Knee and Dances with Wolves, there are few films that convey a positive image of Indians, and very few old Westerns do. This is exceptionally bad in this regard. <br /> <br /> The romance between Robertson and Darnell drove my teeth crazy as he rushed in and forced a kiss on her as she played the old, hard-to-play game. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are unintentionally humorous, like the characters, who obviously do not really ride in or on a stagecoach in several settings. <br /> <br /> An enigmatic humorous incident in the storyline, Linda Darnell's character is looking for long tickets to buy tickets for the Stagecoach, and then riding a horse for a reasonless reason a few minutes later. <br /> <br /> Another humorous scene is when the stagecoach begins to shriek Stop at the sight of a cowboy hat lying next to the road, and not only that, but then ALL passengers stack up to look. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
