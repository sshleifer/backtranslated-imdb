Legendary pop star Steve Alaimo ("Do not Let the Sun Weep") play a role as an unusual car racer whose career has hit the skids (ha ha) as he constantly crashes into his car (or when he complains, " I'm "tired of being shut down by any fat monkey who gets behind the wheel.") He falls into a bad circle of humorously inappropriate Nazi bikers, most likely called Jeeters, Banjo, Fats, and uh Linda He brought a surfboard to the back of the skull and now communicates only with grunts, a sort of Harley Davidson Leatherface. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Steve is fooled by the cops to keep the wicked rogue in the middle The gang robs only banks for "kicks, man." I think they're giving the money to charity, Steve is constantly falling out, the bikers are becoming greasier and slicker the whole thing never looks so brave because it is so boring. This movie looks like it was filmed through a paper towel soaked in grease. Not since "Necromantic" has a movie kicked my soul like that. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Fats directed Deranged, the biopic of Ed Gein with Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> In summary: Wild Rebels: Hilarious on MST3K, terrible everywhere else.
