It's a totally average movie with some pretty neat action sequences that make it look a little better and remind the viewer of classic van dam movies. Parts of the plot do not make sense and seem to save time. The final curve is that of a basic type that does not make the viewer guess, and any twists are obvious from the beginning. The final scene with the vial backs makes no sense as they are added and seem to be of little relevance to the story of van Dams character. not really worth seeing, a little disappointed with the final production, although it is obvious that it was recorded on a low budget, certain shots and sections of the film are of poorly targeted quality
