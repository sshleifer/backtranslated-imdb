As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can not claim to have enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the size of the novel requires a miniseries lasting several hours rather than a regular movie. It is simply impossible to record a significant number of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I do not like the scary flashback format. It was incoherent and for someone who did not already know the story, it was impossible to fully grasp it. I also do not think the filmmakers interpreted Copperfield's personality correctly. The idea of ​​him hanging around on a beach groaning about his life seems incompatible with the forward-looking, forward-thinking nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She looked more like a dumb household decoration than a strong woman. Dora, however, was perfect. This movie was full of problems and I'm waiting for someone to make a decent screen version.
