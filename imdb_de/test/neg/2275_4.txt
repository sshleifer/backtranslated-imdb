Okay, if you lower the production value, the ugly outfits and the big hair, this adaptation of the 90s version is still far inferior. Initially Ann Firbank (Anne Elliot) is literally ten years old to play that role, and her acting leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (who plays the same role in the 90s version) can express more in her big brown eyes than Firbank with her entire face in a four-hour production. Anne becomes an annoying, lamenting, boring character (and what about the scene during the "long walk" where she stops to utter poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa looked so much alike that I could only distinguish them when they were standing side by side (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! There was never a more disgusting character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth should be interested in her. She should be spirited and pretty and charming, not stupid and stupid with her ridiculous laughter, which is like nails on a blackboard. As she begins to sing, "To Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme," I started shouting, "Shut up, shut up, shut up!" The best part of the movie was when Louisa dropped her feet on the Cobb because I knew I did not have to see her in the movie anymore. Speaking of case on the Cobb scene; it was the poorly recorded, poorly directed and edited scene of the entire movie. How does a person fall down three feet, land on their feet and still be knocked unconscious? <br /> <br /> In terms of plus size, the figure of Elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90s version. They also added many more scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end. <br /> <br /> I admit, I bought this movie, even though I knew how substandard it was, but I'm huge Austen fan, so I buy every movie from one of their novels. Take a look at this step if you are curiously curious or appreciate the 90s version even more. <br /> <br /> In the end, this version can follow the letter of the novel, but the 90s version follows the spirit.
