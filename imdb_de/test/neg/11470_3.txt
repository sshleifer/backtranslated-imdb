I try desperately to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes left. If it gets any better, I'll come back here and let you know, but somehow I doubt this will happen. Solomon Kane looks as if it's based on the video game Dark Watch, and it sounds like the video game Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately both are not true. I've heard it's based on a comic or comic novel or pulp fiction or something I've never heard of before, but whatever it is based on, there's nothing original about this torturously boring movie. The atmosphere was stolen from the movie 300, which was not so great. The boring overacting is so serious that it's almost hypnotic, and to put it bluntly, I mean it in a bad way. The plot is practically non-existent: violent offenders who try to be non-violent meet friendly family, friendly family is murdered, violent offenders become violent again. All characters are stereotypes from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes or, anyway, just pick another Apocalyptic Slash Fantasy Slash magic movie you've seen and there you have it. Somewhere, somewhere, it was said, so I make a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, insert many slow-motion shots of horse's hooves splashing in murky puddles and snowflakes floating around, while two boring characters with each others are talking and oh yes rain is raining down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing really happens, and do not forget the black silhouettes that come towards us with fire behind them, burning a lot of torches and of course blurry battle scenes while it is not clear what really happens because we do not have the budget for the bloody special effects, so just throw the sound of metal clinking and let, oh, by the way, no character live long enough audience to understand them with them to connect or sympathize with them and keep their fingers crossed, hope fans of sword and sorcery fil even if it is a complete doo-doo, go directly to the video, not GO. , ,
