When I decided to watch a movie about cryogenic zombies ("kryonoids"), I did not expect much. That's exactly what I got and then less. Apart from a lack of special effects (squibs?) And a serious lack of acting talent, "The Chilling" also shows the absolute worst script I've ever seen in a movie. I had to pause the tape several times during the first 45 minutes to repair the damage inflicted on my intellect for seeing such hideous dialogues that exist here. <br /> <br /> Also, the character collection is so formulaic and one-dimensional it's ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know she is his "assistant" because he repeatedly calls her that title); the recently widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest in Blair's character; his criminal son; the alcoholic, abusive, unemployed friend of the Blair character whom we are presented in the most developed use of a flashback; and of course the rough, tough, bearded guard who becomes a hero. Obviously, the preservative liquid used by some cryogenics laboratories on their bodies is highly conductive, which of course leads to disaster. The containers of the laboratory end in a remarkable sequence of outdoor events during a thunderstorm (no less on Halloween night). As for the zombies themselves, if you like people walking around in green latex masks in aluminum foil suits, "The Chilling" is the movie for you. The zombie action is very weak in its best form; The zombies' primary method of killing seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death. The businessman and the security guard carry out most of the zombie battles, including an extremely exciting scene in which the undead are frozen again with liquid nitrogen. I tell you, the steelmaking scene in "T2" has nothing to do with "The Chilling" as it represents an enemy frozen in this way. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair stuck in the middle of this piece of dirt is indeed a mystery. Although her career in the 80s (unfortunately) has not just exploded, but this film is embarrassing. The script does not even have the decency to use it for a good cause. Her character usually gets shouting things like "Here they come," "Do something," "Hurry!". The only thing I can tell is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this film in food rations. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams, Dan Haggerty. In this picture, he faces a tough acting contest with his beard and safety dog, and he does his best to outdo both. <br /> <br /> The only frightening part of "The Chilling" is the introduction that comes up with the facts of cryogenics and suggests that "the movie you are about to see could be in your own community". When I counted the number of times a few names were repeated in the credits, I saw that Lucasfilm was suddenly credited. Luckily it was just for the sound production of the movie. 1.10
