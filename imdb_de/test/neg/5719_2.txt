Possible spoilers Since Peter Jackson has shown so brilliantly in his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it is quite possible to make good films, even big ones, in the heroic fantasy genre. The genre has differentiated literary precursors, which go back to the medieval chivalric romances, in particular the legends of Arthur, the Tolkien and other authors fall back. Apart from Lord of the Rings, it's hard to think of other sword and magic movies that are good. I agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard's "Willow," and even that made only a small difference, except that this movie was just a mediocre film, in contrast to a positive bad. However, Red Sonja can not make the even more modest difference of simply being a bad movie than a terrible one. <br /> <br /> Like Willow, many of the key elements in `Red Sonja 'derive from' The Lord of the Rings'. A wicked ruler seeks to gain control of an artifact with supernatural powers in order to achieve world ambitions, but is defeated by a number of heroes. The film takes place in the Hyborian Age, a barbaric era in the remote past of Earth. He begins with the villain of the play, the evil Queen Gedren, and makes the heroine Sonja unwanted sexual advances. When they are rejected, Gedren (no woman who rejects a no) responds by murdering Sonja's parents and her brother. (In 1985, it was probably still considered politically correct to not only make the boss villain, but also to make one of the main motives for her vicious, frustrated lesbian lust.) Gedren's next step is the capture of the talisman, one Type fluorescent green football with magical powers slaughtering the entire, unclad priesthood mandated with the protection of the priesthood, just as they want to destroy it because they feel too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonya's sister, her only surviving relative. Sonja herself, however, was not idle, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduated summa cum laude, and wants to avenge himself. On the way, she joins forces with Kalidor, a heroic wandering sword king reminiscent of Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the spoiled child ruler of a kingdom that has fallen victim to Gedren, and Falcon, Tarn's faithful servant. The rest of the film is fairly predictable as Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world through the out-of-control talisman. <br /> <br /> That's what makes film so bad? Well, acting for a start. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the typical typical wooden performance with poker games, which became a trademark at least at the beginning of his career, complete with a strong foreign accent. However, compared to Brigitte Nielsen as a heroine, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties by reciting each line in the mechanical, toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson 3 of a Teach-English-by-Correspondence course. One wonders if she has been hired for the role, just to make Arnie look good by comparison. The other characters, while not conducting their own private struggles against the English language, simply make cartoons, especially Prince Tarn, who has to be one of the most disgusting on-screen youth ever. <br /> <br /> An even worse mistake than the bad spectacle, however, is the almost complete lack of imagination of the movie. This is a particularly blatant mistake in a fantasy movie as films of this genre rely on their imagination to convince the audience to suppress the natural feelings of unbelief that would provoke a fantastic plot. If we look at Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can convince ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle-earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits exist and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of a magic ring we see "Red Sonja", we are convinced of nothing, except that we observe a group of actors with bad accents, who fight on a hill for the possession of a lime green football The fantasy even begins with the title of the film. British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss responded when challenged for the exotic names of his characters that it would make little sense to create a fictitious alien society with a distinct culture, if one wanted to call the hero Joe. (Granted, Tolkien got through <br /> <br /> by naming one of his main characters Sam, but that was because hobbits should be well-known, the Middle-earth equivalent of tweedy whistle-smoking Englishmen). Similarly, if you give the heroine of a story that is supposedly settled in a long barbarous age a common girl's name like "Sonia" (as the name "Sonja" is pronounced), it is equally appropriate to call her "Betty" or "to call Mary-Jane. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been made on a very small budget, so I wonder why they bothered at all. Fantasy has to be convincing or not at all. It was apparently filmed in a remote mountainous region, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture. The few buildings we see, such as the Temple of Talisman or the Palace of Gedren, are obviously cheap buildings. We learn that Tarn's capital was destroyed by the power of the talisman of Gedren, but we do not see this event. We only see a thunderstorm on the other side of a hill. At first you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow a whole kingdom with only a few allies, but if you see how small an army is that has gadgets, that becomes more understandable. If an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, one wonders whether the talisman is work or just a crew member unwittingly leaning on the set. If we can not enjoy this movie for anything else, we can at least enjoy it for its unintentional humor. a nice example of the bad, funny film school. Ed Wood would have been proud of it. If it had been shown the night before the recall on California television, Gray Davis would continue to be governor. 10.2.
