I've always been waiting for the movie to move, to inspire, to shake me, to make me feel sad, but it did not touch me. It just snaked up to the end. None of the characters seemed to be very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters were expressing more emotions. The only one who believed and believed was the veteran. He probably committed suicide to leave the movie as soon as possible. It was a waste of talent, film, time and mine. If there's any message, meaning, or genius in this story, it's probably well hidden, or I'm very dense, which I doubt.
