Considering that they wanted to shoot a vampire movie in space, I thought, "well, it's probably going to be rather cheesy, but at least interesting enough to see a different interpretation of the entire genre." Oops. I do not care what kind of movies you like; Even if you're the biggest vampire, horror, thriller, or suspense fanatic in the world, or if you've never seen a horror movie before and expect your first movie to be impressive in any way ... it's not correct. I do not think I have ever seen such a "for the TV movie" or a special after school. I've never seen a TV pilot so bad. I've never seen shots of sleeping or pooping animals, that's so bad. This is by far the biggest waste of hours that you could otherwise spend thinking about the importance of tea towels and their impact on your life. I would much rather spend weeks in a bathroom with nothing except my own urine and excrement than even look at a single clip of this movie again. When I saw that, I wanted the fate the characters fell on instead of knowing that I was paying for it. But it was like a train crash: so bad you just had to look around and hope something good happened. Did not Do It For the sake of God's love, even if you or your friends - even if you're using illicit substances - are even considering watching this movie, choose a contest instead to see who can continue firing a red rocket , It will bring you much more fun and entertainment.
