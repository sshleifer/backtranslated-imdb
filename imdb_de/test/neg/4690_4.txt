Respected physician James Coburn (as Peter Carey) approaches to accept a position as a pathologist in a Boston hospital. Almost immediately, Mr. Coburn asks the beautiful nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (as Georgia Hightower). While sleeping with Mrs. O'Neill, Coburn is awakened by an emergency resulting in a failed abortion-the fifteen-year-old bleeding to death is the daughter of the hospital's large donor, Dan O'Herlihy (as JD Randall). , Coburn does not believe the man was arrested.

As he tries to evict his friend, Coburn wades through a thickening plot. <br /> <br /> **** The Carey Treatment (29.03.72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
