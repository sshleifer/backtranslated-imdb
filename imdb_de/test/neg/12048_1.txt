Who the hell is responsible for this terrible rejection of one of my favorite books? That's just awful. terrible drama, terrible screenplay. The story is not even close to its old self - and what did you think? Robin Williams, for God's sake! This really contradicts the description. Do not take that seriously. Not even laugh. Especially not if you are a fan of the book. This could be the worst movie adaptation ever - everything is disconnected and confused - the characters that are important to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized, and every potentially interesting place in the book has been changed (example: Vienna - New ) York) in something deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book - it's essentially a fictional biography of a writer growing up, researching his writing, and so on. His mother writes an autobiography, which (despite her protests) is celebrated as a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, captivating and long. His prose is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film is about Robin Williams, who once again instructs us to use the day.
