<br /> <br /> I did not opt ​​for this movie because I'm a fan of US high school basketball (in fact I only watch NBA games), but because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman who owns it usually manages to bring him an impressive depth of his achievements. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. This was not one of the shining stars in Hackman's career. He had little to do with his fairness. When Norman Dale, the new coach of a basketball team in a small town high school in Indiana, was not called to do much to act. Basically, his job was to walk up and down the basketball edges, which were the referees. I did not find him particularly believable in the role, to be honest. I was also unimpressed by the required romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Honestly, there was no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never caught my attention and also the basketball action that was altogether too predictable. <br /> <br /> There were way too many problems with this movie to be worthwhile. I never understood how great the hatred that so many inhabitants of the city had for Dale, even before he arrived. The character development was bad and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and too little human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of kids shooting baskets do we have to see to understand this is a basketball movie? There was no tension: can anyone doubt that Hickory will win the big one? I realize that this is based on a true story, but I think it proves that not every true story should be a movie. Honestly, it was not a very interesting movie. Definitely a movie that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, not better than 2/10.
