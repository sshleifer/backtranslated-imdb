(This is a retrospective of the later English release of Disney with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and Co.). <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and having seen all the glowing reviews of this earlier Miyazaki movie, I wanted to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say about the quality of this film. These later films feature well-done actions, three-dimensional characters and the best film music since ... well ... at all. This movie just does not come close. <br /> <br /> Could also start with the positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this film is still very resourceful with a bizarre fantasy / science fiction scene in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also be far superior to other films of his time. (though not as nice and flowing as Miyazaki's later films) And the English language output is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... is not ... good ... The characters are all made of cardboard - from the saccharine-sweet little Nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians to everyone in between , If you saw each of them for 30 seconds, you saw everything. And the fact that the action is simple does not help. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music ... Well, Hisaichi is undoubtedly my favorite movie composer, but Nausicaa does not do it justice. Half of the music consists of 80s overdrive keyboards. Usually, she steps in and leaves her so abruptly that she distracts the visuals rather than helping them. I suspect very much that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of music before he even saw the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a great message in this movie, right ?! Let us all save the environment! It's a pity that this movie hits you like a sledgehammer. There is a scene where Nausicaa hugs a tree. Not really. I am not joking. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this movie is. But for some reason, all the other reviews on IMDb seem to love it. And if the characters have to talk to each other in extended sentences to say what's going on, that's lame. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who worship anime, enjoy the music of the 80s, and plant a tree Every day of the tree, you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, you save your money on his later movies because they rock big.
