If any movie ever made the Italians look bad, then that is. Duke Mitchell - what an A-hole. Duke Mitchell, I'm standing on your grave. Since virtually every person shot down by cowardly Mimi in this film is either black or of another ethnic or ethnic minority, it's hard not to be convinced that the guy ultimately owes his loyalty to the Ku Klux Klan or the skinheads , Awww, but he does not shoot the little black man in the elevator in the opening sequence, so he can not be all that bad, right? NOT CORRECT. Typically soft, sentimental triplets. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people can be impressed by this movie and admire even the bold, totally un-PC enthusiasm of the movie (it is certainly not shameless because of their own hatred) and the feeling of Self-Realization), but that does not change the fact that the main character Mimi (and subsequently Duke Mitchell) is a thoroughly abhorrent person who does not deserve a single iota of empathy or interest, especially considering Duke Mitchell is such a COMPLETE one BORE as a performer. But what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to celebrity (apart from this dog and a movie) was that he was a successor to Martin Martin?
