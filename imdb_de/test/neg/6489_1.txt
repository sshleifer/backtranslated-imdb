The real plot ... <br /> <br /> A group of prostitutes after the Civil War seek alternative accommodation in FORT BOOM. Lacy Everett and a tight family of call girls have been eating expired sausages for days, planning to move to former Fort McMillian. Locals warn the women against eating more of the outdated sausage. Because there is a vicious pyromaniac in the area and he refuses to bring them to the property. When they finally arrive at their destination, they discover that their stomach is full of gas after the whole sausage. It does not take long for them to find out why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
