Some of my colleagues have covered the plot elements of this movie, so I'll stick to a few cuff notes ... <br /> <br /> 1. That's entertaining - but not for the reasons you mean. It is cheesy, but somehow still to see. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest must be about thirty. The Christian girl who ignores Dan is much cuter. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole Mr. Spock's shirt. If my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I have to apply for a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Okay ... so apparently ... Dan is responsible for the divorce of his parents! What a terrible school trip is that ?! Muriel says that Dan's prayers have held his parents together. I thought that was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as often as I like, but the only way they stay together is when they decide they will. <br /> <br /> 5. I will reiterate the atheist's comments on how this film depicts non-Christians. Apparently they are all sloppy thugs. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. He gives the film a bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. He keeps this movie pretty much alone.
