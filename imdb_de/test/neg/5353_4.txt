There are other reviews that express similar views, but I still feel compelled to add my comments. The movie is generally well-made from a technical point of view, except it may be too long. Acting is usually very good, although Kevin Spacey does not give much room to explain his character's motivation (apparently more ambitious than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only role seems to be eye candy, which she admittedly does very well At a fundamental level, the heart of the film is in the right place to be against racism, and I have the impression that it has tried to be a kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed. However, it seems that the authors bit far more than they could chew (I did not read the book, so I do not know how much of it is in Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ultimately argues for vigilante justice. Apart from the fact that I disagree with this position, I do not believe that such an opinion really benefits the anti-racist cause - it is used more to liberate white defendants who kill black victims. In the end, the prosecutor asks the jury (and the public) to imagine that the raped girl is white - but follow that and imagine that the defendant is a white man who has murdered black rapists ... in the end, the message seems to be that it's okay to kill someone, as long as you hate him enough. It is also convenient that the slain man was portrayed as totally evil and his guilt undoubtedly existed, removing any moral ambiguity that is likely in a real case. Samuel L. Jackson does an excellent job, but unfortunately that also undermines the plot - he looks like someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe he's willing to hide behind some madness (and he does not when it matters). Presumably, we should think he is threatened with the death penalty, but in fact, at some point, he has claimed manslaughter, though you may wink at him. Why do not you accept it because you need to know that its release possibilities are low? Or if he wants to take a stand in court, why be insane? <br /> <br /> There are also fewer serious flaws. The medical experts on whose testimony the case is allegedly based are joking - both are discredited for implausible reasons, and none of them offers a true psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses say what they should say and that they should not be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still comfortable (and if he died?). I can hardly believe that the KKK would march down the street in broad daylight. Other seemingly serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) pass without a visible attempt to expose or prosecute them. And the scene in which the dog returns is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My last reaction is that I feel pretty dirty - as if I have to be a racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the film wanted to explore different points of view and the audience should leave the decision. If so, they seem to have forgotten it to the end. The film has made me think about my views, read what other people have been thinking, and add my own opinion, so maybe it was successful on some level - but I'm afraid it may be very illiberal in some people What I hope is the opposite of what he intended. <br /> <br /> Final thought - try to observe Law and Order. He handles these problems with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!
