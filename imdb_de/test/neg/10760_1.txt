Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once grew up with a light, sardonic touch of seductive material like "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", is down here. His direction is not only inappropriate, he has also sloppily adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; The results are cruel. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist who is framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, who chews the landscape, is a hot cop (it is certainly his most embarrassing performance). The only actor to show some life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about how he enlivens a bum script. Fad, choppy and cheap produced. NO STARS of ****
