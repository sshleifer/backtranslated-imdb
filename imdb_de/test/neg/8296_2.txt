Uggh! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s! What nasty and unsurpassed cartoons that these hacks have imposed on us! It's really a shame, because in the 1940s and 1950s "Hanna-Barbera" meant quality - because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, with the big cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, the cartoons generally looked pretty bad and budgets were cut. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never seen the original cartoons! So the team was unemployed in the late '50s and decided "If you can not beat them, join them" - and started producing horrible little cartoons yourself - with terrible animations, backgrounds and writing. <Br /> <br /> It's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy cartoons worked too well - they're rich with it, and they're the most prolific producers of cartoons of the '60s and' 70s. During this time bad production values ​​were the norm and a long list of VERY memorable cartoons was created. In this case, the amazingly bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE - a completely listless and stupid idea. If you want to know what the show is about, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> Lazy at the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids!
