This movie is very unlikely. Read the other reviews to learn why. <br /> <br /> I would say most of the characters were plastic, but they did not even indulge in the luxury. They look just like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to win real surfers for the surfing competition, so it's a shit if they can act. At least Occy did not give a damn and just went along. But "lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The one character who rang true was portrayed by Gerry Lopez, who did not really act, he was pretty much himself. He's used to stomping people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was that I put out a newsletter on my laptop when it appeared on a cable channel one night. That spared me to pay full attention to this silly little time-waster. In no case would I try to see it.
