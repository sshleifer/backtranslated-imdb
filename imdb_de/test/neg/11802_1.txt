Okay, they tell you it's real. They do not list scriptwriters or directors, but watching this movie will show everyone - it's not what you had hoped for. Speaking rarely sounds like real natural speech ... but also down, so you can not write scripts. (possibly loosely scripted). For me it sounded much more like they were always looking for ad-lib. (which they almost always did badly). Therefore, they knew that they made a "movie" and did not just collect real natural material. I'm sure these people knew what was going on, they knew that they had certain places to look for things that were set up ... and they were simply asked to be ad-libely interested in everything around them , <br /> <br /> ********************************************************************* ******************************** ******************** ****** <br /> <br /> Okay, it's so lame. Any object, point, or thing that could be weird or fearful is magically stumbled upon by these people. Let me list the ridiculously obvious fake things that I remember: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes when they enter the house, they turn on a light - the lights sparkle and a chandelier falls almost to a guy. <br /> <br /> 2) You find an old doctor's bag with a bloody butcher's knife in it while exploring the cellar. <br /> <br /> 3) You hear a noise a cupboard, so slowly open the door - BAM - a cat is just there and jumps into the camera while she yells. <br /> <br /> 4) Then they realize there's a hole in the wall, so let's put our hand in there ... wow, they pulled out a baby doll wrapped in mummy ribbon. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the loft, oh, it feels "heavy" here ... BOOM - a chair flies through the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no ! The girl, who was afraid of insects, had a ROACH in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Let's get the ouija board out ... oops, one of the planchette's legs fell off the side. That could not be because people were pushing, right? (They find out that a ghost is called Charles there) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that sound in the chimney ... CLINK - oh my shackles fell out "I think she kept the people up here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now, the wimpy girl will bravely look up the shaft ... oh, what does she see ... and ask people who are not looking up in the fireplace, what it is. SWISH - It falls off her right. (perfect camera shot) She is just moving in time. It was more chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate our planned rooms and every "cleaning" - would not it be something if now one by one these people would happen ... okay: <br /> <br / > CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly her room is shaking ... but no one is doing it. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 1: Actually to yourself "Charles, that's it." you Charles ... you can not be, because you're just a fantasy of my imagination, not you Charles. "Okay, what happens, he gets knocked over and pulled across the floor Another happy camera image. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hears things ... and tries to communicate ... and stands there and gets Abrasions or something. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 2: He was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter ... I can not remember what else. <Br / > <br /> 11) Dude # 2 is running, getting chick # 2 .. You hear chicks and guy # 1 screaming, you find them chained to a wall and tied to a table. (*) They go The final text tells us that they fled safely and were treated for minor cuts, and they had nightmares and sleeplessness since then, and we also hear the next day that a 911 call was made by calling a person named "Charles" . <br /> <br /> ************* * 'Major Spoiler' ********************** ****************** ******************* *********** <br /> <br /> Okay, when I heard that this movie was made, I could not wait. I thought it would be real. REALLY, really. - and more professional, with more professional people. I love the idea of ​​this kind of thing, I would like to see real haunting material. Before this movie was released, I've seen reviews from people online. They both said how wrong it was and how stupid the people were. Time passed. I forgot the movie. Then I realized that he was never shown in theaters. So I found out that it went straight to the video, it was rented ... and found that every brutal review was completely correct. It's a pity, I really wanted that to be good. <br /> <br /> Random thought: The house did not seem to have televisions, radios ... kitchen utensils that I remember ... that would make me think no you lived there for a long time. Especially the house is really known to be a haunting ... I'm pretty sure nobody lives there. But it looks so clean and tidy ... and what did a cat do there? The property is not close to neighbors .... All in all, you should only rent this if you and your friends are sitting there and want to make fun of it ... or if you want to have long heard of it and it fascinates you. (You'll be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or a real movie.) Random thought: I think the producer says "The" footage you see is real ". Well, technically it's real stuff, right? Real shots of fake gimmicks? Maybe that was his hole. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this movie a star just because they were telling the story of Madame LaLaurie. A real New Orleans story. <br /> <br /> The best performance was achieved by the man who initially instructed participants on ghost hunting equipment. He was obviously really ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
