That is the answer. The question is: what is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My name is Julia Ross". This is one of the best movies ever. Noir or whatever you call it, it's a very disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> She's also having fun in one of the worst studio releases of all time. That would be "The fault of Janet Ames". This one has a scary, promising title. It has a good cast. It has a good director. I expected something dark. Maybe something dry. Instead, it's an uninspired, routine espionage movie. It's pretty much a total bore. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is fascinating. And that's it.
