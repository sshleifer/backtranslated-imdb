I had a different experience with this movie - he never became charming, adorable or funny to me. A big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label did not give any indication of the languages ​​spoken in the film. another was the lack of choice of subtitles. <br /> <br /> I found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, as it almost always was. The wildly contradictory development of the weak conspiracy was puzzling. Were there characters or just vague gestures? Was there even a conspiracy? <br /> <br /> In another matter, I am asked to correct the spelling of "Dialogue" with the proposed replacement of "Dialogue". Maybe this movie in its entirety, including the IMDb part, is designed for puzzles or astonishment, but I get more annoying than amused.
