It was vowed to be a fast-paced screwball comedy and the best German movie of the year, so I tried, even though I've already seen some of Dani Levy's films - or at least parts of it. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy at all, unless you think heart attacks are funny. It's a good example of sloppy screenwriting with an implausible storyline and characters filled with stereotypes that are true but certainly not funny either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying character is that of Zucker's wife, Hannelore Elsner. She has to behave incredibly funny in order to keep the story going. For example, she does not know anything about Judaism, but for reasons she probably does not know herself, she comes up with the idea of ​​playing the charade, that she and her family are Jewish laws that Jews obey to her husband's family. and of the very orthodox and self-righteous diversity. To make things a bit more complicated, she invites the four of them to their city apartment because they are arriving from Frankfurt in Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance. This is not a 60-year-old businessman, actually no adult German would ever do. This gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still does not produce jokes. Sugar and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now a militant Orthodox - were once lovers, and he is the father of her daughter. Samuel's daughter - a nymphomaniac - talks about the gay son of Zucker. Is this supposed to be a kind of humorous parody of Jewish incest? It's probably just a thoughtless way to add "love action turbulence" that every screwball comedy needs. And of course it fails because of jokes. <br /> <br /> The praise for this film is purely political. Therefore, only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be "politically important" will enjoy them - even if "all for sugar!" obviously has no meaning. <br /> <br /> For everyone else: Do not look without "Fast Forward" option. I really missed it.
