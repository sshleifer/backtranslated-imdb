This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is located in a bizarrely subdued Midlands splendor called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the country's most boring place. It has a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university without students, a police station without criminals and a doctor's office with more doctors than patients. The storylines are grim - each episode is about a bizarre medical theme run by a multitude of grumpy extras who can never really act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up in the house to solve his problem. Pretty entertaining for its sheer comedy value, but I can not believe this thing actually disguises itself as a serious drama. Bonkers
