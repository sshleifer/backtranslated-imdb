It's been a long time since I and my wife saw such a boring thriller. It's definitely NOT a gripping story and it's so slow we almost fell asleep. This could instead be a TV crime series with a very low budget. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one in which Mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red dress or another mafioso can not stop thinking about her and so on. Okay, maybe this should be a romantic thriller, but believe me you really miss nothing. We gave 4/10.
