I saw this movie because of the good reviews and I will not make that mistake anymore. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes show that a group of people brought together by a tragedy did not see what it is flashback 12 hours and we see the boring life of these people who are ultimately completely meaningless for that what will happen. When the end is finally praised, you find that you have just spent an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that is not happening and that means nothing to what you've just seen. The only connection these people have is that they all had a "bad day" - but even the continuity loses a complete failure in boredom.
