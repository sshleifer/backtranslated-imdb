This only applies to Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy does not mean that this is more than a B-movie. The script is awesome, it just meanders to ridicule crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face to meet neither. <br /> <br /> First, is there 30 minutes of unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war? The guy is playing basketball someday ... How can you treat your audience more? ... This jail time is boring, unconvincing and can easily fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Back in the US, the guy is considered a "war hero" for no real reason. Of course, he is quickly forgotten by the public and seems to stumble into all kinds of crazy mishaps. Or are they really? We will find out soon. Yawning. There are annoying stereotypes: his sick mother, his little daughter he never meets, a high-end whore who falls in love with the hero, etc. It's very strange how this movie constantly changes from tragedy to slapstick in an instant , Does not work at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is just a bad comedy that is detrimental to prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian, played in a couple of good movies, and died of MS, that's no reason not to get annoyed by this stupid, unconvincing, listless comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be thrilled reading 3 hours of Dadaist poems.
