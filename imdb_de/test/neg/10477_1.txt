I've seen this DVD on sale and bought it without hesitation, although I did not know it came out as this is one of my favorite books ever. As soon as I got home, I ran to him and looked at me completely disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (ie, Finny seems more of a pompous jerk than anything else, while Gene seems more like a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or changed altogether (eg Lepper), many characters are missing and famous lines / thoughts absence. The film tries to convey a feeling that was missing from the previous one, but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat-boring movie. It is the depth of the character and the feeling that makes the book a classic, and this film takes these things with them and destroys them completely when rewriting.
