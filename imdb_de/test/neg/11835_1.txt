Why is not this movie among the 100th? Raptor is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my fifteen years. I've never experienced such a catastrophic mess before. Absolutely everything is unpleasant and cheap. <br /> <br /> Nobody in the cast offers a decent performance. The dialogue is completely incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can not help but wince when I remember some of his lines, like "In or Out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Her friend is not a very good poker player, she has just lost her hand." <br /> <br /> The birds of prey are a joke. Even I could create more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers shamelessly did. It is an insult to the actual Velociraptors or to every dinosaur. Not only that, the killer scenes are too cruel even to me. I do not seriously believe that these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces on the floor just to make everything look fresher. In addition, the blood and guts are useless if you can see the deaths from many miles away. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Perhaps the filmmakers did not expect anyone with a touch of intelligence or intellect to ignore the bad filmmaking, to stumble upon HBO late at night about this movie, as I did. If I could say anything to anyone involved in this film, Quote Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Try to show some respect."
