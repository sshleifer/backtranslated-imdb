I'm speechless, frankly, I can not understand how someone could fit in with a script like this, or let anyone act in the movie, let alone direct it. The fact that I am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers. This film should rather be thrown in the bin than to be tested. I'm disappointed with Flex Alexander that I even thought of accepting such a bad EXCUSE FOR A SCRIPT, let alone the role. OH MY GOD! I think I just insulted the word "essay" ... uh, I did it. You know, the less said about this thoughtless chatter, the better. They were warned, nobody warned me that I had to experience the horror myself. WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK.
