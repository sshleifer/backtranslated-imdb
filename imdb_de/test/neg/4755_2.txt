I really do not understand how this movie here on IMDb could reach a rating of more than 4. It's just a huge mess, and I have to admit that I really liked AvP 1: Almost no story, okay, I can live with that, but at least they got to the point pretty quickly. AvP 2 not. After presenting the stupid premise, for over half an hour there are stupid and inappropriate teenage clich√©s, stupid dialogues, and almost nothing except a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse for the first half of the movie and Predator scenes where you're wondering if the guys who did the movie even saw another Predator movie or just were not keen enough to get bothered. <br /> <br /> After that, the bastard arrives at the stage point where the Predator attacks the aliens, or at least pretends to do so. And boy, is this Predator stupid, blind and deaf. It is terrible. How he even managed to earn the stuff he has is unclear to me. He misses almost every shot, aliens notice only when he is in his face or when it is absolutely necessary for the script so he can move to where he needs to be. He is even surprised again and again by crazy teenagers and deputies. What should this guy be? After the first hour of this atrocity I shook my head more or less constantly at every scene. Almost no scene in this film comes past without incredibly stupid dialogues, stupid Predator actions or stupid flaws or stupid actions of our "heroes". <br /> <br /> Then the thing ended. To my surprise, not only did not I and my friends know whether to laugh or cry, but all I heard as they left the room half cried and laughed halfway over the one and a half hours they were wasting , <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention. Never.
