Let us clarify one thing; That was bad! So Putrid, that it is not even qualified to memorize someone's memories. <br /> <br /> The repetitive act (which is constantly reused by using not only jokes but also storylines and character features); Sue (the mother) opens the episode and quotes how she loves her little son, but smells awful (as if that does not get old! Har-de-bloody-har!), Some Australian quasi-nationalist "Bogan" looks up - seems to say how she thinks she's great because she's an Ozzie, while all / all others are not sucking before they disappear for the rest of the episode. (a small mercy) <br /> <br /> The rest of the conspiracy revolves around the father (Gary), who gets into some sort of disagreement with Sue and him, who ask members of his band for advice on how to solve it should. <br /> <br /> The phrase "Words fail me" is an old sentence, but here it is most honest to say. It is so bad! So terrible that I want every trace of its existence to be sent to the deepest depths of the North Sea and life to go on. <br /> <br /> However, it makes me sad to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good actress, I like her) make an idiot out of herself, Ardal O Hanlon (next to my hero) the ability to be quite funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, who stands out for so much good stuff, somehow manages to figure this out ... then what comedy is in very serious trouble!
