I liked the movie somehow, it's just that the characters walk around and have no real sense of their craziness. As I said, poor goat. The goat closed as the guy pretended to grind it. I would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the ones with the goat). Jane Ryall, who played Celia, just shot this one movie. She was very naked everywhere. This crazy couple, who has killed and tortured many people, landed in its rightful places. I almost forgot the gay transvestite couple who are also selected as sinners. If you like crazy things on the wall, this is your movie. 3.10
