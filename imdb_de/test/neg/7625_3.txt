weird.this is a TV movie, but the rating on the box says it was rated R. There is nothing in the film that could qualify remotely for an R rating. The idea was good, but nothing was done with the storyline. It just was not developed. It's a bit scary and the acting is really good, better than the movie deserves. There have been other films that have had the same concept that was done better than this one. I have not seen too many Wes Craven movies so I can not compare it to any of his other films I think it's poorly designed and poorly executed. For me, I can not give Chiller a rating higher than 3/10
