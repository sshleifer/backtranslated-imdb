The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like Scream and I know what you did last summer, this movie is familiar with the conventions of this kind of horror movie and comes up with some good lines and scenes that play on those conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just boring. The plot is your basic Ten Little Indian with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. They know from the beginning that each of the characters will be cut down until only the hero (s) defeats the evil. And that's exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. Production values ​​and drama were okay, but I had no motivation to watch until the end (though I did) as I already knew how the final scene would evolve. The end surprised me a little, because he had managed to literally run out rather than throw out a bucket of special effects. Maybe the budget for special effects was exhausted in the end.
