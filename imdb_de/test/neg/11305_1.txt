I know that it's pretty unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete track - but I'll do it anyway! I was waiting for a laugh, I tried to give time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait for a laugh in a comedy. My laugh never came, so I gave it up. <br /> <br /> It's stupid humor, not so stupid that you have to laugh. It is not nearly as high. Let me correct that, it's just * stupid * - not stupid humor. They certainly determined that certain scenes should be funny, but they were not. If you are really bored, you could somehow merge the movie with a hallucination and have a mild conversation. <br /> <br />
