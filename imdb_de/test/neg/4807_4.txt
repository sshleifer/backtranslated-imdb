I'm a big fan of prison dramas, which shows up in OZ as my favorite show in the US. I think the charm lies in a kind of smug voyeurism that wants to see bad things happen to bad guys but I thought Don Seal's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 was pretty disappointing. Okay, I knew that since its completion in 1954, there would be no bad language, no graphic images and no rape, but it is still a rather weak film compared to the prison portrayals in earlier films like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the preaching tone of the film, with the insurgency Dunn being something of a prison reformer. Yeah, that sounds ridiculous, because he's a violent antihero and not some slender, hugging tree that makes salary payments, but that's what he essentially is. He wants prisoners rehabilitated to return to society instead of suffering. There is also a problem shooting a B-movie with such radical themes (quite ironically that Siegel would later do DIRTY HARRY, where the only good criminal is a dead one). That said, the cast with Emile Meyer as guardian is not very good especially irritating in his performance. as I said, a disappointing movie
