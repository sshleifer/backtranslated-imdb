The only puzzle in this movie was how it was done. The British film industry has to make films that people really want to see and not that they get the taxpayers' money (a'la BBC) to keep Luvvies in their usual way of life without doing anything about it. The film was all wrong at British Films, it was based on clich√©s, it had to be a London where people were either posh and corrupt, gangsters, luvvies or gawd blimey gelled eels Guys, the story script was just pathetic. As the policeman pulled out his phone and the ringtone was "Sweeney," I just expected it. The whole movie was a happy buyer of sweeney / Minder rip off. <br /> <br /> The priceless manuscript that I found was left behind a few times and lost and is itself something that even I with my restricted street would not carry anywhere in my breast pocket, to the beach and to the Fighting etc. To say that Vinnie Jones is sympathetic, which is about the only thing in the movie, poor guy. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi finally went into the water because he was Dickens, oh my god, what a lot of crap, and I'm positive here
