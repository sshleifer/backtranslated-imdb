Worse than the incredibly boring "exorcism of Emily Rose". It started decently, and until the mother said to her father, "Look, I knew she was obsessed," I told you so. It was a terrible line that was spoken badly, and it indicated the swift death of this amazingly bad movie. Each family member has a past problem with the priest. The father accuses everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her, killing his climax and killing his buddy. People are dying, others are getting possession and at this point most viewers are no longer interested. Apart from her employee Miguel, none of the characters in this film were really likable, so it's difficult to take care of them. The acting was terrible and the writing even worse. I'm glad I saw it for free. although I feel like someone owes me so bad for a movie that I lost it.
