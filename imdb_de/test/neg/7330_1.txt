Well, there is not much to say about this film. it's just garbage. very bad acting, bad script and lame story ... well, the actress (I do not know her name), the main role played (not the blonde, but the latina), was good, but the blonde played the girlfriend of the main character "Their acting level is like a high school game, like most other actors in the movie. Also zombies, very bad acting. and, history itself really does not make any sense at all. If you are really bored and really have nothing to do, but somehow want to kill time, you may want to watch this movie, but maybe there are still millions of better B movies than this crap. his total waste of money and time.
