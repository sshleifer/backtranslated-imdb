The terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe's horrible first movie. It consists of a group of soldiers going to a zombie-infested college campus to find a specific blood type that could help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical lambs to slaughter, and none of them are so boring (or at least not very interesting) that you will not feel any sadness in the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of. The movie has the typical zombies that bite people and blood spatter. It even has the same chewing on the innards. It just does not do anything for the zombie genre to remember. And the highlight of the story is more anti-climatic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can plunge into an army of zombies and not be bitten (for they are the main stars who seemingly master the escape) while others seem to find it easy. The only motivation of the film is to show people how to get something ... nothing else. Watch a Romero movie for a lasting impact.
