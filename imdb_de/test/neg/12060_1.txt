1. watched 19.07.2003 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculously paralyzed 3D movie that follows the plans of many 80s Slasher films pretty much. Stupid children go to a well-known murderous campsite, are chased by an unknown masked man, and then we try to find out who, if anything, will live. We really do not care who is behind the mask, but even that is not hard to find out if you've seen such films. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite some decent 3D effects.
