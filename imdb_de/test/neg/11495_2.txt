I've just seen Icon on DVD and although it's a great book, the film is a weak substrate. Those responsible for writing should be banished to Siberia. It's completely inexplicable to me why they abuse the great story with all sorts of C-movie offshoots that are completely irrelevant to the story. <br /> <br /> But the filmmakers and performers do the best to make a difference, but in the end, the film was not satisfying at all. <br /> <br /> Can someone please make a decent movie to show how it's done? I'm sure the masses will rise for such a novel that's turned into a book, not a cheap C-movie.
