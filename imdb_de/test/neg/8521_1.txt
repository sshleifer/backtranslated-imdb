You're Dead is an indescribably terrible attempt by a British gangster movie. It has no original idea, a cruel copy of various elements of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The play and the dialogue are absolutely unbearable, the action is ridiculous and absolutely predictable despite constant attempts to do something. There are some good performers, but they are out of shape and can not do much with the terrible stuff they work with. It is absolute torment to sit by this jerk.
