Perhaps we are attracted to big glasses when we hear that antiquity was put on display. Maybe we expect too much from these films. However, if we as a viewer are offered too little, what happens then? <br /> <br /> That's what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, part of the production series about the Roman Empire. AUGUSTUS by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM movie, at least contained Peter O'Toole, but what does this movie contain? <br /> <br /> Hardly accurate. The historical mistakes are so grave that the film changes the facts and represents rather a distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true story. Throughout the film, we see Nero Young: young man during the supposedly long reign of Caligula, a young man during the reign of Claudius, and finally during his own (historically 14-year) reign. And ... he dies the same way. According to the film, Nero, who was born during the reign of Tiberius, has been living for more than 40 years, but seems to be in his late twenties when he dies ... Continuity related to fictional history is the film's biggest problem it's hardly logical not to say reliable. Nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. At this time, his mother Agrippina is exiled from Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly married Emperor Claudius, who already has large children and is married to him fresh Messalina. In these moments of the movie we see Acte (Rike Schmid), Nero's lover. Alright, it's historically "accurate"; No source proves, however, that it played such a crucial role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a devout Christian, but also a witness of the Pauline miracle (he brings a young girl Marzia back to life). Moreover, there was nothing historically comparable to Nero's at the court of Caligula since Nero was born in Caligula's four-year reign (A.D., 37-41). I understand that movies can change something, but such a mistake makes the script absolutely unsafe! And many, many other shortcomings in terms of content that are hard to enumerate, but after 30 minutes of watching this movie, I doubted if I saw a historical movie or a total fantasy. As far as his artistic characteristics are concerned, they provide us with entertainment, they are just as lame as the story here. The performances are artificial, the performers have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. Maybe I'm too tied to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead role, but Hans Matheson does not fit Nero at all. He could have some of the good moments as an actor, but never as the infamous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises his love for his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for "alleged justice"? None of these. He is just a young man who can not govern and in the long run begins to release the fire that burns in him ... John Simm is out of place in this film as Caligula and other depictions of the character. Elisa Tovati is sexy only as Poppaea; but she could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets are not astonishing. Low budget leads to low effects and consequently to low maintenance. <br /> <br /> But what annoyed me most in this movie, and I give it 1/10, are some moments that are totally unacceptable: <br /> <br /> - the death of Poppaea and St. Paul's conversation with Nero on her body, <br /> <br /> - Claudius mention of Britannia's recent conquest of the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia, while Messalina his wife was long before his death.) - Tigellinus killed Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother, - Nero's arguments in the speech to the Senator, <br /> <br /> - finally Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide leading to a morale of Acte has been said: "Let's forgive him" <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is a waste of time and as a further production of the Roman Empire absolutely unnecessary.It is better to make a good movie in 30 years than ten small children in five years, 1/10 - should not have been done at all.
