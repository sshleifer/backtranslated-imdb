This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that EVERYONE was in the air, and this comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". <br /> <br /> My wife loves to see reality shows - and there was an episode of this trolling, where wannabes had to go for a walk. The end result was directly from Monty Python's sketch "Ministry of Silly Walks". I could not laugh enough. <br /> <br /> And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (like laughing up to ...). She must be the most annoying woman on television since Rosie O'Donnell left The View. As if modeling would make a big difference to humanity. You're welcome. I've never found her attractive, and I do not think she's intelligent, now that she has the enormity of opening her mouth. Someone has to tell these human hangers that he should eat healthily look like real women.
