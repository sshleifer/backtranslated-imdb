This came from an adult who happened to encounter the first movie that was expecting a child-oriented movie, and was surprised at the humor of adults in Emperor's New Groove. The character I liked most was Kronk, and I was thrilled to hear about the sequel (sp) with "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just saw Kronk's New groove, it took me two days to turn it off, so I got bored halfway. The rest I finally saw the next day and unfortunately the second half was just as lame as the first one. As a Disney movie, I had expected some musical scenes, however, filled with them and they were not amusing. The great thing about Emperors New Groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. Honestly, Kronk's New Groove did not care for me or my girlfriend, and we both loved it. It's really geared up for little kids, the comedy is pretty childish, the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely trite. <br /> <br /> definitely not worth a second visit. I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how together this movie was. They have actually managed not to make fun of a character (Kronk) in this movie, which in itself is amazing. <br /> <br /> Of course, every opinion is different, but I am very slightly amused. When others discredit them, mainly because I loved the first so much, I needed more characters and no matter how bad the plot was, I would watch the movie enjoy. I can not say the same thing for this, I never thought that I would turn it off halfway out of sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy at own risk.
