This movie was so predictable and badly played. I really can not recommend it to anyone, not even for inadvertent laughter. It's just bad. It's a hell of a TV movie hell, the cast does not seem to be that bad, but they look awful. Just stay away from this movie and rent something more intellectual like porn.
