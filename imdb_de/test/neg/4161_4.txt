We are in the not too distant future, globalization seems to have peaked, languages ​​mix (though English dominates the rest) into two zones: the valid and the non-valid ... a beautiful new one World (in the style of Aldous Huxley), where humans are genetically anchored and blood relations are strictly prohibited (for health reasons - this is Code 46 of the title). In such an environment, two souls fall in love, who are destined not to meet. In Winterbottom there was an important story with a lot of potential. A nice recipe, which he ruins and gives him such a slow rhythm, tells so tired, removes emotions ... cold, that's all Code 46 transmits. Cold and bored. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play their roles wonderfully), nor the visual and tonal capabilities of some sequences can contribute anything to the saving of the film. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Code 46: What could have been and has never been. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
