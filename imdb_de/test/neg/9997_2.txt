Terrible, terrible, terrible times, one-hundred does not begin to describe how crappy "Biggest Loser" is. Imagine: Take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them and let them work to lose weight, all on prime-time television. Am I the only one who thinks that this is not something that people with IQs in the three-digit range WANT TO WATCH have? Everything goes away forever, and the lumps of Schmalz neigh about how losing weight will mean so much to them and their lives. Is anyone interested? Do you think that's important to us? Do you care if we are interested? Probably not. I think I'll make videos myself, make crunches, and sell them to a big television company. If this is true for television, then my workouts too!
