I speak badly of G.I.J.:T.M. especially because I think there was something missing that G.I. Joe had yes, it had something that G.I. Joe did not have any celebrity cams from Don Johnson and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The Movie had no passion for the characters that the G.I. Joe had television series. Most voice-over artists really sounded as if they were dead, and they would die anytime now. It's a good movie, but I would not say it was the greatest movie in the world. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built on it, I would say that Serpentor, who beat Herzog in the chest, was not the best way for Charlie Adler's character to go out. Golobulus also did not remind Cobra Commander why he was chosen to lead the Cobra forces and then mutinied terribly after failing to deliver what Cobra-La rightly considered them to be for the GI Joe series to go out, but it is better than nothing. :)
