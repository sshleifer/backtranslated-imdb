I'm really sad that this is the first bad review I ever made for a movie ... EVER. ..a downgrade. The first is Open Water, which just did not make sense. The Next Karate Kid had no mention of Daniel (please correct me if I am wrong.) And that end line was a shock. It was like, "When fighting must ... win." then it showed the bird flying around and the panpipe was playing, and I was like, oh. Okay, it will take a while for the next part. And then the credits hit the screen. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! I hope I will never have to repeat a movie badly again, I apologize for those who like The Next Karate Kid.
