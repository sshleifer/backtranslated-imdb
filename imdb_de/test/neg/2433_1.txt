I can not believe this show was alright. First of all, J.P. Manoux gets a terrible job for David Spade and Pacha's voice is too deep compared to John Goodman. The title song is so annoying and the acts of the episodes are so stupid !!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of time. Half of the episodes are copied from the movie. In my opinion, The Emperor's New Groove was one of the best children's films in years, but they were completely ruined by Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should watch such shows as Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible, but not this show.
