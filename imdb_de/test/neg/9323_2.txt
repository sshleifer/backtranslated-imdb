I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite films. But some horror movie fans were in a premature uproar when their original version of the EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION, which you're reading about, it turns out, was discarded by Warners) and replaced as Renny Harlin by spruce and do a new version that was "scary". In my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and were automatically juiced because they hated Renny Harlin's attitude (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first movie was even made for them. And I have to know. because I myself went into the theater premiere of BEGINNING with folded arms and prepared myself for the worst, which I was sure. Imagine my surprise when I found Harlin's BEGINNING much more serious than I could ever have imagined, with a good performance by Stellan Skarsgard as a young version of Father Merrin struggling with his belief in God. It was by no means a great movie, but it was nowhere near the garbage I had been preparing for. <br /> <br /> Well, now I've finally seen the true rubbish version - and it's Paul Schrader's DOMINION: REQUIREMENT TO THE EXORCIST. It was relentlessly talkative, uninteresting and bland. Stellan Skarsgard's troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been in Harlin's film, and the actor himself was not so good in that role. For anyone who has pointed out the obvious CGI effects in BEGINNING, you know what? You are also here in DOMINION. Do you remember the stupid ending in Harlin's account (which I agree with letting the rest of the movie spoil)? Well, you'll find that this end of Schrader is not much less lame. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I dislike the nonsense presented by those who appreciate this movie better than Harlins by saying that we do not "retards" or "subtle films appreciate ". As a person who abhors Stephen Sommers' 1999 MTV-style MUMMY and is a real fan of the very impressive and discrete old horror movies of the 30s and 40s, I can assure you that this is not the case for me. At least there was "a measure" of terror and exorcism in Harlingen's BEGINNING; This is just a real exercise in boredom and a big challenge even for the most certified insomnoses. It will be quite interesting to hear horror fans trying to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST was as good as they had decided in advance; Just when they were ready to beat Harlin's BEGINNING, they learned when Paul Schrader's name was soaked with the white-out.
