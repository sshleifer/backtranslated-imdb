I saw this movie just because it was another David Dhawan entertainer. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Comeback by David Dhawan.he has made many funny movies in the past that did not make sense, but none of them was a crap bag !! What a waste of talent and beauty was it? Donno why actors agree to make this movie. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there was no sense of the practicality standard and potential that Bollywood has. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth watching in this movie was Katrina, but we do not have to watch a movie like this to see it! As a remake of the Hollywood movie Hitch, it is clear that Bollywood directors can not even make a real remake. I think that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Terrible 1/10
