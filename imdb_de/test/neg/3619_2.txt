Snake Island is one of those movies that, while you're sitting and watching its amazing stupidity, makes you wish the movie camera was never invented. The real reason why Plan 9 From Outer Space will stick to his honorary title Worst Film Of All Time for a while is not so much about how bad it is. It's because of the fact that it's the most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see. Snake Island is the other kind of bad. Snake Island is just so bad that it is agonizing. A stupid premise combined with a script written by monkeys, with one-touch typewriters tapped on transparencies, which then overlapped to resemble the dialogue to solve the most obvious problems. Filmed entirely on location in South Africa, the environments in which the film plays are about the only element that can truly be considered well executed. Many snake shots consist of close-up shots that look so unreal that you begin to wonder if the snakes are CGI dolls or real snakes fed on really hard drugs. William Katt-Stars, if you can call it the author who drives to an island that seems to be a river ferry. Along with him is an assortment of very generic, poorly defined characters. It's all a matter of random typing, who survives to the end, but Katt certainly seems to consider firing off his agent. The rest of the cast seems to come from the Home And Away drama school, where any contemplation of an uncomfortable action point is accompanied by an open mouth gaping in all directions. The Foley effects are often worse, with a memorable scene in which a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that firearms accompanied in games like BioForge. In the meantime, snakes are constantly exploding or randomly jumping around. It would have been more accurate to call the movie "Snake Holocaust". Of course, no horror movie or Z-class sci-fi movie is finished today without unnecessary scenes of naked women in a disheveled state. As every woman in the cast has almost undressed, the movie begins to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst piles, everything in this case is really a lot of settings with no real profit. The sex scenes will never happen, and the death of characters is so shallow, so uninteresting, that the entire movie becomes pointless. Unless you want to watch William Katt walk through a spongy forest with ill-fitting cricket equipment, crashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat. Not for the log. I always thought that Anaconda is the worst movie ever made about predatory snakes. I was so very, very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake to worry about if she had suspended the disbelief for some time. Some of the snakes that are shown to defeat humans are no larger than the laces of some Combat Boots pairs I wore. <br /> <br /> So far, we have the bad horror movie checklist that works well together. The unrecognizable, lame voices as well as bad audio and visual effects are taken into account. The dialogue is so miserable, so bad, that during some school games I played many moons ago, I saw better writing and transmission. Wherever Snake Island faltered in this regard, the area is unfortunately fatal for all bad movies. Essentially, it forgets to be so bad that it's funny. It's so bad that after the opening credits, it stops being good, and it gets painful as soon as the cast starts talking. Compared to William Katts appearance in Snake Iceland Jon Voight's appearance in Anaconda was as Oscar-worthy as Russell Crowes in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors, but with such a material it's hard for you to say a word of your own. Listening to some of the lines here was like the victim of a violent crime. The mind tends to block out the experience that serves primarily as a self-defense mechanism. Due to the above-mentioned failure to be entertaining, I gave Snake Island two out of ten points. My special rating for films that are so bad that they can not possibly be good, but not bad enough to entertain them. It's all so boring or pointless that you could just as well watch the test pattern. The correct way to spell "crap" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
