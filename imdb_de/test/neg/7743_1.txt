And the title says it all: a cheesy-sounding title that portrays a cheesy-sounding joke of a movie called "Alien from L.A." is known. Why do not you just call it "Alien from South Africa", as this was the place this movie was filmed? My advice to watch movies shown in "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" I do not see in the original version of the movie! Period! Always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen. A man is trapped in space with his two funny, cleverly cracking robot friends sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. It just seems better that way. <br /> <br /> movie as it was originally seen: Awful! Movie as seen on MST3K: Genius!
