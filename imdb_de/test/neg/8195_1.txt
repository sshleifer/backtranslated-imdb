I remember watching this movie a few years ago on TV. It was so bad that I can only remember the scenes where I just had to die laughing. The only plot summary I can give you (without spoilers) is the image of a home movie made by college kids who were tall. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert Starts Here ...) When the movie starts, a guy is running, to be hunted by the "Demon Cop", though the man was actually hunted by a Halloween costume that went wrong. A car jumps out of nowhere and hits the guy who ran. He lets him fly over it, and what does the driver do ??? Watch the man fall, get back in his car and drive away. What kind of hair-brain-dolt would that do? At least I would have asked if the guy was okay. <br /> <br /> Then a black guy stares straight into the demon policeman's face and later tells reporters, "I did not get a good look at him." My sisters and I almost choked with laughter. <br /> <br /> Then there is a scene in an alley where this girl with an Afro pulls a machine gun out of her teeny. Weeny small handbag. It could not possibly fit! I can barely remember certain scenes. Maybe because they were just so bad. Cops in the movie can not even jump a fence, and the acting is so wooden that wood planks look like better actors. <br /> All in all, this movie is a shame for Hollywood, much more than any other flop. You have to see it to believe its juicy, cheesy plan, which, as far as I can tell, has none of it.
