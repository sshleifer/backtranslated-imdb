I love oddball animations, I love many Asian movies, but I did not love this special product from Japan. The Fuccons are supposedly an American family (they are all mannequins) who moved to Japan, and they are more of a 50's sitcom family with at times a bit more modern sensations. The DVD contains several very short episodes (less than 5 minutes each?), And I found them neither funny nor entertaining, not even in a strange way. I'm not sure what that charm is. I've taken some satire here and there, man, who would not, but satire is usually humorous, right? And nothing I've seen or heard judged even a small grin. I picked that up and it's certainly SOUNDED appealing, but I guess either I miss the point or it's just LAME. The box even says it's hilarious to Fuccon, right on the front, but I want to make a difference. 2 out of 10.
