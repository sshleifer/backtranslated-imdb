In the real world of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do, but no one wants to wake up next to him. Christina Ricci, her on-screen screener, is the ugly, artistic wannabe girl who desperately wants every guy, but no man will touch her. That's why Prozac Nation, the unpublished film from Wurtzel's 1990s bestselling book of the 1990s of the same name, poses immediate problems. OK, the problems start before Ricci's Miscast, who has the emotional bandwidth of a thimble - is it any wonder that her best acting was on Addams Family's two films? At first she looks bizarre - with big eyes and a domed forehead, which makes her look like the 2001 Fatal Starchild: A Space Odyssey. Second, she always plays weeping brats. Third, films try to give the impression that every man is interested in them. In one scene of the movie, her boyfriends Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz go through Harvard, and all the boys' tongues wobble in Ricci, not the super sweet and sexy Williams. Hello ??. Reality Check Time ??. This material asked for the Andy Warhol treatment. Here is his version of the movie. A five-minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five-minute shot of Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. A five-minute recording in which she sleeps naked and stony on the bed. She gets up, gives the middle finger to the audience. Cue credits. Less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel's whole life. And, oh yes, Warhol's movie would not have occupied Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's stupid bosom, I would take everything that Williams or any other baby had to cinematographically offer me. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a movie, and how she works is a mystery. Think of their mediocre to bad movies like Monster, Sleepy Hollow, and Woody Allen's Anything Else - including Jason Biggs, in which you play a major role, and now imagine another actress in her role, and immediately the movies might look better if not great. She is the feminine counterpart to banal, wooden Milquetoast actors like Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
