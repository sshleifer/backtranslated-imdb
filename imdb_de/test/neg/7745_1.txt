In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland in person - I was at UNT in Denton during the shooting of "Necessary Roughness". Strangely enough, the voice she uses in this film is not too far from her real speaking voice. <br /> <br /> The story goes like this: Kathy gets a letter informing her that her father fell in love with a bottomless pit in Africa. She goes and investigates the location of her father's death, only to be drawn into an underground world that is partly a dystopian nightmare, partly uninspired fantasy and inhabited by the Plasmatiker's rejections. This film really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge, who in my opinion could have been someone if she had gotten this one big role that was right for her. Anyway, the main hero of the story, Gus, is a very lame Jack "Jacko" Jackson rip-off. The original is annoying enough at first, but this guy is really torture to look at him. Finally, the Nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and wears a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you have Kathy Ireland in tight clothes in a movie, it is better to have a bikini. In any case, the movie was just bad and was impaled by MST3K rightly. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if possible.
