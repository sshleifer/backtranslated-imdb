I saw this movie on video with some friends as part of a teen comedy triple header alongside Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously, we did not opt ​​for quality, but for airy entertainment and rough jokes. In general, we got what we came for, but Wild Roomies really stood out: for the horrible. <br /> <br /> First impression first the cover: The Norwegian release cover revealed breasts and a few seemingly "crazy" roommates in the background; Take pictures of drunken half-naked teenagers doing a lot of fun stuff, right? - The "crazy" housemates on the cover could not even be seen in the picture. And the weird stuff you think they're going to do? - Also absent. <br /> <br /> This movie was called comedy, which is a bit strange as it is not even remotely funny. Relationship drama would be more accurate. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is a young couple who inherits a fancy house in LA and is forced to get some roomies to make ends meet. These roommates eventually test the young couple's patience and relationship because they are so "wild". The problem is, they are not. And here lies the problem of this film: The protagonist pair is so presumptuous and neurotic that he manages to generate zero sympathy. You will dig in the middle of the movie for the antagonistic roomies. Add mediocre drama, lame dialogue and boring directing, and you'll have a movie that's best left unseen. <br /> <br /> See something else.
