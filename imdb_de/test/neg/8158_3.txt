I expected the movie to look more exploitative, but unfortunately it turned out to be just a cheap low budget action movie that simply does not have the talent for it. Story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas), whose friend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency, and he invented a bulletproof motorcycle that shoots with lasers and rockets and has a helmet shot with the laser can also be. Agency boss Bosarian (Martin Landau) has completed a $ 5 million sale deal and sent two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and pick up the bike. A big blond thug called Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick, but Teri survives. At home, she discovers a videotape left by Rick to describe his invention, which helps Teri find out what to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is being followed by several agents and she is being caught and tortured, but does not talk about where a motorcycle is needed becomes. However, she is supported by a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick), where they use the motorcycle for a bloody firefight. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Fred Olen Ray, who made his career in making extremely low budget films, but here he made a terrible mistake by omitting the aspect of use and try to make an action movie. Apart from a quick shower scene at the beginning, there is no nudity and the usual tickling that viewers are used to seeing in a Ray movie is not to be found. I do not think anyone expected Thomas to undress, but she does not wear a sexy outfit. Not that it stopped me from seeing her in those tight jeans and admiring her almost perfect form, but Ray really blew it away in that case. As with all of his films, the cast is fun, and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan, and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after this was done and it was his last acting performance and the movie is dedicated to him. One has to wonder why Landau would waste him with so much garbage, but I was interested in the casting of Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas good in this movie? Who cares! I think she showed that she could become a popular "B" movie if she wanted, but it never happened. Ray wastes all his time with this effort, although the cast is fun, but he has omitted the elements that make him a pleasing filmmaker.
