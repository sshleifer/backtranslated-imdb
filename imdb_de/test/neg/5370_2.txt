This show, Paranormal State, feels almost like a Blairwitch project. For example, you're watching a documentary that's really just a script that looks like a documentary and feels like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the show is the contact with Warrens external advisors, who became famous for their "investigations" into the Amityville murders, which turned out to be completely fraudulent, just because of the police reports on the death of the family! (For example, the eldest daughter was actually involved in the whole thing, to the point that she might even have helped some of the deaths!) Then there is the way they are constantly blaming demons for everything. Not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they accept. They do not want to help those who need them most, they only want the craziest cases that give them the most press and attention. <br /> <br /> They are complete scams, plain and simple.
