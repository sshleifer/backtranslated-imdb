Given the topic of drug addiction, Down to the Bone can almost be a rather depressing movie. But depressing does not have to be bad. Unfortunately, it's pretty bad in this case. The movie has some good things to offer, especially the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mother who is struggling with cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good to outweigh the evil. The flaws of the film are mainly in the story, which is not intrigued and never really gets going. Irene goes to the detox clinic and comes home to an unsuspecting husband who has no idea how she wants to support her attempt to distract her habit. Irene approaches another convalescent, a nurse from her rehab center. Complications follow. But the story is never brought to life. It does not seem like the movie is really going anywhere. It can be said that it is a stark, realistic view of the everyday life of an addict. Maybe so, but in this case it does not make an interesting movie. The whole thing has a very "blaes" feeling. Minimalist cinematography does not help, adding another layer of bleakness to the incredibly gray process. And none of the other services can compete with Farmigas. Hugh Dillon is OK as an Irish nurse friend, but nobody in the cast adds anything valuable to the process. All in all, this movie is a bleak, depressing and rather boring ride.
