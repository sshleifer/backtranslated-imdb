"Curse of the Forty-Niner" does not deserve a long and detailed discussion, so I'll just make a few random observations: <br /> <br /> - Cool opening speeches. <br /> <br /> - No conspiracy. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror movie and can not guess in the first 20 minutes who will survive and not belong to this group of stereotypes? <br /> <br /> - Hey , the newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (made to look about 100 years old) and John Phillip Law have fun, funny cameos. <br /> <br /> - Karen Black has a bigger role, but she's no fun - she's more embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - Martin Kove is about 40 seconds on screen but still got his name on the video cover. Did you pay him for this performance or was it the other way round? <br /> <br /> - I hate cheap computer generated effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4.
