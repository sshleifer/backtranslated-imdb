This is a bad movie because its central message is very confusing and the action acts as a result of merging several different scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense and certainly it is not a movie that Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should be proud of. But if you're a fan of "pre-code" movies, it's worth the movie because it contains a surprisingly bleak plot that says that cute girls will not go away - even if they're not married and even if they're not married her partner is it !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker accompanying troops on their way to World War I to Europe. She gets to know a scale backpacker (Bruce Cabot), who finally makes her sleep with him. She gets pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want to return him because she realizes that he is not worth it, but later her baby dies at birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always hinted at - almost as if they wanted to know the adults in the audience, but hoped that the children of the audience will do so if they formulate it or film it in the right way. finally, films were not rated and children could not participate in any film at that time). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this entire conspiracy involving a stillborn and Cabot ends up in a quarter of the entire movie and is never mentioned or mentioned again. It was like filming a part of a movie and giving it up - and pinning it to another movie. In this second phase of the movie, Miss Dunne unexpectedly starts working in a women's prison (though we never really see her see it). What we see are countless terrible scenes of severe mistreatment and torture that were likely to waver. As a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer. But then comes out of the blue, a different kind of movie and the women prison reform business remains on the track. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married, but he desperately wants her. Throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl - even though she had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less deceived). But now, the single Irene, the tireless reformer, and a good woman begins to sleep with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are alienated and just married in the name, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with her safety she flies off her clothes and they are in the baby industry! BUT, while pregnant with his love child, he is charged because he is a judge. He assures her that he is innocent, but he is convicted and it sure sounds like a rogue - he uses insider information from people who came to his bank to amass a fortune. In the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to release him and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The movie ends then. <br /> <br /> So we basically have three separate movies AND a bizarre early '30s idea of ​​what a cute girl should look like. I learned that she should be a strong-minded, working girl who immediately becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This removes all the positive aspects of Dunne's character, and it's really hard to imagine everyone likes the movie. A strong advocate of women's rights could be easily offended at how weak and needy she was, and religious people might find her totally amoral, or at least morally suspect! With a decent transcription, this could have been a good movie or at least could be interesting as an unsightly and murderous movie, but he could not decide what he wanted to be and was just another boring pre-code movie.
