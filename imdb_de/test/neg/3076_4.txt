What an uninteresting dodge. It could have been a little more, but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or the direction. A man is framed by his wife and lover for murder. The conspirators are doing a pretty thorough job to make him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric record identifies him as "stable" and "unimaginative," manages to escape prison, beat it in the conspirator's beach house, and secretly initiate a conversation between them in which they take theirs Reveal guilt. Then he accidentally drops the cassette recorder with all the evidence on it into the seawater, but manages to regain it. He shows a lot of creativity and improvisational art for an unimaginative man, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The band is now a damaged estate, but it's enough to tear down the woman's lover, and he's sobbing out of confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> The shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden facade raised on the grounds of the Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after production. <br /> <br /> It is a nice place. Unfortunately, it's a bit hard to see because someone seems to have picked up every scene through tights over the camera lens. It's all very blurry. And despite the natural splendor of the place, the viewer never gets a real sense of the place, as the sand feels, the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens. <br /> <br /> The drama is alright But the performers do not have much to do. The best performance is, as often, offered by Dick Olsen as a sloppy, but not unsympathetic defender. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every blink of an eye. Ted McGinley is in his reach as an immoral weakling. <br /> <br /> The score mixes the evil with the mystery and is effective. If you want to hear the original it was demolished, rent Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and hear the exciting theme of Bernard Hermann. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine any particular reason to catch this boredom here.
