First, I will give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing but a wannabe movie. I felt very disappointed when I saw this movie. I was led to people, it would be more drama and more facts about the true story on which it is based. Instead, I spent over an hour watching middle-aged, breaking the law, and taking drugs. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a football factory, but with no real action and no good ending. After watching the movie, I asked myself, "What was this movie about?" If you like and swear films with no real action and lots of drug use, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of mob and gangster movies, but this movie did not live up to the hype I can see where the author tried to go with the movie, but he never reached his goal , One of the worst British movies I have ever seen. If only the movie had an action, this would be an excellent movie.
