I saw this movie and I was not interested in this movie anyway. I would not think of going to Paris because I do not like this country and its capital. I still do not like learning French because I do not understand their language. Why should I go to France if I prefer to go to Germany or Britain? Germany and Great Britain are the nations I tolerate. Apparently the Olsen twins do not understand the French language exactly like me. Therefore, I will not disturb the trip to France under any circumstances. I might as well stay in the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. That's all.
