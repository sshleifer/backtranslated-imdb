Well, that was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview was the entire movie. No plot, no clear action, just some misguided tension. It looks like the director has been trying hard to create an atmosphere of mysticism and fear, but there are still gaps to fill. Why the drugs? Why the number 11.11? (By the way, when Sarah enters the library, the clock reads 11:14.) In what connection is the murder of the parents? What is the role of this Rayden woman? Is she one of the children or not? Who are these kids anyway? There is a lot of material around to create the ultimate cult movie like "The Omen", but the director just lets them lie on the ground without getting into the story. Even "the Blairwitch Project" was scarier than this one. Any gaps you hope to fill as in "The Butterfly Effect" will remain open while the credits are running. OK. On to the next movie ...
