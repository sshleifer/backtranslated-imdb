Beethovan lives upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History course our teacher let us watch this movie and Amadeus to compare the two composers or something. We first saw Amadeus and it was a very good movie, but when she let us watch this movie right after, I could not believe what I saw. The acting was awful, the costumes were ugly (the little boy was especially ugly and girlish), and the cinematography had a Z-grade. My friend compared it to a home movie with no date in the lower right corner. I understand that this was a TV movie from Canada and probably cost $ 10, but please, they could have done better. I've seen some good TV movies in my time, but this was not one of them. The biggest thing I do not understand is why my World History class could not just see Immortal Beloved or something else. How is it possible to compare composers when the film Amadeus for Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs for Beethovan is given? This is not possible if this is the film for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares, but Beethovan Wives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10).
