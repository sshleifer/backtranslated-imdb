The reviewer from Variety said it was "over-written and too long," and I agree. There are some events that seem forced and unlikely, such as Cal (as Crudup again as a "lost, empty and somehow boring male") and Julianne Moore finds a map of the United States in some sort of unbelievable place. The story is one of those '70s stories where the guy needs to find meaning in his life, and I imagined Jack Nicholson playing the role of Cal in his best role. The topic "Going to the streets to find meaning in life" is still interesting. Does all this really lead back to the family? I was not so sure. Acting is okay, I especially liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. I would give 'five'.
