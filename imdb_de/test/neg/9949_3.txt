When I sit and think about Poison for the Fairies, I find that I may not be fair with the movie. My rating of 3/10 may have more to do with my disappointment than the actual quality or entertainment value of the film. Based on the description of the action, the ratings on IMDb and the IMDb rating of 7.6, I would be sure that I had encountered a little-known gem. Unfortunately, it just did not do much for me. For whatever reason, Poison for the Fairies almost made me sleep. Gift for the fairies is the story of two young girls in Mexico City from 1965. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so gullible that she believes and, above all, fears what her friend tells her. It's really like that. In reality, not much happens and the film continues to move, while Veronica tries to terrorize and dominate Flavia. A commentator on IMDb described it as "the scariest movie in Mexican cinema of the 80s". My comment ?? In this case, not many horror films have been shot in Mexico in the 1980s. Another commentator wrote, "Watch if you want to be scared." My comment ?? Are you sure that we are talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples I have given. It was boring, unimaginative and bad for me. The scene image is particularly annoying as director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia have long and lengthy conversations with their family members and their teacher, but we never see the faces of these people. It's an annoying gimmick.
