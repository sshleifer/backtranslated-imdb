There is nothing mean or evil about this movie. It's just terribly boring. Boring is the photograph - the film supply appears old and faded and washed out. Maybe it was even 16mm to 35mm blown, no idea. Boring is the script that is boring and "Jules Pfeiffer". This is a kind of bossa nova cocktail party of the 1960s, cool. As if our Beatnik grandparents spoke, if they really wanted to be straightforward. The 'slice-of-life' characters were usually annoying. They were real in life, but if I really wanted to see ordinary people doing truly worldly and ordinary things, I would just take care of myself. I would not fall all the way to a movie theater and blow away five pounds and one evening when I saw someone watching. <br /> <br /> I expected a funny, bright Romcom. What I got was more like two intelligent and moderately talented 19- or 20-year-olds producing on the first day with a new video camera. <br /> <br /> I have given this 4 a 10 because it seems that someone has at least tried it.
