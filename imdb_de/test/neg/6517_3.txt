This movie is about the encounters of 7 couples on the Hampstead Heath on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. He shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, relationship breakers, gay, mature, blind date and escort service. Apart from the geographical situation, they are not interconnected, which is a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations without discernible action. The film jumps from one couple to another without logic. I find this movie boring and futile. The only redeemer is the great weather throughout the movie. It is sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are wasted by this movie.
