I did not really get this movie because I'm not a pervert like you who cares about lesbians. <br /> <br /> The girl in the red wig tries too much to be funny (her lips are SO silicone!), but she is really lame and unsure. She tries like a surfer guy (better than sloppy clothes, but still weird and definitely outmoded); The film does not explain why she tries to pose as a man. Oh, right, to "get" the poor, stupid girl. I forgot. She does all those stupid inventions that are not funny, and she's a really lousy actress. In addition, the Waif look is so OUT! <br /> <br /> This stupid blonde girl from Melrose Place plays (surprise) a stupid blonde. <br /> <br /> She thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! They even turn off! Ewww! I think that part was kind of funny.
