First of all, I have to say that I've read everything on this topic, and I know it by heart, and I was thrilled to finally see it. But all you have to do is read the book on which this mini-series is based to realize that this is not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is loosely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the imagination of the screenwriter. And unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names Mitya and Lushka until their affair began, during which time Violet was also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who followed Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The 'seduction scene' at the beginning of their affair Violet was much more passive than shown here and certainly did not kiss Vita first. I could go on, these examples were all included when the show was just begun. Apart from all these changes to the facts, the characterizations are wrong. Sometimes Vita behaves like a crazy woman. Especially the scene in which she saw in the publishing announcement of Violet Violet, is just ridiculous. Vita kept her flood of emotions inside. It was Violet who was spirited and showed her feelings (good or bad). Everything that Vita did when she read, she almost fainted, that's all. As a gentle nature, Harold avoided confrontations in real life, but here he is sometimes quite strict and accused. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters and not verbally. And Violet ... I know this show intentionally focused on Vita and Harold, but that does not mean all the other characters are just puppets on the sidelines. Here it is completely one-dimensional, and the lines given to it are usually embarrassingly flat. Actually, she was intelligent, talented, a very extraordinary woman who seldom deserves the credit she deserves. I've always thought she's more interesting than Vita. In this series, her unhappiness, loneliness and problems with her mother are completely ignored. Viewer also has little idea of ​​her background and her family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) to Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she fought over Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her right to exist, and if Harold suffered in an affair, so did Violet. After that, her life was in ruins and it took time for her to regain her composure. Statue could have played the role of Denys, so much depth is his character. Lady Sackville West is just a poorly drawn cartoon. an annoying chatterbox with exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends with the poorly written scene in Amiens and, according to the screenwriter, that was the end of the story. No, it took a whole year, and the end was much longer and sadder than what was presented here. But what's the stupid end, if the whole series was stupid from the beginning. I have to give the actors some credit, they've been trying to get the most out of those roles, even though Janet McTeer is the only one who really shows through as a vita. You can not complain about the settings. All complaints go to the director and especially to the screenwriter. Instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and boring conversations. Many of the scenes are too long, some are pointless and bring nothing to the plot. On the other hand, many details are shortened or omitted completely. In particular, there should have been more information about Vitas and Violet's youth and how their friendship developed. This is a fascinating story that deserves a much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. At the moment you can do a lot more of this story by reading the actual book or Violet's letters to Vita, which are brilliant stuff.
