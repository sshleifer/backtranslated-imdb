I recorded this movie because it sounds like a pretty decent movie and I've always been a fan of foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised how much I hate, hate, hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Although he aims to expose the lives of young, under-aged men in Lima, and if one succeeds, the characters are hopelessly flat and the audience ends up with absolutely no feelings for them. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves mainly around M, he rarely speaks and his dialouge is at its best, surprisingly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: some small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically, the story revolves around a young man named M, who has been looking for Jobs, but to no avail (He is acquiring Although twice a job, but is terminated because they are "not for him." If you are poor, the last option is to be choosy). Some time is spent with his friends, whose idea of ​​"fun" is to rape a little 14-year-old girl, steal crappy tires from a buggy for a small sack of weeds and some other somewhat reserved activities Ms. Buddy's plan is to earn $ 25,000 apiece and move to the US by directing Cocaine to Miami. When the drug king gives them a job, we experience a very lame scene in which the three friends in the mall buy clothes while music plays in the background. We see them dressing different clothes, like little girls getting $ 200 to go shopping, getting their hair cut and then looking like fucking gangsters (a character, Carlos, will always be wearing sunglasses, ALWAYS ... even at night ). The day before they leave, the leader of the group goes to speak with the drug lord. M and his friend remain silent. They celebrate, take several samples of the drugs they run and break into their old school, behaving like animals and shattering everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The film ends when M tries to call his girlfriend, who hangs him up. The friends then set fire to the payphone, revealing a bunch of kids and an old man with a gun. M and Carlos' friend, responsible for running the drug, appear on his motorcycle and want them to go with him now. Then he strips himself and is shot by this old man. The police appear and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and cover their dead friend with newspapers while music plays and becomes credits. <br /> <br /> **** End Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I've even seen this movie a second time, hoping to see a subtle, redeeming factor for it, but I have not done it. A complete drop of 102 minutes. Although I must acknowledge that I am straightforward and not afraid of disturbing elements, the casting, acting and general direction still leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> IMHO, If You're Interested In a movie that explores the issues this film was suspected of, consider renting City of God (Cidade de Deus) instead. Avoid this garbage at any cost! You have been warned !!
