No words can describe how horrible this movie is. It's as if the director literally took a shit in a movie role and sent it to the audience. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is terrible, The conspiracy is so stupid and death Every character is ridiculously bad. Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar who pulls a weapon out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes, a hologram), Akshay Kumar with a bazooka through the city, Rajat Bedi is beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth, permeate the Monisha Korella (how did you think that was straight?). I would also like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene supporting this statement is when Kapal has the bike and somehow gets the glasses. The purchase looks like it was made in Microsoft paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts in this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he even scares God. In one scene, he literally opens a prison door by kicking her. Chuck Norris' Rundhaus has none of this! He is even so powerful that he can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! Overall, this movie is perhaps the worst-made movie in the universe. If you were watching the movie, watch all the fun (by the way, this movie should be serious).
