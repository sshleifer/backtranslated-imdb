The beginning was decent; The end was fine. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film suffers from complete and extreme oversizing of characters, unrealistic confrontation / battle scenes and the lack of intelligent people outside the shuttle. This makes for a terrible middle screenplay. <br /> <br /> To look for something: too obvious foreboding, fast healing cuts, overly smoking fires, funny seat belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 4, not a 0 because the start of the movie had some nice elements of luck and basic character development. The relationship between the dark-haired head girl and her fianc√©e is briefly touched on, and the placement of the blond boy's affect on this relationship is present, though this is unpleasant. The deal that was discovered in the end is becoming more and more mainstream and decent, though not unexpected, as another commentator noted. <br /> <br /> ~ Viper ~
