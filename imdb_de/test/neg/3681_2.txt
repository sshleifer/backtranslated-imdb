I was fascinated by the premise that the show was about demons. From hell. And a door to hell. What I did not know was that I was watching some guys running around in tunnels that were chased by small children who might not have been demons throughout the movie. Sure, there were some dialogues and great subterranean landscapes, but the lack of action, developed characters, any twists or developments in history altogether lacked painfully. Oh, and there were no special effects out of interest. The entire budget was spent on actor salaries, sets and a lot of time running around with a camera under the ground. <br /> <br /> The ending was one of the typical boring finishes that lead to "I endured this movie of boredom !?" If you want to see demons and a door to hell, I promise you would rather watch the Hellgate: London trailers, which are less than 5 minutes in this movie, pack more dialogue, character development, action, plotting and satisfying Conclusions than this. <br /> <br /> The second star is for the effort, but overall a low score, because it has failed to make a movie that stands out, and for promising items in the slogan much more than what was delivered ,
