The movie had an interesting surprise. Something psychologically gripping. And the creators could have ended it in a tasteful way, without it being just a rash of Hollywood films for homosexuality and / or other sexual deviations. This could have ended with a pay-off, but there were other motives behind the pen. What scares me off is the mud that is in your face after you've seen the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Yeah sure, I'm just another Puritan. This gay content has clouded the whole movie. I would not judge a movie positively as artistic or entertaining if it would solely serve to promote a subordinate political motivation. This is even more so.
