Two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. This is the first scene, and I dared to wince because I was afraid of what was going on. At the end of the first half hour, however, I was carried away by the flood of images. Not because the characters were the least important to me, but because I was appalled by how horrible the movie was and how curious it was to sink. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are ex-prisoners. After murdering the two innocent campers, they plow through the forest and snake into the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, attorney Keith and the alien homosexual Behr. At first, the runaway people pretend their car broke down and they have to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identity. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like a familiar area so far. "Desperate Hours" or "Funny Games" maybe. But wait a minute - the gay son is in contact with them. It seems that Stockwell, when he spotted his son in Flagrante Delicto with another man named Billy, kicked Billy around and kicked him out. Billy died and Behr now blames his father for his death. And indeed, Dad is a Neanderthal when it comes to Paraphilias, the fact that he was living with a secretary. <br /> <br /> Behr, who was plagued with grief, was looking for someone else that had known Billy, someone to share his desperation with. It turned out to be one of the outliers, and now Behr is determined to see her in her freedom. <br /> <br /> After that everything is twisted. People talk. They talk and talk. They talk constantly. And NOT about the two crazy killers who can not wait to put one between their eyes. No - the dialogue is something like this: "You were just afraid of something inside that you even expelled your own son." This is Behr, the young gay man who talks to Stockwell. It's as if a house drama one afternoon mixed his genes with a killing thriller in a kind of transformation device or cocktail shaker. <br /> <br /> The only real accomplishment is given by James Remar as a talkative and ominous two fleeing. This is mainly due to his rough but flowing baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson's, and his broad, guppy-like lips. He is an eye and earmuff. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell has done well, including his invaluable bizarre turn in "Blue Velvet", where he was my supportive player, but here laziness, up-and-coming years or loose direction has each of his moves and each one Utterance made a clich√©. It's as if he's reading stage directions - "look surprised" and "scream angry" - and follow them literally. There is no surprise in a truck shop. <br /> <br /> If the gay son Jason Behr ever blinked, it must have been when I blinked at the same time I missed it. He has a long neck and only one expression in his instrument. Woolvett as a secondary villain disappears into the pine wood paneling. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he did not give up his day job. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the staging functional without being innovative. Sometimes it is confusing. I lost track of where everyone was supposed to be when the killers were circling the porch and the family locked themselves up with a gun. I could not understand how Stockwell banged through the cabin door, slammed Remar and hit him in the back of the porch, and then Remar could just get up, dust himself, and come up with a cranky Riposte like, "Okay Playing game." But why continue? See it if you have to.
