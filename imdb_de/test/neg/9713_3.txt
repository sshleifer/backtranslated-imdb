Pete's Meteor. I have seen that this is called "authentic" and "jewel". I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I wish I had not done it. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was referred to as Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice about Pete's meteor is a total lack of conspiracy. Or rather a series of small subplots that are not really connected and are not going anywhere. The young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and his younger sister with the grandmother. A meteorite lands in his garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the title of the movie, Mickey is the one claiming the meteor, and the "plot" actually has little to do with the meteor in any way. From here, some other signs and negotiations are introduced. But like I said, they are not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's pretty fast moving from a cute family movie to a dark thriller when Pete (Mike Myers) is introduced and plays a role. Micky blames him for his parents' death, though we've never been told what happened or why. Hugh has romantic problems because his girlfriend can not overcome his cosmic fascination. Pete begins with his drug-related past and temporarily brings his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix as dodgy characters try to kill him. This seems to be the main story until you realize that halfway through the movie, it does not even matter and is anything but senseless stuffing. Hugh's girl problems, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what do they have to do with EARTH? Not much. <br /> <br /> So the "conspiracy" is incoherent and half of it is pointless. But a good cast of characters can save it, right? Keyword: good The majority of the characters are extremely unlikely people of whom you would most like to see terribly die. At least I know that I would. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is really a bad step when seen in action. He's one of the worst kids I've seen in a movie with an extremely bad behavioral problem. He "borrows" a car, harasses and talks garbage to Hugh (an adult) for the meteor, in fact he tries to burn down the man's house when he is unable, and even tries to stab Pete with a knife , You'd think a kid like this is on the way to jail. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets what he deserves. I'm not sure when to sympathize with his character, because he's always a disgusting little brat. He is the ringleader for his brother and sister so they predictably leave and sit back and just follow what he does. Surprisingly, they are pushed back so far that I can not even remember their names. You just might not even be there. <br /> <br /> Your grandmother is pretty much an alcoholic on the border. She is just as disgusting to Hugh as Mickey and likes to push people out of her house and scowls her if she does not swallow alcohol bottles and drink silly. Pretty ridiculous, considering that she should take care of three children. Her problems with alcohol are never really addressed, though she breaks down in the film from time to time. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few sympathetic characters in the movie, but that's just because he's the punching bag, the majority of the characters and takes their mess without giving it back. The kids treat him badly, but he keeps coming back and trying to teach them and doing nice things with them. He has a taxi driver friend who seems to regard every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense and tries to keep him in the film several times when he goes into his cosmic language or proves something that he is not exactly the same Wavelength like the other figures (luckily). <br /> <br /> Then there's Mike Myers as Pete. Although Pete has the only fixed purpose and the only action in the film, he is hardly used and plays no role until the second half. It is regrettable that Myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even if Pete has screen time, half is just Myers, runs through dark alleys and hides in small corners. And though he was the only real point in this film, it's a strange, unfulfilled conclusion when all of his characters finish the movie, and all the characters laugh well and have a short and strange explanation behind the title of The Movie Leaves You wondering if they were in the movie you just saw. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in Pete's Meteor is Mike Myers's role as Pete, and if you can go through this disjointed mess long enough, without looking at another man because of the extremely unlikely characters and not to avoid existing plot line. No, sir, I did not like that at all.
