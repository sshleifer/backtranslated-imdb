There is not much to say in the end. One would have expected much more from a director who has made much better films in the past. It seems he did it without caring. The actors do their job (although Belmondo is anything but amazing), but you're just not addicted. In short, it is boring. This is all the more disappointing, as I heard several times that this film could be seen as responding to all the great American blockbusters that are considered a threat to the French exception of those who simply can not admit that they should turn to another job , I tell you, if this is the best reaction we should get, boy, I'll be very depressed soon ...
