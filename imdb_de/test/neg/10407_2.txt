Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well once more when Chappy Sinclair goes to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux, who is interested in Jason Gedrick who wisely refused) to teach a new group of recruits. This time, they discover corrupt Air Force pilots dealing with toxic waste. This is a series that gets worse and worse with every subsequent entry. However, this has neither the zipper nor the action to make the cable even worth seeing. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dog fights go off as if we were watching a Playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It's horrible to see, and Gossett Jr, who made his share of turkeys, seems to have bottomed out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. The secret of Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems like Christopher Walken when it comes to doing everything while he works. When I look at his post-Oscar, win. His better films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that the last two films are starring him along with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it is indeed saying something that three guilty amusement moves are for his better work in the race. Of course, Enemy Mine and Diggstown are his best work after the Oscars. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bath)
