I loved the first fifteen minutes and I loved some dialogues in the Tribunal - which proved to be the best showcase for the director's method as a method of acting - but this film ultimately disappoints. Even if they are seen merely as a metaphor of oppressive / repressive dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks clout and credibility. An obvious end would already happen. <br /> <br /> And for the record: Despite fierce rumors on the contrary, this movie was never banned in the US (I can not comment on the rumors of British censorship, but I'm suspicious). Hollywood refused to postpone it after the first film festival, and I'm more than willing to believe that the Nixon administration influenced that decision. The fact that it never appeared on American television merely reflects the more cautious and effective way in which this medium works. At the moment you can have your own copy of the DVD delivered to your home in Amazon within a few days.
