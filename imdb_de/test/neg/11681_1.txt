I rented a copy of Netflix - big mistake. The DVD version entitled "The One-armed Swordsmen" was produced by lunatics who felt that the combat sequences in a big chapter should be better put together than in a consistent, consecutive story. Part of the story has been left in separate chapters that you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated nonsense. As much as I like seeing Wang Yu in the best of hands after all these years, this is a waste of time. I had dishwashing liquid that made a better movie. The DVD version shows that no matter how stupid a Chinese script may be, one has to look at a story to see how the combat sequences evolve. <br /> <br /> But "The One-Armed Swordsmen" gives you the chance to see Wang and Shaw Brothers as Lo Lieh smacks the handsome boy David Chiang - it's always a pleasure to see this plays a kind of second-string villain here and is a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists.The film is also honored by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as magistrate. <br /> <br /> Another comment above mentions the compulsory "in-the-inn" scene (in fact there are two) in which Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comic barbarians who look like they are making cavalry Bruce Lee noises while they fight None of this makes sense, but that's fine if you do not expect clarity and common sense, but it was fun to see. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity of this production is that there is no significantly en female characters. There are a few female roles, but they do not play a serious role in the plot or the plot. <br /> <br /> If you find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One Armed Swordsman movie, the movie explains why he has only one arm, and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.
