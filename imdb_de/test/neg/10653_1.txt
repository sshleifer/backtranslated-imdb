Not to be confused with Michael Ritchie's vicious beauty pageant of 1975, this "smile" is a shabby example of those good intentions that pave the way to hell. The film tells two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise an orphaned orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a Malvu-born family plays "Gidget Get Birth Control." Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a spoiled, reality-distanced high school. Her teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China to teach students how to deal with deformed children. <br /> <br /> The film uses deformity as a means of tension by treating Ling like the Frankenstein monster. Kramer is always masking her deformity with hats, hoods and camera. This approach exploits the freak show quality of the material. She may feel uncomfortable with society, and Kramer's answer is to cover her up until the great revelation appears. Why are you annoying your audience? We see her face shortly at the end and only a few minutes before the completion of the snapshots show a swan under the Harelip. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; It's imperative that Ling be as hot and popular as Katie. The film was funded by a trust founded by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They envisioned a heritage of quality family films. Give me "Son of Paleface" every day.
