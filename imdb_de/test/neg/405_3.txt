36/100. This is not to be confused with the decent arachnophobia, this movie is a very cheap and cheap rip-off of this movie. This is so bad that it actually has an entertainment value at this level. There are many unintentional (I think) loud scenes. I did not expect much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I thought. <br /> <br /> It's a clich√© that's torn and predictable just before video diarrhea. Luckily, it does not take too seriously. The spectacle is, as expected, not quite Oscar-caliber. The special effects are bad, worse than I thought. Badly edited and the score is intrusive.
