A single mother, her son, her daughter and her friend with hippie chicks are camping in the forest. A muscular machete with maniac in a yellow ski mask appears. He begins to terrorize and sexually assault the family before killing her with a machete. "Wet Wilderness" is loaded with ugly hardcore sex, enforced incest and blatant racism. It's as politically incorrect as XXX-Roughies. The score is stolen from Hitchcock's horror classic "Psycho" and also from "Jaws." It's bad and there are some big gaps in logic. The repetitive nature of the sex scenes allows the film to gradually run out, so that the short term is a blessing. The scenes of violence are quite uncomfortable, for example, the hippie girl with the machete in stabbed her groin and one sees blood in her crotch.3 out of 10 and that is generous.
