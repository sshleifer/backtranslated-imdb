With David Arquette in the lead role, you would immediately think that this is a stupid movie. Well, it's a stupid movie with a horrible script. But the F / X, the eight-legged freaks, makes this movie a shout. A tribute to the great mutated creatures of the 50s, albeit the stupid side. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) call to ward off the poisonous giant spiders that cause havoc in their small town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.
