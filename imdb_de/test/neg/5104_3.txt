While I've seen and enjoyed similar films like silent films about the Russian Revolution, like POTEMKIN and TEN DAY'S THE SHOOK THE WORLD, I did not really enjoy this movie. This was mainly due to the annoying and "artistic" way the director filmed the film. While POTEMKIN was characterized by his cutting style, this film used similar techniques with much less finesse - in some places the cut seemed very choppy and amateurish. Plus, and that was really annoying, the use of zombies at the beginning of the movie and late in the movie was really overkill. By "zombies" I mean that in many scenes people are like mannequins to illustrate how depressed and oppressed the Ukrainian peasants were. And so they stand immobile for a very long time, while the "evil" capitalists and exploiters pass by the masses. Give me a break! This film is a wonderful example of style and substance - and it's just a movie for those who enjoy or miss the excessive indulgence. If you leave the audio comment. This makes the movie easier to follow and gives some interesting insights.
