The film provides a vivid account of the suffering of forced labor, but nothing more. The left agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and makes the viewer look so embarrassed when watching this feeling. Therefore, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex-Yugoslav territory to work as sex slaves because (deep breathed) the American military authorities are corrupt and look the other way, while their private security companies sell people abroad. You do not need half a brain to see relevance to the Iraq war and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What a load of leftover excrement! It seems that all my life I have been deceived into believing that this problem, and many others, have been a direct result of Communism's influence on this region for 45 years. But no, it was the American war against Iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms and the constipation that I had last week. The film ignores the fact that 95% of sex trafficking is available to women who are willing to sell their bodies for money and entry into the Western bloc. You also see scenes that are so stupid that you want to pull on your hair. We have somebody who follows a woman in the streets of London in broad daylight, beat her up and then drag her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. No one sees this or calls the police, and the running woman does not want to scream during the persecution. Better still, later on we see 4-5 women being set up in the middle of London to sell daylight, one of them has a battered face and people are shopping in the background as if nothing had happened. You can not make out this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I always thought that such garbage is exclusive to Hollywood, but apparently I was wrong.
