We have shown this movie in a club as an example of how classical literature can become some of the most terrible films of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the conspiracy in the "techno-futile" future should have been a clue. I think this word describes the movie itself, because no matter how much technology was tried to save this movie, the effort was completely pointless. Not to mention that our club advisor told us he was not supposed to get a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This cinematic failure is littered with kitschy, clich√©-related dialogues that are worse than frightened teenage poetry. Beowulf's character changes halfway in a way that is in no way credible, and when he's in an action scene, he's always shuttling like a hypergymnast. There is even, as they say, a "black guy" whose humor attempts are out of place. And of course, the daughter of the leader of the outpost Grendel is a total vixen. A vixen whose breasts are visible throughout the movie. A vixen who wants to fight the creature but never puts on armor. And her weapon is a little carving knife. And despite her bad situation, she still disguises herself for dinner in a dress with a sheer skirt showing her short underpants. There are a few scenes that could go through as softcore pornography, and in the second scene, they even use footage of the first one. I found Grendel's portrayal bad enough, but then the film ended, which contained a display of CGI that might be decent for the '80s but is utterly ridiculous for the late' 90s. I could go on, but you should all watch this movie to see the completely ridiculous effect itself. <br /> <br /> The other club members and I have managed to have fun by taking a cue from MST 3K and mocking it all the way through. I'm still shot by an extra weapon: a constantly rotating pizza cutter on a pole.
