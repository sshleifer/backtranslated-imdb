Of course, I disappeared in the cinema. The Neil Young Concert Film "Heart of Gold". <br /> <br /> Over the years there have been many great concert films. The best part was Martin Scorsese's 'The Last Waltz', with which the band's last concert was filmed on Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal movie, if you love rock and roll and feel like you were born into it and part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that a few chords and one or two lyrics, you could change the world ... As you can imagine, I felt all five by the end of my 24 year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in "The Last Waltz". They had to work digitally before they were digital, they had to manually scrape off a large hanging cocaine rock that pulls out of his nose. In this movie there is a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem hanging over his lip and under his nose. It's a famous piece of rock'n'roll history. <br /> <br /> But The Last Waltz was born when the band and Neil and everyone else was in their thirties. "Heart of Gold" was filmed last year when Neil is in his sixties and his band looks like they're in their late ninety and the entire movie could be used visually by Christian Right and the DEA in the same way Ohio State Patrol did Movies about the dangers of drunken driving when I was in high school and dead teens sticking out front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and it's a terrific concert, open it and watch the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. An example of this was the once ethereally beautiful Emmylou Harris, who literally came out of the darkness to sing with Neil, and from dark to light, which looked like a ring spirit, leaped out of the river in front of Rivendale. A ghastly, ghostly nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make buttons on dolls look lifelike, and the ability to express emotions, whether human or not, by unrestrained generosity in Botox be restricted . My mind was complaining ... Porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... lived hard for decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris I saw singing free at Fred's in Boulder dead Pharoah would not accept. But the voice, as pure as a fat lip bottle of boulder beer brewed from the waters of Boulder Creek, and I closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... you have to pay homage at least once in every movie. ..) Fred's Hamburger in the Boulder Mall and the Steve Martin Pink Panther movie. <br /> <br /> It would have been a terrific concert, sitting in the dark in the Ryman Auditorium, maybe twenty rows back. But in close-up, it was a medieval morality game that depicted the horrors of enjoyment and the consequences of a sinful life. <br /> <br /> The concert theme, influenced by the scenery, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, mass guitars (I counted eight) and I wondered if there was irony in the game. I do not think so. An American bassist, a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a pianist whose face looked like the Screamer's face in Munch's The Scream, the kitchen singers (who were actually matronly singers), mostly to the lost youths of Senior United remind flight attendants who are still stroking the friendly sky), dressed in matching, full-length denim dresses ... no, it was just played. <br /> <br /> None of them had seen a powerful wind. <br /> <br /> It will be a great CD, and I would be happy to tell stories about the hip, gloomy Boulder, when Neil was a long-haired Canadian singer whose inconceivable lyrics reflected heartbreak and loss. <br /> <br /> But only in a dark bar.
