This is a nice move of the mill family, which I'm sure most kids will enjoy, but really nothing that pleases all the adults watching the movie. The premise of the film is that Belushi's cop character is retiring but is being drawn into a case that causes him to become a private investigator. The plot of the movie is so obvious that most kids will surely pick the end before it happens. In addition, there are seemingly story-sheets and negotiations that will be forgotten in the course of the film. This paired with a sub-plot where the title K-9 of Belushi is pimped out. To avoid one, I'm afraid.
