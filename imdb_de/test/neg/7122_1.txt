In the beginning, I did not bother to see The Grudge. The previews for this movie did not make me jump, did not scare me and did not talk to me. When a group of friends asked me to visit The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a bit curious as to how this movie would look like. I went mainly because of my friends. Not even five minutes into this movie, I realized that I threw away $ 7.50. Acting from the beginning is terrible. The schoolgirls look at first as if they had never acted in their entire lives. Then the film takes over. Let me tell you, I could not stop the whole movie from laughing. It's just so stupid. I'm pretty sure they tried not to make it scary. They do not let anything pop out or anything. It shows the children and shows them how to "attack". It builds on that, it's not a "sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the film, the core of the film, acting is still terrible. There is so much time left between the dialogues that someone can add their own comments. To be honest, this movie is one of the funniest "horror" movies I've ever seen. Badly written, horrible drama, terrible screenplay, terrible actors "incompetent", and a terrible concept. The movie turns black and changes the situation more often than you can count. Each part will eventually be played and tied at the end of the movie. I would never pay again to see this movie. I would not even look it over cable for free. This movie is a joke. Please do not waste your money in this movie !!
