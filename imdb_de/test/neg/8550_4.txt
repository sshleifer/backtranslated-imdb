You Belong To Me was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team, and it was a movie rental for Fonda at Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to receive the Tom Joad role in The Grapes of Wrath. After that it was usually his rental films that were good when he was cast in mediocre things at Fox. <br /> <br /> But here the rule was broken. Although the character he plays has a superficial resemblance to Charles Pike of The Lady Eve, this movie is not nearly so funny. In fact, feminists would probably be horrified. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanwyck did not like that at all. She enjoyed working with Henry Fonda, but found this film ridiculous. She should have done that too. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire playboy whom we would now call a trust fund baby who has little to do with his life. He is a kind of loveable lunkhead who meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls in love with her as she tries to show herself. It turns out that she is a doctor and they have a whirlwind advertising and marry. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that Fonda is jealous, especially when it comes to Roger Clark, another millionaire Stanwyck patient. And he does not understand their job responsibilities. Like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, Stanwyck was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda to go into work and live on a salary to see if he can, Fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. She is so proud of him that she will actually give up her doctor's practice and spend the salary of his salesman with him. Today, the movie would be picked up NOW. Stanwyck was not too confident in her performance, probably because she did not believe it. I certainly could not. <br /> <br /> I do not even believe back then that the public believed in it. But the two stars and the rest of the cast did their best, but this was a Thanksgiving special.
