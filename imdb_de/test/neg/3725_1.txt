I want the 99 minutes of my life back, wasted for this pathetic apology for a movie. The acting was terrible! I was a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at her like this again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were no surprise. Everyone knows that they could never act. Fortunately, only Dan tried an accent. His accent was as expected a catastrophe. I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never spoken to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review will help anyone who does not spend their precious time. The only reason I could sit through the movie was because I was stuck somewhere without seeing or reading anything better.
