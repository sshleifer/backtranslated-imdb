Who gave these people money to make a movie? It was nothing funny. The fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this piece of disease says it all. Above all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it just took the name and counted on all the people who liked the original Chevy Chase. They took Randy 'I have no talent, I'm just a fat and sweaty pig' Quaid (the only wrong part 1) and made a 'movie' about him ... There are only idiots in his family, but not the ' are not they sweet 'kinda silly, but the' do not touch 'somehow silly. If you look at this pile of dirt, you hope that everyone who participates in it, THIS! They did not even bother to fix the effects. When they are on the boat, only the wrong background moves. When Quaid is in the water, you can tell by the lighting that this is a studio. This movie was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and should never have been made. No way ... if the money had thrown into a volcano, would have so much more use. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope I've reached some of you ... Nobody warned me, and now I've been drawing for a lifetime. Merry Christmas!
