There is no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience that must be seen at Mamma Mia: Hitler has to look up and tell pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd, "You monsters, what have you done?" Movie is wrong Straight ?? Not correct! Even the success that is inexplicable. I can understand when those crappy epic films, like Epic Movie, make their minimum share of money and make a profit just because they're cheap (of course!). But if something like Mamma Mia earns $ 450 million worldwide, you think, "what the hell is wrong with the world?". <br /> <br /> And to think we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest living actresses in the world, inside? What did she think? "I need the money," she could say. Then you sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is well in a catastrophic, um 'movie'. It is also catastrophic! If she sings, even though she has the vocals, that's ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he sings Abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. "Really?" And when I mention Abba, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Although it does not help them when actors start to sing (bad), danced (worse) and the extras joined (they come out of nowhere!), To present one horrible music sequence after another. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you pray for the actual silence. <br /> <br /> I could go on. The list goes on forever. You could write a Stephen King novel with the full list of bugs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Go ahead! Really! You have to be a witness to understand !! And since it's a huge success, who cares if he earns a few dollars more from you? And you do not like that you sell your soul to the devil. Meryl has done that before. For all humanity. And now the world has to end because we have committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.
