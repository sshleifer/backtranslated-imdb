This movie was horrible and in the end I wondered why someone bothered to make it. Now it was not all that bad, I studied film and this film was very nicely put together and had very good cinematic things with interesting angles to very good lighting and excellent camera work. I wish I had seen it at school because it would have made a good movie on which I would write a work. BUT ........ Since I finished my film and lost most of my presumptuousness, I realized that a movie should be entertaining especially point that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
