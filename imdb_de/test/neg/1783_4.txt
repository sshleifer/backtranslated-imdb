I thought that was a funny comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there is no sexual content, but as a "fun comedy" I can only remember that I laughed a total of three times during "The Green Butchers". The merriment is about cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just a bad sense of humor. Actually, I should not have seen this movie at all. The only good thing that came out of this movie was the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally got better and left their ugly past behind. I recommend every well-meaning individual to turn away from this rough effect.
