The broadcaster, who introduced late Saturday night, said he should have won Oscars. Quite a statement for a movie that I've never heard of ... although I should hear a TV speaker, I do not know. In that case, the announcer talked to Tripe. <br /> <br /> It's a bleak, wretched film that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I could not get on with Hoskins' terrible burr-ming-gum accent. Anyway, I can not see any benefit in being in the Midlands. <br /> <br /> Unresolved threads abound ... and I would not mind that, but half of them do not make sense. And what if Hoskins says he'll pick up Felicia at her B & B, even though she never told him exactly where she is? Or her purchase for the funeral, which obviously never took place (and where was she in those days ???) Clumbsy and ill-conceived business, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller with no thrill. It is full of challenging little things. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> Did not like it. I thought it was garbage. Would not recommend it. 'Nuff said.
