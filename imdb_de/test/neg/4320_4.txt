This movie can be seen, but nothing special. Four girls on a road trip to Vegas stupidly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he's cute). They all spend the night in a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the psychotic problems of the woman's hitchhiker become obvious. The characters are clich√©s - there is a married, responsible woman; a dirty party girl; to be an insecure bride; and a man-hater who has just been dumped. The hitchhiker is really nice until he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not nearly enough blood and too much rape. I really like Slasher Horror / Thriller and it has not done anything for me. The end was just as lame as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the actors did a great job with them to work with. The dialogue is not terrible and overall I was impressed by the cast, I've never seen or heard any of them before. And the plot was not out of the question (though I really doubt that a woman would take a hitchhiker during that time - no matter how attractive he is), so I did not moan that things did not bother me. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hitchhiker" was well played and useful, but not very interesting. There are many better movies in the same genre that I would recommend about this ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", even "The Hitcher" remake). Do yourself a favor and skip it if you have no other options.
