Thomas Vinterberg's "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road movie without the most important element of a film: a good story. The characters are not very original and not very interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck that plays the same role he has played in recent years and that he has repeated in "festivals" - it seems like he is acting, = being angry and looking at other people scream! The movie does not make too much sense and is not very funny - although it tries to be "crazy" and "funny". If you're making a road movie, add something original to the genre.
