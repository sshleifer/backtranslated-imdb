Once upon a time there was a great American movie. What combined horror and comedy with the same thrill. This movie showed a clever direction. Groundbreaking special effects and outstanding comedic and serious drama. It bore the title "An American Werewolf in London". Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel was pinned to the billboard in front of your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the thrill of the original. Think again. "An American werewolf in Paris" is an incomprehensible chaos from the beginning to the pathetic goal. The problems start with the leading man. The performance of Tom Everett Scott is stiff and tiring. From the beginning he seems to be anxious that all young people are simpleton. In his defense, not even an experienced Shakespearean thespian could derive a good performance from the youthful and witless dialogue. At some point, one of Scott's deceased friends, whose soul has to enter the earth after a quarry by one of the werewolves, can finally leave for the afterlife. Then he jokes to Scott and his friends. "Okay guys, see you then." What an unforgettable farewell. Julie Delphy soon shows up as Scott's secretive European love interest. After all, she is a Frenchwoman who plays the Frenchwoman. It is not a big stretch. But all this stupidity is not even the most disappointing thing about the movie. The special effects, which are an integral part of the excellent original film, are far behind on this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you model a cartoon with sinewy lycanthropic muscles. It's still hard to be afraid of a cartoon. Instead, the American gang, headed by the ultra-awake Scott, keeps making excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs. Here, it is much easier for this incompetent special effect crew to keep the computer-aided creatures or absurd animal masks under the guise of darkness. Some have said that if you do not consider this movie to be a sequel, it is not that bad by comparison. I do not agree, this movie can not stand alone and is even more of a shame compared to the brilliant original. If it is not to be considered as a sequel, it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 movie. I do not care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you adored "American Werewolf in London." as I did. This is not worth wasting your time. "Okay guys, see you then." Awful. 3 of possible 10 T.H.
