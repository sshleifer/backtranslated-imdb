Yes, it is me again! Mr 'I'm sitting in the trash so you do not have to'. <br /> <br /> What is your opinion? Could it possibly be a woman calling a sex-line and meeting bachelors in a secluded area? Then her cross-dressing friend comes over and cuts her throat with a razor before taking off with his money. Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the policeman brought in is forced to band together with a sexy Assistant DA to nail those jerks, what is your conclusion? Do you think the sexy DA will go undercover in a threadbare red dress to hit the drag queen, but then have to be kidnapped and rescued by the Maverick Officer? (who has already handed over his weapon and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie bores me to tears. Why do people insist on doing this kind of garbage? It's a waste of our time, of their time, and yet they still continue to film ... a film that nobody gives a jot. If it has any redemptive functions, then there is the fact that there are some of the most beautiful women I have seen in a movie for some time. I hope they spent their meager wages on plenty of botox and intestinal lavage. They would look good on Vogue's cover or sit in a bikini on a car. They should only leave the acting to the professionals (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> When I talk about future careers, I recently met the director. He sure makes a delicious chicken burger. I also have to say that the uniform really suits him. I asked him about 'Party Line' and his eyes went down before mumbling something about fries. Well, guess, it did not work out. Anyway, they let him take the passage tomorrow !! Hooray!! 1.10
