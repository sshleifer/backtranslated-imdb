I was disappointed in this documentation. I thought it was about the second chess game between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue, the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat every human chess player. Kasparov was and still is the best chess player ever. The movie takes us back to 1997, when Kasporov agreed to have a remake of "deep blue" after defeating her a year earlier. But instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after the game, but not very much. Much of the film revolves around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was manipulated as part of a conspiracy theory and he had unfairly lost the match. The film also includes interviews with people who are in no way interesting They even talked to the manager of the building where the game took place. Who cares? I also found it very dry and slow. At the same time, this film was unsatisfactory. Of course, that's just my opinion. If you like Conspi Englisch: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...2934 & lang = en. For people who are not interested in chess or conspiracy theories, this movie probably has no value. I'm a chess fan, and I only stick it the machine "4/10
