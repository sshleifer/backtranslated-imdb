Big disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT is way too talkative and dizzy, and the dialogue does not sound as true as it comes from these characters. This is melodrama at its peak. The spectacle is really exaggerated and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as supporting players give this movie a zipper. I wish they had more to do. I am someone who looks at details in movies. Two Big Questions ... 1 Who watches the baby all day, when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas works and then quits a fight with his father in a bar? 2. When Stanwyck packs to leave the city, why did she see her parked at a brother place where she has not lived for at least two years? If everyone goes into the projection room of the theater, who will take care of the baby again? Such details really irritate me and cause me to rate films with much lower ratings. What were the authors, directors, and anyone else involved in film thinking? Nuf said.
