It's just when a band goes on tour and has only one original member. It's not the same as the classic line-up. All new actors playing the lead roles of Rag, Scotty, etc., with Ashby being virtually the only recurring face of the first movie. The first film was minor and served as the only redeemable group of the three boys Scotty wanted to support in meeting women. The film is poorly written and shows the dumbest dialogue on this page by Armageddon. Even for a T & A movie, this is a turkey. Not even the die-hard fans of the 80s movies would want to watch this movie, which has no plot and a lot of bad acting. It would have been better if this movie was never released. Only bad.
