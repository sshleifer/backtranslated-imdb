First, they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality, then they get voices that do not match the original. They make so many movie mistakes. When Sasha sings in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and reappears. Itchy's shirt changes color, his hat changes position, one of the bridges is white, everyone in the background appears bold, halos change colors and appear and disappear. Even the sky looks different. I do not mind if it's a low budget movie, it should not cut the animations. They totally ruined the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
