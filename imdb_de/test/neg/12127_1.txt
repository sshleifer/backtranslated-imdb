This movie was awful. Acting was lame, but it's hard to tell if someone behaved well because the writing was so bad. This is one of the worst movies by Johnny Depp. I despise everyone urgently to look at him. <br /> <br /> However, if you need to see cry baby, I recommend muting it and just cheating on Mr. Depp for an hour and a half.
