The real star of the last airport films is this big supersonic carrier, which the French called The Concorde. Considering that the whole movie is supposed to show what the plane with the needle-shaped nose in the sky can do, the movie makes sense somehow. <br /> <br /> But if you expect serious drama Here, be sure to take some of the evasive action the Concorde shows here when some hideous people try to shoot them down. Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the lover of the military tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's assistants only casually brings information about Wagner's dirty business by selling weapons to people who are not friends with the United States. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed before her and she is almost done by a batsman whom she escapes, of course, she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course he denies it. Shortly before Blakely enters the Concorde, the widow Kathleen Maguire from McCalman gives her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his henchmen try to down the big bird. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy are up to all their tricks. It's quite a sack, as you'll see, if you want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an avid aficionado you will not care less. It's like the movie Le Mans starring Steve McQueen, who has a legion of car racing that made him a cult object. Maybe Le Mans is better because they just have not dealt with any story. Among the passengers heard a smoking saxophonist, played by Jimmie Walker, a desperate mother who accompanied a new heart for her child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye, a woman with weak bladder who made the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the bathroom spends. She is actually the best here. <br /> <br /> Robert Wagner must have been psychic, as I'm sure that he got the role of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series because of the strength of this movie /> <br /> I am Sure, all concerned had a big payroll from this movie, but it seems the movie saga was killed by movies.
