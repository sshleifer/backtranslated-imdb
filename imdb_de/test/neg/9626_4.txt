Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and artworks, the circus and the ethereal feeling, the movie was great. The audience only had to worry about the fate of our protagonist. Because she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of danger, unlike David Lynch's films, which persecute each time. This also draws attention to the age group targeted by this film. For whom would that engage? <br /> <br /> Mirrormask will obviously make comparisons with Labyrinth on Teenage Fear / Imagination, but unfortunately, there is not nearly the same Henson Essence. The theme of the sick mother is never fully explained and certainly not something that is close to your heart. <br /> <br /> Not terribly awful in The Cell or as enticing as Labyrinth - an unforgettable, but good-looking fantasy.
