A bit weird, as the comments for this movie went downhill constantly, add mine now. I think the script could have been saved by better acting and a better script. Together, it was difficult to watch, and I'm not afraid of such topics. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this movie offered) but even she stayed behind. I can not blame them, who knows what the director and / or the editor left behind on the cutting surface. The entire movie was "okay, that's enough, let's keep going" one, as I know that more was to be gained by the actors and the script, which had some good lines and interesting topics. <Br / I do not think that this is considered spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene in which Sigourney marched to the house of her alleged tormentor, having this face in the face and I thought, "this is the face of someone who is. " It is exaggerated, as it is to see someone in a motor home "and really, the next shot should shock us. I am sure, the tyrant lives in a trailer and not in a nice house like hers. <Br / > <How have pointed out many other posters, there are SO mANY better films with similarly airy screenplays about tangled families who make the grades better - "Celebration" is probably the ultimate example that I have seen.
