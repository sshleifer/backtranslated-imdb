This movie was painfully horrible. Most of the film consisted of people walking in the woods, walking in the woods, or dancing in the woods. At least more than half. Then two children, discovering two horribly mutilated bodies in the forest, return the next night for a romantic walk in the forest. ????? There is no temporal continuity. his day, his night, his day, it's really night, his dusk, his deep black, his day. All forest scenes go on until you think you are going crazy. really bad. The sheriff discovers a five-foot claw-pinned embedded forest in the woods and suspects that a very large alligator has learned to walk upright. Really a stupid movie with no real motivation for the characters. Could be entertaining for little kids, as an alternative to really graphic material.
