I've mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot was shitty. The film was not really all about being single after a pact when one of Jerry O'Connell's friends marries. The other friends put this money together and whoever gets married gets the money ($ 10,000) from all his friends. Anyway, the movie just tries to go through it by not doing any and making it funnier than doing. I'm glad I only paid .50 for this movie. It was not good at all. I rated it with **** of 10 stars!
