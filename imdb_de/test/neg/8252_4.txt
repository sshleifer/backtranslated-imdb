What about mathematical geniuses that allow the critics to flow? A BEAUTIFUL MIND was not worth much in my opinion (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING earned the Oscar this year), while GOOD WILL HUNTING had unjustifiably rewarded several awards. <br /> <br /> First of all, the script. When I attended film school, I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example of how not to start a script, and the tutor was right. There is no kind of opening hook in this film, and most of the time it is very slow. If you wrote such an unsolicited script, the script reader would have given it up on page 15. <br /> <br /> Structure aside the idea that a member of the American subclass is an intellectual god who does not really ring true. Ask yourself the following: If he's the smartest character in the movie, why did he go through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Not a single teacher from his childhood has noticed his gift? Very unlikely, since he has read so much mind-resolving literature. And if Will is so smart, why is he so forgetting what happens to young, handsome boys in American prisons? <br /> <br /> But it's the casting that has failed most of the movie. You want to get some actors to play the tough Irish gang members? Let's get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, which makes Russell Crowe play a pacifist, or Charles Bronson, to play a liberal Do Gooder. I could not convince myself of the ill-minded Damon and Affleck as they stroked that they had people in their heads, and I could not help but think that although they wrote the script, the parts were given to different actors after all, Billy Bob Thornton has done scripts for films he has not been cast into, and here the same criteria should apply. <br /> <br /> The film has some good points. Robin Williams is excellent as the man who wants to show off his potential, and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard, who is simply one of the greatest character actors to have walked outside of Europe, and despite my previous criticism of the script he is moving one Piece of dialogue in the park, as William's character Will explains what he's seen in life. <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are fewer pluses than negatives to this film, and I have to agree with people too who said GOOD WILL JAGDING is boring and unconvincing
