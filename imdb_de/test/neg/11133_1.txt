Whoa, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The foil packaging is better than the foil itself. My girlfriend and I saw it last weekend, and we kept on pursuing it hoping that it would get better ... it did not work ... <br /> <br /> It looks like it was taken on video and put on film. The lighting is not great, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The acting itself was cheesy, but I think it's acceptable for "another" teenage horror movie. The sound was a huge problem: sometimes the video needs to be rewound because the sound is unclear and / or muffled. I try to ride on the coattails of "Sleepy Hollow". Do not bother with this.
