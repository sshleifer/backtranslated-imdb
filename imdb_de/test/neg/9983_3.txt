210-minute version (extremely hardcore, I hear) or the R-Rated version released in theaters? Both are terribly terrible, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell both said they wished they had never made this movie (the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!), And I can see why. Nothing but a silly mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at conspiracy. Not much, except cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: "It was like a moment when I was staring, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians focusing on it." <br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
