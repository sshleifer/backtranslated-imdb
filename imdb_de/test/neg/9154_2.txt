THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a very successful bestseller and was probably featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its run. So what happened when the novel became a TV movie? Maybe it's the mediocre screenplay below (oops !, teleplay!) By John Pielmeier, which consistently blunders in awkward pedestrian fashion undermining all credibility of the story. Maybe it's the cut and insert direction of Mick Jackson that misses the tempo and character drawing. Maybe it suffers from the cinematography of a non-credible source or the score "Liquid Tears" by Daniel Licht. For all these (or all of these) reasons, the novel-to-film persists because it is a good argument to educate the public about the abilities of Down Syndrome borns. And for that it is worth the attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic physician, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and her life is changed by the pregnancy. On a stormy winter's night in Kentucky, Norah goes into labor and Henry hurries to a nearby clinic where David gets his wife (the doctor is caught in a blizzard), along with his old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson) , After giving birth to a perfect boy (Paul), Norah still has contractions and (surprisingly ...) delivers an unexpected (!) Twin girl. David and Caroline immediately realize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a "Mongoloid" (before using the term Down syndrome), and David, who has in the past lost a baby sister due to a birth defect, decides to send Phoebe to an institution for the mentally handicapped: Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told that the second twin died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows the instructions, sees the conditions of the 'house' where Phoebe is to be dumped, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child. With the help of a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her lonely existence and her mothers Phoebe and find a new life in Pittsburgh of her trucker. Norah insists on an official funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and the life of Henry continues with only one child, Paul, who is stifled by the lack of Phoebe's presence. Norah gives away David with a camera ("People's lives are like a camera, they live there - in a space held by a moment") and David is obsessed with photography. Norah mourns, drinks and loses David's attention as David pursues Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford of Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's unfaithfulness and is upset over his father's lack of communication and understanding. He decides to reach his goal of becoming a musician and goes to Juilliard. In the meantime, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has grown into a very attuned young girl, and the way Henry's broken marriage happens, and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe and Paul's life, coupled with the courage to join Caroline Gill struggling to win acceptance in the world for those who are born with Down syndrome, forms the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast of well-known actors is very hard-working, but only Emily Watson can revive a believable character from this squishy script. Jamie Spilchuk testifies to a promising young actor. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters from the insanity lines given to them. The movie is a mess, but the message about the acceptance of Down syndrome children and adults is important. Grady harp
