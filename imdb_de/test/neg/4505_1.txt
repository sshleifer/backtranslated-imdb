The evil is about a big house in which a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture everything in it. What a washout of a movie! There is no scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna plays a role of nothing. There are some animated ghosts, a disfigurement with the chainsaw and a ghost rape. After almost nothing special almost the whole movie The Evil happens in ... Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary? He looks like he's looking for a paychecked guest to pay his alcohol bill. Then it's too late to turn it off because the damned thing is over. I felt like throwing the videocassette out the window. Please avoid this garbage! Hopefully it will never see the light of a DVD and go into the darkness.
