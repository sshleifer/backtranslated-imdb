I received this movie in a package called "50 All-Star Movies" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This one was terrible. It was a crazy retread that ran 1000 times before and was better every time. A crippled ex-jock is allowed to train a team of juvenile delinquents. They learn from him that they can do it if they stick to the rules. I am sure that the children and the locals were thrilled to be included in a "real TV movie", but I can not imagine what brought the people who launched and produced this project to this already overwhelmed topic. I have always been waiting to see this "new twist" or "new angle", but honestly, it does not come. Avoid this movie. Forget the 45 cents, I want the 96 minutes of my life back.
