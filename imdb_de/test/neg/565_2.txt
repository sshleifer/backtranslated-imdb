Committed doom and fool Peter Watkins meanders across the pond to take over American justice around 1971 with this precious Zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far to the left that it is constantly tipping over. Watkins is a mere tourist as he puts together this bandage tragedy, with clich√©d freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries fighting against evicting police and military, and a kangaroo court made up of disapproving calcified adults making bad fashion statements. Talk about a revolution. At Punishment Park, we have a radical juvenile against a corrupt system, as dissidents convicted of crimes have the choice between prison or a three-day trek through Punishment Park (Death Valley) and the freedom to decide. Of course, the police officers monitoring their journey are not going to play fair, and in combination with the oppressive heat, the fate of our protagonists seems sealed. <br /> <br /> In Punishment Park, elements of Kafka are presented in both the setting and theme. Trials are taking place under a large canvas tent where captive prisoners defy a hardcore fan or leave it to a group of inquisitors (such as members of the Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who cry out. Neither group has spent much of their time listening to the other, and the confrontation eventually takes place in the fight between teenagers and parents. Most of the time, it's just a page that says what's wrong with America, the other, what's right, without anyone offering solutions to change. Meanwhile, the martyrs of the Punishment Park stumble endlessly around the dessert, while the cops behave with pistols like twelve-year-olds. It somehow has the look and feel of some of my 70s college film lesson lessons when we were younger and knew more than we do now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as corrupt, powerful few. Culledon was in the 18th century in Scotland a strong charge of military atrocities, which still resonates. War Game is a sobering look at the nuclear consequences that should be of concern to everyone. The Punishment Park has its value but also for other reasons than intended. Watkins' vision today is a textbook example of the full-tilt adversarial paranoia of the 1970s, and in the face of time (Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7) such stern hysteria did not seem far from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever has subsided, and Punishment Park, with its unrestricted narrow vantage point, is a pretty stupid ride.
