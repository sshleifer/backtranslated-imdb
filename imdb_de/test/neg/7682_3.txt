I'm sorry, people, I love Ray Bolger's work, but the only thing he's not is a leading man. If you act as if he were the last man on earth, this romantic plot might work, but come now! <br /> <br /> Here's a movie just to present the title track, which was a great success for the Basie band the year before (1951). And some pretty sophisticated songs and dances save it from a total catastrophe. <br /> <br /> However, the plot itself is pitiful for musical comedy standards of 1952. And the other songs are as memorable as Evening In Paris Cologne. The dialogue embarrasses the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin's Boyeresque charm retains its character in three dimensions. <br /> <br /> How can you enjoy this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward through all dialogues ... <br /> <br /> B.) Pass Doris Day's vocals and Ray Bolger's loose-fitting footwork. And do not miss Dauphin's hilarious take on a rain-soaked, windswept version of "April In Paris" ... <br /> <br /> C.) Finally, keep a few bottles of Cabernet refrigerated and handy. <br /> <br /> Bob Raymond
