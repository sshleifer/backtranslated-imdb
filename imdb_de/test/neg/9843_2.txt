If this film had been directed by a man, he would have been imprisoned. While Adrian Lyne was tied up in the editor's office with a lawyer to appease the censorship of a classic literary piece and to prevent the 1996 Child Pornography Protection Act from being violated, a woman throws Ripe at us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to the blatant pedophilia, this film is extremely absurd. Has this woman never entered an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is that? The uniforms must come from uniforms-R-Us. Just throw a few patches, who cares? Just make sure that each of them has a big red one. There is a small insider joke that the Auteur has undoubtedly gone over his head but may have been pushed in by the one who delivered the military vehicles. Certainly there were no military advisors. The US Army does not operate slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner. The US Army does not allow 14-year-old girls to work at military bases and does not allow them to use the shooting ranges or training courses. Sexually growing girls requires a lot of drama. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with it.
