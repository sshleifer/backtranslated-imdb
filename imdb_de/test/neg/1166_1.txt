When "Deranged" was made, the filmmakers saw the opportunity to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb, though the resulting film actually came close to the facts of the notorious case. I suppose enough was invented that they thought they should change names and the like. "Ed Gein - The Butcher Of Plainfield" masquerades as a true story telling the Gein case, but bears little resemblance to history. As a biopic film, this is a travesty. If ever a movie needs a name that changes, this one is far more than Deranged. It's as close to the real crime story as "Dirty Harry" was the true story of the Zodiac murders. OK, well, that annoyance aside, how is it as a horror movie? Well, as a horror movie that's pretty awful. One of the worst movies I've played for months. The expenses are as follows: 1) Kane Hodder is astonishingly wrong as Ed Gein. Hodder is absolutely inappropriate in this part and growls menacingly threateningly. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the cast is more "amateur drama" and totally disconnected. It is painful to see how some lines are delivered. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional effort of stylish filmmaking seems to come from "The Big Book Of Moody Cinematography Clich√©". You have seen everything before, done better. Apart from the effort for style, the rest of the film production is largely inappropriate: cameras shake, the imaging is poor, there are long meaningless recordings that hold back the pace ... which makes me ... <br /> <br / > 4) It seems to go on forever. It's less than 90 minutes, but it's a torment. They would swear it was two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein seems almost secondary. Mostly, the film deals with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff. This member of parliament is played by a miserable actor, on whose shoulders no film should rest. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about it? Well, the Gore FX are very good. Some convincing wounds are shown and the make-up is generally excellent. None of this compensates for the massive failure of the film. <br /> <br /> It does not even have a kitsch sword, it's just bad; not pleasingly bad, not "that bad is good", just really bad. A movie to avoid and despise.
