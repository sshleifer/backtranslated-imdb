I saw this movie on TCM this morning. Very bad demeanor, low budget and bad action are the impressions I felt while watching the movie. The only highlight of the film was the tender young Rita Moreno (23 years old), who played an Indian Indian Indian woman who fell in love with an older man in her fifties. It reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), just an innocent Lolita. She bounces up and down like a fifties teenage bopper, almost as if you expect her to chew gum, raid that old man, and be ready to give him anything because he turns it down as if she's interfering with him , Any man in his fifties who had a pretty virgin teenage girl who was willing to do EVERYTHING for him and be his bride would be crazy not to use her. It is a pity that the censorship of the time, when this film was released, did not allow the expansion of a character like Rita Moreno's. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 is Rita Moreno's appearance in the movie.
