Immediately, Clint Eastwood's final tribute to the once-great West. But while I thought that would be good and raise the bar for future Westerns, I was sadly wrong. Unforgettable, though simple in the plot, the characters and emotions are struggling, and I would say with certainty that Unforgiven is Eastwood's worst movie yet. Eastwoods himself seems to be too old to play the role of acting and directing, giving the overall picture of the movie a fall. <br /> <br /> All characters appear hurried and torn at the edges, especially the character of Eastwoods. The drama does not seem to flow and contributes to what the characters feel. The direction is badly mislead by bizarre shots. Overall, Unforgiven is not the best Eastwoods and by far one of the worst westerns in the world.
