I can not impose any knowledge of cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love your people. In July, my 14-year-old son and I traveled to Cappadocia in Turkey to search for remnants of the neighborhood where his great-grandfather Iordanis lived until the great Anatolian exodus of 1923. Reading the Summary of the Film (Refugees from Odessa) I thought maybe I would learn something more about the forced migrations of modern Greeks. If I had not had a home in Rhodes, I would not have been to Greece 28 times in so many years, would have been unfamiliar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and never enjoyed the friendship of these lively, life-touching people, I would have believed that this lawsuit has something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at a New Jersey State College, may I assure you that I am familiar with the history of the reporting period. In fact, my wife's uncle was murdered by the Communists during the communist raid. My mother-in-law went through the Italian invasion and the German occupation ... hardly. These characters speak Greek, they listen to Greek music, but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course, these are not human beings, but merely allegories. They are what the artist invents when the life of his perception, as it was or should have been, does not fully correspond or is inappropriate. All represent an aspect of post-World War I Greece, where larger external forces were exposed to a fate that they did not deserve. As we joked in America in the late '70s: "The revolution did not happen." This is no joke for an ideologue / artist. It is indeed reason to undergo two and a half hours torture. And all because the different powers (Elenis monologue of the guards in different colored uniforms) of the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) did not allow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, ie the movement, the cause). This dark, surreal revisionism blurs the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their zest for life through the tragedies of the twentieth century, to reach more than any of its neighbors in the Balkans, to have developed politically and globally.
