Super Troopers was immediately a classic. Club Dread was disappointing for many but had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw below that it was made by the group Broken Lizard who made Super Troopers. I only found one scene to laugh out loud. Far from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you have plenty of free time and really need to kill some time. However, it is better to play video games or see something that makes you laugh or think.
