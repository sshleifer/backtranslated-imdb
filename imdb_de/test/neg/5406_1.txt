As of this writing, no reviews have yet been submitted, but there are 17 votes, with an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I did not notice, and even if I did, I did not think I would have been able to roll my eyes long enough to appreciate them. Science, police tactics and the like that are so common in B movies should be enjoyable significantly affect. I tend to fall into the "Yes, that's a sensible response" camp - especially when the bugs are at the heart of the plot. With this film, I look forward to reading how everyone can defend this mess. They mess up pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside B movies). In short, I can not think of anything trivial about what they understood correctly. <br /> <br /> Every film would have done its job, if its central premise is a supernatural spirit, inaccessible to all small arms and disappearing at will into another dimension, apparently vulnerable to a bigger explosion. (They do not make ghosts as they used to.) Combine that premise with every detail that's wrong and you have a memorable bad movie.
