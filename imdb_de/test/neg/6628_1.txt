Carrot Top's "Chairman of the Board" and his AT & T commercials are living proof that flying feces are available in orange. Not freely available as HBO charges for such garbage. Blehhh! The COTB's salvation is that it will surely fill out suicide hotlines across the country and potentially provide work for thousands of telephone therapists who have lost their jobs after discredit of dis- erited memory treatment, even though Carrot Top (unfortunately) becomes its sponsor AT & T. T contributes to the increased traffic of devastating HBO viewers. I can imagine the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, one-handed calls and fully loaded .45 machines in the other hand. I select the last minute of despair before stepping away from the plank of life to resist the ghost of the COTB orange in its synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.
