This movie was so bad that it was fun. If you want to see a soap opera, opt for an action movie, this is for you! Exaggeration, irrelevant incidents, implausible dialogue - it has everything. The main character has a split personality and can not decide if he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. He is not plausible in any of these roles. This sets the standard for many of the other characters. The boss of the company, whose building is on fire, has the same unpredictability, as does his wife. And the punchline - who took the "chip" - believes in it. I laughed heartily and for that reason I recommend you to look at it.
