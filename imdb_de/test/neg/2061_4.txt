A girl is looking for her soul mate - this movie was very strange - many sequences that look like hallucinations. Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable in the picture. It was hard to figure out what the director wanted to say ... Mostly the main character is dressed in strange clothes and makeup. A funny combination of reality and madness.
