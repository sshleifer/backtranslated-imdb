I'm rarely motivated to write a review, unless the quality of the movie inspires him. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was so uninspired that I felt the need to warn others how bad this TV miniseries are. Here are a few thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: They came as if in a Saturday Night Live Skit and made fun of talking to the Indians. When McMurtry writes in his novels Dialog, it reads so interesting; I'm not sure how they finished what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: Looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke series. Acting is fine and Robert Duvalls McCrae's behaviors are correct, but the look is a pure cowboy. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe next time you could use some dirt or sweat. Have you ever been in Austin during the summer before there's air conditioning? I promise you that women did not look like that. Do you think they have never seen any consequences of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Whenever they are in the governor's office, it feels like a Saturday Night Live Skit, and the sketch is a bombing raid. Woodrow Call: Call is the most sensible character, of course he talks as little as you can screw it up? But hey, what about this hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and add that he is not even a bit scary. They should have got Javier Bardem to play the role. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: Right out of "O Brother, Where Art Thou," I expected George Cloony to come and break into a song. <br /> Maybe I'm premature because the mini-series is not finished yet, but I doubt I'll watch any more of it somehow. <br /> <br /> I would not expect anyone to be able to copy that captivating feeling of Lonesome Dove, but I watch that and it seems they have no feeling for the Old West at all.
