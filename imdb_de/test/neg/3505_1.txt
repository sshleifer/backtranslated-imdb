I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations and was disappointed. First, they used every cheesy racism clich√© in the book. It was so predictable. For example, the young Latino guy knew from the beginning that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character was played millions of times, a police officer who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree at the end of the film. Predictability hardly ended in these characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The moral of the story was PC maximum. There were a few clever twists, but not nearly enough. The dialouge was sometimes embarrassing. Not everything was bad. I just can not believe that this movie has achieved a high score so far. It was entertaining, just a little offensive to his intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve, but it was very short.
