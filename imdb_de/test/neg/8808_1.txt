There are bad movies and there are movies that are even worst. Saw is just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is just plain bad in every way. The action, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible, and I can not understand how such a garbage gets on the big screen with holes. The beginning is tempting and leaves much to be expected, but does not last and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and leaves no credibility. People who claim that this movie is bloody, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because it's far from it. If you have any form of intellect, you'll be disappointed. A real boredom and a mediocre movie, as it can be.
