Showtime was the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because if Deniro is in the cast, this immediately increases the credibility and you want to see the movie. I also made the mistake of seeing 48 Hours and Beverly Hills cop recently before seeing Showtime. For some strange reason, Eddie Murphy still found it funny. He is not. In fact, it seems he has been castrated. When I saw this movie, I was very surprised that Deniro decided that this script was good enough to give his name. No chemistry between him and Murphy. Terrible writing, terrible jokes, a movie that you think is good can not get much worse. Not too long after sitting through the misery of Showtime, I happened to be watching National Security with Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts, but was not that great. Nevertheless, it was 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if your Deniro fan does NOT MONITOR this movie !!
