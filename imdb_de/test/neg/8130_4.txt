The greedy landowner in the small town west of Prairie City wants all the ranchers to leave their lands, using intimidation tactics and arson to clear them; Apparently, the city floats on oil and if a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is hired by the baron. Soon the farmer's son of a sailor's son arrives, slowly realizing what he has to do and trying to gather the rest of the inhabitants to fight. Another story of lawlessness in the West where everyone is under the thumb of the villain (who, of course, keeps all his cards). Distracting and uncomfortable to see, with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his shed. The half-hearted Swedish accent of Sterling Hayden is a big problem, though it shows a robust, sympathetic presence on screen and makes the picture almost worth seeing. Director Joseph H. Lewis stages most of the scenes as starkly as a TV western, and Gerald Fried's bugle-heavy score is of no help, though the rich black and white camera of Ray Rennahan is excellent. An independent production released by United Artists has a bizarre beginning (beginning with the beats from the finale followed by the beats from the middle section of the film), but it does have a certain needle size that brings the viewer safely to Hayden's side , ** from ****
