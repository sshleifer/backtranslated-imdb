The wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good thing that comes from this kind of pointless hustle and bustle is the fact that films that receive these films cause the distribution. I mean, if this is the market for Indy Horror, I could make a fortune that will make me 83 minutes while I get the garbage out. <br /> <br /> A full list of shortcomings that are missing from this movie would take way too long. But the highlights are: no story, terrible spectacle, terrible cinematography and virtually no editing. The last one bothered me the most. As Editor-in-Chief, this movie absolutely drove me crazy, because it was hardly edited at all. Each scene was shot in a master. They had absolutely no cover. For those who do not know that "cover" cuts off a scene from different angles to have editing options when editing to create a desirable viewing experience. Yes, this movie had none of it. I'm talking about the simplest scenes. For example, a common conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would normally start with a master who determines who is in the scene and where they are. Then, while the conversation is continuing, you would shoot back and forth over the shoulder as the conversation continues. You can even throw one or two cutaway shots on the table or in someone else's hand. Something. That's "Movie 101," people. It seems that these people have no idea how movies work. Each shot was a camera lock. No movement, no cutting, nothing. If I teach a course in filmmaking, this would be the visual aid to my lesson "What not to do". <br /> <br /> Finally, you should not waste your time. The only astonishing thing about this movie is that it even achieved a distribution. <br /> <br /> <br />
