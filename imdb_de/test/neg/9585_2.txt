This is the worst exercise in the presumption of the middle class seen on our television screens so far. Unfortunately I did not see it when it was shown for the first time, but I paid for the pleasure of seeing six hours of excitement - and I'm still waiting for the laughter to come. I love Tasmin Greig, who was a big fan of Black Books and Green Wing and therefore knows that she has mastered the best comedy parts. However, she played this role as well as she was able to, given the lack of any decent comedy material. Please note that broadcasters are aware that the Trades Descriptions Act may be used if you continue to expect comedy material that is at best a pseudo-psychological romance and, at worst, a drama that turns out to be a bizarre comedy to hide the fact that neither fish nor poultry exists.
