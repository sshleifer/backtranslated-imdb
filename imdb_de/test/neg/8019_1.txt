A few teenagers have some sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's all. They say they are fifteen while one of the actors is actually twenty-five. Perhaps this film was a little revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching "taboo" themes, but I can not imagine that at that time anything that was shown in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo disco music still is flatter. The selection of songs is nothing more than the well-known "classics", which can still be heard on every second radio station today. The plot of American Pie is not much different, but at least a little funny. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable that there were six sequels!
