This movie definitely made me laugh, but that does not mean it was exactly funny. Well, my friends and I had a lot of fun watching. <br /> <br /> I doubt there's anything about this movie that has not been done twice, as well as the storyline. All characters are overloaded film clich√© cardboard rolls that do not even require acting skills. Accordingly, such capabilities are not provided. We have the corrupt cop, a ruthless murderer who claims to take care of his husbands and their families while he's not caring for people he shoots near the forehead so he spits blood into his face. We have the "worn-out policeman on the edge," so nicely pointed out in the discussion rounds of this film; We retired the old one-day MP, who must have identified just about everyone as the most likely man inside, as he had the most to gain and did not speak the word in the film. As transparent as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all the previous big black gangster kings in film history (they could have just called him Marcellus Wallace), but only a little tougher and ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne's good movies. Then we finally have the highly educated doctor, who does not come up with any idea as soon as the situation is different from their normal life, and who sits in a corner most of the time trying helplessly to figure out how to hold on to the gun that she got. DO NOT USE. <br /> <br /> The entire siege story is not interesting, not original (has been used twice already), and this movie can not add anything interesting. There is the first probe, then the siege, then the attack and then the escape attempts. Meanwhile, a bunch of strained, stressed, freaky policemen and thugs manage to stop a police squad with high-tech equipment and the very important advantage of VISION. In the deep night, when the power is down and a blizzard is raging, a lot of light comes in anyway, so who cares about night vision? <br /> <br /> But the best comes at the very end. In the first scenes of Precinct 13, we see that it is located on the outskirts of an industrial city; Factories and office buildings surround him on all sides. From that point, the besieged walk is perhaps a hundred yards in a sewer and where do they land? An alley ends in the middle of the forest! A FOREST! Where does this forest come from? Who decided to plant a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How was this forest in the last scene suddenly on a hill above the city in question, while he looked in the scenes in the forest deceptively FLAT? <br /> <br /> From here I leave you the judgment and your common sense. Watch this movie if you are looking for an unwanted good laugh. I really recommend it.
