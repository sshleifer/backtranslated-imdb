This film is trying hard to be an "action" movie, but it fails miserably. Steve Guttenberg plays the head of a high-profile anti-terrorist team that fails (?) To keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent. <br /> <br /> The story ... the drama ... the special effects ... ALL FALL FLAT !!! <br /> <br /> Definitely NOT MUST AVOID! !!!
