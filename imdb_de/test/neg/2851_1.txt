First of all, I have to say that I really love Udo Kier and that Armand Assante always has respect, but nothing could save this train wreck. Udo appears in the movie much later, and Everyone's acting is just awful. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is made of wood, the "action" is ridiculous and the plot could be summarized on a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie, but I held my hands in front of my eyes, shaking my head and repeating over and over again, "Oh Udo ..... why ??? ???". If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please do not watch this movie. It just makes you sad for her.
