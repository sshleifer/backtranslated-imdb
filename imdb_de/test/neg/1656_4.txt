I was so looking forward to this movie that I can not really understand how I felt I would enjoy it. I'm afraid it's really a yawning party - every single customer in the movie theater I attended yawned and fidgeted a lot throughout the movie. It's a shame because it's a fantastic story - I tend to think it's better to read. It does not help that the main character only shows his teeth once - and that was the camera angle. As the story evolves, it becomes easier to understand the main character's dilemma. However, the tension and drama that could have made this film a truly high-profile film were completely spoiled by the boring treatment. Boring like a half-frozen documentary!
