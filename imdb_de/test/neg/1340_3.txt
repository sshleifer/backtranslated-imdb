I went to this film with a bit of trembling; The original is a masterpiece of writing and acting, and unfortunately my fears have been realized. This is a humorless work and I sat in the theater, waiting for humor and humor to begin - I'm still waiting, it seems. Updating the plot to the present day just did not work and changing the characters was an absolute travesty - why did they introduce Bette Midler's character as she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived; The related character in the original of 1939 was an integral part of the plot. The women in the cinema laughed a few times, but nothing touched me as funny, except for a line by Meg Ryan, who talked to her mother about her situation and told her that it was not a 1930s film. I really wish I was watching the 1930 version. It was all too tricky, the sisters stick together "and really needed some of the bitter joke and skilful dialogue of the original game. I still watch the original movie and grab a line I've never caught before. There is no feeling of closure for this new version, and although the film from 1939 is politically incorrect from today's point of view, every thread was tied and when the film came to an end, he did so strongly. This remake should be marked with a warning for all viewers. If you know the original, do not worry: I felt cheated when I lost a part of my life in a movie theater when I saw this unforgotten piece of fluff. Bring on the jungle red !!
