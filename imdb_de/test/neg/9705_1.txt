I'm sorry to say, but was disappointed in the movie. It was very hectic, as I suspect that you could understand a movie-length version of Pride & Prejudice, and I felt that many of the great scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. Unfortunately, because the movie is so hectic, you can not really experience and feel much about each character. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this movie is boring. I say that with a capital letter B. 1/3 of the way I started to yawn and could not wait until the movie is over. When I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes were needed before I could leave the cinema. Mr. Darcy, whoever he is in this movie definitely can not act. He also looks too young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed as if it came through the script or something. Where is the structure? At first he seems confused with everything. He is just bizarre! It all looks like it. <br /> <br /> Did not try to compare the Colin Firth version, but if you love this version you will most likely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as a type of women's fashion, and did not grow up in a stumble. Her clothes suggest that she may be the poorest peasant farmer in England. <br /> <br /> I disagree with some of the scenes in the film because I do not think it would be right In this society where men do such things, Mr. Bingley, who has wealth, should to know better. There are some things that sound too modern for the time this movie is playing, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shocking, for me he behaves like a fool, not a character you can like and respect. What about his laugh !!! I have little presence in Wickham and Mr. & Mrs. Hurst and some other characters have no presence at all. Keira was fine, but it's not the same.
