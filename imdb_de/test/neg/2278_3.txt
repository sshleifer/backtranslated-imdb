This was formerly referred to as the "image of a woman" and later as the "chick snippet" when times and films became more youthful. The plot is just a soap opera for women and will only appeal to those guys. The only incentive for most men is when they want to see a dreaded Mary Tyler Moore in jerseys. (If you're at a certain age like me, that may still be enough to take a look at.) Otherwise, MTM gives another typical number of appearances she has been giving since the early 1970s when she took them Hearts that she was America's treasure. Christine Lathi gives another of these abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem to be a real part of her as a person, and probably only appeal to those of her kind. (Sorry, but it seems to be true.) Ted Danson is too young as MTM's husband and usually makes a somewhat scary appeal, unless he has a acting partner who can temper him. And that does not happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably had everything gone crazy because he had previously worked with Mary when Project wrote for her and she had the juice at that time to finish it. It seems to have no other purpose.
