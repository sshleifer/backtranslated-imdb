I have just seen this early experimental short film by William Vance and Orson Welles on UbuWeb. Yes, you read that right, Orson Welles! Years ago, when he became famous for "The War of the Worlds" and his movie debut Kane, Welles was a 19-year-old who just found his muse. In addition to Vance and Welles Virginia Nicholson was there, who would become the first wife of Orson. She plays a woman who sits on something that is rocked back and forth by an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in Blackface). During this time, a man (Welles) always passes by her (courtesy of the scene, which keeps repeating itself). I will not betray any more, except to say how interesting the silent pictures were, as they are constantly jumping. That's not to say that was good, but it was fascinating to see, even if the 2005 guitar score (by Larry Morotta) was added. A look for Welles lovers and all those who have a taste of the avant-garde.
