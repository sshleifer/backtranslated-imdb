You'd think a movie with three of the biggest male movie stars of the post-war era would have become a classic. These three, who also happen to be my three favorites, walk around dizzy and look like they'd rather be somewhere but there. The sad thing is that The Way West definitely had the potential to be a classic. In these days of political correctness, a film about American pioneers and the labors of their westward migration is not made now. It should have been better then. <br /> <br /> Kirk Douglas is a former United States Senator driving west a wagon train to build a settlement in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Since he is a former politician, he is higher than what he leads. The script requires that he not only has a covered wagon, but also a carriage to guide the train. <br /> <br /> You think that's ridiculous should you see the whip scene in which Douglas orders his black servant who is being played by Roy Glenn to whip him. I'm not going to spoil it by saying what makes Douglas demand this from Glenn, but believe me, it's bad. Robert Mitchum is the guide and among the three stars he looks most bored. There should be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum just saunters through the movie about it all. <br /> <br /> Maybe the friction helped a bit because the movie asked for Douglas, a widower, to keep an eye on Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she is the best thing in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie bill is about introducing Sally Field. This was done between her gidget and her Flying Nun days. She plays a piece of white southern garbage with the musical comedy name Mercy McBee. We first see her sitting in the movie on the back of her parental wagon, her legs akimbo and inviting. Of course she will be accepted on her invitation. <br /> <br /> Her character is something that can be found in every caravan park in America, which in turn was a wagon train, but a large caravan park that is on the move. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field made a career with two Oscars. What this woman had to overcome. Victor McLaglen's son, Andrew, directed this point and turned him into a clumsy mess with a lousy script. Too bad about Andrew McLaglen, he has certainly done better in his career.
