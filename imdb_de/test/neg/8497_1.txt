This movie has made you crazy. I think the original of this movie, 'The Mask', was a great movie worth buying and a lot to watch. I was convinced that they should make a sequel, but when I saw that, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This movie has spoiled the whole idea of ​​'The Mask'. Screen mode? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother, who is seven years old, did not even laugh, and he loves those childlike movies, but that was worse. A load of crap !! I tell you now, please do not look at this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you could actually have fun! Look at 'The Mask' but not, I do NOT repeat it, look at this garbage. Many Thanks.
