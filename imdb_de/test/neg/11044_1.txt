This movie was one of the longest movie experiences of my life. I like the way director Chan-wook Park dealt with the revenge, but the whole train was terrible. Oldboy will only be billed for 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it does feel like it takes at least three and a half hours to tell this story. I'll say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easy to understand. I felt that some scenes were unnecessarily long and many dialogues repeated. If you have an aversion to annoying voices, you should not hear Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do) speak. If you are looking for a movie that will kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, just look away. If you do not want to watch a movie full of incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fighting scenes, serious torture scenes, and confusing flashbacks, this is not the movie for you.
