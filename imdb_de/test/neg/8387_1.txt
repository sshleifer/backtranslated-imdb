I've had the misfortune to see this movie lately and have to prevail. A friend bought it for Â£ 1 and insisted that we see it, as it sounded good from the story on the back cover. Ten minutes into the film, it was obvious that the actors were amateurs and this was extremely low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very poorly played, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes that looked unnecessarily long just for the movie to be of adequate length. <br /> <For example, if the main character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous time in this scene, with meaningless dialogues that do no real purpose or necessity for the plot. The lead actor allegedly seeks revenge on a woman who sleeps with men to infect her with HIV, she never thinks to be tested. Instead, he turns into an insane killer who decides to torture her before he kills and cuts her to pieces. <br /> <br /> If that sounds good and you think this will trigger a lot of gore, think again. This movie has no real bloody sequences and is pretty tame for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> He is not afraid, he does not let you think, he does not have fun. It may, however, make you fall asleep, it will certainly bore you to tears, so please save your despair and follow my headline. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM 1/2 of 10 (This does not deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The movie lasted 78 minutes but seemed like 2 1/2 hours.
