Wow ... <br /> <br /> Reading these comments, I see a remarkable sociocultural conflict issue between the US and the Dutch. The USA P.o.V. It seems that this is a pretty good little movie, Parker is a sympathetic hero, and the story is a light-hearted rendition of a transfigured form of reality. All three Dutch reviewers look at the world through a completely different pair of glasses it seems. They agree categorically and in surprisingly similar terms that the film is a disaster. <br /> <br /> It is far from me to take sides in a conflict between cultures, separating them geographically. Based on factual observation - I saw the movie with my own eyes - I suspect that the Dutch are not too far away: "Parker Kane" is badly made, totally boring and really not worth the celluloid that was undoubtedly wasted in its creation.
