Wow ... I suspected it was bad ... But now I'm just baffled ... Honestly, no words from me can justify this movie in any way ... <br /> <br / Me I'll still try to say something ... <br /> <br /> This is truly a unique gem. One of the worst types. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - Given His Background As An Actor - Performing A Whip Battle With A Toltec Wizard Zombie During The Pinnacle Of The Movie ... ??? A true stroke of genius, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> It's rare for me to laugh aloud when watching a movie alone. It happened several times with this. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, the man, the accents ... And the dialogues that I heard, how they heard ... And the acting itself ... I just could not 'I do not think so , what I have heard. <br /> <br /> This fat uncle farted so loud (when he walked up to the house with his little nephew) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> Tits! Yes, there are tits! And female ass! There's even a naked chick in the tub sipping a beer ... <br /> <br /> This "stretched out his mouth over his face" - the kill was the bomb! A real highlight. <br /> <br /> The comedy aspects were just nuts. I just could not believe what I saw and heard. For a while, I even thought they were unintentional and shook their heads in disbelief. About half of the movie I started to get a bigger picture. I think I needed half a movie to stew half of my brain to finally get it. <br /> <br /> It was really hard for me to believe this movie ... But it's good, really, I think. A black chick came to a tiny cabinet, opened it and then said, "Wooow, look at all the storage space!". And she said it as if she meant it. I mean, that's a good dialogue and a good show, right? <br /> <br /> Oh, and maybe needless to say: Lash La Rue's whipping skills suck in THE DARK POWER. It is really sad and pitiful to look at. That's all part of the comedy, of course. Or wait, I could be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was incredible with the whip! It was the publisher's fault. He screwed it up and cut his eyelashes and everything else. Or wait, it could have been the cameraman. He filmed from the wrong angles ... why did not Phil Smoot say anything? That's it, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'll just stop talking about it. Anyway, I have nothing meaningful to say except the fact that I hope my brain will recover from this experience ... some time later.
