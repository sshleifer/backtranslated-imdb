There seem to be many fans of this film, but I found it boring, slow, meandering and pointless. I watch and enjoy many arthouse and independent films, so I did not expect an action movie. I did not sympathize with any of the characters. The country man was a bad guest and did not seem very anxious to find a job, and his relative in Istanbul was humorless and emotionally closed. <br /> <br /> In an interview on the DVD, the director says that the film is a common situation in Turkey - the person who goes to the countryside because there are no jobs and she relents Come to Istanbul and stay with relatives while trying to find work. That in itself is interesting, but the movie was not like that.
