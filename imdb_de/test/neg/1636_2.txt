There are many reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made. Certainly there are many flaws: lackluster drama, rather boring and clich√©d and at times paradoxical script as well as the standard B-movie sound and "special effects". As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of actions that make _Cave Dwellers_ a fabric of fantasy movies, especially compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this movie is not the worst movie of all time. Most, if not all, including this review are written by fans of MSTK3. Therefore, many of these reviews are quite a few summaries of the _Cave Dwellers_ MSTK3 episode. <br /> <br /> In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow tell the crazy scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them. Of course, loyal fans have taken this quote and gone through with it. I find this movie appealing - not in a way that appeals to _Forrest Gump_ - but in the effort some of the performers put into this movie. This movie is ridiculous even without its MSTK3 treatment. That's because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take itself seriously and does not try to import a righteous topic into its viewers. For all monster dolls, hang gliding in the Middle Ages and the continuity of continuity - this movie does not advertise more than what it is, a flat representation of a rather flat genre. <br /> <br /> Likewise, I can not bring myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred is for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr. and so on. <br /> <br />
