I accidentally saw this cartoon on television one evening when I could not fall asleep. It did not help in the least. I stared at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. I just could not see that cartoon again, just because of that face. Now do not get me wrong - I love fairy tales and nursery rhymes just as much as anyone else. But this twisted and frightening account is just worrying. It's mainly the cruel laughter and the exaggerated features that scare me, and I still have nightmares. Please, I urge you not to allow this to your children. It's far, far too scary. Please, I ask you, keep it away.
