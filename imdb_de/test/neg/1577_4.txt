After a blizzard, the streets are closed, and the street policeman Jason (Adam Beach) comes to the dinner of his friend Fritz (JÃ¼rgen Prochnow) and advises his customers that they can only pursue their travels the next day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his former lover Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. During the night, without any communication with his base, Jason sees clients in distressing and suspicious situations and finds some corpses, suggesting that among them is a murderer, an average thriller, but the script is just awful. Most of the characters are despicable persons and the motive of the startling serial killer will never be disclosed, and the spectators have no further explanation as to why the killer killed the guests. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Captive")
