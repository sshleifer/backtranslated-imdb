Five guys who were in the Boy Scouts came years later to camp. Were they getting into Nemese's childhood and escaping from prisoners in this highly disreputable putative comedy? Most performers are happy to just call it and do not really seem to care. The authors were so lazy that the names of the characters are largely the names of the actors they play each.

(Although he is one of the few actors in the film who does not completely embarrass himself), I barely smiled, much less had anything that would reasonably be misinterpreted as laughter. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
