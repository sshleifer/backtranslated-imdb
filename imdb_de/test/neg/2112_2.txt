How on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? This is one of the most stylized pieces of waste I've seen in a long time. Not only is it poorly written, it is a product of inferior orientation and editing. The cinematography is so terribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage is unbelievable. The real ideas behind the attacks (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are initially fine, but where the production / direction team leads them, this is a huge mudflap, as seen in an episode. And that is a scientific series? I'm a doctor and all I can say is that the science in this movie is total crap and almost embarrassing to see. I felt really bad for the actors involved, as they were all extraordinary.
