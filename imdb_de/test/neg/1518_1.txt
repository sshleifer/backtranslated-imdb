I have always been a fan of Bottom and have taken as many videos of the series here in the States as I could find. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always awesome, and the combination of smart writing and absolutely stupid humor certainly seems to work. So I sat down to watch this movie with great enthusiasm ... and was extremely disappointed in the end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the movie is best described as uninspired and badly directed (sorry Ade!), but with some absolutely brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these noisy moments make you realize how little the rest of the movie is. The slapstick starts weird, but gets a bit boring. Only the perverted sex jokes make things funny. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie (the "green" scenes for those of you who did it might have been the worst end I've seen in the last decade.) Honestly, it was a joke that was repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt end that made no sense (which did not bother me) and was not funny (which did) <br /> <br /> In summary, I was very disappointed with this movie. I will cling to the few genius moments to keep the best memories I can ... but I have to warn you if you pay too much for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer, there are much better things for which you can spend your money.
