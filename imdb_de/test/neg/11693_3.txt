I'm a fan of the horror movie, no matter which hemisphere it comes from. I know what I can expect from the West, the East and most of the horrors in the middle. So I got the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build-up of ever-increasing tensions and weird children with odd, disjointed movements hidden under comforters, that it has a much more linear history than many others - you get who the characters are, where they come from and what they do. They get the basic information (nice couple, can not have kids) and realize that the premise is just too normal for something freaky NOT to happen. <br /> <br /> And then comes the bad. The number one complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I got it pretty much the moment the kid hugged the tree. I knew where the movie was going and could even predict the order of death and for what reason. <br /> <br /> The editing is shocking and unfortunately not for the benefit of the film. Even if I still think about the events, the tension must not grow because the director got a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final complaint is that .... the tree was unnecessary. This would have been a very good story of subtle horror. Only the couple collapsed over the death of the child - the titular tree bought the movie nothing new or exciting. I finish with where I started - my overall impression was 'Oh'.
