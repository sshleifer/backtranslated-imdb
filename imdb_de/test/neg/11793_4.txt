I know why people hate this movie. And I hated Blair Witch Project. This is about as staged as it gets and yes, they insult your intelligence by trying to make it appear real. I really liked the Madame Lalaurie plot, though it's more than likely invented. But the main reason why I like this movie is fake or not, when the ghosts attack and kidnap it, I get chill-ups every time and have to look behind me as it feels like there's something about me. I know it's my imagination, but hey, more than half of the trolling that's horrible in today's movie theaters and DVDs does not give me goosebumps, so this is a weird treat. Not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it and not like a PG- 13 rating, there's no gore. And the women are very annoying. They wish the spirits would take them off and experiment with them before everything is said and done. ** out *****.
