After reading so many glowing stories about 'All My Days', I went out and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to something in the same league as "Brideshead Revisited" and to some of the few other major productions of British television, but this is definitely not among them. <br /> <br /> The characters are all too good to be true, in a very predictable storyline, and with the most banal and sensational writing I've heard in years. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The main actor is particularly interesting because of its uncanny resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), only dark. But his undisputed talents are wasted on a character who is unbearably self-important and splendid. His prickliness is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during the First World War. He does the first episodes that focus on his nervous state better than if he later plays the squeaky, clean, socialist doer. <br /> <br /> The women are absolutely amazing, as in un-real. His first wife is annoying chipper and chirpy, the girlfriend, the perfect cunning slut, and the last lady, a hodgepuff of political feeling. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other champions named Hobarth. I forget the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The script's highly-acclaimed sermon is the typical Andrew Davies, scriptwriter, in his early years, and gets bored in the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). For episode 4, all I wanted to do was go through the damned thing. <br /> <br /> The music is just as boring and is mainly limited to a Mawkian piano melody and a chorale that the boys sang during the credits. No expense was spared in the location settings, providing visual relief to an otherwise distressing viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I like stories of this kind in general and am very disappointed with the maudlin character of this series. If you want to see something interesting about the First World War and its aftermath, there are many other, much finer vehicles you can rent or buy. One that comes to my mind is "The Unknown Soldier" from 1998. The characters in this presentation of the Masterpiece Theater are real and intriguing and, in contrast to the two-dimensional puppets, are in "To serve them all my days ". For movies about boys' schools, stick to 'Goodbye Mr Chips' or' Tom Brown's Schooldays'. <br /> <br /> I know that runs counter to the generally favorable view of this miniseries, but I strongly recommend purchasing Acorn Media for their 4 DVD sets before purchasing $ 80.00, of which 2 discs on my set were to think insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping.
