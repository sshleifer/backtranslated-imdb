Ring! Ring! Was the Horror Directors hotline, how can we help you? Yes, yes, Pronto! I mean hello, my name is Rugge? Um, call me by my initials. Okay Mr. R.D, what does the problem seem to be? Well, the reviews on my latest movie "Dial: Help" have all been negative and hard, and frankly I feel like my career has seen better days. Okay, Mr. R.D, and why do you think that's the case? Well, through my controversial and shocking movie about wild tribes of cannibals eating a film crew and another about ruthless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house on the edge of the park, I became the brainchild of fame and well-deserved cult status Wes Craven borrowed, but "Dial: Help" turns ?? uh? never mind! No, Mr. R.D, tell me what the movie is about. Um, it's about a mentally obsessed phone line following a sexy model and killing people around her. Ah, I see. This premise may sound a little stupid and not as fossil as cannibals or rapists, but I suppose there are deeper issues in your film, right? Oh, sure? Um, what do you mean? Well, is not the phone line icon a different kind of terror? Or maybe everything just happens in the head of your female heroine? Uh, no? It's just that a phone goes insane and murdered people with string, vibration, electricity or even with normal coins. Interesting, Mr. R.D. But how do you explain all the supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie? You know, I thought the slow decryption of the phone's secret action was not that important or relevant, so I focused only on processing all the possible gimmicks I could imagine. Telephone gimmicks? What do you think? Do you know, like a wind that blows through the horn, thought-provoking dial tones and turntables that catapult into the air! Very original, Mr R.D, but not terrible and as an experienced director, you must know that in the end people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh, but there it is! Everything has to do with negative and unpublished energy, if I remember correctly! Everything is a bit out of focus, I admit. Hmm ?? Aha. Well, as they always say, a good movie depends on more elements than just the story. Have you integrated at least some of your usual trademarks into the movie, so your fans will at least recognize your style? I tried! Lord knows I tried, but the murders and the bloodshed shock nobody! This is a pity, Mr R. D. But what about sex? Everyone likes a good dose of sleaze and nudity in their horror movies, and you said yourself that the movie was about a sexy fashion model in danger! Yes but ?? But what, Mr. R.D? To tell the truth, we have promoted "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with insightful shots of Charlotte Lewis on the cover, but in reality there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refuses to go topless. Mr. R.D! Now I'm really disappointed, it's just shameless to rip people off and make false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to lend and love "Dial: Help!" To summarize, I can reassure you by saying that every major director is entitled to make some erroneous decisions without this affecting his career immediately. However, next time, be more careful and research first, okay, Mr. R.D? I will; Thank you! You're welcome. Say, do you have any ideas for upcoming films? Yes, a fact, I do! I thought about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine! Does not that sound fascinating? Hello? Hello?
