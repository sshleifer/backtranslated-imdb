I was really trying to give this movie a chance, but when I realized that the movie was mostly told by boring officials walking around and talking on the phone, I knew it was over. Many of these films also looked like stock footage. That's just lame. <br /> <br /> The cameraman used these short, short zooms for NO REASON! It bothered me so much, but I was just wondering why they thought it was a good idea. This adds nothing to a static scene in which two people talk. This is not NYPD Blue or a cop show or something. <br /> <br /> How could they not have realized that this guy is telling a story of talking to people in conference rooms and what is not, is boring? !! Did not they see this mess? In any case, this was just a really boring movie and it seems like the one who made it does not understand good storytelling in the movie. <br /> <br /> Damn Stock Footage ... that's just wrong.
