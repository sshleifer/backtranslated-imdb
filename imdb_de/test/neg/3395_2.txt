I'm very interested in animal kids and have read a lot of novels by Edger Rice Burroughs - but this horrible movie did not interest me or any of the absurd, unrealistic scenes. I only managed to sit through the Africa part and John's first days in Scotland. Let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! The apesuit actors looked like big chimpanzees and not apes (there is a difference). They did not move with the grace a wild beast would do. (By way of comparison, you see some of the better Planet of the Apes movies in which they trained their actors to move in a similar way). The monkeys eat large pieces of meat - as far as I know, no usual monkey practice. I'm a fan of animal stories, but the script did not make me a monkey. The expedition's big white hunters, which John Clayton finds, are completely charismatic. The parents of Clayton were shipwrecked on a sea beach, but somehow it's a very long journey down the river to get to the coast - give me a break! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even the people who consider this a great movie admit that it's not an action movie. Far from it. It tries to be a character study - unfortunately outweighs the almost stupid part! I have not read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful actions and heroic intentions! This movie is just not there.
