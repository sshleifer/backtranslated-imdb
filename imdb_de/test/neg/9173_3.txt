What can I say ... not much at all. Pretty boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The performances are just fine. The only one who shines in any way is Simmons, but he only has three scenes. I understand he keeps his mysterious psychic aura by keeping his screen time to a minimum, but I can not help believing that his talent was wasted. No one else went beyond the mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems intriguing in the beginning, but just does not go anywhere. There was not a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel special. The cinematography was pretty boring ... I mean desert in a washed-out sepia ... not very stimulating. You're really adding something to the story, other than making an average Twilight Zone script a full-length feature. <br /> <br /> Drab.
