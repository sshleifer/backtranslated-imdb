Another sequel! Why on earth do they always do that? This is the weakest "franchise" of all time, but it is still funded and is causing consequences. SCARECROW GONE WILD - whom I just looked at to discard the entire series - returns the evil straw man who slaughters some college kids again ... that's it. Acting is (as usual) shit, the death scenes are miserable, and do not be fooled by the title, this thing does not have as much nudity as you may think. A few nice topless girls, but nothing too tiring pants. Let me conclude my ongoing insult (or review) about this film by saying: If I find a SCARECROW IN SPACE or a FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the shelves of the video business, I am absolutely impressed ...
