The unemployed man Bud Abbott (as Jack) and the comic partner Lou Costello (as spelled) receive a job for the latter, calling himself a "problem child" David Stollery (as Donald). Young Stollery reads out Mr. Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), who sleeps Costello and dreams that he and Mr. Abbott are telling the story of "Jack and the Beanstalk" (you guessed it) relive br /> <br /> The sepia tone changes to color for most of the production. Apparently, this was an attempt for something else for the duo, a colorful children's fantasy. It fails, but here you see Abbott & Costello in color, silent movie superstar William Farnum (as king) makes his last appearance, boxer Max Bers brother Buddy and Stollery ahead of Disney's "Spin and Marty". <br /> <br /> ** Jack and the Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
