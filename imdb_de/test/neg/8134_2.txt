This film has some good performances, as others have already mentioned, but suffers from it (as others have already mentioned, with the exception of those who appear to be either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to explain why they call it "10"). would consider). from some self-confident and selfish film school upholstery and surplus conspiracies. This is the kind of storyline Sex In The City could handle in a half-hour episode. So there was no reason for it to be an 88-minute movie. A perfect example of wasted material is the fast forward assembly in the first third of the film. Part of the backstory is earned, but too much time was spent, for example, on Daria's character with the anal sex boyfriend and with Paulie's back story, which was not a realistic character, though the actor was given a decent job on the lines. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts: typos in typed footage, bad jumps and changes, bad camera positions, angles, lighting issues, and most of all a bad picture written script with poorly developed concept. If the author (including the director and lead actor) has worked with someone, he or she may not have been 100% rotted with Tomatos, which further enhances anyone's ability to truly believe the people they've given him charged rating system here.
