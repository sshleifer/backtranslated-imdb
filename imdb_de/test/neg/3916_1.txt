Oh man! ohdear! ohdear! ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... er ... "movie" just shames the space flicks. Every sci-fi movie I saw last year was, to some degree, disappointing, and I'm seriously considering which genre of movies I really like in the future !! (Maybe I'll watch love movies from now on!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And that does not say much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so silly stupid that it rivals Battlefield Earth and Baby Genius in sheer behavior. The special effects are obviously fake, the Big Mac Truck looked stoofy with its roller coaster seatbacks, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the Power Rangers, a huge, fat guy is first sucked out of a porthole window flask. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can do better. What really stunk were the two good-looking young things that accompanied him and ran around in two-thirds of the strip in their underpants (??)! The obligatory 'sex scene' (giggling!) Between our young heroes was so bad that I almost swallowed my tonsils and laughed at the TV. <br /> <br /> The only notable character is the Pirate Ship Captain / Cyborg / Mad Scientist. He drenched the word grotesquely and was predictably grim, but I think he could have been much more threatening. He does and says things that are pretty funny (the best scenes involve him!), So I give this movie an extra point. <br /> <br /> But this movie is so bad that you feel like flinging abuse on the TV or maybe throwing the TV out the window! It can even kill a few brain cells and put you into a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain tries to run around on his spine, when it's obviously a wrong vertebra! I would have given it 0 out of 10, but since it tears me apart with its stupid antics, this streak gets 1/10!
