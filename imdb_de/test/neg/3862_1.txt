Imagine Diane of Cheers focusing on intellectualizing characters, and now imagine she wanted to shoot a moire film. That would be it. If you were only looking at a few of the recordings without sound, you'd think, Hmmm .. that could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> If you turn on the sound now and hear it at any time, you'll quickly realize that the person who made the film knows nothing about films that go beyond what they read in a book. I kept thinking that this is a foreign movie. It was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you do not remember Cheers, think about Mr. Beans Holiday Movie ... Well, imagine this horrible movie without Mr. Bean saving him. That's this movie. I do not say anything about what the movie is, unless it's an attempt to make a dark, melancholy movie about a hit-man going home. At least that's all I could get out of it.
