After the book, I became very sad when I saw the movie. I agree that sometimes a movie should differ from the original, but in that case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Why are the ranks different (eg Lt. Diestl instead of Sergeant, etc.)? <br /> <br /> 2) The last screen is very bad and makes Diestl so from a soldier who feeds himself and wants to die. But it's not 100% true. Just read the book. In the last few seconds he was also a cop. He did not want to die by destroying his weapon and just approaching Michael & Noah. <br /> <br /> So this is a happy ending that does not fit in this movie at all.
