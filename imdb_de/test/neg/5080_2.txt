When I saw the names of the main characters (Statham, Snipes, and Phillippe), I thought the movie should be at least decently funny or interesting. Instead, all I got was not just boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing what was going to happen, and lots of lame and shabby "bad cop." The main problem is that the movie does not have a good story. And if you have that, nobody can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes ... not even John McClane could save this movie :-) It might be cool for the kids, if they are not older than 12 years old, because they are not so much interested in the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.
