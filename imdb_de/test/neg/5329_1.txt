Writer-director Emilio Estevez shows here with this insoluble, supposed comedy a significant lack of talent. The script is completely hopeless, let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and poorly edited. The comedy just does not work. If Estevez does not use bad taste sex jokes, he lends used gags and makes them very bad. You might think that the interaction of Estevez and brother Charlie Sheen would be cool ... but that's not the least smile from their audience. Do yourself a favor and leave it on the video rack.
