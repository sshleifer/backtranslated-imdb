I'm not from America, I usually watch this show on AXN channel, I do not know why this respected channel plays such a suck program in prime time. Built by Hollywood's money bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he spends a large amount of cash on the small screen. In each episode, a group of people travel with two team members for a large sum from country to country; where the camera crews shoot their travels. I do not know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. There is nothing to see, in all episodes we see people running like beggars, sometimes screaming, crying, beeping, jerking camera works. The most disgusting part of the race is that viewers finally know that every member of the team can not enjoy their racing / travel experience. To summarize the ratings, the producers came up with the idea of ​​putting gays on a show, the American reality show. > <br /> The Amazing Race.
