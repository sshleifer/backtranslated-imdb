An unintentionally hilarious, early talkie melodrama, in which Kay Francis chases everything in pants as Countess Balakireff. At the beginning of the film she "throws" the stable boy back, because he is still too young, before he makes his way to the chauffeur! The eloquent English set in which she moves is such a clich√© of Harmetkeepers that it's ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as Italian violinist with Chico Marx accent! "My Violeen, how nice that I'll ever play Eet again!" "Patreecia, my master is cold!" It's campy beyond belief.
