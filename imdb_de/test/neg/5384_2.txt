From an artistic point of view, the film can not find a moral solution. The plot is hard to track, if there is one. Acting is hard in the stomach. The dialogue is a clich√© and clearly written by someone who can not speak English. Only the cinematography was worth seeing in this film, although you can still see mistakes in the picture. As an Asian-American woman, the movie annoyed me because it showed how narrow-minded people can be. From a political point of view, it should be forbidden to put Asian women in such nefarious roles. Existing stereotypes of Asian prostitutes are disadvantageous not only for the self-esteem of Asian women, but also for the entire country. I have a feeling for the lead actress that Maya played, and the exploitation she must have faced in such a role. <br /> <br /> As an American please avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop tolerance and respect among each other and not to hinder.
