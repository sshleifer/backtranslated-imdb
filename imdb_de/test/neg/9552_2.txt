I just happened to see that early morning on the Fox Channel (my dog ​​woke me up) - I had seen it years ago and I thought I remembered it pretty well. I had enjoyed it as a kid. But now? As another poster commented, some of the scrolls were down, and although it was initially disoriented and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - which was horrible, became surreal and amusing. Musical figures for what I thought was the "big" fundraiser show ("They're in show business, I'm in show business, most kids are in show business, let's show them a show") before they all come talk the putting on of a show and then fade without acclaim to completely independent "straight" scenes. The captain's girlfriend appears, spits lines and dialogue lines, and then disappears. I was half awake and loved every crazy minute.
