Oh man! Oh man! Oh my dear! <br /> <br /> Believing that films like this one have been made, and likely to be enjoyed by thousands of drive-ins, amazes the mind. How innocent we were then. <br /> <br /> In short: This movie is crap. The hero is so wet that you can hear his muddy, wet footsteps in every scene. My lord, but he is just one of the many horrible, terrible actors that appear in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. The story as it is revolves around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe it's the actor driving the car) that he gives up and "comes in with the wrong amount" Oooooh! Creepy stuff. But the wrong crowd turns out to be the biker-equivalent of The Three Stooges and their "hand-me-round" biker-chick powder. As an example of how lame this whole thing is, the authors have apparently annoyed the brain to find a frightening name for the biker gang - when four people can be called a gang. The result? The gang is called Satan's angel! I do not shit you. <br /> <br /> Such terrible drama and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make for a wonderful beer-and-chips movie. But otherwise it's just the worst kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> As I said. Once this was considered good. But today, every minute makes you laugh (and pincers). Avoid it except a good laugh. And make sure you're more than half drunk!
