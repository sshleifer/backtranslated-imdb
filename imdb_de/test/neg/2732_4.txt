"The Core" meets "Crack in the World" (made for television in 1965). The action is in stock, the tension is predictable. If you've subtracted the entire drawing that was demolished by "The Core" - essentially the manned drill - you get the appearance of "Crack in the World". "Crack" was a really excellent movie with Dana Andrews. His South African team of scientists drilled to the crust and "hit" with a nuclear device to provide a steady geothermal energy source. One of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist, disagrees. He believes the explosion will not drill a simple hole, but will crack in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He's right. In order to prevent the resulting crack from destroying the earth, they must place another atomic device in the path of the crack. <br /> <br /> Although I set up a spoiler warning, I do not know if I really spoiled anything for one of the movies. And since "Crack in the World" is only available in very rare VHS formats, if it is not decided at all whether the counter-blast works are likely to be academic or not. Descent 'just below the average.
