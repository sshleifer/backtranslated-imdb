I rented this movie because it's supposed to be in a jazz club - you know, those cool, hip places you might come across late on a Saturday night. Well, in this ridiculous movie, there is not an ounce of "cool." The score is stupid, the original songs are terrible, the vocals of the two main actors are always outlandish (to be friendly) and at best unprofessional The only decent cinematic moments are the footage scenes. In the scenes of the jazz club there are sophomoric dialogues stifled by excessive organ music. This Joey de Francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job helps with movie scores). Can not I just get back my four dollars but have paid for my therapy sessions? Interestingly, this movie is so bad that you might want to see it. Just like driving in a serious accident - you only have to look once. Just make the earplugs ready!
