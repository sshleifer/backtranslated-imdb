The classic author C.S. Lewis once wrote an essay that states that no children's story is worth reading, viewing, etc., if it can only be enjoyed by children. I would say that this film is easy to defend to defend its arguments. <br /> <br /> At the age of five or six I loved it, tracked it only three or four years later found it wet, badly animated, stupid and confusing written and with embarrassing repetitive and terrible songs (I look, hi-cockalorum), which show a production aimed at joyous stupidity and whimsy, but with twee, frustrating confusion. <br /> <br /> Be sure to show this to your child, but I would highly recommend that you do not buy a copy or try to look at it. If you're looking for something from the same era, but with real charm and wit, look for "Oliver Twist" or the brilliant BBC adaptation of "The Box of Delights."
