The worst Korean movie ever! The plot is ridiculously complex, unbelievable and the movie does not create a single shock. It builds up enough tension and leaves you feeling upset without producing a shock or a bouncing moment. Whenever there's a refreshing moment, it does not bother you because you're still trying to figure out who's who and what's going on! It goes something like this: A modeling company hires 4 people for a modeling career. But the owners are not what they seem, they have model dolls of all and a strange girl goes through the place and the owners do not have a girl's recognition. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and that's what I could understand. The end is a mess of murders and you do not know who a doll is, who is real and who is dead! I do not recommend fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
