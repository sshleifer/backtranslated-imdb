I do not understand how this garbage got into the shelves of the movie business, it's not even a real movie! It was incredible, me and a group of friends decided to see this night, and it was just the dumbest thing each of us had ever seen, I could not believe it! We were awed by the first 15 minutes of someone actually thinking about it and turning it into a movie. Are you on crack? My guess is in huge doses. I strongly doubt that anyone might like this garbage. Should it be sci-fi or comedy or what? I do not think about the idiots who did this thing, they just decided to do a film about nothing and see how many idiots they could cheat. Well, we put something on film, so we bring it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf - no, no, no. This is not filmmaking. Acting is like looking at wooden puppets that move and read in a book, that's how bad it is. I feel like going to the movie store, complaining and getting my money back. Nobody should have to endure this crap. That's why I'm here to warn you - DO NOT RENT THIS FILM, it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen!
