Forgive my spelling. This is probably the funniest horror movie ever. Think evil dead * 1000. Acting is awful, you can see the makeup line on the face of a certain lady. There is a lesbian scene that makes no sense at all. And the end, haha ​​ohhhh the end ... be prepared that your stomach hurts from laughter. Now, if you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and still expect something, look at yourself and ask what the hell is going on with you. This is a very bad movie designed to laugh and enjoy its sheer stupidity. Do not forget to watch all the outtakes after the movie. All in all, this movie is a rare gem when it comes to showing that talent, care, skills and money are lacking and what else would be needed to make a successful movie. But it is worthwhile in any case.
