Above all, you should not take this movie seriously. Unfortunately, it takes itself seriously, but that can not be helped. This anime Ninja-Flic must be the crowning achievement when it comes to corrupting something that would have been irresistible when it comes to unoriginal storytelling with nasty handovers, ridiculous, time-consuming cutscenes, and an outrageous guest appearance that either makes you laugh or laugh to groan (or both), like me). <br /> <br /> Although I'm usually a fan of Ninja / Samurai anime (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin, just to name a few), this one must be the exception. For the album, this film was very well animated and constructed from a technical point of view. It's just the act that stunk. The authors of this film have clearly decided (for whatever rational reason I do not know) that they could somehow make up for the missing script if the character around the world was looking for a treasure that his father (he experiences) fought and died for. He rescues a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in an Apache village, joins a Ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members than he knew he did the strangest had places and circumstances (and all those who later die in the movie). <br /> <br /> So far, these ridiculous plots of action have been excused, but then come the two "guest appearances." # 1: After a ridiculous clich√© with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain". At this point you probably say "What the hell? !!" This "meeting" serves a single purpose: it discredits a film that tries to create a historical background. I found it disappointing that the writers went out of their way to research the US from the 1860s, and I did not realize that "Mark Twains" was actually Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that he used to be Captain Kidd. I can now hear the moan of disgust. <br /> <br /> Finally there are the running scenes. These scenes show different characters, with the landscape moving statically behind them for a few minutes, and there are many of them. It's these scenes that make this movie (2 hrs 12 mins) make it last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitle movie that's just fun, that's it. Feel free to have fun with all sorts of aspects and have fun. Just do not take it seriously. 3.10
