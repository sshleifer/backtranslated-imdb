I'm a big fan of the comedy show. Racial humor is always a bit risky, but greats like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli and so on do that perfectly. They do not go overboard, make the audience uncomfortable or cough STEAL JOKES! But I will not go for it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor absolutely uncomfortable. His jokes bring racist humor to the point again and again, if it's not funny or smart, but it's offensive. I am not one who is turning into race humor. But his execution of these jokes is sloppy, which causes people to shy away from his comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is only exceeded by his stage presence. I feel like he's always screaming at me! And he walks around the stage like a madman. It's just annoying!
