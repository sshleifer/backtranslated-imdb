Terrible, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the movies are miserable. I rented the DVD and forced myself to watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: Read the book, it's much better and you do not have to look at all those stupid pictures and ridiculous dreams that Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I think I have never seen such a bad movie.
