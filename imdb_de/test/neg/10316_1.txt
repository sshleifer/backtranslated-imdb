I broke my own rule when I bought this movie from Walmart's 5-dollar storage bin. Basically, if a movie has a big star and you've never heard of it, it usually has a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, the reason is because it SUCKED! They're pouring Sandra Bullock's photo and name on the cover of the DVD as bait, and this little fish fish is thrown in. I was thinking about donating the CD to charity or giving it to the library, but I do not think I want to put this movie to anyone else in the world. Worst lines: "What do you mean by army colleagues?" "What do you mean with your father?"
