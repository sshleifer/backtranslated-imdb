There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail is a truly great event in Australian military history, the brave defense of Australia against the cruel barbarian Japanese army. But this film does not take into account the story of the "Fuzzy Wuzzy's" or the New Guinea aborigines. The Australians helped them carry out military operations. Nor does the film provide a credible depiction of the Australian soldier and his behavior at the event. It is rather an uninformed contemporary view of what was. <br /> <br /> The Australian film industry has again failed to give this important chapter in Australia's story the film it deserves. This is the film that is worst with random cinematography, poor scripting and dialogue, no character development, and clich√© jungle warfare scenes. <br /> <br /> It fails to penetrate the public in any meaningful perspective other than the Japanese Army and cruel killers of a poorly equipped and poorly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle. <br /> <br /> The film failed because most Australian films attract a significant Australian audience, though they have stayed away in droves. <br /> I will not join the usual parochial rubbish when I say it's great because it's an Australian movie. I say either do a great job or just leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure of the wealthy and spoiled rich kids of Australia. I give him zero stars because it is an insult to the descendants of these really tall Australians and their enormous sacrifice. What a shameful waste and disrespect, and I know that this review will cause more negativity from the Movie Show Crew and most reviewers, but I have a right to my opinion and that's what the Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM an opinion.
