If this has been nominated for a Screenwriting Award by the WGA, a professional writers' association, then it's time to quit the word processing program. Amazingly unsuitable writing, directing, production, on every level, even for a TV movie. In this incredibly bad movie no clich√© is left unused. What did they think? Does anyone really believe that kids are stupid enough to see this?
