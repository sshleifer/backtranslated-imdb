This is really one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It is not funny at all. It's simply a northern British lower-class environment. I think it's a very sad movie on parts, but it should not be on other cuts. One thing that really annoyed me was the close-up shots of pointless objects that really slow down the movie's tempo. I only made it through the movie because I went through certain sequences towards the end. <br /> <br /> This movie loses the audience's attention. The main problem is that there are several reasons for an action, which in turn weakens this action. But if there is a reason for an action, it becomes more passionate. All in all, this movie is present everywhere. I did not learn enough about the characters to take care of them, because the storylines and the stories in which I might have explored the life of a character have changed. Man meets God in the bar, God seems to be a cool guy his. The movie could have gone into this moment, and I think it would have been a lot funnier. <br /> <br /> Definitely, if enough. Look at it if you want, but I warn you that this movie is crap. I respect the creators who have tried to do it on such a small budget, but they could have done much better work. I think it's all about the camera movement and the editing, the acting was decent. But that's just my opinion.
