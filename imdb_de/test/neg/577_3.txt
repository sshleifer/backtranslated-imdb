I have to be honest, I like romantic comedies, but that was not what I was hoping for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had most of what should have been because I did not like the two struggling bed partners. It was awful. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to deal with someone who was so much in the picture while he and Ellen were actually in the movie. They were the only credible ones. And the only really funny parts played the lead role, not Kate Capshaw and this Everett guy. Cool that mom is coming out of the closet, I thought, that was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad that I saw it on the cable and did not pay any money when I rented it.
