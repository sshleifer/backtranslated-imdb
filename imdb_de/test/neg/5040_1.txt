I will not destroy your surprise with the vile storylines. I'm just saying that this movie suffers from bad animations. These are some good features. If you're lonely on a lonely island and the only connection to the civilization you've got is for this movie to throw the fish. I can not tell you how sorry I am for watching this horrible, gruesome movie. Speaking of which, this movie, which is supposed to be a horror movie, can not be classified as such, as the only horror in this movie is the play opportunities of some actors. <br /> <br /> Take care of yourself.
