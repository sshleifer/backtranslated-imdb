The movie is nothing but a nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (though not very much) nudity of local stars along with a slang that is otherwise rejected in today's Portuguese society with horror. If you see Portuguese films promoting Portuguese films, they all have a "hot" scene from the film. I am by no means saying that Portuguese society is estranged. Only the film industry does not seem to be able to find other ways of success. Back to the movie ... The spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece, leaves nothing to be desired. The film could have been a good movie if it had emphasized the real idea of ​​the book (topicality at all times) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "boss" was terrible ...
