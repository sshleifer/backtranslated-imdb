Usually I try to find as much in movies as I can to enjoy them. I made no exception with "Tart" and did my best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how great, could redeem this pathetic apology for a movie. <br /> <br /> It has failed for several reasons. First, cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Second, the script reached depths of "poor," far beyond the category "so bad it's good." Third, the acting man left much to be desired - it was horrible, it really was like that. Anyone who sees Mischa Barton (seen here as a remarkably terrible Grace, a character so badly invented and realizes that Yes, yes, Binks does not look so bad) as a Devon in John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs" will wonder what's going on between that and that went wrong today. If she had been given a character that was worth dealing with, and a bit of directing, she would have at least given this film a redeeming character. Unfortunately, this was not the case. After all, the movie did not seem to make any sense at all, nothing to express, nothing to achieve. Really, I wonder why Christina Wayne disturbed herself. <br /> <br /> "Tart" made a faint attempt to be something and failed. The result - a movie, unfortunately so bad that it is only very, very bad. Do not bother - it really is not worth it.
