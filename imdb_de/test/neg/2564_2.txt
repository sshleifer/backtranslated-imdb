Okay, other people have commented that this is not an action movie, so I do not have to rewash that (though I just did). This is not exactly a letdown, it's even nice when an actor tries something different. But unfortunately, this is not one of those opportunities. <br /> <br /> Now, the story: does not exist. This movie is missing in the plot almost as "showgirls". Sure, they're throwing in a few environmentalists, no, not even an environmentalist, something else, a treat here and there to please Seagal (because that's what he loves). That does not make history, not even close. Well, the end ... Even those of us who really liked this movie ... the end, you have to admit that it was a bit much or a lot stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, from what I understand, this was a direct video (at least in the states), but that's even too good for this one. This piece of rubbish should have been just cables, on TBS or Starz (until late at night).
