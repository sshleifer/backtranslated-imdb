This film is garbage because it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also garbage, for many reasons. Let me say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is just looking for another way to put himself in the limelight - and others who belong to that kind of garbage are in jail. it was also terrible for the movie itself if it was based on the book. The only reason this murder case became such a big book and movie was that the guy is related by his aunt's marriage to the Kennedy family and it's ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability To make and cover up murders - they are just a family and Central America must overcome the obsession. This poor guy and his family were persecuted by the police for years, they could not take care of Tommy, so they followed Michael. It's amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence he did not do, apart from the facts that the statute of limitations should have prevented, among other things, that this process was brought back after twenty years of love, God, do not look this garbage
