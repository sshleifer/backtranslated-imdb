This could be the worst movie ever made, in a league of films like Howard the Duck, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Ishtar. I do not understand why I decided to watch this movie because it was a waste of my life. I also do not understand why you would like this movie, regardless of your sense of humor. Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, as well as writing. The characters are all stupid, and there's no funny scene in the entire movie. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor ever - this movie proves it. This movie is worth nothing. Do not rent it, do not look at it, do not even say it looks interesting. It's bad enough, I saw it.
