Normally I would not waste time reviewing a movie like "Human Pork Chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the earlier movie with the same title, which is probably better referred to in the West as "The Untold Story") ), but since the reviews here are pretty unclear as to what they actually consist of, I thought I'd best post something more detailed, since no one (as I really wanted to) would be tempted by the movie. Mysticism I'd be honest Just say STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> **** IMPORTANT SPOILERS are included at **** <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" .I expected it to be like one Chinese interpretation of the popular Japanese Guinea Pig movies Anyone who has seen enough of this series can see where its makers come from, and there is a strong sense of humor - you can not laugh without the ridiculous "He never dies" watch and "The Maki ng of Guinea Pig "is a fabulous turn of the whole thing on the head proving that it has just been made. with some joy, by quite good-natured Gorehounds. All GP films have punk rock, DIY, shot-on-video aesthetics, occasional flashes of real art ("Mermaid in a Manhole"), an angry political agenda and a distorted, confused zeal that puts them in a league of their own Liga relegated own. <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" has none of the above features. <br /> <br /> It was shot on 35 mm film (with harmless good production values), it's 90 minutes grueling and it's absolutely nothing to give you. The plot recounts in a police questioning of the suspects of systematic torture, death and eventual dismemberment of Grace, a heroin addicted street vendor who is abducted and brutalized by her pimp and followers as she steals money from him Despite his elusive attempts, To be a moral game, the film has a freestanding, inhuman feeling, and one can not help but focus on the mindset of the thoughts behind it. Although Grace half-heartedly paints as an innocent victim, the charismatic nature of the script and the protagonist's constant, diabolical dialogue tend to be shocking, totally unwelcome, "She deserves it!" View that makes it impossible to observe the whole thing. It takes much more time to detail Grace's demotion, and when their kidnappers are eventually found guilty and imprisoned, it seems a hurried thought for the writers who have long ceased to be less worried. <br /> <br /> What does it matter? The question of why anyone wants to see such a movie is questionable that even the people who REALLY deal with mindless sex and violence in the movies would have a grave failure. The torture is just a constant stream of kicks, beatings, verbal abuse, psychic abuse, and then increasingly bizarre portrayals of the abductors who use Grace's heroin addiction to make them bid. And by the way, when I say that, I'm not misunderstood. Unlike "Guinea Pig" with its frequent nudity, which, despite the ultraviolet, gives a more youthful feeling of vertigo, "Human Pork Chop" has no such sexual overtones. There is no real nudity in the film, and the violence is carried out by the vile protagonists out of malice. Who sees a dog stuffing a dog in a bag at the beginning of the film and banging on a brick wall - do not worry, not really, just a cheap special effect!). <br /> <br /> The only real bloodshed in the movie is coming to an end, as they are dismembering Grace's body and cooking the bones, all very poor special effects (near "Guinea") Pig) and at this point you feel probably already too unhappy and sick to even worry about what's going on. <br /> <br /> The film is depressingly dark and uncompromising in a similar direction to Buddy Giovinazzo's "Combat Shock" and I think you could even compare it in one fell swoop. Both films are about the gradual physical decay of a person in a nightmarish environment with no social or moral redeemable characters, and both films have a particularly visceral climax with the inevitable, inevitable fate of the individual. <br /> <br For fairness reasons, it "does not glamorize" violence or violence ("Guinea Pig" can easily be blamed), but you can not wonder where the location for a movie like this is. In its honest presentation of such brutality, it misses many real points and with a leaden pace, a virtually nonexistent plot and the aforementioned lack of entertainment value. I just can not understand what would make anyone look at something like this. I just made it to the end, just to judge it fairly ... which I hope I did now. <br /> <br /> Total score: 0 of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
