I'm sorry, but I just can not understand why someone would like it. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOTHING like in this show !! Personally, I am glad that it was canceled after the first episodes. I mean, this kind of show would be fine if everyone knew that homeschoolers are not really that way and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of it. If anyone who saw this actually believed that this is what happens in the life of a homeschooler, then I am truly sorry. This reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have in "Mean Girls" of children in their own homes. It is really sad that people think that way. That's utter garbage, IMHO.
