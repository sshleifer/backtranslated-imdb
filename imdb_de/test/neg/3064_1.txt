As a Michigander, I got the Michigan jokes. Very funny - make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor and all the lame suburbs of Detroit. Yes, yes, I have heard these jokes millions of times. I give them credit for accurately portraying the lame nature of Grosse Pointe. It could not turn white. Have you heard these lovely nose accents in Michigan? Where the girls talk so fast, you can not understand a word that comes out of their mouth (nose) ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I have never met a person from Grosse Pointe that I liked. Listen to this terrible live band and this annoying and horrible background music! What's this? A band of your Gross Pointe Homeboys? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you have there. Funny, as the people of Grosse Pointe always say, they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich, they want something to complain about. From lame jokes to girls in thongs to terrific character development. Oh wait, you mean the whole base for a character is that he often says the f-word? What a deep personality. Great work, big pointers! And I love the whole sexist language, as the narrator calls the first girl to be killed, that we never hear a "naive B * tch" speak. This is really nice. <br /> <br /> And the homemade masks with contact lenses by Marilyn Manson are really great. And I love how sensible it was, why the motorcyclists came and killed people. And how did her narrative master have such an obvious role in the movie ...? The main friend was so bored that I fell asleep and looked at him. The three idiots (or were they two or four, how can I say they all look and act the same!) So desperate to make me laugh. And what about the gay jokes? No wonder this movie is shit - all involved must have some minor issues with their manhood, like guys? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie was the main girl. Despite what the others said here, she was actually a good actress. Teenagers speak the way she spoke. They really act the way they acted. Her acting was very natural and believable. I really thought she was an employee of Grosse Pointe. .. maybe it is her! And yes, she had big breasts, most women here. You know, Michigan is the fattest state in the Union. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> Those of you who think this is a representation of Detroit are not. It's the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of teenage fear. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is from one of our suburbs) and $ 75 baggy khaki pants all the way! Lame rich kids who are crazy because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they also make bad movies. <br /> <br />
