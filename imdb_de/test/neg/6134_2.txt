I discovered the DVD in a shop near my house, and since I'm addicted to "kitsch horror movie / alien flicks," I wondered how good it was. There were even two prizes on the cover (I can not remember which festival it won), so I thought, "Hey, that could be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to watch the IMDb. Either people beat the movie to call it bad, or people said it was a wonderful performance in indie movies, blah, blah. I then played the DVD and did not think about any reviews I had read, minded and expected nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Man ... I do not like being so critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I'll just give a few pointers to what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1-Acting / Dialog: The acting was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes where I could not see any effort from them at all! The dialogue was even worse ... I think it was probably the aspect that I did not like the most throughout the movie. The conversation between the characters seemed ... out. Not only bad, but far from the actual events in the movie. The monologues of the female character were well won, but they soon became boring and annoying ... But the most ridiculous aspect was the ... "aliens" or the "infected" ... that I will not comment on this one, just to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the whole mood out of the picture; 2-Visuals: The strongest aspect of the movie ... forgetting the terrible effects and flashes of light that they use to simulate explosions or what the hell they should be. The aspect of the "camera in the car" was pretty cool, but they did not even use the environment to cause fear or anxiety. That left them with cheap sound and video effects and the three "infected" characters. The movie gets boring in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: Talk about editing ... this movie has no problems showing how weak it was edited. From computer sounds that mimic the forest animals, to the "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So what did I like in the movie ... (SPOILERS), the only one What I really liked was actually quite scary was the sequence of two scenes in which the car stops and you see something / someone running far away. At first, I really thought I was seeing things, but when the character realized that the "characters" approaching them were their own mirror image, I was surprised! Pretty scary idea well done! Besides that ... I had a terrible time. <br /> <br /> And I can not recommend it to anyone ... not even "teen meetings" because you can not even laugh about it .... <br /> <br /> I give a solid 2. Only some technical achievements have worked here ... otherwise ... yes ... nothing
