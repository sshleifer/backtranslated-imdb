I can not believe I sat through this garbage. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit that was so obviously artificial that I thought it was a dummy until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous conspiracy. I think it's a pity that Jill was Ireland's last movie before her death, that stinker. Do not waste your time - I wish I had not done it. The only salvation is that they were cables, so I did not waste my money on everything.
