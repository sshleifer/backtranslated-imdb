In general, I'm an admirer of Jess Franco's filmmaking, but for some of these films, I really have trouble understanding the motivation behind them, or even their reason for their existence. Like this sick puppy for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no cinematic value, it is done without any kind of action and contains some of the worst sleaze recordings ever recorded in the movie. This is yet another filthy movie in which women are raped in prisons where rape, lesbian action and violent torture play are part of everyday life. The guards are crazier than the prisoners, and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only becomes sexually excited when he discovers a girl who has sex with a dog (!). The girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the movie. Still, one can not really enjoy this sight in all the perversion. Among the dubious highlights are a barbarous hunting game (you can guess what he is looting), a duel between a guard and a prisoner, and the image of a poor girl putting a needle through her entire nipple. Also! Avoid this sick mess and you will save yourself the trouble of taking TWO baths to wash the dirt.
