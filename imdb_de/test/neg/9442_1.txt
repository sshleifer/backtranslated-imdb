I can not believe anyone gives this movie a good rating. Besides the awful-looking, thin (non-existent?) Storyline and the slow tempo, this is the movie you should watch if you were really trying to fall asleep. The brain of the writer and the director must have been fried eggs to ever have such disgusting results. Based on the plot summary on the DVD case sounded the premise really promising. But within the first ten minutes, I knew it was a lost cause. If you want a REALLY Creep to accept the Area 51 idea, watch the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes." Dreamland will soon disappear like all pathetic movies. NEXT !!!
