... what a porn movie would look like if you kicked out the sex and just went into the bad dialogue, cheap sets and bad acting, you Galaxina Star Wars has proved that there was a science fiction market. This in turn leads to some gems like Alien and a revived Star Trek. Unfortunately, this also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say, of course, because until a few days ago I did not even hear about this movie, I missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here's the underlying problem. Dorothy Stratton could not act, so they did not even let her try most of the movie. I understand that her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me I can not understand why. But obviously they do not understand it as if they are playing something, it has to be FUN! This movie was not, or at least not the funny timing in witty jokes. Science fiction is ripe for parody, as Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest have proven. This movie did it badly.
