Slasher Sequel (fourth SLUMBER PART MASSACRE movie) is about a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in the snow in a mountain cabin and plundered by a confused murderer. Typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans, Gore, wonderful female nudity, no conspiracy. Although it eventually wears off its greeting, even in the short length. <br /> <br /> Original star Brinke Stevens makes a cameo that just seems to be there to get her into the movie.
