I've read the other comments and I am glad someone compared them to the 2004 original of Kamal called Perumarzhakalam. <br /> <br /> The original had a tight history and no loopholes, as described above by the Indian government no proper records or bad shoots and bloopers. <br /> <br /> The story is awesome and a touchy and well described by others. Sadly, though, Nagesh recognizes it as his own story, and it's nothing but plagiarism. I think he was hit by Bollywood's so-called "inspired" syndrome. <br /> <br /> He must at least give credit where he is due. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his older films, but now I guess if they were even originals. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to watch the original, even with subtitles, if necessary, to know what the direction and acting are all about.
