Although this series and especially the minifilm were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was written rather poorly with a weak cast. The core themes are very well presented, but it is difficult to describe and understand the problems within the film if drama and script are not convincing enough (especially when watching the mini-movie). I do not think that this minifilm or this Series has survived the time, as many scenes are now pretty ridiculous. The issues are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff can not fully support understanding of Britain's problems in the 1980s.
