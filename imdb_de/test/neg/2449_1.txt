Before I saw this masterpiece, I never thought that a devastating and terribly contagious virus could be defeated by Lutheran prayers ... and "inheritors." The performance of Ralf Moeller is gigantic; Realism incandescent. I was so inspired that I fly directly to Zambibwia tomorrow to find the pesto and get my hands together for the prosperity of the Third World. God bless this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'll just have to look at Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty to believe that it's possible to create a somewhat clich√©d dialogue. It's so tortured that it may be preferable to take a cheesegrater to the knuckles. The only subtlety that it can achieve lies in its thin camouflaged racism, as the poor islanders turn to an ineffective, silent, collective prayer that has no effect until the superhuman, linen-covered Germanic hero Moeller with his direct connection to Give Jahweh a chance to have a blood test where the hornblowing Yankee scientists can save the unfortunate natives. This movie is shit.
