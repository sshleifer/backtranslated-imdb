The delicate catch or who killed the Australian film industry? Case No. 278. This sad excuse for a time drama needs a cast and an idea with potential? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a gangster drama of the Jazz era ?? and turns it into a sloppy and executed sleep aid. McHeath (Weaving) is a boxing promoter, a gangster, and a working illiterate; For no apparent reason he quoted the songs of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen before fighting. Like postmodern. How stupid. Anyway. There's a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes McHeath's newest protégé, through his unfortunate Aboriginal stable mate Alby (Luke Carroll). McHeath's Flapper-Minor Iris (Byrne) turns his eyes on him. Sexual tension squeezes under the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Iris (these flower girls stay together), who appears in scenes without being asked. They practice dancing together and talking to the boys about how they work together. In the 1920s. After that, I stopped counting anachronisms. There is a subplot with Japanese beer and a backstory of Broome pearl fishermen. I do not know what it was about. For some reason, which is not explained exactly, Byrne puts cocaine in Art's lemonade. McHeath believes he is drunk and dismisses him. Byrne plans and plans to help him again. She is a great person for plotting and planning. Most cause problems. McHeath's two guns, the nimble Ronnie (John Batchelor) and the Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), debate as he pokes McHeath on the head when he realizes that they are involved in one of Iris Schema's roles. Many practically incoherent scenes get in the way of the film, which finally comes to an end. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time making some pretty pictures with cameraman Geoffrey Simpson, but does not create a sense of style that could compensate for and decorate the wispy, pathetically underlined script; Unfortunately, Ogilvies' sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring of the scenes and the exposure, is astonishingly incompetent. In an early scene Daisy suddenly appears with the protagonists in the car. How she got there and who she really is seems to have lost Ogilvie's thoughts. There are many more examples of this sloppiness. Where he chases poetic economy, he is only irritated. He receives uncomfortable performances from actors who are usually reliable and bad at misusing Weaving, relying on Byrne's ability to project a kind of spooky, doll-like humanity, while saddled with an incomprehensible character. Rather, if the story has more characters and a stronger conspiracy preferably, had not stolen from a dozen old Noir films and decorated with witty speckled pop culture quotes. But it does not. It's boring.
