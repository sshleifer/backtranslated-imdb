HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. But the critics quickly showed that they blended their ignorance with a complete lack of humor by slamming the show because they felt it was a cheap attempt to redeem the success of American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both were opened with "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & the Comets. Both took place in a past time and both played Ron Howard as one of the main roles. But there were also some major differences. While the American GRAFFITTI was held in California in 1962, when a group of newly graduated high school students were about to make that big step into adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson, and focused on a group of teenagers at the University High school, which dealt with the college joys and sorrows of puberty. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS was originally opened with the Juke Box, which features the original version of Bill Haley & ROCK THE CLOCK of the Comets. As oldies reached the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to the success of American GRAFFITTI and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK from 1954 and again became a hit in 1974, the royalties went through. A "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then introduced for the second season, when the reminder does me good right. <br /> <br /> Fans and enemies agree that this show is escapistic. Freedoms were taken and details overlooked, making this show less authentic. <br /> <br /> That's fine. HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. Occasionally, sometimes the authors stretch out through controversial topics. One episode revolved around the Cunningham building of a failing shelter. Another episode was about a divorced woman who moved into the neighborhood and dreamed of starting a new life. The theme of prejudice was raised when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army colleague who happened to be black (at a time when prejudice and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American lifestyle). The issue of the draft even appeared in a later episode! <br /> <br /> The show, as originally set in 1955. One problem that was handled wisely was the cast. Most of them were teenagers, and as each year passed, it was obvious they were getting older, so that the series got older with the cast and the series from the safe waters of the Eisenhower years to the age of Camelot to JFK and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s. Along with the writers who run out of ideas, and later on, members like Ron Howard, who left the series and gave up wisely while they were ahead, wished they'd done everything right by pulling the plug on this show and stopping had while they were ahead. Along with the idol-worshiping studio audiences, who could not control themselves every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene, it quickly became very thin. <br /> <br /> This show originally showed the Fabulous Fifties as we WANT to remember this era. The time heals wounds. Everything has its place and although I would prefer to hear the "original hit versions" over these "new stereo recordings", these "new stereo recordings" worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And here I regret that I bought the DVD! In contrast to the complete DVD of the first season, the original music of the entire second season was replaced by other music. While it's great that the original episodes were digitally perfected digitally, removing the original music destroyed what made the show so much fun to watch.
