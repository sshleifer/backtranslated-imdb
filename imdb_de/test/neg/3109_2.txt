Honestly, I had no really high expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hopeful. The directing of Albert Pyun - one of the better-known authors of B-movies - has not really sparked my hopes. I mean, how many Albert Pyun-Flicks are classified that high? Yes, exactly ... but the movie still had a good cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-born star), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> It's all in a squat, but the movie is so boring and so slow that the energy just seemed to drain straight out of me the longer it went. It runs over 90 minutes, but tells a story that could have been told in 30 minutes. I do not know what Pyun wanted here. I mean, the movie looks artistically similar, but it's a bit blurry at times, and maybe I'm an idiot because this time I expected more from Pyun. Here he actually seemed to have a budget and a potentially good cast for the material, but it's all wasted. Crazy Six is ​​not exactly an action movie, it's not really everything. <br /> <br /> I think what's the saddest thing is that I found the credits as the most entertaining part of the movie. The music score is actually half decent with a few smooth female voices, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said, the better. Avoid.
