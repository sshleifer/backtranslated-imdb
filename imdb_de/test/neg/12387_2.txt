I have not read the book and due to this customization I will not care. I hated every character on this show - Miranda was slutty, selfish and mumbled unhappily through the dreadful dialogue, her sister was a total weakling and this was the worst portrayal of manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in psychology and that was not exactly. Until it was mentioned, I did not know that Troy should be bipolar - I thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant. whose brilliant psychotic performance was the only thing that made me see the second half. <br /> <br /> Of course, the authors and producers of this series have not investigated - Troy's mental issues are not very accurate, and the forensics are not over with the "twist" (and if you have not noticed this mile away , You're a big old pacifier!) <br /> <br /> Outer garbage.
