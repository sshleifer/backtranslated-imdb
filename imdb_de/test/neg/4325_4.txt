If possible, try to watch all five "Mummy" movies in sequence, not so much on the continuity between the movies, but on the apparent lack of it. It goes without saying that the original Boris Karloff classic "The Mummy" should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the so-called "extensions", all of which act as Campy or cult. <br /> <br /> This time, the mummified remains of Princess Ananka have come to the United States. And once again, when your eyes cheat on you, Kharis, the mummy, has not really died for the second time in "The Tomb of Mum", but is living and searching for his lost love, Princess Ananka, with the help of the rhetorical nine Tana leaves brewed during the full moon cycle. In order to complete the mythology, Kharis needs a caretaker who is cleverly occupied by John Carradine as Yousef Bey, who was entrusted by George Zucco's Andoheb, the high priest of Arkan, with the task. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka are to be returned to their last resting places in the hills of Arkan in Egypt. But as we have already seen, it is a sure thing to be entrusted with the task of a high priest, and Carradines character falls on the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It is shocking to see Yousef Bey and the PO'ed bandaged beaten over the beautiful Amina. <br /> <br /> Puzzles me - in "Tomb" and "Curse" Lon Chaney shows the mummy with a flaccid right arm, which is helplessly crossed over the chest. When he meets the unconscious Amina, he raises her without problems in both arms. As soon as he puts her down, his right arm returns to its crippled position. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is most notable - the monster gets the girl! But it is a short-lived victory as the mummy and his abducted bride succumb to a swampy grave, an Egyptian curse is fulfilled - "The fate of those who resist the will of the ancient gods will be a cruel and violent death."
