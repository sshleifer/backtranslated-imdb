I just came here to look for an alternative title at Terror Hospital so I know what I should not pick up. Not only do I get the original title, but I also think that Terror Hospital is one of seven other aliases. This one is a real clunker. Films like this can usually be omitted for a variety of reasons, usually unintended consequences of the feature at each stage of production, which bring at least a mild form of entertainment, usually entertaining. That does not matter. Instead, the viewer is witness to unnecessarily unnecessary and, for the situation, to comfortable exposure and lengthy scenes of characters moving cautiously from room to room, and all this is half of the movie. Do not forget to find out where someone is (or who he is), even in dark or nocturnal scenes; you probably do not care anyway. There's also a random car-tracking sequence that looks pretty boring when compared to the old driver's old movies, um. Really, we're talking about mysticism, possessions and a deadly killer - not a bad recipe for garbage cinema. Unfortunately, there is nothing here that makes the garbage "good"; In conjunction with the above, the bad-looking and not so special effects are just that - bad acting and not so special effects. This is just garbage, pure and simple. Leave it in the pawnshop on the shelf or in the box at the farm sale. There is a reason for that ...
