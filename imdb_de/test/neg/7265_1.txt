In short, this film is an explanation for the bankruptcy of artists. Almodovar is by far the most important European filmmaker of the 80s and 90s. No other living director has shaped the style and content of today's European cinema as he did. It is not easy to say, therefore, that his recent efforts are not just another disappointment after two lackluster films, but rather a complete and total catastrophe confirming that he runs out of ideas, humor and, above all, empathy for the characters he creates. <br /> <br /> This is not because of the complexity of the story. All Almodovar films can hardly be summarized. This time it's pretty easy if you're familiar with his previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", only this time the director is straight and the jealous beloved lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those of you who do not know this movie, I 'll make a summary. If you do not want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind man, who used to be a famous film director, seduces a sexy woman who reads him a newspaper after a chance encounter on the street (yes, really, that's how it starts). At this moment he is visited by his agent and his best friend. He mentions that he has learned from the newspaper that a certain millionaire has died, something the story takes 14 years ago. He can still see and is about to conduct his next movie. He plays the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the main role, because he is in love with her immediately. The millionaire discovers her affair in silent movies of his gay son, which he has lip-synched from an interpreter (some great scenes: Cecilia Roth). After fierce confrontations, the mistress flees with the director to a seaside resort, where he learns that the millionaire who produced the film, let him bring out in the worst possible version, which the director's reputation was destroyed. The couple decides to return, but suffers an accident in which the director becomes blind and the aspiring actress dies. In the present he learns that his agent has preserved the negatives of the film and begins to reconstruct it. <br /> <br /> As in "Bad Education", there are various negotiations that spice up this rather slender story, and like in "Bad Education", the result is rather confusing rather than satisfying. For example, the son of the agent who works as a DJ has an accidental overdose of drugs - which is completely unnecessary for the conspiracy and is interpreted rather poorly. <br /> <br /> Mostly the actors are not guilty, but the way their characters are written. Blanca Portilla, as an agent, has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. Lluis Homar is the dream of an old man of a protagonist who lives in an artificial world where an English alias and a few sweet words can seduce any supermodel. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of the sexual fantasy of this old man. Her character is completely lifeless. It is completely incomprehensible why she went from an old man who had at least helped her family to a somewhat less old man, who is not charming enough to convince either as a romantic hero or as a passionate assurance. <br /> But all these shortcomings would not make this movie so horrible. However, Almodovar does the worst when a director (or any other storyteller) runs out of ideas: he quotes himself, something he has done increasingly and brings little value. The film-in-the-movie that Broken Embraces uses as a tool of action is actually "Women on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown" (1988), only this time it's called "Chicks and Suitcases." This rather unimaginative title can give you an indication of how this popular classic is treated here: While the dialogue that makes up the last ten minutes of "Broken Embraces" is a fierce exchange of screwball inserts in the original movie, here it is a stern one , colorless, annoying business meeting. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is the DOA spirit child of an exhausted creator of past wonders, pretty horrible and disappointing like the last Indiana Jones movie. Maybe not so many people agreed because Almodovar used to be such a genius. I would rather express my respect for his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to look at "All About My Mother", "Bondage Me" or "High Heels" or "Matador", all of which testify to the unique nature of Almodovar and unmatched talent. A few more movies like this, and his legacy can most likely be destroyed forever.
