I've just seen Fingersmith and am amazed to see the average rating of 8/10 for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only was the storyline hard to follow, but it did appear as if the character development was being randomly applied <br /> <br /> The actors were adequate, but trying to create twists and turns , their characters are completely one-dimensional. Once this happens, the story gets really flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And in the event that someone has not seen the predictable lesbian undertones from afar, this is ultimately banal of the film. <br /> <br /> The final scene is disappointing and is called, and everyone who sat back and said, "Ohhh, so they were all the rug boys!", has to go out in the evening. <br /> Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the previous scene, which was at least a bit slender, not for the rest ...
