This cheap and trashy film is about a NASA test rocket sent into space with an animal charge. It disappears for a while, then returns unexpectedly, collapsing in a forest and triggering a wanton creature. <br /> <br /> Like many films of this kind, Night Fright offers dumb teens who will be killed before the surf music of the 60s. However, none of the killings are memorable even remotely, as we really do not see anything. One thing we do see is that one of the teens seems to be around 40 years old and wears a pretty stupid haircut. <br /> <br /> For a creature feature to work, it really has to be monster properly to the viewer. In this movie, however, we get only the shortest insights into the monster. It seems like the alien of Robot Monster. But I am not sure; Since the photography was so dark, I just could not understand what the hell was going on. My feeling, however, was that I probably did not miss much.
