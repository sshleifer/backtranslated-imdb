What a stupid movie. Although it looks nice, it does not make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's "madness" was that she was only one woman ahead of her wife. On the other hand, she has an obsession stemming from the worst Victorian novel of the abused woman, and that seems to be a kind of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie would be what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not managed to get past Essex's sexual attraction.
