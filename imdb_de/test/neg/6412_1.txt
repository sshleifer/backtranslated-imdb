"Fate" makes Walter Sparrow come into possession of a mysterious novel that has uncanny similarities and connections to his life, all based on the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow has to figure out the connection he has to the book and how the story will eventually end. <br /> <br /> The number 23 offers a fascinating premise that is offset by a weak execution. The film has just failed on many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it has so much potential. The script was probably the worst part of it. It was full of stupid sequences and ridiculous dialogues that simply killed the mood of the movie. It seemed the scriptwriter had a good idea, he simply did not know how to develop it to last for ninety minutes. In the second half of the movie, the ideas were over, the twist was pretty obvious and the end was awful. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst films of all time and he has cashed himself a little for Phone Booth and a few other films, but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still a stinker can make. He soaked the movie in style, but he just can not get a good focus. He moves the film at a harsh and slow pace. He changes from reality to what actually happens in the book, which quickly became annoying. The actual book in the movie titled "The Number 23" is a horrible detective story, and the audience gets stuck as Carrey tells it, telling it that bores me to tears. When Carrey finally finishes the book, we stop and watch him walk around to solve the puzzle. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We are waiting impatiently for the movie to reach its terrible end and unconvincing explanation before we celebrate that the movie is finally over. <br /> <br /> The acting was mostly average and rather forgotten. Jim Carrey was obviously just sleepwalking at his performance and he did not even seem to be trying. In some scenes he was either completely over the top or just very wooden. His story was a boring matter he could listen to, and he did not give life to his character. Virginia Madsen has done her best with a limited role, but she has to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty boring like Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was a horrible thriller that offered more laughter than thrill or thrill. Rating 3/10
