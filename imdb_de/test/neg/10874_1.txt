Because pretty much Hell Ride. Larry Bishop and Tarantino are celebrating Weinstein's money, promising to make a film someday. I'm all fake boobies and alcohol like the next one, but did we really need the movie? There is nothing worse than the used remains of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 1970s Grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era for which it claims to pay homage. No, that's a smooth and shiny MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the confident, pseudo-hip, quirky movie world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three men were at least talented and had good reason to succeed. Hell Ride is just a used copy, fickle and uninspired, polished when it should be raw, the "supercool" aspect seems forced and stupid. <br /> <br /> There is no reason, for example, why a simple and totally inhumane story needs to be told up and down in a timely fashion. It's just a post-Tarantino scam. There's also no reason why the dialogues need to be so mind-boggling that people rattle their gums and say nothing: at least when Travolta talked about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction, it felt fresh. Dialogues are not much more than a pseudo-macho attitude. There is also no reason why a lattice rock'n'roll guitar has to move purposefully throughout the movie. Perhaps the lowest hell ride is a hit if it tries to be quasi-existential. There is a funny dream / illusion scene in the desert where Bishop eats Peyote and sees colors. I half expected an old Indian to come out and offer Nuggets of Wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only saving mercy of this vile crap is the fool and Vinnie Jones's monologue about his wing tattoos (and maybe some of them) the desert's outdoor shots). Lots of boobage and hot, lightly dressed women. That's something I can leave behind, but a movie they do not do. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely talented imitators.
