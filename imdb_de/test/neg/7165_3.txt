I liked some characters, but our lead relies too much on a charming smile. I was not interested in two things. He makes bad decisions and I really did not care, as he did not seem to. He seemed pretty unintelligent. There were a few moments that allowed a chance for human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but these are lost in the movie's general malaise. The love interest was acceptable and the other different characters were slightly interesting, but the plot snakes too much and does not let me see it in many parts of the movie. In the end, I wondered why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> There are some moody humorous moments, but in the end I did not care. I can not rate the movie higher. - 3 out of 10
