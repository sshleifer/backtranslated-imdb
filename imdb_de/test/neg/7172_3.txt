This film starts with children who tell urban legends like the poodle in the microwave and get something extra at a chicken place. Unfortunately, it will then become your basic anthology film. The first topic was a janitor with a little secret. This is fine at best. Then things get even worse when the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies goes on and on and on and on. It's too long and not too interesting to start with. Then you get the typical shock scene and it ends. You need more than that in an anthology film. You need at least three stories and one should not be so long that it becomes terribly uninteresting, especially considering that you can see how it is removed a mile away.
