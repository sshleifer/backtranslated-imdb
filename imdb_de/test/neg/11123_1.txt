Chupacabra: Dark Waters is one of the nastiest idiots ever made. I had expected some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after watching this movie, I can honestly say that I've significantly lowered my opinion on Mr. Davies. <br /> <br /> Why? Acting is incredibly bad. An outstanding actor like Davies should have asked for more from the actors and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just watching the clock, hoping the check would not jump. To say he just turned up would be an understatement. But at least he showed himself. The rest of the cast looks like they're sending them from their respective jobs in the various restaurants in Los Angeles, where they work as waiters. Talk about a number of unknowns! This is the kind of cast never to be seen in movies again. They behave as if they had been auditioned while waiting at the employment office. <br /> <br /> What about the special effects? The store bought firecrackers, polystyrene, a cheap rubber suit, and CGI effects that look like they came from my 1980 Atari game. I've seen some terrible special effects in sci-fi channel movies, but those things looked like cutting kids who made a kid in kindergarten. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob to turn up in the end to fight the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all of the creature's accounts describe it as a small Gremlin-like creature. It would have been a good movie for a goblin-like character. Instead, we get a gigantic, hulking creature that runs with laughing stop-action effects. The Chupacabra is in one place and then he's shuffling down the hall at breakneck speed and it's worth a laugh just to see that.
