Rose ?? Is something really happening in this episode? It introduces our two leads, a slow-witted, grinning idiot of a doctor and a most uninteresting companion. There is no plot to talk about, childish humor, mixed with extremely bad tempo and random music. What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> The end of the world? A slight improvement as we see our first space scenario. Then plunged by bad contemporary humor, paper-thin logic, very slow pace and tired SF clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead ?? The best episode so far shows what can happen if someone knows how to structure an episode, write interesting character dialogues AND integrate a fascinating storyline. Let the doctor and the rose alone. <br /> <br /> Aliens of London / World War III - Doctor degenerating to farce. What else can be said. Penelope Wilton gets a little harder and tries her best in difficult circumstances. In these two episodes, some ill-written and inappropriate soap opera elements come to the fore and a return to bad tempo, bad plotting, and dignified humor / satire. Dalek ?? Not great, but still way above the FTE price. The tempo and the script are all fine (though the Doctor and Rose still irritate). The implications and threats of the Dalek are well established. The finale, however, required an interesting premise that turned the doctor's notorious enemy into a cuddly confusing chaos, turning a previously unseen threat into a blue rubber marmar looking like a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game - The first RTD script that shows every action, even if it was in a stereotypical 80s style. Still, it was somewhat hampered by its usual reliance on youthful jokes, which in the future was too far away to be logically meaningful, and again a bad pace. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but immediately forgotten. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial premise may have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic leave this episode right from the start. We also have a whole episode of Soap Opera. Before you begin to think that this is just characterization, remember, there is a big difference between lame soap opera and characterization. On the positive side, RTD is not the worst screenwriter yet. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances - This began in a mediocre manner, with a few damn worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even a primary schoolchild would not make (well-lit windows in a blackout , anyone?). After that, the first part makes a more interesting and uncanny twist. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes and shows us how an interesting fellow could have been. She could act too. Instead, we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as a new companion. The conclusion was a bit premature, but sufficient. The tempo and script improved with a pretty good plot, making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I have to be honest, apart from a few examples. I was so disillusioned with the current series that after watching the trailer for another 'Slitheen' episode, I gave up and did nothing I'm not submitting to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, probably the worst facet of modern media, is basically used as a premise. There is no subtlety. Do we get interesting social comments like in The Running Man or Truman Show? No of course not. This in an RTD episode, so they are basically here to cynically attract the audience of said shows. Once again, logic goes out the window as we are placed 200,000 years into the future. RTD senselessly tries to make a shoehorn here in an "overblown" story, with no relevance beyond its own existence and when the bad guys are revealed in the end ... idiot for the climax! Much faster than RTD's other efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise another lackluster rate. <br /> <br /> The separation of the ways - The grand finale. Literally more a wet octopus. The entire Dalek threat set up in "Dalek" crashes as it becomes quite miserable. So many storylines go through this episode with typically weak constructions. Daleks want to reap people as Daleks, but then evaporate entire continents? Daleks can vaporize these continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis are now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over humans, so they can be saved. This ability can not be used to easily destroy the Dalek "god"? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents, but do not just destroy the satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and let him play around instead. The doctor is a wretched coward without the conviction of his actions, after he has eradicated his entire species to eliminate the Daleks? Aside from these and many other holes, we are treated to the lame charges ex machina ever conceived, combined with an almost meaningless story arc. <br /> <br /> So what can we say about the new series? all? <br /> <br /> Would this have won a second series, if it was anything but Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have considered anything but uninteresting and memorable if they were anything but Doctor Who and matched RTD's name? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Some people would make us think we could not say anything against RTD because we owe it because we bring Doctor Who back to our screens. But at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I'd rather not have a poorly planned, ill-conceived product delivered at this price. I would rather wait for someone to come with me and try hard. Most of the time it's puerile garbage that gives SF a bad name and otherwise destroys creative genres.
