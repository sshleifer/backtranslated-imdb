Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically it is terrible. The drama is not so good either. But there is something about wanting to see more (like a car accident). The ridiculous close-ups of killer eyes are funnier than anything else. If you're looking for a fear, that's not the movie for you. It is very dark and almost impossible to find. I am sure there is a reason for that. For a while it was called HOSTAGE. It does not matter what you call it, it's still a bad choice for entertainment. It might be good for a MST3000 party or something. Can you believe that they would use such a title as SON FROM SON? If that is not exploited everywhere, I'll eat my hat. I remember when this was shot in Belmont, NC. Many local personalities have been used as a talent.
