After his widowed father died in a fall accident, young Tom Burlinson (as Jim Craig) has to manage his Australian "Snowy River" farm, with only run-down prospector Kirk Douglas (as a lane) helping. The times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson works for Mr. Douglas' wealthy, silver-haired brothers Rancher "Mr. Harrison" (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a big job is in store, the silver-haired (older?) Douglas thinks Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to get involved. So Burlinson stays behind and falls in love with the daughter of the boss, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The least satisfying aspect of director George Miller's "The Man of the Snowy River" is weak Action For example, note the sequence of events "Jessica is lost". The girl loses herself in one of those "freak" storms while running away. Her worried father collects drunken men to find her after predicting bad weather. Damsel "Jessica" rolls to the edge of a comfortable cliff. Father and the suddenly sober men do not test Burlinson's farm. Hero Burlinson discovers the girl. After building a fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> The "romance" is played too innocent to see such an obvious man and a woman as Burlinson and Ms. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark story" that is revealed before a mystery builds on the issue. The main attraction here is the Australian landscape.
