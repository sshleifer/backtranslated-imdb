If I had to choose the most depressing movie, try to be exciting. I saw that it would be this one. I know how good the original should be, it should be better than this. The movie is so dark and depressing, but it's not interesting to look at it. I have seen depressing Thriler films that have been stored because of the tension to counteract the dark quality. Vanishing did not have that, it was so disturbing in the beginning, and there was nothing positive to make this movie into a classic movie. I think another IMDb poster got it right when it was said that this genre has just seen thrillers that are far superior. I totally agree - I would recommend skipping this - maybe I'll look at the original someday, but I doubt it. I give a 2 out of 10 points.
