TART is the worst movie I've seen this year. These include both the Affleck / J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie Borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I do not know if this is a fair comparison since TART was made two years ago and probably has only half the budget of the low budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three films suffer from the same shortcomings: terrible screenplay, terrible drama, terrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (Although I honestly do not think there is anything to ruin there) <br /> <br /> TART is about a group of super spoiled kids. Most of them live in super-sized apartments in New York's extremely expensive Park Avenue, thanks to the finances of their negligent parents. The film shows the aimless life of one of the students (Cat) as she throws off her only true friend (as reckless as she is) in the pursuit of the "good life" with the in-crowd. Of course this leads to sex, drugs and music that are much worse than Rock & Roll. Everything is so dramatic, as is the case with really bad movies. Cat's first sexual experience results in her branding and outlawing her newly acquired circle of friends as a trampoline; Her first encounter with drugs causes her to almost be dumped in a garbage chute after her cohorts considered her an overdose. No insulting news there, he said sarcastically. This is mainly what the Plot "Seen 100 Times" plot contains. Other minor and even less interesting details of the plot include a friend stealing jewelry and trinkets from all others, a wild, marginal life-living child (and finally falling off at night in the EAST Hamptons), a Semitic British chick who enjoys her close friendship ended with Cat as soon as she finds out that Cat has a Jewish father, and Cat's tense relationship with her single mother who unsuccessfully tries to make Cat pay tribute to her privileged life. The thief turns out to be an irretrievable life. The "wild child" is played as a weakened version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears after separating from the movie. The mother-daughter relationship is considered completely meaningless until the final schmaltzy scene of the film is completed, in which she and her besieged mother have some sort of reconciliation. * Yawning * <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the cast and crew .... Dominique Swain made a strong showing in 1997 with her role as an inferior seductress very well observable LOLITA and FACE / OFF. Their performances were strong enough to land them on some "ones-to-watch" lists. She was 17 at the time and I hope that she will not be the best person in her career. If she takes on a few more roles like the ones she takes in TART, it can be very good. <br /> <br /> I just saw Bijou Phillips in another movie (BULLY) and I swear her performance in that one was almost identical to the one she gave here. I am not sure if she is not able to give varied performances, or if it was just a coincidence that her roles in the two were so much alike. My guess is that the former is true. I have the feeling that this woman has very little talent in acting. Here she is the actress who was tapped to portray the watered-down Hilton sister. That she plays so weak is amazing, considering that she grew up with the real Hilton sisters and is friends with them. She essentially plays a version of herself in this movie and does a damn bad job. <br /> <br /> As for the writer / director Christina Wayne ... I know nothing about her, except TART was her first, and only movie project to date. With such a first try, it's no wonder that her career in show business was short-lived.
