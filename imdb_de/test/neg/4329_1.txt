Imagine watching a slideshow where the projector stays on each slide long enough to completely store it three times. Now imagine that the images in the slideshow consist exclusively of earthly scenes. a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. Imagine that the people performing the slideshow are having a frustratingly slow, half-clear conversation about events that only occasionally refer to the slides they show you. Great ?? You have just presented the entirety of the movie "India Song". <br /> <br /> The film is a torturously slow montage of images that do little except shout "Look at me!" I am PROFOUND! 'with such blatant self-importance that the images themselves and the film as a whole are not only deprived of depth but COMICALLY of depth. The visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above, as it is so rare that in fact people can be seen on the canvas, and even if they are, people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture , You never speak or interact in a meaningful way? They just stand there looking at each other and occasionally crying. The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the movie is when three people walk in slow motion across a parking lot. In fact, the visuals could easily have been left out altogether, as the story is told completely by narrative. The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot and hates that people do not hate India because it's hot (this point is treated several times). It's also about a man who feels like he's allowed to sleep with the above woman, since she will sleep with anyone who asks her, but he can not sleep with her just because he never asks, and he is very upset about it. So he stares at her as a single tear runs down his cheek. Later, he stares at his bike as a single tear runs down his cheek. Actually, you do not see the only tear running down his cheek when he's staring at his bike, but you know it's there anyway, just because that's the kind of movie he's in. Best of all is the narrative to background hum and serves as a perfect compliment to the comaerregenden pictures. Being aware of the whole movie requires the utmost determination. To see it, and to actually come up with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what it was all about, would bring about the same kind of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic claim that man will ever experience.
