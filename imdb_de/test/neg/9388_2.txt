On the plus side, I say it's pretty enough to be observable. On the negative side, it's bland enough that life in front of the screen is wasted for another 2 hours. Long, whiny and pointless. And I'm not saying that this is mean, I really wanted to like this movie, it seemed to offer everything, had the so-called "buzz" and was also hard to look beyond. If I had more trouble on the story page, that would have been amazing. And I expect that the team behind it will do a wonderful job in the future, they clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for your future efforts, let them go.
