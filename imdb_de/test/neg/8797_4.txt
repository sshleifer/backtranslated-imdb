There was a time in the US that everything was possible on film, so the roughies, movies with horror and explicit scenes came. The best known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but of course these were created with a little budget. All shown on the 42nd in NY, but hey, there were other mills out there that had no budgets. Wet wilderness is an example of this. After a while, he turned the underground scene over so that copies were available, but as seen in other reviews, some copies were cut abruptly at the end. But the version I looked at was complete. Well, I would call this a porno rather than a jerk, there's a serial killer, but he prefers to have others sex instead of killing them. The drama is the worst thing I've ever seen. And I guessed that the so-called actors did not like what they do, for example at the beginning, when we watch the lesbian scene, a girl stops working and a pubic hair gets out of her mouth, then he continues what happens or When the mother rides the black man, the daughter sits in the grass and is angry with ants! But it is the story that made this story famous. Incest and racism have made her famous. When blood gazes, the two girls sitting there waiting for a sign to act, God, that's worse, but still one when you're in Sleaze and Grindhouse. Make sure you have the full version.
