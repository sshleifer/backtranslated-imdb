When I saw this movie for the first time in the theater, I was so angry. It blew me away in my opinion. I have not seen it for a decade and then decided what the hell, let's see. I now watch all the Hellraiser films to see where things went wrong. My guess is that the fifth installment was the first one to implement the whole thing, oh no matter. "- Happy Story These sequels do not even require the box to be opened or follow the rules of the first 4 movies. The first 3 Hellraisers stuck to this story, which initially made them so scary, nothing fancy, nothing weird, the box was opened, Kirstey was the only one who got the Because of Uncle Frank, then because she had information about the Cenobites, this film at least tries to cling to all of that, even though it was a bad story, it was still a bit hellish, no, I'm pretty sure that part 5 was the first part that completely and completely destroyed the Hellraiser series, now they are redoing 1, and I do not think I'll look at it, oh, who am I? Jokes, I'll probably be disappointed and again ....
