This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the first 10 minutes I was ready to go. The stereotypes there hit you in the face and the action was not only predictably stupid, but full of holes more than Swiss cheese. I'm considering complaining for those lost 2 hours, and $ 6.25 along with the fact that I'm stupid now to watch this waste of film. The T-Rex have to spin in their graves, so to speak.
