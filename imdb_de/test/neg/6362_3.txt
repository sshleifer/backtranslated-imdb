Well, this movie was not as horrible as I thought. I expected to award a star. I opted for three. Why? Well, it's not so bad for a kitschy horror movie. Sure, the characters are sticky (as is their play - including a young Leonardo DiCaprio), the effects look cheap and the monsters ... let's just say, I've seen more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... there was something this movie that made me watch him to the end. A little humor helped a bit, I think. And if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas, this movie will make your dream come true. 3.10
