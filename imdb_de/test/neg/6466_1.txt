Ladies and gentlemen, may we present the worst of all Disney remakes? Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it should have been "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat did not get really good scenes, Ricci's character was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug did not get good lines, even Dean Cay's role could not save this movie! The only really good characters were the city's only two auto mechanics, but their scenes were brief. All in all, I would say that if you're considering the movie, you're looking for something more intelligent than a Barney video.
