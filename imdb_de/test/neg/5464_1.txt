Well, it really made me stunned - I can not believe anyone made another Australian movie that is even more boring than Somersault. The story is not plausible, the characters, with the exception of Friels and Mailman, are unlikely and wooden. Tom Long has a variety of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and the "sex scenes" that would have been most likely confrontation and disturbing eroticism were in a low-budget porn movie home. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I have seen in the cinema for 30 years and on the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and walk. <br /> <br /> The best part about this movie is the billboard.
