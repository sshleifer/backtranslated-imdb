With this movie I had really hoped that the idea was to make up for the crowded incompetence of the first AVP, and to my horror: Requiem is far worse than I could imagine. <br /> <br /> My hopes I was in the Predator ship for the first few moments of the movie, and I almost took a deep breath when we finally saw the Predator Homeworld (a throwaway digital matte painting, but still beautiful to them) finally to be seen) and then of course People (if such poorly written characters can be described as such) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> One has to wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie Aliens and Predators. At least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> Characters are set up in the same way we would expect them to be from the worst Friday of the 13th episode. The pizza-making scene was staggering, as was any other scene of interaction with the characters who followed it. Bimbos and adolescent non-actors do not make a REAL movie, they make a cheap movie, and Alien 1-3 and the Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st alien is a "B "Movie is done as an" A "movie) The Strause brothers have really missed a chance that could have been corrected by knowing their Alien + Predator roots: in the Alien and Predator movies we become characters Alien: Refinery Workers, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts, and in the Predator Movies we generally follow one of the main heroes of a unit (Predator, Arnold Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises have started to go awry: in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates ... or something, AVP we have ... explorers? ... with weapons? And of course we in AVP-R jugendli Slasher clichés. What is there to identify here? In conception, the idea of ​​a convict returning to a small town and a war veterinarian returning seemed to be a first-blood action hero, but like many other things, he was never paid. <br /> <br /> The film-making is also without rhyme of reason. The action is not straight forward, just small sequences that build the least tension or interest, just to cut them off when they get interesting. The audience is taken out of the movie with every move. The action scenes themselves, though much confused in the trailers, are so dimly lit that it is literally impossible to tell what is going on in the fight scenes when they finally occur. Basically, the film is obstructed from many levels. Bad actors combined with bad direction and a horrible screenplay (which I myself noticed as a scriptwriter seemed to have met every wrong tone and cliché that only the most unsympathetic writer with no ideas could match) The WRITING, if you can call it that, is not even geared directly to the video quality and also shows no respect for the established tradition of the previous entries in the series. Why does the Predalien suddenly have the ability to shoot foreign embryos into the neck of a pregnant woman to use as an incubator for mammary worms? More than likely because the brain-dead scriptwriter needed a way to have more aliens available for the predator (and given the accelerated growth time, even more than the first AVP: as fast as possible.) Why has a pointless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks ) (Does the alleged characters) substitute for a real character development? (Remember that a character is defined by what he does, not SAY.) Why does the sheriff lead civilians to a weapons cache? (Is not he an officer of the law?) How does the bimbo of all people know where he is, why does the predalan wait for the Predator to remove his mask VERY SLOWLY before he attacks? How on earth was the loot to convince itself of how she could walk? How did it come to a series that said, "People are dying ... we need weapons!" Artistic Call, It's Like Anyone A person involved in creating this movie suffered from mental impairment or is really unable to perform at any level of the film production process. <br /> <br /> The EFFECTS are pretty bad this time. The aliens look like men in suits and ADI only gets lazy with their creature design. The aliens look like modified remains of alien resurrection, with the same bulky muscles around their arms, as if they did not learn from this movie that it's not a good design and not a good recycled material. Again, everything is cloaked in such a state of darkness, not to create a secret or an atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. And just like AVP, Stan Winston is painfully missed when the fake Predator face is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are too many mistakes that I want to list, so I'll just say the following: Do not waste your money on this movie. Fox no longer cares about the fans, as this cheap and trashy movie is clearly a proof. I had a bad feeling that I had taken my girlfriend (although it was free) and apologized to her much later. This is a diehard fan who's done with the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not a pointless Slasher movie, it was a movie adaptation of the original Darkhorse comic book, which was better than anything you produced for this 1993 franchise. <br /> <br /> Sign out.
