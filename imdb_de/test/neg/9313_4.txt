He becomes a beast and even begins to kill his own comrades. When no one returns from battle to the kingdom, the king curses the land of battle and forbids anyone to go there. One day, a rebel who wants to marry the princess decides that it is time to go to the cursed land to claim it for the king, and the king agrees to lie the kingdom that the king is captured and was killed. He takes the throne and prepares to marry the princess, but the night before her wedding, the princess flees into the country to fight the beast herself. Only when she comes to the cursed land, she begins to realize that her father is still alive and the animal may not be so evil.
