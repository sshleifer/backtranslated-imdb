I saw this movie a few years ago and I never want to play golf again. I mean, ninjas do not seem to have any respect for the game of golf or the way it developed. And I'm not talking about "victimless," like forging a scorecard. No no. Based on what I've seen here, they shamelessly massacre policemen and golfers on the revered Country Club grounds. Judge Smailes would turn in his grave. And do you regret the said sins? No, no, based on what I've seen here, the typical reaction of a killed ninja is to take the body of a draped female repairer and take revenge. I find that morally reprehensible and I do not need to say that I not only stopped playing golf and phoning, but also decided to feed the homeless.
