The filmmaker wanted to make a film without telling a story - and did it. Really terrible mess of unlikely / inexplicable coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get stereotypes instead of characters. One of them is the tiny and beautiful criminal boss who projects an exaggerated "hard-man" personality and casts a caricature of intimidation over the really tough guys used for their work. There was nothing particularly exciting about the movie except a shot of the guys walking out onto the street and one of them holding a tiny suitcase (like the smallest of a complete American Tourister set) in a bright sky-blue sky with no explanation or apology. Otherwise, it is optically standard - another exception is the convincing shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.
