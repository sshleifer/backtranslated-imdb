That's more than stupid. <br /> <br /> Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket for the summer and find situations that are utterly abhorrent. Demi Moore co-stars in this. Was the film a child in the forest in 1986 when Ashton Kutcher was still a child? <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather died and his house is about to be sold to ruthless people with a father and a son Who brings a new meaning to the term agent. <br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldthwait, with that disgusting voice, is featured in the movie, as are two brothers who make stupidity and stupidity seem smarter. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely ridiculous. Highlights of stupidity are when one person says to the other, "Have you ever noticed that when people die, people are alphabetically in the papers?" <br /> <br /> I'm resting my case.
