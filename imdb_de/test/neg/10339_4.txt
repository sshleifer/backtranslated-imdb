Despite a small handful of beautifully executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, director of the great MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the hefty premise porn photoshoot. Predictable stalking, harassment, assault and rape follow. <br /> <br /> The staple of Roman porn is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting topics, but not when they make so little effort to freshen them up. A masturbation scene in which a woman stirs up her mouth (via a condom) is not too late. <br /> <br /> The rain theme of the series continues and the last scene of the film brings relief.
