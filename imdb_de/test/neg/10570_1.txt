This movie somehow shows 6.2 stars. It seems inconceivable that the director has so many relationships. I can not explain this. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on earth, do not waste 1 & 1/2 of them on this delayed, steaming pile of guano !!! <br /> <br /> There is no story as the director apparently "wrote" (and I guess with a dull orange crayon) the script of the next day when the filming is over. The "story" was described as bizarre, no it is aimless, there may be enough "story" to fill a commercial. Do not hate ads? <br /> <br /> Now, while both leads can trade, they have obviously decided not to be here. And similarly, the author / director can actually write as well as work directly, as evidenced by his next work, "Toy Love." Make sure you avoid it. <br /> <br /> To rewrite Monty Python's quest for the Holy Grail, "Escape!"
