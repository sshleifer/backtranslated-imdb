I started to look at it because I was looking for a nice background comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I realized that this would be a road movie, and I decided to actually look at this. The first 15 minutes were awful, but I wanted to give this a chance because I can never judge a movie without watching it closely. Then it got a little better. This seemed to be a nice road movie about friendship. But then the movie got horrible predictable stereotypes, and when the movie was over, it felt like you were wasting your time. Did that have something to say? Why did they even make a movie? And I did not expect a modern Citizen Kane, but I have several ideas on how this film could have been improved. <br /> <br /> So take my advice with you; Leave it alone and watch a real road movie. There are many of them. I will not make the directors of these films look bad by putting their name on this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
