In Michele Soavi's confusing arthouse zombie movie Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert plays Everett Francesco, a custodian in a cemetery where the dead are not long-buried. With the help of his simple assistant Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the cemetery's zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting his skull with a spade. <br /> <br /> But soon after, the mysterious widow Francesco, one of his recent arrests, is busier than ever. <br /> <br /> After collecting some very positive comments from some of the most respected horror officers in the IMDb, I decided to see what the fuss was about. I just watched the movie, and I can honestly say that I have not been so disappointed with a horror movie for quite some time. <br /> <br /> With its drab, cluttered pseudo-philosophical storyline and Dellamorte Dellamore is an extremely bland performance from the leading man, Everett. Dellamorte Dellamore is an irritating and clumsy mess that can not even rescue a few babbling sayings (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and welcome nudity (from busty Anna Fialchi). I do not understand how much in-depth analysis and discussion this overbearing bilge has received from its misguided fans.
