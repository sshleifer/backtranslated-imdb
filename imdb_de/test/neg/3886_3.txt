With Knightly and O'Tool as lead actor, this movie had good possibilities and with McCallum as the villain after Knightly, maybe some suspense. But they threw everything on stupid evening ruffle and later with warlike remnants of war. It was of course superficial, beautiful English country and the coast or not. The number one mistake was to throw Knightly into the movie so early as she could easily play someone who was a few years older, instead of choosing one ten years older to play the role you missed all the odds, great conflicts between the performers too instead, and stupidly pulled on the simple and inexpensive heart sounding elements.
