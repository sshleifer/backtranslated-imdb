Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in a horror movie; That always sounds like a grandiose plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of her generation, who had previously played in grandiose genre flights such as "The Flesh and the Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave" and have joined forces in a satanic strip of exploitation of the 70s. How could that possibly go wrong? Well, unfortunately it can. To my deepest regret, "Land of the Minotaur" can hardly be described as mediocre, despite the cast, the exotic scenery, the appealing title, and the potentially great-sounding premise. In a remote small area of ​​Greece, especially near an archaeological site, several tourists disappear, because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers repeatedly bring them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing, who has never been bored and uninterested, has a huge medieval castle, and in Greek this means that you also have the ancillary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. This is of course very handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of casual campers and amateur archaeologists. As three of his young friends mysteriously disappear into the same area, Father Roch - the priest of some cities - decides to investigate. "Land of the Minotaur" is a boring and extremely slow horror effort that never really goes to great lengths to create a satanic atmosphere, and does not deal with all the potentially intriguing elements and pagan trifles. The Titular Minotaur, for example, is a fascinating creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason, the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on boring and talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music that is altered with experimental sounds. The only reason you should consider this big disappointment of a movie is Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of a rude, imperious and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that depicts modern youth is as powerful and reliable as ever.
