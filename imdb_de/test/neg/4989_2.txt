Let me first say that I never wanted to see this movie at all. I had to watch it one day, and I figured I could make it easier and enjoy what it is, and it might turn out to be entertaining. What I started with this expectation was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At first, nothing was funny in the least. The creators expected humor as ridiculous / passable when using sarcasm in every line that comes out of the mouth of Underdog and using scene by scene by fad, playing out aspects to "charm" the carefree side of the audience while still "ooh" are "and" ah "for more with boring action scenes and threadbare, lackluster performances that made me want to shout at everyone in the audience who enjoyed it.The acting was boring, the humor was boring and the characters / plot felt They spend about 10 minutes creating all their personalities, leaving no room for the unimaginative actors / actresses to portray their characters with the least depth. "This movie is simple and horrible in every area and really only children under 10 years old will be able to enjoy it, even though it was the age range it targets e, it does not apologize that it is so stupid and causes me to feel so penitent. Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Waterhorse or Hotel for Dogs for the Best, New Family / Kids Movies, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks are better than this dirt!
