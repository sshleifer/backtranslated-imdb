I'm sorry. However, if you have seen this "epic", you will obviously learn of total disregard for the actual text of the Bible. Well, I'm not exactly the next in line for sacred, but I know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to obliterate everyone from the face of the earth because he believed that they were so corrupted that they did not come back. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared because of their unadulterated ways. Noah builds an ark as directed by God to house him, his family, and two of each creature as he flooded the rest of the planet. These are the basics. There are other people in this film who roam the seas like guinea pigs and pirates. But I thought that ALL were extinguished. I think the executives of NBC have never been to church. There are other inaccuracies, I am told, but as an average Joe I have no idea what they are. We are sorry. Back to the movie, it was inaccurate, as I said, the acting stinks, but some of the effects were good, I'll give it. Overall, however, I've seen a better and tastier story than a small scene on The Simpsons. God help the ABC leaders on the Day of Judgment. 3.10
