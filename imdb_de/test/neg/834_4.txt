Unlike the other spaghetti westerns, this character is almost meaningful and can be identified to a degree. It still has the stupid gunplay of other western spaghetti. By the way, a spaghetti is another word for a western without a plot, no characters to look out for, and a silly gunplay that makes no sense for the time and relies on great music so the audience can feel something. This is more carefree, like the ones Bud Spencer and Terence Hill put together. They were also superior to the junk of Eastwood and others, where sado-masochists watch their friends when they have a chance. It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie. It was nice to see a huge actor like Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned in the loan box, which was clearly the biggest name. His character was very enjoyable. In the end, there is a three-way distance that is superior to the one he favors (the good, the bad and the ugly), simply because the characters are at least a bit personable and a bit identifiable. Not a good movie, but has a bit of fun.
