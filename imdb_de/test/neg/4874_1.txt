I just saw it at a local independent station in the New York City area. The cast was promising, but when I saw the director George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And surely it was just as bad, as pointless and stupid as any George Cosmotos movie I've ever seen. He's like a stupid man like Michael Bey - with all the awfulness that the acknowledgments promise. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy makes no sense, no burning issues that the conspirators are pushing. We are left to ourselves to connect the dots of graffiti on different walls in the film with the next. So, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, stagnant wages, and the death of the middle class are all marked by terrible graffiti terror /> <br /> A truly amazing idiotic movie.
