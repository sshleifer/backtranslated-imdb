"SHUT THE FRONT DOOR" That's what I said when I was told that Blockbuster got a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Okay, maybe I did not say that exactly, but you got the point. I did not have to know who was in the movie or anything else. I just knew that I'm lending this movie. <br /> <br /> I should probably have asked what it was about. In retrospect, I do not know if I really wanted to see a movie about a Mayan curse in which a woman gives birth to snakes and spit out of her mouth. I also do not want to watch a movie that shows a guy who looks strangely like a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> However, although the curse may be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still the promise that these annoying characters were eaten or at least killed by snakes. So, I was ready to sit the first less skillful, except for a Texas Ranger who forces a girl into a pretty little bag so she can keep her cocaine or the Hispanic shaman occasionally stabbing people. But then hell broke loose and the girl began to spit out more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * So, in the end, everything is fine and I'm ready to miss the fact Some of these snakes suddenly turned out to be 25 feet long. After all, people are eaten, so everything is fine. But then all of a sudden, and I will not tell you how, because that would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then it continues to squeeze and devour the train, with all of Serpentaur's graphic art from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I could not connect to Nemesis Enforcer with this movie. Anyway, one would think such a big snake that had eaten a train would be pretty unstoppable. Well, not if you know your Maya voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from the sky. Yes, that's all I'm going to say. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is bad. Really bad to the point where you may become numb after observing this, or your brain could get hurt. I did not give this one, because no matter how stupid it was, it was still not as bad as Date Movie. So if you like a stock or badly designed B horror movie, this is the one for you. If you think this is really cool, like its bigger, notorious brothers, then just go away from the box if you see it. And I'll give you a quote from the movie that should basically get it all to the point. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can not get on a train!" Because that's just stupid. Not as if they stop or something ...
