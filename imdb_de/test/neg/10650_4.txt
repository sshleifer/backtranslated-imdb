Rarely seen, a film that deviates so much from the original premise and yet is (more or less) acceptable? Bloodline is a rather short one (which in this case is a good thing), which focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted it to be done and how it captivates the whole bloodline of the man who finally created it. We are introduced to three generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey). one in the 18th century in Paris, one in the present and the last in a future galaxy far away? The opinions on this action can be very different - either you think it is very idiotic and far-fetched or original and daring. The initial atmosphere and attitude of Clive Barker has completely vanished, but the morbid environment remains and some sequences are still very scary and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains quite a few exquisite battles and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is still an added horror. Pinhead ?? accompanied by a puppy this time ?? still knows how to kill ?? he speaks too much too badly and his diabolical speeches quickly get boring. The best of this production are the newly introduced "Cenobites" and the occult Parisian portrait. Huge distractions are the weak script, the lack of typical macabre humor, and the lack of references to Barker's original masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Though not very memorable, Bloodline is the last observable Hellraiser movie. After this sequel, the series went completely downhill. So far, two more extensions have come out (two more are still in progress) and none of them is worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered from many production difficulties and the director preferred to assign Alan Smithee. That means he does not want to be reminded as a director. Who could accuse him?
