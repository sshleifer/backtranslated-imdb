WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Mr. Roger, <br /> <br /> You have made a wide range of entertainment in your remarkable career, some good, some not so good. Bloodborne Night falls into the latter category. It's not as incurably horrible as saying "The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues" or maybe "The Dunwich Horror". Nevertheless, one of my biggest criticisms of this film is that I could have made it faster, better and cheaper for you. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the title and the title. Roger, the rocket sequences look like something of Disney's "Man Into Space", of course not so good. The futuristic rocket ship looks nothing like it in the contemporary 1958. Why did not you just use a Vanguard, Atlas or even a Viking launch? Better yet, why not give up on the start and start with a dash of space and the capsule floating in it? I would have done that for you, Roger. Second, why does the spaceship crash when re-entering? Even a middle school physics student could have told you that your astronaut had arrived on Earth, crispy and largely dismissed. I have shown that your astronaut was "obsessed" with the monster (perhaps by using this great "negative / positive" date you used in "War of the Satellites"), lost contact with Earth, and lost in the Wilderness has landed. That would also explain how you, as a "Blood Beast," can impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of reentry, yet be destroyed by fire. Even with these stupid things. The first half of your movie is pretty good. If you had spent some money on decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of Outer Limits. But again, your author describes Ed Nelson as the designer of the landing system and then gives him a stupid dialogue about magnetism. The biggest problem with the second half of "Night of the Blood Beast" is Michael Emmet. He is terrible as the condemned astronaut. They should have fired him immediately and replaced him with Ed Nelson. They could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with John Dunlap's and saved the cost of an actor. I do not know if you have actually PAID one of these people. However, at least you would save the cost of three meals a day. I had also given up the "scorched parrot" costume and spent the extra money on make-up so the astronaut could turn into the "blood-beast". Maybe that was a bit too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but it would have helped the tempo of the second half enormously. If you have a "blood-beast," would not it be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know the title comes from the embryos in the blood of the astronaut, but Kowalski could have done a much better job for you if he had poured some chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like blood in black and white. What did that cost you, maybe two dollars? I would have used some close-ups as well. For some reason, bland dialogue and bad action in close-ups do not seem so bad. Take a look at almost 70's TV shows and you'll see what I mean. Oh, in the end, Roger, a note to your author. You can not use a fluoroscope to show a poor guy full of alien embryos if you DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY. Do you remember, you fried the generator in the first roll? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, can not you afford a bad knife? You know, the way the blade handles. I had one of those when I was nine. This year also "Night of the Blood Beast" was made. It might cost two dollars more. I think I knew enough to make a better movie. I know, I know enough now to do this. So, Roger, if you want to reissue "Night of the Blood Beast," or if you're looking for an author / director to work with you on ANOTHER PROJECT, then I'm your man. I'll work cheap because I really would like to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I give "Night of the Blood Beast" a "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you like cheesy movies like "Night of the Blood," the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was of very good quality. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" along with many other terrible horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for about $ 6.
