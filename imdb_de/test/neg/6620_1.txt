There is a reason why the CEO received a 2 (which is too high). This movie is one of the worst movies ever and I have seen my share of lazy movies. The CEO shows two of the most annoying actors, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top is just not funny anymore and was not in this garbage. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just look "for Jim" and you'll see a good example of what I'm talking about. The CEO got a 1 from me, because as low as you can go, it's so bad. I'm a bit shocked that this piece of garbage is not anywhere on the IMdb Bottom 100. I would put it among the top 5 on this list, but it is slowly working.
