This movie was very disappointing and apart from a few moments, it was not possible to fly at all. More than anything, it was just stupid. The music was bad and the action took place like a BYU pelvis game? very predictable (avoiding embarrassment from hits, late touchdowns, rallying, which leads to a loss). In essence, the semi-naive / semi-naive Will (the film's release) and his religiously confused brother Danny (we call him just a Democrat) - treat Kirby (the "sweet ghost" of the movie), the third member of their hapless Mormon "boy." band ", like crap, until the man and the father figure of the film (the stage manager Jill) have a conversation with Will and align him. It is to be believed that Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is immediately the band's mature and confident leader. This would be a sweet, maybe funny, 10-minute road show gig, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long is really life for you if you watch it until the end. My advice ?? Take the money you would normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or rinse it in the bathroom. More entertainment with much less time. If you want to see a better movie of the same genre, get yourself saints and soldiers? not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (Kirby actually has more fun stuff in Saints than in SOP).
