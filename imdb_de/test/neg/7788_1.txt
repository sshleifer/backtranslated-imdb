To be honest, it's hard to get through this movie without suffocating on your own vomit. The sloppy animation does not help, because it looks like a decades-old video that you would find in Morrison's 99p trash can. Still, it's better than the terrible script that spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like Belles today's problems, stuff about Scroog's dad, and a lot of charming fannying with - choke - TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC MICE. These bizarre additions consume the screen time at the expense of elements that you think are quite important, such as Dickens dialogue and important parts of his plot - the film, for example, stirs up the game with twenty questions and sometimes can not create scenes in the movie right order. Absolutely hopeless.
