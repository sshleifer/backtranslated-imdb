Around 1980, the name Godfrey Ho was linked to a series of low-comedy action films starring an unlikely actor, Elton Chong. Although not masterpieces of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining for those who have a sense of stupidity. <br /> <br /> It's completely unclear why Ho (or whoever) wants to shoot a movie that would attack Jackie Chan's Drunken MAster, the film that legitimates the creation of comedy action movies in Hong Kong is a savage attack on the Chan movie (the imitation of Chan, who stars in this movie, learns that her opponents will laugh themselves to death - a pointless game in any genre). <br /> <br /> Along with all the mistakes one expects from a Godfrey-Ho movie of the time - no continuity, no motivation, incomprehensible plot, irrelevant and incredible characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable mistakes make him unsurpassable: the fighting scenes stink and the comedy t fun. <br /> <br /> Meaningless.
