"The Mill on the Floss" was one of the smaller novels of Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. Years ago I tried to read this boring and very crude novel but could not finish it. I will only review this version of the film on its own merits, as I do not know how exactly it follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The film's credits are printed in an old English script that points to the Middle Ages. It's a very poor choice for a movie with a backdrop from the 19th century. (On the other hand, about half of the film, we see a close-up of a handbook announcing a estate auction.) This handbook is written in authentic Victorian script and looks * very * convincing.) Very convincing in the architecture and clothing design early 19th century in England. The exact location of the story of this movie is never revealed, but for the actors' accents, I would place it somewhere in the Cotswolds, maybe Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The story of what it is. It's a mill that changes owners a couple of times (over several decades) between two rival families, a wealthy and a working class. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason has only a small role in this film. Mason has the biggest and most central role in this drama as a scion of the wealthier family. Mason, like the spoiled and irritated Tom Tulliver, is grim and intrusive. His performance here is part of a better movie: I wanted "Wuthering Heights" to be remodeled with Mason as Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> As this is a generation of generations in which George Eliot was much better "Middlemarch"), some of the main roles in this film are split between two actors: children actors in the prologue, adults in the main narrative. The prologue of this film shows a very well-written scene in which Tom Tulliver was malicious and victimized from childhood, and the young Philip Wakeham as decent and thoughtful. Philip earns half a cent through hard work: Tom tries to harass him, but he is not willing to take the coin with brutal force: he wants Philip to give it to him. All child actors in this film, male and female, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all children speak their dialogues with classy, ​​plushy accents that are completely different from the accents of actors and actresses playing the same roles as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the staggering of the material. Unfortunately, none of the later scenes is as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> At the peak, there are workers in a rainstorm who are doing much better and being photographed than the previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in the UK) can not take this kind of material seriously anymore. By now, virtually every British comedian has made a comedy routine that parodies precisely this topic, so I had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The character actress Martita Hunt is fine in a small role, but the credo (in this old English script) wrote her first name as 'Marita'. I'll give this boring movie a 3 out of 10 rating: a point for James Mason's performance, the early scene with the kids, and the authentic Victorian phrase in the auctioneer's handwriting.
