You'd think, since this movie has a bad rep, I'd be exaggerating when I say I hated this movie. But I mean, the movie was just so stupid and so inglorious and a waste of time. I feel like I've had a headache over the first 30 years, and the smile on my face (which was usually ready to laugh) eased. When the movie was over I was so happy and because I had the good expectations that it would be fun I was extremely disappointed. Acting is not great, the comedy moments are lame and nonsensical. Actually everything is fine, because I laughed like maybe two parts. Overall, this is so boring and I can not tell you how awful this is. I think that could be used as a suicide method. I mean, I do not think it's even visible to some. My last words are: AVOID ALL THE COST.
