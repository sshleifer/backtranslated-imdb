I would like to sit down and write a smart, thoughtful review, but I think I spend more time writing than the filmmakers. I live in Los Angeles and I am sorry to say that the characters were so much like underemployed and overly egotized actors. There was not a moment in the movie where I could resist the sensation of seeing the informal entertainment of unemployed actors in a hippo-less LA coffee shop. One of the worst "indie" movies I've ever felt so little to hear when he won the Sundance bid has effectively eliminated any interest I've had in participating, let alone one postive Sundance review considered useful. Watch at your own risk.
