I am in the process of thwarting Gibbon's Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire, so I had everything Roman had to do. I'm not far from it, maybe two hundred pages, but it's amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I think I've read perhaps 15 emperors so far, and only Antony, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed, or at least suspected of being killed. I was also fascinated by the crazy excesses of many of these Roman princes. Not the smallest practitioner was Caligula. That makes me check this movie. I think of the film on a historical basis, as far as I understand it from Gibbons' statement from Rome, as well as other research on some good websites and some novels that deal with the times. <br /> <br /> My point is, I do not think this film is considered by many of its advocates for the film. I do not think that the depravity shown with the sex and cruel violence of this film qualifies this as correct. The general ideas of the movie seem to be correct. Caligula grew up on an island, with his family in exile and in contented fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and foreign Emperor Tiberius. He becomes paranoid and anxious and can never shake the cute nickname his guard, Little Boots, gives him. This helps him to feel abused and unconscious. He receives the kingdom after Tiberius' death. The Senate hopes that he will distract himself from the groups of informants who have whipped up the once-paranoid tyrants and distract Rome from the madness into which the dictator brought it. Caligula starts out as a decent emperor, but falls ill, nearly dies, and returns from the brink of feverish death as a real monster. His perversity with his sisters starts here, if not before. He killed Makro and many others who were originally his followers. The deeds of madness seemed less to be the murders of Caligula than his new thinking of himself as a living God. He saw him talking to the statue of Jupiter when he was equally doomed to failure. His violent riots would have doomed him anyway, and three years were a decent run for Tiberius' successors. Well, the film essentially sticks to these lines, while succeeding in being coherent, which is not common in its entirety. He tries to shock the audience in all turns. In every single scene, the film urges you to be deterred from the corruption of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is built on and completely failed. It is just too much to see that successive rulers have murdered, raped and tortured man after man, man after man. The representations of violence may be, but probably not accurate. Murder was certainly the order of the day in imperial Rome. Torture was an elite in advance. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists while the audience watch with nonchalance, I just do not see it that way. The death machine, the cheater, is certainly something you've never seen before in movies, and something you've ever seen will probably never be forgotten, even if you wish me to. The wine that is drunk when the penis is roped off is the same. If you have seen this shame, it will forever be yours. These things hit me in the fantasies of the director and the porn tycoon. They sprang from their ill fantasies and not any proven record. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is pretty good. I think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to see and here in her young years she is impressive and beautiful. The depictions of Nerva and Tiberius are performed very well by their prestigious actors. The movie could have told so much better stories, it's such a failure, that it's just another layer of what a shame this thing was. For example, there might have been an opinion on why and why Caligula went crazy, or showed that he was crazy, paranoid about his illness, and that fever broke the mental reserve he had previously possessed. It could have been the weakness of Claudius and the miracle that he survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things, but it stayed with its sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally, about the sex. It's porno It shows that these sex acts are perpetrated by many people throughout the palaces. Man on man, woman on woman, man on woman. It is dispassionate, disgusting sex. Sex, when it comes to relinquishing it, I seriously doubt that you could do it. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been addicted to sex, and orgies were common enough, but the visions in the film seem more like a Greek than a Roman. I do not believe that this kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies was commonplace in public until the strange, corrupt government of Elgabalus was crushed and killed. This movie should probably never happen. Be curious, if you're curious, let it go. It is something, as I said before, if you observe this, unfortunately, you keep the ill visions in mind for many years. I do not think that it is an exact historical picture, even if it is historical as a whole.
