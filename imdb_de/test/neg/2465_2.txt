For spoiler too predictable, but I will not be trapped below. So do not read it if you are interested. <br /> <br /> a couple of boring scriptwriters together for half an afternoon, and even then they run out of ideas. Let's start with a criminal wanted by all France. No matter what he did, we'll think about it later (they do not). a few seconds of tension, but not too much and nothing unexpected, because that requires art. half an hour to finish the film; I understand it: let them rob a jeweler and take a lot of time to avoid alerts etc.; Everyone robs jewelers in movies, just as it is, it has to work (it does not work). No humor, no character (ok, yves montand can be a bit tiny) and everyone should speak in a quiet, dead voice that makes you think of noir, just that the actors look depressed. If they are dumb, they will look worse - but also if we write their lines. We should add something to stay at home when women look at this stuff, so let's get them to empathize with their husband (we forgot to put women in the movie). Have a son (wheeze) marijuana - oh, and have you tried suicide for no good reason (shame his father is a mafia boss because he screamed loudly but the audience will feel his paternal care, and if not, fuck it). Oh, the crooked cop was a classmate of the man who caught him in the end; bad, eh? Let them all die in the end, or we will never end the stuff. is it in the can? Right, that's over with godsay. Who do we get as a director?
