I'm tired of "open thinking". I'm generally pretty open-minded, but this kind of line is essentially made up of people who like things that should not be "enjoyed". You know, there's a reason why so many people are disgusted by it. And only because someone out there does not do less. There is, after all, a reason for the feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open-mindedness" or "repulsion" should eradicate that feeling. Otherwise we are no better than senseless creatures. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Another argument is that this film inserts women into the roles normally reserved for men, which is why men do not like it. But just because it turns out to be outrageous for more men than it would otherwise, it does not make it great. Maybe men should not be dominated by what dominates the film industry, but is the answer the same for women? Maybe if you do not like watching movies, watching TV and talking to so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, do not look at them. <br /> <br /> And if you are a director, do not do it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise somebody will be asked for an open mind, if what happened in this "movie" happens in real life it may be so much.
