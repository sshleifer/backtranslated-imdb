Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen customizations Doug McClure played in the 1970s, this is the most impressive of them all. It is so incredible that you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heat of the lamps above it. The thing looks like a very, very large budget school game or, indeed, a very low budget action movie that it actually is. On many occasions it was said that this was the last entry in the genre, and I hope that was the case. The genre did not die peacefully, but in terrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, bad blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt like a boy again, a nutty professor whose shirt stays as white as snow after the men drag themselves through the slimy holes of the underworld. What a sport it was to accept a part of this mish-mash and to wear it so bravely. <br /> <br /> Fully filmed on a sound stage and accompanied by the then unbearable, today unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always such monsters in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or believable. In the heightened Action Battle scenes, where Mr. McClure heroically attacks the creatures, one can almost hear the empty, hollow tone as his head beats a Triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames every minute, stumbling and falling over. In fact, there is a lot of unmotivated explosion when the movie (and the genre) moves towards the finale. And the lovely Miss Munroe loses her subterranean accent. <br /> <br /> The triple-invoice currently available on the market includes this movie and two more - The Land That Forgot This Time - and The Warlords of Atlantis. The first two are pretty strong submissions, especially the first, with a lot of money and sometimes even fascinating scripts. Do not expect any of these qualities from this movie. Have fun with friends and shamelessly laugh about what you see. After all, the makers had no shame.
