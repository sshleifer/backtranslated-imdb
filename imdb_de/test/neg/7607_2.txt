This is a student movie and it is a piece of crap. I would use a much stronger language to describe it, but then the review would not be published and the world needs to know about any legitimate doubt - this movie REALLY SUCKS. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a difference ruler used when measuring the early work of an already famous director. As if it were somehow awesome that we were just too stupid to understand it since he finally got it today. I do not buy it. The early movie "Bad Taste" by LOTR Peter Jackson is shitty and this "early work" by another famous director is also in the same way. These "early works" are representative of everything from budget to scripts to actors, etc .. everything is the bottom of the bucket. Do not be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to pretend to be a handful of seventies 70s male hippie burnouts pretending to dominate a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen, this is your movie <br / > <br /> I can not believe this thing won a Golden Scroll Award for the best special effects. This is a joke, right? Or a joke price? <br /> <br /> If you want to see what this movie WISHES wants, it was one or three squads of Red Dwarf that smeghead you.
