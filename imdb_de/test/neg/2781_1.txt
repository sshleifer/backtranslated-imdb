Another stupid "movie". The picture quality is correct. Sound too. Music is in the middle. The guy is trying to make music like on Halloween. <br /> <br /> For a rare time, producer / director does not choose anorexic girls. It is therefore that this "movie" takes a week and costs $ 10,000. Does that mean if the producer has money, do they choose all anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But you are not a good actress. Neither guys yet. But maybe it's just because the "story" of this "movie" has no value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we'll give $ 10,000 to a teenager who likes a movie, and they can make a better movie /> <br /> Do not waste time seeing this "thing".
