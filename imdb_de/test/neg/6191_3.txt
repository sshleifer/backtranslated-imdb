Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal thought leader to be sought in countries across Europe. In order to free himself, he digs himself into the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go. A high-ranking officer is sent from Paris to finally capture Le Moko. For le Moko, the kasbah becomes a police custody, but at the same time it becomes a kind of prison - a place he can not leave, for the moment he does so, he knows he will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance was good and I can understand why he was nominated for an Academy Award. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and at the same time very noble. Unfortunately, the movie itself was pretty disappointing. Some parts of the story seemed inconsistent, two of which I would like to mention. The first thought was that the police would not enter the kasbah. This was quite clearly stated at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references indicate that the police actually entered the kasbah fairly regularly. Neither Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police should not enter nor Inspector Slimane's statement (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could get into the casbah, but not out, seemed to make a lot of sense. It was also hard for me to believe that le Moko - a hard-core criminal mastermind he was - could be so easily kicked off by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) that he entertains the population with love songs and leaves the Casbah essentially, find yourself giving up. Of course, I understand the irony of the last few scenes when Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) just to find real freedom in his capture (because he was shot by the police). I think someone like le Moko in one such case would be advised. <br /> <br /> It's worth it for Boyer and, to a lesser extent, for Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3.10
