Rented (free loan), as it was allegedly filmed in CT, where I live ... could have been filmed in a tunnel! Dark ninety percent of the time and just a dreadful attempt at a low-budget streak that may prove right. In short, a group of young adults witnessing meteorites and then falling victim to aliens on a lighthouse island, supported by guardians and wives. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - Drama = terrible <br /> <br /> - Writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - Story = made a million times with different settings <br /> <br /> - Production values ​​= okay (lighting) for the budget <br /> <br /> - Effects (Creature, Digital, Miscellaneous) HORRIBLE, VERY CHEAP LOOKING <br /> <br /> So you get the point. To make the injury even more insulting, the credits bloopers of shooting - really now ... who cares? Distributed under a universal company, they were shocked after they looked at it. <br /> <br /> Try "CREEP" as an alternative. Low budget, but well written, well presented and pretty good, scary!
