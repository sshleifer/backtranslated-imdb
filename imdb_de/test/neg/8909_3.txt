The movie comes quickly with more and more destruction into a big chase scene. The first really bad thing is that the guy who abducted Steven Seagal had been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that would probably have ended the movie's entire premise changes in the movie's plot. So just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent presentation. Apply any sense of logic that you may have, reducing your chances of getting a headache. <br /> <br /> I hope that Steven Seagal will try to return to the type of characters he portrays in his portrait of more popular films.
