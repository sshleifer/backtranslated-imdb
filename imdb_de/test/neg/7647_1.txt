Honestly, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Shone like a TV movie. And a bad one too. I can not believe that people are still hiring Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they still allow John Sayles to make films. My husband and I saw this movie on television one evening and it got so boring that we clean the house while it's running. , , and we still succeeded! I got the impression that critics were so gullible with Sayles's earlier films, like Lone Star, who was thrilled at the time, but did not really bring much in the end. Spend your time with something better. Something.
