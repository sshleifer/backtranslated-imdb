The only thing that surpasses the amount of non-stop action in "Sudden Death" is the incredible number of potholes. What about it and the sheer amount of tools, you could hardly call what was left as an action. To say the script borrowed from the premise "The Hard" would be the most obvious understatement in the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a troubled hero working as a fire marshall in the huge Pittsburgh indoor ice rink. On the night of the seventh game of the final series, he receives tickets so that he can give his estranged children the deciding game and, of course, spend a little time with them. Also for political reasons, the Vice President of the United States (Raymond J. Barry) is the turn. As a bunch of incredibly well-organized mercenaries conquer the vice-president's box and claim hundreds of millions of government money, our hero, Darren McCord, has more than just refined his plans. Each time a new These formula flicks are made. It seems that everything we put into the way of innovation is evil villains and the more and more spectacular and gruesome ways that the good guys have about them. Director Hyams and his scriptwriter have exaggerated hating the evil terrorists. The terrible villains bombard intelligence, security forces and civilians (both old and young) with gay devotion and with little respect for the relative threat to each victim. Van Damme is heavily involved with fist-shackles and guns, exploits and death-defying stunts. The script asks little about the muscular Europeans. Almost everyone else has seriously exaggerated his signed, superficial role as the cruelest, craziest old ringleader ever, except Powers Boothe Walk-Ons. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of clever cinematography and enough explosive special f / x to keep everyone awake. But really, that's all this action movie has, action. Although there are a few nice sequences, nothing can be described as outrageously brilliant.
