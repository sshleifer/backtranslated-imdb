What a lousy movie, I needed 3 times to finish it. What I did not like most was the childish humor. Jokes of a 10-year-old child. not funny. Rather annoying, when, for example, the detective does not get a seat in the bar, he shouts "She takes everything off" and then they all run "Fast Foreward" Slapstick. so stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar and smashing fruit to find out his post-traumatic stress disorder. at the bar and the bartender delivers him more and more fresh fruit. that should be funny? and I mean ... I love good old exploitative flicks and have seen a lot of horrible movies, but its just bad. and also the "gore" is not that exciting. Do not bother me. I would not recommend it.
