This movie was bad and the films about how some college students live in a house to get paid for by renovating, and then they learn that there is a woman in the house Deamon and that there is a portal to hell. In this movie, there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the beginning of the movie as they brush the house, and they begin to dance to a cheesy song, and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some types in bad costumes trying to scare Creating Sounds There are some good gore scenes when the professor gets his face torn. I only hired this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and it's only worth seeing if you're a fan of horror movies. Really bad, the only good actor is Roy Scheider from the great movie Jaws. This movie has a lot of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10.
