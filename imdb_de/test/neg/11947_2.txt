How bad was it to recreate an almost Oscar-worthy movie? Most Martha is much better, has depth, finesse and so on and above all: a wonderful and talented actress in the lead role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the pretty Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remakes and the films are full of schemas. Is not there anyone who can create a good and new script? Or is this a security solution to make remake or movies from the well-known cartoon characters? The movies are becoming less interesting these days. Oh yes: If you want to see a really good movie, look at the original movie. It's definitely worth it.
