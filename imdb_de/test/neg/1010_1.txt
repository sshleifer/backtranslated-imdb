This is a little less painful than the first two films, but otherwise it's the usual: a shabby, dirty and unbalanced piece of diseased cinema. Charles Bronson is back and jumps in action when his friend is killed by supporters terrorizing the neighborhood. You see crime has increased 11% in the South Belmont area ... so what to do? A stronger police presence? Tougher prisons? Tougher sentences? No, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like Bronson to avoid bloodthirsty revenge. or, as the authors wanted, justice: this time he is the personal killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter. The writers bow backwards to make Kersey a hero and send the useless policemen into the area just to confiscate a gun from an elderly resident who keeps them for protection, and deliver a scene in which Kersey's camera stole and shoots the thief directly in the back to applaud in front of the observing crowd. Death penalty for theft? Well. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest transformation of characters into ciphers that exist only to cheer or support Kersey is frightening. <br /> <br /> Sure, these villains are scum, but should not the movie leave the audience to decide instead of focusing on Kersey and his thoughtless answer? Oddly enough, the besieged residents fear no gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any of the acts of violence, which is strange as a character is being killed just because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, they take all the guns out of their sock drawers and cheerfully go along with the massacre, they never stop thinking things through or fight with the thought of killing another person cruel flat performances do not help ?? Bronson literally has a facial expression and can not even bend the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here? a machine gun? A rocket launcher ?! ?? and new misogyny lows: the film desecrates every female figure in sight, be it through rape, explosion or larynx; and it makes them in a most stupid way, like a victim venturing into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighborhood to ask a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is dirt, pure and simple, meaningless garbage that is put together without style and meaning.
