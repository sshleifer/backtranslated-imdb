"Fool for Love" is one of the many forgotten films that Robert Altman filmed in the 1980s. This is a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard game featuring Shepard in the lead role. It just is not very good. Altman has not made many good films during his fascinating career, and often the mistake was due to him. But here, in my opinion, the mistake lies with Shepard, because he wrote such a weak piece. The direction of Altman is secured, the performances are o.k. Given what the actors have to work with, but this inconsistent script goes nowhere and takes time to get there. Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a relationship with May (Kim Basinger). , The two fight endlessly during an evening spent in a dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton), who is either a figurative or a literal father to Eddie and May, quietly observes. Randy Quaid completes the four-man cast as Gentleman Caller. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic catch throughout the plot is that Eddie and May's relationship is incestuous. This hook, however, feels more like a gimmick than anything else. The script does not explore their relationship in detail and does not use their relationship to explore more universal topics. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, kind characters that irritate within the first five minutes. Stanton and Quaid have little to do, but offer reaction shots. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie is especially bad when Eddie and May's stories start to look back on monotonous, somnolent synchronization. Chalk this up to another experiment failed by Altman. <br /> <br /> degrees: C-
