During our studies, our philosophy professor Mr.R played "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese idiot was still fairly unknown; A charlatan in the making, a swift surname still busy improving his abilities, easily impressing, manipulating the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, and the sexual frustrations, the illiterate, the half - educated, the unsuspecting, and the ridiculous gullible people. When we finished watching, I thought, "Yes, it was entertaining - in a totally stupid bugs bunny way - but what an ultra-biased, anti-capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity is the only goal is to make cheap shots of people and ideas for which the creator has a pet a documentary with every fantasy. "However, our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with R & M, and in the end we not only have NOT criticized any aspects but Mr. R actually spent the rest of the class praising his "qualities." Just to understand us, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "leftist extremist" or "selective factual presentation" never left his constantly smiling mouth ... And just to remind you: this should be Be a philosophy Class, NOT INDOCTRINE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL BS course. Well, here's the really interesting aspect: This professor, Mr. R, is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left scripts with A-Stars. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story: These are the people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood. <br /> <Michael Moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he could prove beyond doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but as a Marxist liberal, opening doors for everyone. Tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-Chavez extremists, so brainwashing through simplified depictions of reality has been part of the Hollywood experience for decades. <br /> <br /> Embrace this demagogue and you have betrayed your own brain forever.
