Really, REALLY ... What the audience (American!) Enjoys in this so-called show, I am absolutely not. What can we learn from this series: <br /> <br /> 1. Every casino there spends about 2-3 billion dollars each year to rent a satellite and a huge amount of high-resolution hi-tech cameras for its security team , The FBI bites the dust from them. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security professional must have a lush chest, of course. The tits must be constantly shown, otherwise they lose their job. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee happens to be a man, have him breast implanted, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can the ideas of other shows Crass demolish, then implement them as their own and call all this crap as "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. Any security with boobs larger than 39D is considered immortal and can not die. <br /> <br /> I really would like to have the opportunity to vote negative. -10/10 for this one!
