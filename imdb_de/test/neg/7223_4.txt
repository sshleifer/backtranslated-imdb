Richard Donner shows his liberal testimony with this ridiculously exaggerated simple attack on South Africa's politics. It's not like America is the cradle of race harmony and fraternal love - and the irony of the film is added. The city was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the police department, which with its brutal racist attitudes is so closely related to relations Community contributed. Donner's salt-pepper mating, which has a definite crush on a late teens, does its own thing by ignoring the rule of law or the rules of evidence, and no one worries because the bad guys are white South Africans - certainly a concern exciting example of police racism in itself? In Rudd's office (Joss Ackland - extremely hissable), the décor is designed and lit up so that it resembles the driver's bunker as much as possible. In the event that some stupid moviegoers miss the point, he and his men are regularly referred to as "Nazis." For me, the only bright spot in the film was when Mel Gibson showed up for an anti-apartheid demonstration with a banner reading "End Aparthied Now." The extremely irritating Joe Pesci is admitted to the franchise to take the boy off the shoulder by making him jump like a poorly trained puppy. This would be tolerable if there was the slightest possibility that he was in a concrete coat, but unfortunately he survives to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems to be in a world of her own, and may not believe in her luck in facing Mel Gibson, who has little trouble begging her into a mobile home that seems to have been washed up on a beach somewhere. Shortly after completing the affair, they are under attack from several helicopters firing enough shots in Mel's caravan to keep the US Army in Iraq running for six months. Fortunately, he has a dog who is not afraid of causing coitus interruptus as he moves in seconds, and his barking warns them of the impending attack. I hope he gets a special bone as a reward. The film reaches its climax (without interruption by Mels dog) on ​​a cargo ship that drove to Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa) when Mel and Danny murder so many members of the master race that I lost them. Nevertheless, it wobbled like Bonnie and Clyde Like a small hail survived Mel, who is like a small child with a smart and benevolent father in the arms of his partner. Take that apartheid!
