And I can be generous. The overwhelming majority of the film is made of polished material ... the confusing monster, two women moving, the confusing monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, the confusing monster again, despite the injuries, wearing even worse. . you get the picture. I have repeatedly stopped screaming "GET ON WITH IT ALREADY". <br /> <br /> And it does not help that the material used was poorly produced. The sound does not match the picture. And in the one scene where they tried to become "artistic" with the lighting and camera techniques, the guy with the flashlight, which provides the only illumination of the scene, is clearly visible in the shot. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the production fell victim to a terrible disaster that destroyed the original audio track and most of the material, but they decided to publish it anyway, screwed together from the editing room, in memory of The heroic crewmembers gave their lives the attempt to save the * real * movie - the plot and the interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to prove it, and I find that in the immortal words of Joel and the bots, they simply did not care. <br /> <br />
