Acting 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" comes from that unlucky postmodern theater school that has declared that anything that resembles a story or action is forbidden. While people get away on stage, the film becomes deadly - or at least mortally boring. We have a lot of great actors who spit out dialogues that are brilliant but do not make a difference. Worse, every character speaks in the same voice despite his background. The only attempt to differentiate is that Anna Paquin uses the word "is not". <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the characters are extremely unsympathetic losers. for residents of LA, attention to geography is ridiculous. (Note: The view from the window of Sean Penn is about eight miles away, and you can not drive south through Hollywood and open up in Glendale if you pretend that's Burbank's - and usually I would do such little things not paying attention because they are vague about production, but the fact that they are so pervasive despite the pyrotechnics on the canvas says a lot about the weakest element of this business - the script - Raven has the wrong quote from the Scottish one Hurlyburly should have been better called "A story told by an idiot full of sound and rage that means nothing." A bit long for the marquee, perhaps - but at least it would be honest publicity.
