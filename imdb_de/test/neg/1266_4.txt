I was very willing to question Rendition when it came to all the negative press I had read about it. I even thought about three-quarters of the way that it is confused and a bit incoherent, but otherwise a solid story that comes to its conclusion. And then the ground fell out. Not necessarily wanting to ruin the movie for everyone, but the inference revolves around what you saw as a fact, what and when things happen on the head - for some reason, except perhaps to say the world, yes, I'm cool, and I know it. I love a good shoot, I love a good ah-ha moment, but only if it is relevant to the present story. The complete misdirection of the filmmakers has no meaning in the overall story, the schedules did not have to be parallel and they did not have to split by a week. The revelation destroyed every merit I wanted to give to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, which may be a good thing, because in retrospect it was not as solid a film as I would have given it blindfold at first <br /> <br / > It is an admirable thing to try to bring the concept of rendition into the consciousness of the cinematic audience, but it needed a story that went deeper into the connotations and politics involved than gloss over these themes for a story of one Woman in distress about the disappearance of her husband and the terrified rebellion of a daughter against her "interrogator" father. I understand that the movie's bottom line is that it needs a human quality to reach, and that's why I do not want to blame it for taking this path. My only criticism is that we do not get enough of what the title says we should get. Instead, we are shown many lines of action, all confused, before they are sent back to the lower levels of our consciousness, never to return there. It's so busy that you forget what you should care about, the woman? the interrogator? the CIA agent? The victim? the senator the Middle Eastern daughter and her friend the zealot? In the end, I really gave up and let the film get me where it belongs, which was ultimately someone else than originally planned. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens happens as a result of a bomb blast. This bomb is at the heart of every story thread and is ultimately so harmless that you can not believe the size of the waves it spread. The old butterfly winged stroke quote is fully effective because a boy's revenge ultimately destroys many people's lives. Whether through death, destruction, physical and mental abuse or suicide in the career; nobody really escapes unharmed. At the end of the day, however, only the story of the man exiled to Egypt for torture is really interesting. We are convinced that he is clearly innocent from the beginning, but he is exposed to water on board, electric shock, etc., in order to extract all the information he may have. When the powerful belong to a man without compassion or cause to stop, until something is spilled (true or not), and an observer with no courage to attend or quit, the situation gives rise to an intrigue as to how this might be possible The End. The three actors involved are all the best parts of the film and once again prove that the film should have dealt with them in their entirety. <br /> <br /> I do not want to belittle people like Reese Witherspoon (). the wife of the victim) or her ex-employee Senate, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they are doing really well what is given to them. Even Meryl Streep with her crazy accent and Alan Arkin do not distract too much. However, it is the trio of Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agents, Yigal Naor's interrogator, and Omar Metwally's victim that really shines. Naor is brilliant like the Egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours, but compassionate and worried as a father trying to find his daughter. This man is brutal, but he is so because it is his profession and why he needs to find answers. Metwal never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted on him. Whether he lies or does not really know about the terrorist who called his cell phone, we are totally in his situation and desperately waiting for the situation to develop. As for Gyllenhaal, who seems to have recycled a performance with varying degrees of success throughout his career, he finds a role that suits him. The demons that enter his soul throughout the suffering are forced to participate in his body and mind, leading to ambivalence as well as intervention needs. The two emotions wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish demeanor fits in perfectly with this fight. <br /> <br /> It's just too bad that the one plotline that works never focuses on being a lead actress, even though he's the eponym of the movie. With all the clutter around the edges, we as a spectator are played around too much, swaying in the sense of time and sequence and then slapping in the face while the whole thing makes us laugh more than a "bet" did not see it coming. "I felt cheated and that's unfortunately the lasting effect I've taken from the movie, if it had been easier, I might have enjoyed it more, but you can still take some positive things out of the grossly flawed whole.
