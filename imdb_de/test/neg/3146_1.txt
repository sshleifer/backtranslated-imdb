When I was younger (oh 2), I saw Barney for the first time and liked it. BUT, I did not have a brain back then. And now I look back and see what a horrible show "Barney" really is: First, EVERYTHING in this show is scary. Barney, the main character, is a terrific, nine-meter-tall, talking, purple dinosaur, the 13-year-old teaches a smaller, "fancy ..." (* shudders *) BJ (I know what you think about his name) but scary yellow dinosaur that is "presumably" used cool. In fact, it is exactly the opposite. After watching a few episodes with B.J. I wanted to scream, who had stumbled into it with his cap pushed back slightly and made a few not so funny jokes. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomiting *) oh-oh-oh-anyway baby bop is the worst idea of ​​a character EVERYONE ever had. She is a green triceratops (it is a dinosaur) wearing a yellow blanket. Her utterances of "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise of "Super-Deeee-Doooper" make it difficult to sit through each episode as the Seventh students learn about forms and manners. <br /> <br /> And that, my friend, makes this show really awful.
