The man (Gaston Modot) and the young girl (Lya Lys) go through the movie, consumed with passion for each other. They long to be together, but their shared moments are constantly interrupted. The film is scattered with pictures and comes to an end after an hour ......... find the lovers lucky ...? ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts off interestingly with scorpion footage, but you soon realize that this is all presumptuous piece of nonsense. It's a silent movie with occasional dialogues and it has a non-stop soundtrack that is so irritating at one point that you want to turn down the sound and watch it as a silent movie. The endless drum rolls must have made the movie audience crazy. There are some really funny moments, for example when the man kicks a dog and when he overturns a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is done in the name of art, so it's just a pseudo nonsense. The movie is crap.
