Although I was a fan of shock and blood, this movie was at least disappointing. The effects and puppetry were impressive, yes, and the humor was well tuned, but ... something was missing. The first act of the film is to identify nuances of Jack Brooks's character, although everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards. As for the narrative and many of the flashbacks: unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The tempo during the second act was tedious. Most of it focuses on Freddy Krueger eating, then vomiting, then eat something, then beat his arms and say something snappy or rude. Meanwhile, the beat is interrupted with short scenes in which Jack discusses his anger problems with a therapist. (Definitely the entertaining scenes in the movie - excellent dialogue that laughs a lot.) Then Jack decides, without warning, to kill some monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> All in all, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has a lot of potential as a throwback to the horror movies of the 1980s, but is futile and babbles without conflict or adequate resolution. Hopefully these issues are addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack to the Hell or Jack Vs. Ash goes into production.
