Not sure if it's just a lousy movie or if it's a mockery of a "B" Western. The story was so-so, but filming, editing and acting were just bad. Plus, the music in the background was irritating to the end, too loud and uninterrupted. Often one could not recognize the dialogue over the background music. I'm in the SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and I'm making some recordings with Old West, and many of the actors are members of this group, so I bought it. If you are not interested in this group of people or in this sport, you would most likely not even have that little interest to help with the film. The acting of veterans (especially Stella Stevens) left a lot to be desired.
