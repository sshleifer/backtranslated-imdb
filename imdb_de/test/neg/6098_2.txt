How pointless, vile characters and boring movie. Rescued by short sex scenes, crazy witch, beautiful desert island and Brooks body. The plot is weak, the characters are flat and unlikely. After I said that I managed to see everything, especially because the shaking and the hope that her character would end up good has totally fixed me. The film was well-filmed, well-directed, but the casting has somewhat disappointed him. Disappointing. Really summarized the review in the first line, but this site requires you to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time with another film.
