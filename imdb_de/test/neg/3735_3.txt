Minnesota is not really a road movie, but that's still the best categorization I can generate. A road movie does not depend primarily on a great plot, and since the plot of this movie is really pathetic, it fulfills that description. Interestingly enough, such a film must rely solely on moving and intriguing characters and the chemistry between them. Unfortunately, the staff of Feeling Minnesota fails completely in this excitement. <br /> <br /> The initialization of the characters is unsatisfactory and confusing. For example, I can not figure out if Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in the house of his mother and brother or not. His mother (Tuesday Weld) is told that he has to live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that this ever happens. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never meet them. They seem to be irrational, and there is no real explanation why they do that. <br /> <br /> In the end, I leave the movie with no feelings for the characters, except the stupidity and maybe a little bit of attraction of sweet Cameron Diaz.
