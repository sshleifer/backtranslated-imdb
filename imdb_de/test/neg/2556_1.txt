Like the previous commentator on this movie, I was sometimes in tears during this movie. Sometimes one wonders how a movie of such impressive awkwardness emerges. From the moment our protagonist awakens in his apartment in New York from a dream of subway trains cut together with galloping horses (which the Irish emigrant did not have), it's clear we're in trouble. And it does not get much better. <br /> <br /> Back in 1950s Ireland, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation, talking exclusively about the theme of the Irish Civil War. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the Civil War. The drinkers in the pub split up after their civil war relations. Memories are made for those who died in the Civil War. The city is divided into those who think we should remember and those who want to forget the civil war. Every look and every conversation that goes back to the Civil War is significant. <br /> <br /> Broken Harvest's video on the video camera suggests that the movie is a parable of the problems in modern Ireland. The only parallel I notice is that today's Dublin conversation is actually dominated by one issue: real estate prices. If she intends to give a glimpse of Ireland's obsession with its past, it fails miserably. It is remarkable how few Irish films have dealt with the Irish Civil War and its legacies. However, it will take a movie with much more subtlety and intelligence than this movie to tell us about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche. For the American viewers who suggested this The film is reminiscent of the atmosphere of the fifties in Ireland: not. In the 1950s, Ireland was a terrible, poverty-stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves. However, there was more than one topic of conversation.
