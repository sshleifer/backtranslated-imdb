Two days ago I had the chance to see this movie on Cable (TV-Asia). I have been very worried ever since. The film "Baghban" has very successfully portrayed only one side of real life. It is very biased towards the parents. Have you ever thought of another side (children)? There are few parents in the world who only give birth to their children but do not give proper parental care. I am a victim of it. Why do you (parents) want to have 5 children in your life if you only earn 2000 rupees per month? I had to work with my siblings on the street. I have no idea how I got to the IIT from there. It has been a long time since then, but I still do not believe it. Now I am a scientist in the USA. I have provided everything necessary for my parents and looked after my two brothers who stay with them. They could not deliver basic things when we were kids. I find this film very vindictive. It is very incomplete. It hurt my feelings a lot. I urge the producer / director of this film to look at Indian society in other ways as well and make another film.
