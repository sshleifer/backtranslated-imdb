After reading this story some time ago, I was very excited to see the movie. I have read the book again. It's one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. What I think, what makes up the story, are the relationships. That was the downside for me in the movie, because I think the relationship in the film was badly expressed. I have no idea what the change of main characters (Tim's and Alan's characters) is for. The film did not capture John and Savannah's relationship at all. Maybe if you did not read the book, you might like this movie, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I found Channing to be a great choice for John, but I felt he would bring all the young adults to look at it. I think it was more focused on her. The end cuts out the whole point of the book, so I was also dissatisfied. I was hoping that the movie was more like a notebook or a walk to remember and how they recorded the books. I feel like I wasted a Friday night and $ 10 for a juicy love story, not the whole story I expected.
