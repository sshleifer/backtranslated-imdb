This movie spent three hours last night on the History International Channel, including commercials. But it felt like three weeks. It was not the cheap, unusual and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of Dresden. It was not that the film has robbed almost the entire context of World War II. It was not even that the bombing raids often seemed like a major inconvenience to a stupid love story. No, it was the woodless features that drove life out of the story. Oh, and the fact that if it's possible a movie is negligent, Dresden is this movie. A better title might have been DRESDEN - AS URIAH HEEP HAD KNOWN. <br /> <br /> It is especially the latter point that irritates so much. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The creators of this movie believe in it. But in the typical, demaskulated way in which the Germans approach World War II, they can not comment without saying "peace" and "no more wars - anywhere" like Mother Teresa. And also typical of the German complacency towards the British is the effort to crawl before "Britishness", while all the "blame" of Dresden on one person, Arthur Harris, is charged. <br /> <br /> Did I tell a person? Not quite. At the beginning of the film there is an exclamation from the main character Anna, with whom we should all sympathize. "Damn Americans!" She yells as they watch the bombs fall. And a few minutes later, a radio voice sounds warning of the "American Terror Bombing" inflicted on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Note the word "terror". Roger that? It is really the Americans behind the inhumane attack on German civilians. Notwithstanding that American strategy for nearly the entire war in Europe was the precision bombardment of industrial and war manufacturing locations. It did not matter that it was the British who decided enthusiastically to "bombard" land planes on civilian targets in Germany - before the Germans themselves attacked English targets. Irrespective of the fact that the Americans bombed during the day and suffered more losses than the British to hit precision targets, while the British bombarded civilians under the guise of night. Notwithstanding that the Americans were essentially taken to the RAF's real terror bombing campaign, which kicked and shouted at them. It did not matter that most American officials, from FDR to General Dolittle, opposed civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait. No, in DRESDEN, both the Germans and the English. except "Bomber" Harris, are innocent of a doctrine, it is hinted, created by the evil Americans. And only the power and power of a love story between a German nurse and a downed British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of cruelty. Right. By the way, for the younger and probably less well-read readers of IMDb, the first and only literary attempt to give thought to Dresden's bombing raid was the pacifist novel Written by Kurt Vonnegut - an American prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the bomb attack. I think the German ZDF could not find a pretty nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
