I was totally disgusted with this unnecessary successor to "The Poseidon Adventure," a film about which I made a great comment. <br /> <br /> This movie is unbelievable of the word GO! I agree, why were no other boats and helicopters rescued? The one who had rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat carrying Michael Caine & Sally Field. THAT WAS THE ONLY RESCUE CREW? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap. I hated the talent obsession of some good actors. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie unless you need to see Sally & Michael as a lover. <br /> <br /> gord
