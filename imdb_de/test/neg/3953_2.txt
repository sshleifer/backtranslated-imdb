It was a videotape in The Ring; a website was the problem at Feardotcom; The danger at Pulse came from computers; and phone and a missed call were presented - you guessed it - deadly phones. At Stay Alive, the technology that causes all sorts of problems is an online game: those who play it are dead soon after. How smart! <br /> <br /> Director: William Brent Bell (who?), With an inconspicuous cast of twenty stages that you may have seen before, but probably can not remember where or how they call their names is a very distracted piece of film that is aimed directly at the horror set of PG-13. For experienced scary-movie observers, Stay Alive is undoubtedly extremely tedious, highly predictable, and in no way scary. <br /> <br /> The poorly developed plot follows a group of players with extremely stupid names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch, and Swink !?)), who try to uncover the secret behind the deadly game, even before they To become victims. Eventually, they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory who kills anyone who dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue the game to the end. <br /> <br /> With such a stupid story, viewers should expect a movie with loose ends in abundance, not a logic (who made the game, how and why it never gets explained) Fear or blood and a silly final scene to leave the door open? God forbid a continuation.
