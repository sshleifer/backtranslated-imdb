This movie was so bad that I thought I was screaming in the middle of it. It was all I could do to get through it. The beginning of the film they are at war in was promising. Only it smelled like "Saving Private Ryan" for me ... or at least after a try. Only we do not care about these people. The characters were not built. The child who dies should probably be made to cry ... but for some reason, it has irritated everyone. Then we have to hear line by line sappy dialogue, which has desperately tried to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which of course was also cited in the movie. Imagine that. There was nothing original about the film, it was like sitting in the most trivial parts of any war movie ever made, and with a little humor you were hoped that it would be better. Unfortunately not. 3 hours later I leave the theater cheated. Anthony Menghilla was supposed to be shot because he was trying to copy the English patient, which was a good movie for the time being, but now I'm wondering ... should I borrow him and make sure I was not caught in the HYPE right now ??? Maybe I was, but I was definitely not busy with the hype of this movie. I really went to the theater to like this movie. I am a diehard Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money, borrow it on DVD and laugh like me.
