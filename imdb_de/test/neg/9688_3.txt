I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after the movie! I was expecting a biblical story that was visualized with great special effects, etc., but during the film I realized that this was an absolute disaster ... it was not at all biblical history ... if you were a visual "translation" of the bible version from Noah, then DO NOT go this movie!
