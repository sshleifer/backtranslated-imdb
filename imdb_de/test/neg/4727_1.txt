Oh, how I laughed in these first scenes. That silly little movie about an 11-year-old who wears a gun, steals cars, robs shops, breaks down houses, blackmails other children, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drugs, distributes drugs to his mother and friends, and then kills a guy What a great comedy! It should not be a comedy. It was meant as a social drama. How can that be? The events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes of a four-year comic strip that's not mature yet. The dialogue is ridiculous; People talk like idiots. It is a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are really funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional cheerfulness of the idiotic premise disappears after a short time, and after that the laughter comes only rarely; At this point, the onlooker can not believe what he sees and is alternately surprised and bored with what follows (if he has at least half a brain cell). <br /> <br /> A short film, but feels like eternity. The film is actually a serious attempt to portray the world of a young degenerate while imitating movies far superior to it, such as "Fun." There is something of phonicity about everything; The children, the adults and everyone lack credibility, both in terms of action and conversation. The boy in the main unit crawls through the film as if he has seen all the Jimmy Cagney films at least a hundred times. And as a rule, the child is not portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but as a misunderstood little artistic talent. Of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society has made him bad. Poor child. <br /> <br /> The movie is embarrassing; a collection of outdated, occasionally hilarious clich√©s that have been put together to make a movie without intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.
