When I saw this DVD for the first time for three dollars in a bargain basket, I really could not believe my luck: a Christmas movie with Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I got it right away and thought it a worthwhile investment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was just as bad as any movie you would expect to combine Christmas and the three aforementioned "celebrities". The dialogue was crazy, the characters were one-dimensional and Carol's character sheet was absolutely incredible. The film itself was a lifeless piece of boring piece that did not end and made me feel human as the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not see this movie if you do not have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday eggs.
