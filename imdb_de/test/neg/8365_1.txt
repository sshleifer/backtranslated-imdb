If you come to this movie to learn about depression, forget it: you will not learn anything except how you do not write a script on the subject. I understand the intention to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie ... no trifle. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the entire movie screaming at the peak of her lungs, insulting someone maliciously, bursting into tears or a combination of the three (the only exceptions being a soft pout at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest clue as to how she could be, WITHOUT depression ... not the faintest glimmer of other aspects of her personality ... she just screams. At one point, her roommate tells her, "Lizzie, you're such a funny person when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "She is?" It seemed strange that the authors would add this comment without giving us examples, but this script is a lesson for incompetence. It has no recognizable structure or flow at all; Instead, it's a series of awkwardly juxtaposed scenes in which Lizzie screams and then ends. Character development? No ... scenes from her everyday life, d. H. Going to class, which may be important details? No ... screaming at maximum volume? CHECK. It is not quite enough, I'm afraid. 1.10
