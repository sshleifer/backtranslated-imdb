A friend of mine decided to rent this thing, luckily it was not my money. A story that could be interesting is wasted by unbelievably bad acting and terrible editing / directing. Maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird hyperfunction :) (eg Gary Busey's character). All the overreacted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a bit more interesting, because it caught your attention (for all obviously wrong reasons) where the movie itself failed miserably. In short: waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> 2/10
