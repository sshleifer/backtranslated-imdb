The big (and we mean plus big) villain Sebastian Cabot is trying to get farmers out of the earth with salt to get the oil rights. If Sterling Haden's pop is killed, how will Haden TERROR IN A Texas TOWN put an end to it, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First of all, this is not a B Western. There are no singing cowboys, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie - you know, those who use unimportant actors to pronounce "important things" and cover the general low-budget waste of the action with "Interesting Camera Angles". Secondly, to avoid compromises (the expected ones) that would eliminate Trumbo's important statements about justice in America and the rather sick relationship between the supreme henchman and his girl, the money is really low. The main problem is that the acting is really bad. Sterling Haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he's the last man to want to play a sensitive Swedish sailor who finds happiness in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make a Sydney Greenstreet a (very) bloated plutocrat. That's not a bad idea, but Cabot has no acting skills. The guy who plays the weapon with the missing arm and the missing soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the movie. He does not do anything with it. <br /> <br /> Third, the script is not all about it. Trumbo brings some digging for the immigrant, and the sheriff in a corrupt city will not be shaken up. This is a rather outdated 1958 movie news item - High Noon, Black Rock's Bad Day, Devil's Doorway - all Westerners who deal with the evils of Western society and keep an eye out for the ills of the 1950s in America. Trumbo certainly had every personal reason to agree with these feelings in '59, but he does not do anything new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So, if you take into account all negative aspects, why is this movie coming from? a 4? Mostly because there are interesting peculiarities throughout the movie. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is intriguing.) And Trumbo is a mediocre writer when he does his political affects, and is very good at creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when you're ready to break boredom out of Indy-Film, there's going to be a dialogue exchange or simple bizarre thing that makes one realize that the guy who wrote the script was not just a hack. <br /> <br /> If not like Trumbo or Western, do not miss it. Otherwise try it out. You may like it more than me.
