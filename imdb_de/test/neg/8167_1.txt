It's hard to make a bad movie with the sport theme "Underdog finally succeeds", but this movie succeeds admirably. I think how pointless and boring this movie is. I think the director could not decide if it was the runner or the coach. It's about being above nothing. Who cares in the end? No character has a sympathetic personality. There is nothing in the movie to interest you for someone. Even the "bad guy" is not really bad. (I think he's in two scenes and seems to be in a kind of barbitus.) I think he politely asks her to leave the coach and train with him. Later he somehow asks her to join him. that's it. Conflict! Tension! What will she do? !! <br /> <br /> -and what about the appearance of running? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? Christine's form is so wrong, she is absurd, as is the form of the alleged "champion" she competes with. (A character without lines - maybe they could have set a real RUNNER?) <br /> <br /> And the speed of the run is incomprehensible. Are they running or running fast? It's actually ridiculous. I can literally go back faster than they ran in the big race. Maybe it was too difficult to move the cameras at real speed? <br /> <br /> Another absurdity: (Spoiler, I think) At one point of the big race, the two women at the top inexplicably fall in time at the same time. What they fell on is a mystery. Maybe both were just exhausted and fell over? And then they get up, but may not walk for 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add tension, as the other runners are not around, and you were also put into a state of catatonia at this point. <br /> <br /> - I really enjoyed it like all four of your male teammates, all highly trained athletes, retired from the big race because of horse horses or pulled tendons. <br /> <br /> But who cares? This movie has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. A runner who has absolutely no personality, is discovered by an old, boring coach whose failure was hardly hinted at in the past. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train even more. She wins a big race. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the actual movie. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this like the plague.
