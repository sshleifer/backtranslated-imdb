For some movies, it's hard to tell who they were made for. Huevos de Oro seems to be targeting the well educated Spanish middle class. There have to be many insider jokes in this movie that you, as an outsider, will not understand. That can be pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the film alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the surrealists in general, a certain love of bidet-baths seems to be shown on Duchamps finished brands. In addition, the main character has a talent for karaoke tapes with songs by Julio Iglesias. But why this is mixed up in a rather pretty, but also unfounded way, simply eludes me. I can only surmise that all of this contributes to highlighting the vital, impetuous, Boorian vulgarity of the main character that the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. How all the really pretty women run after him (the main character, I mean) is a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts. It begins in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the Engineering Corps. Then it's off to the resort of Benidorm in Spanin, where Benito just wants to build the tallest skyscraper in town and become a vulgar Howard Roark. For the last part, a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably to start a new life. "But the change of location is not really satisfactorily explained, it is somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the film goes into one Soap-Opera mode over without being convincingly ironic, and Javier Bardem has to deal very well with the young stallion, which becomes flabby and drained. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because I am For this reason, Huevos de oro has only partially convinced me, and in Jess Franco's "She Killed In Ecstasy" (1970), this particular place has been used more profitably.
