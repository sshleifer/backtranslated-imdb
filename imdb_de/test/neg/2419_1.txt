If the directors / producers / publicists want to promote a movie as "based on actual events" and make a movie that inspires and makes sense, then you should first maintain any kind of credibility and integrity. Keep a movie as honest as you can possible. <br /> <br /> A team that carries "all black" jumpers and does the haka in America is just stupid. Any semi-intelligent person would know that the "All Blacks" are the New Zealand National Rugby Union team and their jumpers are all black and the haka is performed by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> If such stupidity is present in a movie with no explanation, the credibility of the film is reduced to nothing and the message and inspiration the film tries to achieve are lifted. <br /> <br /> The question is "why"? Why should you do such a stupid thing and for what possible profit? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the authors or directors or producers saw it on TV before an international rugby union match and thought, "Wow, that." No one would know that it never happened, they are all too stupid to know about NZ and all the black people, it will be great. "<br /> <br /> What would an American audience look like in a New Zealand made movie about American lattice ironing, with a team wearing American Indian costumes and war paint, dancing a native Native American war dance and walking around in circles and" oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo "you would laugh their heads! <br /> <br /> The people who made this movie and the industry that made it should have their heads read Reason the industry believes that it can "always fool all people." <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
