Very stupid high school teens roam about geeks trying to prove themselves better than the rich brats. Sounds familiar? This TV movie by director Rod Amateau ("Uncommon Valor" and some "Dukes of Hazaard" episodes believe or not) says nothing, does nothing and will certainly entertain only a few. <br /> <br /> "Who is Who" of TV cast including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver ("Gilligan") and Todd Bridges ("Different Strokes"). This lame effort barely limps across the line. Also stars Anthony Edwards ("E.R."). Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
