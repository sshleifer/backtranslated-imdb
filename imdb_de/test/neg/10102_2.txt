I just saw it on TV today. It was on ABC's Sunday Afternoon Movie. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but it was okay for an independent independent movie like this one. There is some tension, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie to a standstill. The script is pretty lame, and the plot elements are not very realistic, just as a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone reports a murder. I do not know what the author was thinking when they came up with this idea, but that's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie would be a good suspense thriller, because there were a few scenes that would seemingly lead to something good, but unfortunately never. There were a few plot elements that were used similarly in similar films and did not turn out to be very creative in the end. <br /> <br /> If there's anything good about this movie, then it's the cast. Every actor in this movie did well with the one he had to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. But if you want to see a really good movie, check out the excellent animated film The Incredibles. She used her sexy voice well in this movie. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this movie is not really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they were all wasted on this movie, which is a pity. This movie was trying to be an exciting thriller, but in the end it fell flat. If you want to watch a good movie that resembles this, but is much better, read the Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast of this movie, check out the other movies. You can easily share this movie if you ever have the chance to see it.
