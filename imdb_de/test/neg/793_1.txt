For the first time, I felt like I needed to write a review. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a lot of movies. I am reasonably open-minded and can easily say that I enjoyed a movie, even though he still said, "Yes, it was not good, but I enjoyed it". I can appreciate the mastery of great films like The Shaw Shank Redemption, the Godfather and the American History X. I like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy, even though the movie may not be that great. I can even enjoy a bad movie that happens to entertain me (Bloodsport). I will also try to rate the movie fairly, even if I do not like it. City Lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed, but I can appreciate the drama and plot lines of the time. should consider some ideas. Try to judge the movie by how good it actually was. Do not let your personal inclination influence the rating. Also, look at the other moves you have rated and compare the movie you will be rating. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was the worst garbage I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life have just been stolen. Acting was horrible down the line. The scenes were best cut off. The real shame, however, was the story. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that made sense and took the viewer from point A to point B. After that, it was a nightmare. They were constantly trying to add new elements, but nothing was explained. Nothing really made sense, Steward was dead, is he alive, did he hit by lighting, was it really lit, were it aliens, is he an alien, etc. The end has nothing to do with each other and no questions answered. The only positive was that it did not interest anyone where we were just happy to leave the theater. What's wrong with some of you? I admit that the eight of us were so crazy to see that, we thought, "what would make it better?", And we decide to tell some of our friends that this movie is good for them to suffer and see need this movie. What can I say, misery loves company. That's really the only reason I can see for a rating of 6.5. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your life!
