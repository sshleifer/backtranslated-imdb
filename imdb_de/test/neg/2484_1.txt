Here is another pop star breaking into the big TV country, and from my observations of the pop career directors who said, Yes, you big Gwen, you could be a real star. Maybe one day you will be in the A-List movies To expand the show, there is simply no pretty face, but also has an acting ability almost overnight. gwen has come up with some of the ability to act by watching actors like James Dean or Clint heading east. Please give the real people in the world who have to sit behind this box and the pop stars who are trying to act. Please stick to your pretty pop videos with your Japanese and do not insult the British with their efforts as an actress. Anyway, I go back to my job in the working class and I think, God, I could do that. But yes, remember, I'll work until I'm 65, if I live that long and yes, you put your feet up every three months with your royalties, pah marry money right xxx
