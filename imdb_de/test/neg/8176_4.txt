This may not be the worst movie that has ever won the best picture, but it's up there. Well, at second thought, this is probably the worst movie that has ever won the best picture. Still, one would expect it to be worth a movie. That is also questionable. The movie contains almost no depth and just makes "fun" of "fun," if you want to call it that. At first it's very interesting, but it seems like everything is exaggerated on so many levels. <br /> <br /> The spectacle was not spectacular, but it was quite interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first starring role. I found many of the characters like the sound of the movie annoying after a while. Who I liked very much was James Stewart as a philosophical clown. He saved the movie by giving him a much needed extra shift. Unfortunately, there was not much else after Stewart. <br /> <br /> The direction of the respected Cecil DeMille did not exist for me. I sometimes found the movie cheesy and his use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The look of the film was at times very good, but did not produce the magical feel that classics must have. The writing was actually pretty good, considering how shallow the movie was. <br /> <br /> From movies like this came the term "Hollywood Trash". There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw emotions from the audience, and simply no artistic value for the film. Then of course the many holes in the plot. This movie was always annoying and frustrating. I even had a feeling through this movie that much of what I saw was not just an inaccurate portrayal of circus life, but the opposite of how it really is. It's a mystery to me why this best image was won, but it's not the first or last time that the Oscars will make a mistake.
