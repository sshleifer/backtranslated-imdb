This is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I am confused that this guy got his own show. It smells of utter desperation from Comedy Central and tries to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. He's a tip from Ned's pocket with the comedy Gold: Is not a Pointe Funny? Do you need to give that extra boost in joy? F *** ING YELL IT ON THE LIST. Just no? And as an added bonus ... finish off half of your jokes ... THEN YOU'RE RE-TAH-DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh man. So funny. Beaner ... weird. Wetback ... does the laughter ever stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, let me give you an example. Mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild new Orleans because it's so close to the water. Genius. The line between a big comedian and a hack has never been so clear. While a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, subtle ways of weaving a joke into something we can all laugh at and comfort, Ned goes for the obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is that funny? Ned does not have the intellectual ability to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city. The dyke project was underfunded and urgently needed federal dollars ... and lo and behold! They broke. I think that's how God tells us we should not be there. After all, he has a seat in Congress. What a fool. Chapelle was a master who turned a tired racist comedy on its head. He was effortless and we laughed with him everywhere. While Mencia says that black people can not swim, yawn, Chapelle continued with the black and blind white superiority 300 yards. You do not have to be angry to be nervous. You have to be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and his legions of fans are such a self-contained gay guy who laughs too much about gay jokes. Of course, apart from Ned, he laughs too much about the "retards". You duuuuh
