This was a shockingly bad movie and I literally snapped at the first sight of the Blue Screen puppets. Imagine the worst blue screen special effects you've ever seen, make it a whole lot worse, and then combine them with poorly built rubber and play-doh dolls that look like something from a semi-delayed pre-school class appearance. Then add some yelling, Yngwie Malmstein-Esquire, Melodic Metal guitar soli material that's way too loud and takes way too long. The overall movie is absolutely terrible and makes "feeders" look like "Rashomon". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with each measurable metric rolled down somberly, much like a soaked muck in the eternal, slow-moving whirlpool of a broken rest-stop toilet. Nevertheless, a movie like "Actium Maximus" is not to be overlooked by the bad film concerts, even if he only looked up clips on YouTube or somewhere. This movie is a bit of eye-opener if you can get carried away. I think this director may be mentally ill, which is a bit depressing. As you watch him discuss the project, you feel that he really believes he has created something wonderful. I think he is the "Star Wars kid" of the Gonzo filmmakers. What a mess. :-)
