The animation is great, I admit. But Disney immortalized every stereotype that we Alaskans have tried to overcome for two generations. And the names, I mean, come on ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denahi (cheesy start of Denali)?! These are real places where real people live! And the real people for whom these real places are named are probably fighting out of the earth to seek revenge on this banal little movie. Disney, you are based in California and Florida, in the middle of the other states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you can not stick to what you know, at least you have to hire and / or work with people who know the area in which you are trying to move. Maybe it would not be so offensive then! :(
