Well, for the first time I have not seen "Silence of the Lambs" yet ... but I think I would have gotten sick if I had seen it before this piece. Not because of the cruel violence, but because of the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good at Hannibal and I really believed that he was just as psychotic as he pretended to be, but due to the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with clich√©s from "Silence" which left me with points where others laughed at what was on the screen. Well, I've heard that the movie would be very cruel and if the director wanted to pull people out ... he did ... but only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be cruel and I mean, so cruel you'll play the movie of it ... you need more than 2 sequences. I always see it as a movie has to become, either, this cinematic gem that will eventually bring you to another place and time, or go beyond the top (which usually happens with a bad taste). But this movie made me sit in my chair and sometimes fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I did not feel that way. Who was interested in the stupid Italian police officer? I definitely did not do that. So the movie really has a big hole in it for a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is good if you want to see Lector and Starling again, but if you're looking for a really good thriller ... they jump once and may be scored twice. Come on to your level. <br /> <br /> If you think about how much money this movie will bring, they'll probably make another "Hannibal" and this movie will probably be screened in the fall. If you need to see it ... wait and save the $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Do not spend a lot of money on this movie.
