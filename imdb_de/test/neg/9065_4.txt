OK, that's about 30 minutes without history. There are no spoken dialogues, no subtitles, not even real characters. You see three people in the entire movie (who are alive) and two are there for just a few reasons. The captain has no emotions and simply maims corpses for no apparent reason. That's the whole movie. I love seeing very bloody movies, especially because in America real gore is simply not common in modern movies. So the gore effects were pretty cool. But it's not really annoying. Why do everyone think it's so disturbing? There are no characters, there are only 3 living persons and 3 corpses. Nobody has a personality or background story. You see three corpses being hacked apart, and you can not really identify with them unless you identify yourself with death itself and how this could happen (even though the man loses his job and shortly thereafter gets jailed.) Um To disturb the viewer The viewer must be careful to identify with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character. Here it is only a man and a corpse. It's as deep as a puddle made up of a single raindrop. They do not give you any reason to worry about someone in the movie. It's just a guy who chops a few bodies, then he has sex with a body. Well, since the sex scene here is a strange thing, he wears gloves but no condom. So he does not care if he's having sex with a dead sexually transmitted sexual intercourse, but as long as his hands do not get messy, there's no problem. Now that's really logical. I do not really like the movie, I like it very bloody, but when it ends, there's no need to look at it again, no need to worry about it at all, and it's just not a very convincing movie. I say, if you find it for under $ 10 then you can get it, but if it's more, it's not worth it.
