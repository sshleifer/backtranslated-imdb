This movie was really bad. I mean really bad. The scenes were very sucked like a parody and special effect. And it was filmed in 2003 !!! I think that was a big waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his Shaggy from Scooby Doo image just made me laugh. Never waste your time with this picture ... I really do not know what the director was thinking after the last cut, but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt to look at them. The fighters of the "latex cat" were like sheep just rolling around the scenes, looking scared as if they had no idea what to do in the scene.
