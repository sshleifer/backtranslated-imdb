Obviously someone was looking for the "Blair Witch" wave. <br /> <br /> This movie has been set up like all the reality events that have been appearing on TV lately (and I have to admit, I get a kick out of these), but this movie is MUCH cheesier ! Probably the first three quarters of the movie are filled with the "participants" walking through the house, WINSEN. Give me a break! It's not my idea of ​​having a good time whining in the attic for 10 minutes. All paranormal events are crass setups. No strings, but too perfect in the camera to be real. The "participants" were also not very sympathetic. Two stupid guys who do not take it seriously, a girl who's afraid of dropping a hat, and the quintessence that dubbed "paranormal" person. Does this become the clichéd "formula" for a ghost movie? <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the last 15 minutes were pure excitement. They picked up every tension in the movie and stuck them in those 15 minutes. I admit, I spent this time in the kitchen. I really would not recommend this movie for younger viewers, even if it's PG13. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for entertainment, if you do not take it seriously, you'll get a kick out of this movie. There are countless situations where you can crack! If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere;)
