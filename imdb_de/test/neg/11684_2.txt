Well, the first thing I saw after watching the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and thought this would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure there was a good movie here once, but after the unbelievably bad drama and "video game" production figures, this looks like Tron's backward half-brother. The first scene determines the overall atmosphere of the entire film. After five minutes, you'll ask, "What the hell am I looking at?", And from there it'll just be Snowball. A horrible soundtrack, where every song sounds like Rob Zombie's "Dragula", rounds off that miserable piece of crap in a ridiculously bad movie. By the way, the # 3 most romantic quote in a movie - "I think you are the final destination."
