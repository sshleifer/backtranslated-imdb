Other reviewers seem to have appreciated this movie very much. For something made by an eighteen-year-old film student, I would say Bravo, but that's not the case. If you want to see a good movie about Graffitti, follow the documentation. It is recorded with the same quality as a home digital video. The two main characters are sombre actors and once again that would be fine if this was a student movie. The storyline follows a lonely artist who writes around Portland and writes Graffitti. He joins another and they run together and create art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the argument between them that is never discussed, because this film has as much dialogue as a charlin chaplin image. This movie shows the gravity street artists who fit well with their form, and the music is nice, but overall I would not really call it a movie.
