Like most, I rented that after hearing the general praise. And despite COUNTLESS bizarre, inexplicable moments on the way, I was very interested and talked for 100 minutes of the movie. Then the two women went to the "late night" performance. The rest of the movie (by the way, another 40 minutes) is even WEIRDER than the first part AND completely contradicts what I had already seen. Then the movie ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> I staggered over to my computer to see if I could get a clue to what had just happened. Nothing made sense and I'm a pretty smart guy. None of these other user comments made sense, even if they say "SPOILERS". I still have no idea what they are saying. Someone's dream? Not really? What is the meaning of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it is "not real"? Or is it real? I am forced to make a choice. Either: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is brilliant work at MENSA level and I'm just too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The film is weird for the sake of funny and just makes no sense. Anyone who loves it tries to save his face and pretend he "gets it." <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Lick me. I go home...
