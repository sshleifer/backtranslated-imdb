This game is a genre of games that seeks to capitalize on the entire Myst-inspired trend: go around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely terrible, but I keep acting, which is just a little bit better. If you are looking for a compelling performance from any character, you will not find them here. However, this game is worth buying if you are just experiencing the truly funny performance of Christopher Walken. His acting is so terrible in this game that it seems he is imitating someone who is just impersonating him. He's a caricature of himself. <br /> <br /> Buy this game if you're masochistic, a walrus fan or just want to hear the F-word.
