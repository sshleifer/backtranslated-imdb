Ken Russell staged this weird (not very) erotic thriller and if I had not known that I had put my life on the director Brian DePalma was. Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION cries DePalma, from the gaudy cinematography, which is lit too brightly, to the domestic action that turns into a stalk and slash act, to the title "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" , > <br /> Unfortunately, since Brian DePalma is increasingly considered a poor man Hitchcock over the years, Russell should have imitated his own style. Surely an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would be bizarre with a Capital B, but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience. On the video market of the 1980s, stories about prostitutes who lived a dangerous double life and were persecuted by religious madness were a common sight. Oh, and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie of the 1980s. Yawning <br /> <br /> The only thing that really belongs to a true ban on PASSIONS is the controversy that it triggered. I think the studio was the happiest person to hear this because no commercial is bad advertising, but as far as the controversial sex scenes are concerned ... What controversial sex scenes? There are none and the only controversy I can think of is that China Blue controls a police officer on duty with a baton. Needless to say, he did not come quiet
