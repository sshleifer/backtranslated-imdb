"Can contain Verderber" Unfortunately, the last film by Lou Costellos has the difference that he is slightly better than the last film by Abbott & Costello "Dance With Me Henry". This movie is not terrible all in all, it's an amusing career misfire. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie a bit bearable. You can not blame Lou Costello because a big studio has released it, which means someone had to give the "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello solved the problems that he had lost his son a few years earlier and the IRS's unjustified attacks. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies, you will notice that the spell has disappeared. Take a look at "Dance With Me Henry", it's a painful movie.
