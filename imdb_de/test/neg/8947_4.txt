Great show, good production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> However, the script begins with great speed and interest in the first half and then breaks apart in the second half. We are clear about character and motivation for the first half, but in the second half many questions remain unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts are convincing, but the throughput is weak. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is for the war, but we do not know if this philosophical attitude changes in the course of the film. <br /> <br /> This kind of picture makes me want to look up the facts in history books. I do not think I can rely on the movie to get a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of the war itself is heartbreakingly accurate, though women's lack of enthusiasm does not reflect the war hysteria that swept Britain at the time. Maybe this is historically correct; Like so much in this movie, I just do not know.
