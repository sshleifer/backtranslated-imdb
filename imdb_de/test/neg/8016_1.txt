This movie is an almost complete waste of time. I study the book for my English Abitur, and the film only adds in one way, and that shows that the whole scenario plays in a rural idyll. The acting is made of wood, the filmography is ridiculous and the so-called dramatic scenes of the film made the majority of my class (including myself) giggle into their lyrics. The book is not my favorite literary choice, but it's a lot better than the movie, and the soundtrack is just irritating. Watch this film only if you are looking for a timeless, high-quality plot that is transformed into mindless media waste.
