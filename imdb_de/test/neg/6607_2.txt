There are three main problems with the movie. Or rather, there are three reasons why it is not even a candidate who is worth a more serious consideration. <br /> <br /> First, and it has always been that it's not nearly as good as the books. At least we could have expected to reproduce something of Sapkowski's wit or depth. Second, we have the production. Fantasy movies are in my opinion the hardest to produce well. Everything from the props to costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) CGI is inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, and many are very subjective, I can not take acting seriously. I was not educated in Poland, so I can not really judge that I am unfamiliar with Polish films. Nevertheless, the lines seem very amateurish delivered ... The casting could also be better. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the rest of the translucent plot: not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting corpse. <br /> <br /> I heard that the books are in English. I have not seen them yet, but I can not imagine how to start translating them ... I would ask the English-speaking reader to consider this when he judges the book.
