"The Bone Snatcher" begins extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as the use of the sublimely localized location of the African desert. As they check the desert pipelines, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly alien creature, devouring their flesh and leaving only a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue her discover that the monster is an overly mutant ant queen, and they soon find themselves trapped in the eerie desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a sizeable tension until the monster's nature is recognized. Immediately thereafter, the movie quickly transforms into an ordinary creature function where all the characters gradually disappear from the survival contest. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is unbearably boring. with the inevitable love story clich√©s and the utter abandonment of bloody murder set pieces. All characters are unbearable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predicted a few minutes earlier. There's the rookie, who has to prove himself, the woman with brainpower, apart from her hot looks, the disgusting experienced guy who ends up redeeming himself by self sacrifice and? last but not least ?? Who could forget the wise black man who refers to the monster and uses all sorts of voodoo names? Wulfsohn is trying too hard to make his monster look like the space threats of Alien and Predator. The ant creature has infrared visibility and crumbles when yawned! The film actually benefits only from its unique backdrop and the few unpleasant images of destroyed bodies. This could have been a modest gem, but instead it is less than mediocre. Avoid.
