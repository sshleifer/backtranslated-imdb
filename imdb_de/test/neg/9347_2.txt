After missing those countless hours at TCM UK, I decided to find out from the Sci-Fi / Adventure / Camp family: I knew that I would experience an absolutely stupid ride - but it was also amazingly bad! However, perhaps in light of the characters involved, the screenplay rips off many science fiction titles from the previous year - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976); same sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but not very compelling: the title suggests that water has become scarce on the planet where it all takes place. Therefore, our heroes of the Bukkanier-Bukaneer take on ice to steal blocks from the tyrannical Templar (!) Rulers. Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of her father, the deposed king; Incidentally, the cast includes another famous offspring: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate gang - fortunately, the actress' mistake of accepting such a role would soon be forgotten after she won an Oscar no less than her father's guidance for PRIZZI'S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as "Supreme Commander," the filmmakers opted for their own screen legend - 78-year-old John Carradine (who was strapped to a sort of operating table in his only short scene!). <br /> <br /> The most notable bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: the foreigner who uses the toilet; the castration machine; the awkward antics (including the karate-style battle!) of the inevitable robot companions; the stupid slaves / eunuch make-up that the heroes have worn in one place; the recurring attacks of the "space herpies" (whatever that is); the climax in which the characters age through a time warp (Crosby becomes pregnant, gives birth and sees her son grow up within 30 seconds, while Chief Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford) Hank Worden for this scene!) - Incidentally, the jump cuts introduced here (which want to denote the fast timing) are not only unsuccessful, but downright irritating.
