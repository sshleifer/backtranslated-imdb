This "remake" is a complete shame: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it would not make more than a few nasty lines. <br /> <br /> It's also a scam, with a ridiculous script that's made of so much amateurish "drama", you're always aware that it's a set, a camera, a fake, not a direction There is no floating reality that will immerse you in the story. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic, suffocating tensions of The Small Spaces and Spaces in the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) are almost lost here in crowded sets and rooms. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, however, is the moral enormity and intolerable suffering that both of the original mother and the child, transformed into ruthless vengeful ghouls, have a ruthless logic of total nonsense and hollow boogie Man style are completely ruined and rise above the lowest common denominator and prefer to swallow this kind of tutelage of Hogwash instead, f you deserve this pathetic curse completely: the movie itself.
