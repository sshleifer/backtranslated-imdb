The luscious Candace Bergen as a Victorian beauty that was kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert sheikh! How can you be wrong? As? Oh, let me count the ways !!! The earthy, primitive Sean Connery, just the right man to tame a brittle, noble beauty like Candace, is. , , Well, not so good in the role. That's because he does not have to talk about the real issues ("you're a woman ... I'm a man!"), He has to babble nonsense about "the will of Allah" and "the wind blows over the desert sands." "John Milius, a director more known for worshiping naked male bodies and brutal military violence than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has a crazy way of cutting off his desert lovers each time Candace is kissed Instead of watching nature take its course with two incredibly attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we get endless (and I mean ENDLESS) shots of Brian Keith flashing his walrus-sized choppers and sweet sermons on the joys of Teddy Roosevelt I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but seeing him test his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear does not excite me as the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would do. if it had already started! The strange thing is that Milius spends most of his time with it, Ch Build up araktere and storylines that have no resolution. Candace's two little kids in the story get more time on the screen than they do. There is no humor, no chemistry, no hissing in the things that happen in the desert. If you do not think it's funny that after weeks of galloping on horses, her hair is still perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment in the story is when Candace Bergen shakes out her baby daughter late at night from a sound sleep on soft pillows and says, "We have to flee." The little girl turns and answers, without missing a beat: "But mother, I slept!" This one line summarizes what is really missing in the story. No danger, tension or hissing in the story of a cultured lady in captivity. They (and their children) are both so close and in good hands that it's hard to believe someone has taken care of their fate. Mind you, if Candace had said the line herself, it might have worked better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her imprisonment (or her pleasure in being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt over all the difficulties caused by her kidnapping, the story would have been tense. But Milius assumes the strange assumption that the audience is just as excited as if Teddy Roosevelt had a chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles. In the end, the pretty woman and her children do not seem worth anything to him. , , and because they are at the heart of the story, the whole thing seems rather dry and endless. , , like the burning desert sand.
