American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. I have seen it at least 30 times and have been emotionally affected every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962). <br /> <br /> However, more American graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made. The great original movie was involved in this terrible sequel. The part of the film that plays in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (I've been working with the 101st Airborne Division for 18 months in Vietnam.) <br /> <br /> The whole movie did not have anything worthwhile in any part of the movie Unlike sequels to great movies, More American Graffiti would be the best Example of what can go wrong.
