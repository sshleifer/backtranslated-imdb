Unfortunately, another Costner movie was an hour too long. Credible performances, but the script had no purpose and was in no hurry to get there. First, we are offered a series of events, few of which continue the story. Will the script focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front story develops, and the characters themselves are artificially supported by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer further and further. After all, long after you are no longer interested, you will learn about the script meetings. Three ends were undoubtedly offered and no one could make a decision. The final result? All three were used one after the other. If you can hold on to the 100th yawn, you can choose it. Despite the transparent attempt to collect points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, it should have washed out on the first day.
