I looked at the MST3K version of the movie, and this review has smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started to watch this movie, it looked like he had promised a cheesy sci-fi movie, but the more I watched it, the more disappointing it became. The first reason is quite idiosyncratic - I liked the shy girl with glasses much more than the model that became Wanda at the end of the film. The deeper it was the fact that the loss of glasses and the change of clothes replaced the actual character growth. Instead of developing into a figure who could take care of herself, Wanda relied on men to do anything for her as well as at the beginning of the movie. The drama could have been better (though I was tired of the cracks over Ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself!) That's not so bad.) The background was alright, but it was a bit hokey (aliens = face-painting people) , and could have needed more explanations. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was just interested in the movie itself, but Joel and the bots did not do much for me. Without them, the movie might have been better. <br /> <br /> Overall (for the movie itself, not for the MST3K) a 3 out of 10 points. It was an okay movie as it was.
