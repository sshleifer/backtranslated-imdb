I do not have to see the same movie the comments refer to here. First, I think they should have serialized Ghost Story if they were to be made at all. The shortened version they presented was awful. I felt the performances were restrained and so much was left out of the story that the performances were performed by masters like Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks hammy. Alice Krige, however, was great as Eva. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but as a protagonist he was only appropriate. The decision to cast Patricia Neal and cut her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with this character! I blame the script, which was bad. The production values ​​were dark and the pace was slow. A disappointing pedestrian performance. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the five greatest horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the movie was disappointing, though it was a great introduction to Krige.
