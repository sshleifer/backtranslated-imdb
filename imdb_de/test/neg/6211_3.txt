First, let's discuss the story. It's a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an added Indian flavor. A man who is a love guru, and another man who seems to be a jerk when it comes to ladies, and how this apparent jerk becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru, is history. Salman Khan is the love guru, and Govinda is the lame one. <br /> <br /> When Salman Khan arrives at the artist's performances, he over-acts and tries to be funny throughout the movie, but he fails. You can see Salman screaming throughout the movie, there's no real acting in his performance. Govinda faces Katrina Kaif (Oh my God, she's a girl, a real beauty) in real life is a 50-year-old guy, and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the film Govinda looks like the grandfather of Katrina Kaif. What a shame! Come to the execution of the film. This movie feels like a B-movie and a bad imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with sense and depth, this movie is flat and futile. Nowhere is there justification or clarity. <br /> <br /> Just forget this movie because it's nothing but boring, typical Bollywood food. Actually, I give 3/10, because that's the lowest I'm going.
