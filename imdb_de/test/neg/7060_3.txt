I like a lot of Myrna Loy movies. This movie was produced before her personality was developed as a character actor. It would be an okay short film, but seems to go on forever in its full form. Myrna Loy, it seems, is told what to do with her acting and does the job. That's about all you can say about them. <br /> <br /> Their gypsy character is modest and the film has many shortcomings, such as the jewelery business scene. <br /> <br /> This movie will likely be interesting for Myrna Loy fans, but even such a thing is a disappointment.
