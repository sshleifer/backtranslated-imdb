Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the biggest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of budget flights, many of which were parodies of key Hollywood features. Most of Laurel's "spoof" movies are just a bit funny and even less fun for modern viewers who have not yet seen the original film that Laurel is parodying. Fortunately, "Mud and Sand" is a movie still known: "Blood and Sand" starring Rudolph Valentino. "Blood and Sand" was released just nine weeks before this parody and gives you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's films were brought to the ground, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Various sources (including IMDb) state that Stan Laurel did this character in this movie is called Rhubarb Vaselino, with a final "o." I've screened a phrase from 'Mud and Sand' with the original titles (in Hobo script), so I report that Laurel's role is actually rhubarb petrolatum with an 'e'. But I agree that 'Vaselino' is funnier. Laurel copies the lavish sideburns that Valentino wore in 'Blood and Sand' (he should have made them longer!), And there's a parody of Valentino's dressing scene from this movie that fainted female moviegoers in 1922. Carmen in the original movie is called here Caramel parodies (a girl I would like to put my teeth in). <br /> <br /> This movie (like the original) is apparently in Spain, but there is a prohibition gag. Laurel uses an unmistakable hat-tipping gesture that could have become a trademark for him (like Hardy's distinctive tie), but I've never seen it in any other Laurel movie before. There are some amusing dialogues: Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matadors: 'Save a bull for me'. When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, a lackey tells him, "The bull is without, sir" ... which is weird, but I was disappointed that Laurel was not on "Without WHAT?" Replied. <br /> <br /> There's a funny moment here, most likely not planned when Vaseline shows up for the Bullfighter casting. Laurel beats into the bullring, and before you can say "corrida querida", he throws a bull over the fence, where he lands with a dull thud near the other auditioner. The bull is obviously a fake, but the gag is funny anyway ... and yes, there is a title card with a joke about 'throwing the bull'. The random moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag and Vaseline flings a second bull over the fence. This one lands on his butt and just balances for a moment before he tips over. Very funny! If someone has planned this gag in this fast-paced comedy, I greet the unknown Gagsschmied ... and the technician who manipulated the bull to land in that position. More likely, this happened by chance, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it to himself. During the silent movie era, when Hollywood was filming a big budget movie shot anywhere people used to speak English, you could not speak, it was a common cinematographic, text or inscription in the local language show and then dissolve into a single shot of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low budget comedy spent the money to copy this device here: we see a billboard outside the Corrida with a message in Spanish, then it dissolves into English in the same text. Unfortunately, the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> The actresses in this film are attractive ... including Broncho Billy's wife, Leona Anderson, and Mae Dahlberg's wife, Stan Laurel; The latter makes a nice dance. (Mae had danced in Stan's vaudeville act.) I was surprised to see Charlie Chaplin's half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a short role, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this film. In 'Mud and Sand' Laurel gives a fun performance that's different from his later-known Stanley character ... but this movie is a lot less fun than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: Only 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's last American movie "The Bullfighters" (1945), he again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish dubbed voice)). Coincidentally, the film also used footage from 'Blood and Sand': not Valentino's movie, but the Tyrone Power remake. "Mud and Sand" is funnier than "The Bullfighters", but not much.
