I do not appreciate recognizing Haneke's above-average filmmaking skills. I appreciate it, for example, when he dwells on inconspicuous, daylight-lit environments to create a strong realism. As for the content of this film, I am very sad that in the 21st century there is still the urge to pathologize relationships or feelings of domination submission (and / or BDSM practices). The problem the main character has with her mother is incredibly topical, as is the alienation and lack of understanding that Walter feels (I do not mean the frustration of a lover who is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; he looks at her as if she were crazy or as if he were a monk, come on!). I mean, D / s is not something new in the world and I find it rather stupid to treat the subject as if it were something "Freakish" or pathological. it's not Generally films dealing with this topic are lagging behind in time. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a fairly programmatic film that is concerned with very obsolete psicoanalitic theories (isn 'it almost embarrassing?), and that does not really relate to life and experiences those who live in D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chat rooms, even recent scholar studies will show this).
