TANDEM is a weird piece in the Japanese pink genre - having the requisite sex scenes and the misogynistic tone that's almost necessary for this kind of movie - but also in a disjointed drama / dark comedy story, It seems like they were better suited for a different kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two single men in a restaurant dreaming of a previous sexual encounter every day. One is a two-way subway, the other is a typical scenario of rape for this type of movie. The two perverts meet and begin to talk after one lends a cigarette to the other. They spend an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex lives. The film is associated with flashback scenes of the two men's interactions with the women who play a central role in their lives. The two men drop out and the film ends with a strange but predictable note ... I really do not know what to do with TANDEM. It's kind of like an "odd pair" anti-buddy movie, but it's not really exploring the subject in a satisfying way. Nor is there much of the typical extreme sloppiness that often occurs in such films. So I can not really figure out what matters. I can not quite say if the movie should be funny, depressing or both. I think TANDEM could have had some potential as a serious drama movie with a dark comedy edge - but as a softcore sex movie that tries to be "smart" for its own good, it just does not work. I can not say that I hated this one - but I can not say that anything is remarkable about it. 4.10
