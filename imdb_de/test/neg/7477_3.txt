Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that she sneaks straight to Conan O'Brien and Late Night fans and suddenly carelessly sees Carson's show. Carson Daly can not put a candle in the hands of Leno, Letterman, O'Brien, or any other evening talk show host, and Last Call seems to be more than beat in this hit-and-miss genre. The quality of the shows is just that they are so short. But I would not call it crap. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his show is not great (that honesty is really helpful here), while some skits and material from Last Call seem stolen. In fact, some of Carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of a decent comedy. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, Carson is fine, even if only one guest is present, but not very late material, even above the level reached by a high school AV team. He does not have the quick joke that makes Conan so funny. I do not like his musical guests, but that's more because I'm not a fan of this kind of music. I do not hold it against him. <br /> <br /> Continue to the house band. I do not know Joe Firstman's band and would not compare them to the CBS Orchestra, the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or the Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and the Cleetones are better. But Firstman's bandmates still do the show in my opinion. Especially the alto saxophone player who sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and always plays in the upper register), if anything, watch the show, I do it. <br /> <br /> In summary: This show is not even worth a whole sack of kibble n 'bits. But it has an audience and more appeals to the younger "mtv generation". If you do not have a cable and get up at 1:37 in the morning, there really is not much choice left. Surprisingly, there is much worse in this timeframe. So if you wait for Poker After Dark, you will not kill 30 minutes of Last Call while waiting.
