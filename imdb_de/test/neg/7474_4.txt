... a recommendation! Gloria Grahame runs an orphanage where discipline is given to a meat cleaver. Orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them, and the bodies are kept in the freezer area so they can be used to call social services. We know that the orphanage costs cash, because Gloria brings orphans to work, and also because there does not seem to be enough clothes to walk around - especially for the older, born female orphans (the age group seems to be between 12 and 30) his ish). The newcomer, however, turns out to be more than a game for Gloria - and indeed he has just wiped out his mother and mother's lover (in a witty opening scene with claw hammer and arson). Gloria is likely to land herself at a meat hook. This one was made for about, but was / is a HUGE GIANT GIANT hit on the Grindhouse Circuit. My DVD cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes," and it sure did not lie. I think it is viewed as the citizen Kane of the orphanage filming pornographic films. 4.10
