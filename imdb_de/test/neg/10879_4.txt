First of all let me say that ... Ghost Story .... hello!?! <br /> <br /> If one of the other people who ravaged this movie from beginning to end, realized that fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that the characters always disappeared when the protagonist returned should have been a dead present. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you borrowed it from the video store, not even a hint, and this is the BIGGEST mistake the studio made that marketed it. It was deliberately on their side not to market it as a ghost story to confuse you, as if the main character were confused when you try to make sense of it. The problem with that is that they have lost too many viewers; The ghosts seemed "too human and real," without the usual telltale signs, images, or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know that you're seeing a ghost now ... and that's exactly what they wanted to do. The main character does not know that she sees ghosts, nor does the viewer. Do you understand it now? As long as you understand that the main character sees ghosts, you will understand the movie, and you will not be so irritated, which is perceived as major omissions in continuity or conspiracy. I admit that this was said, it was still not a good movie, just not so bad that everyone else did it. Just get it, if you're going to watch this movie, all you see is "not" always what you think. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for action and 5 for fear factor, though there were some hectic and scary moments. Still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
