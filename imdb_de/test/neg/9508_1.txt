<br /> <br /> The piece has been heavily edited and the sequence of scenes has been completely confused. Acting is poor (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and cinematography. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confused, boring movie that will instantly dissuade Shakespeare newcomers from Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> If you can not see a play, then at least see the Olivier version (1948) instead of this Drivel!
