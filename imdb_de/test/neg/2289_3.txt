Although some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond films in terms of learning frequency, and while most of the terminology that Bond confines to a poor 007 entourage has been exploited beyond reasonable judgments, there are some redeemable plausibilities which extend the credibility of Sean Connery in this doubling role that had seen her counterparts in an earlier performance by Jessica Tandy at Driving Miss Daisy. While Connery was less visible in the latter, his spyhunter qualities might not have frowned at the bitter onlookers, as would be the case in this latest version, which approached most of them with friendly resentment. The general taste had changed. Great for those who interest others while falsifying who you are not!
