I'm sorry, maybe this is part of the firefighter's worship wave since 911, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it's not meant to cut your socks off, but I'm sorry, this movie is awful. As in title Cliche 49, I believe it has at least as many clichés. It's a sad story (impressive how to do it when dangerous fires and lives are saved) about a firefighter. And his bleak life, in a meaningless, "scene from now" flashback to the style of the past. We start the movie with the endangered hero in a burning building. The whole movie is about trying to make us love this guy so we'll shed some tears as he finds his end in the finale of the scene from the beginning of the movie. It was hard for me to care, and wished he had gone up in smoke earlier. There are plenty of clichés such as - death of the best friend, love at first location, confusion in a new job, first-born, worried wife with a husband with a dangerous job, father-boss / supervisor, 2.4 children (a good 2, but close enough) to sacrifice your life to save others, praise for bravery ... and so on. It's the life of every firefighter, every cop, nurse, doctor. It was lazy when it was meant to be "life before his eyes" when he died, then God helps the poor guy. I'm surprised he did not smoke anymore to go faster. The flashbacks are mostly banal and predictable, stupid and stupid, and with a soundtrack that could get The Laughing Cow out of business, it was so cheesy that it actually sounded like a muzak or copyright-protected gear !!! At all costs, unless you need something to watch with grandma on a Sunday night. Or maybe if you're related to a firefighter - a warning - your life will end horribly or you'll be scarred for life if you're a brave firefighter after this movie. Unless your John Travolta (weird velcro hair !!)
