A gruesome and bloody story about a couple who inherits an Italian castle with 150 rooms while still losing their young son. The couple's marriage seems to be on the rocks because the car accident claimed their son's life and the daughter became blind. When the castle is taken over for later sale, a hideous, tormented and malformed creature loses the bowels of the 12th-century castle. Pretty bloody with a great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
