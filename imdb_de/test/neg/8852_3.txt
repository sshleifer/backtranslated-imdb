I was so excited to finally see "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon and I have to say I was totally disappointed. I think maybe, I was too hyped up. I had expectations of the fans that simply could not be fulfilled. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow and painful. I am a versatile horror fan. I love the brutal, bloody madness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I also love the ever-growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters". Unfortunately, "Pulse" offered little from both areas. <br /> <br /> In addition to the inertia of the plot, it was also very confused. I had no idea why characters did what they did and how what they did helped their problem. It seemed the director was bubbling with the plot in a sentence or two, and the rest was repugnant to our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters," which also has a rather elusive plot, "Pulse" in the end does not really clear up and I feel frustrated, confused, and uninterested in the characters' efforts. My final statement about the conspiracy was their inconsistency. At first, it seemed as if the story of the overflowing spirit world and its escape medium was the Internet. That's a damned original idea. I like it. But as the plot boils, action holes and inexplicable events raise its head, it seems the director is about to move on to an apocalyptic story (as will be seen in the end) that was not clear enough to be performed. <br /> <br /> I realize that the shots are bleak and the setting was intended to make the viewer look grim and isolated, but the movie's languor was only enhanced by the grainy, shady surroundings. I admit there was a certain sense of surrealism in the film, but that was perhaps just my attention, which gradually faded. <br /> <br /> The actions of some characters are also a bit ridiculous, and if I had been more intrigued by the story I might have been able to expose more unbelief, but even I myself was unmotivated, including some of the characters. As I mentioned earlier, the logic was missing behind certain characters and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Perhaps it was the incoherence of the plot that made the characters do questionable things. To be honest, I do not care. <br /> <br /> The acting was decent. Certainly nothing outstanding, but nothing bad. No runaways on either side of brilliant or terribly awful. <br /> <br /> Now I stop being so angry and mention that there were a handful of scary moments. One towards the end, especially that I (almost) completely enjoyed this film if it were consistently more. I always thought that when the website was shown, it was quite disturbing, as well as some of the ghostly encounters confronting our two main characters. The things that were going on between those awful arguments were just too weak, confusing and "WTF" for me to really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Now for something that concerns the DVD itself ... Magnolia's release of "Pulse" contains subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. They are not told at the right time of the character's speech. It might sound like nodding, but it bothered me a bit and it might bother others. I think this is the only North American version of the movie, so you either have to distribute or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING !!!). I tried to like the movie, I really did. I wanted this movie to live up to the hype ... but unfortunately it fell flat. If you're looking for another scary Asian movie theater, I recommend Audition, Shutter, A Story of Two Sisters, Strange Circus and Marebito - all of which is more my palette.
