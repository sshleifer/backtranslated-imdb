I love Ustinov's distinctive, educated narrative. And the photography is pretty nice. We filmed the movie for our 3,5-year-old, who somehow wandered into the room. On our first visit, we only saw about a third of the movie and were pretty enchanted. When we looked around again as we sat down for family time, we were all offended by the violence and life-threatening situations that the poor otter had come to. About halfway through the movie, there are a few dead, bloody fur animals. Lots of blood, not just a bit. Then, in the end, there is a wild fight with a dog, then the water blurs the blood. You would think, given the G-rating, that's all you'll see ... that they let one of the animals die. Nope. They pull the carcass out of the water and show it for several seconds. Personally, I love horror movies as an adult and I'm fine with violent movies like Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Heck, I love the ultra violent Battle Royale. But these are not children's films and do not advertise as such. If you're intentionally raising your boys to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. However, if you are like me and my wife, you may want to spare and avoid the nightmares of your child.
