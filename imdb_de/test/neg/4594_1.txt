Where does "Bacon" begin the true story of Richard Speck, a murderer of eight nurses in the 1960s? Director Keith Walley has worked on some of the most affordable full-moon releasing films (such as Birth Rite) and is working on a script written by full moon director Don Adams (at the time). While the film seems like an exact portrayal of the terrible crime, unfortunately the script is not that great, maybe because the real bacon wobbles were not particularly interesting! Despite the care taken to provide authentic authentication, this leads to a cheap redemption of the well-known cinematic serial killers of the same period (such as "Ed Gein"). In a filthy, brown, not quite sepia-filmed movie, mostly told by Star Doug Cole, the movie can not portray the horror of the crime, since the story is irritating and distracts the color from the story and the crime, although cruel and disturbing to see, that's just that and there seems to have been no editorial work on a camcorder that has pretty bad quality at the events. There is no study of the motivation or life of bacon really, just a cheap shot at a cruel crime. Published by Full Moon, there is little evidence that Full Moon achieves better results here. Charles Band ignores his own rule that his films contain fantasy killings (such as puppets, monsters, etc.) and do not know exactly what to do with this new reality. Incidentally, Band has introduced a special label called "Shadow Entertainment" for these films. The band has said that he regrets the time of full moon production alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J. R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The Tempe era features a unified Apple Mac cut and brutal handheld camera shots that resemble a home theater. Bacon retains these qualities and while Witchouse 3 used them well, for example, bacon is just boring and disgusting.
