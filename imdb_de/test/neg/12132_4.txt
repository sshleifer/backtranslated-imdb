1st seen Apr 30, 2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts, but it was not a worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled parody of the 1950s, in which Johnny Depp played the title role. This movie is similar to what he did with the parody of the '60s titled "Hairspray," but this movie is not that effective. Some of the pieces are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like style, and the depictions are good, though sometimes exaggerated. The story is similar to the movie "Grease", in which there is a good group and a bad group. The guy from the bad group, Cry Baby, is a girl from the good group. The good girl then joins the bad group, but as soon as Cry Baby hurts her, she falls back into the good group. This only determines the end when Cry Baby tries to win her back. Well, one difference that is expected in Waters films is that the bad group does not always seem so bad and the good group looks as if it has a pole in it. I definitely saw it in Hairspray, too. The crazy and dumbfounding is not really much fun in this movie and just makes us feel that the movie could have been a lot better. The main incentive of the Johnny Depp character is that at various times he can roll a tear across his cheek (and thus his namesake) and drop the women for him. This is overused and the bottom line is that the movie is okay, but not great.
