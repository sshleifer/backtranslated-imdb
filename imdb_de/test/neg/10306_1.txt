I am very open-minded. I look at all sorts of programs ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and to learn from the good and bad sides. This show had potential to be good. But my God, what did the authors, the casting director and the director think? The performers are terrible ... with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers) and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) who occasionally get good lines for the best performance of the game. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast kills the show. It's the same story in every episode. Sam has plans to do something. His boss interrupts these plans by assigning ridiculous work projects to him. Then the foolish way Sam tries to satisfy both in a way that's mostly stupid and has no real intelligent humor. This is EVERY episode. It gets very exhausting. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they give the eye candy. The 2 "hot" girls in the show are being advertised (but the brother remains? Please explain the casting cut). I can see why they wrote them down ... they did not really matter ... but they did not add anyone to replace them. <br /> <br /> The cocky Derek Tricolli character gets a consistent look of Season 2. His acting (as well as everyone else) is similar to many poor sitcoms of the 80s ... maybe it was funny back then ... but now painful. <br /> <br /> The show could have been so much better a few good writers and some people who had the talent to perform them. This show is missing everything. The production quality is the only good aspect of the show. That's great ... unfortunately the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My God. FOX, was there really nothing better to choose from? I stick to shows like "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock". The bar should be set by programs like these, which actually assume that the audience is intelligent and does not constantly drool on themselves, using all their brain power to breathe on.
