This movie was a big disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot and the hurried introduction of a rather lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie all loose ends. Unfortunately not. More action holes were added than resolved and more confused than clarified. The animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic conspiracy, a boring backdrop (most of the film does not take place in the boring world of World War II in the alchemy world) and a disappointing end (Ed is for the Rest of his world useless days in a world without alchemy, and he digs Winry?), It was quite weak overall. Do yourself a favor - ignore the last half of the anime as well as this movie and read the manga.
