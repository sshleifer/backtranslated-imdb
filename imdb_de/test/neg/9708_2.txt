Well, Wright may have depicted life around 1800 in a grainy way - as he repeats and anal repeats because it was written and not published - but it is HIS and not Austen and should not claim to be an adaptation. <br /> Mrs. Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a spoiled woman - they have servants (remember the book scene where the servant is dressing his hair, etc.)? But Wright portrays her with rough, reddened skin on her chest, rough hands, and work in the kitchen. And the pigs that wander! If he wants to be bucolic, he should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett - the script is too cuddly and modern, ignoring the weakness in it. The scene in which he stops playing Mary is meant to frighten you - not in seconds. If not, do not add it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in the game and seems to be a kind of pride of numbers in acting. The first suggestion looks like a nervous schoolboy and not like a man overcoming his pride in making a suggestion under his station. In most of his lines, he might as well read a grocery list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is terrible. Completely exaggerated with excessive yelling and skipping. In fact, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling, crazy character that Lydia actually contains in the book. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Half the time, Knightley clearly mimics Ehle's voice and intonation-close your eyes to see what kind of copy it is. And in her role, you see Wright's big mistake - there is NO PREMATURE. From the first encounter with Darcy she likes him clearly. When he comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of women in the hall, she looks at first injured - not shocked and insulted. The latter should set the prejudices of things. And when she and 'caroline' run around in the room, she seems curious about him, obviously over him. And if you put Wickham out of the way, you will not get enough money to pinpoint the prejudicial aspects of that relationship. <br /> <br /> And apparently it's Caroline, not Miss Bingley. And Mr. Bingley walks happily in Jane's bedroom. And and and and - Wright can boast of how tall he is with the period he wants. But a few panoramic images of country life (showing the preference for Hardy) do not apologize for the grim blunders everywhere. <br /> <br /> The cameraman - who clearly wants awards - should intervene He switched between Bronte and Hardy throughout the movie - and were not Tess's last suggestions / lighting? The need to see Darcy walking through the countryside with unkempt shirts was stupid. But above all - when they switch between these two very different landscapes, they forget the most important - Austen. (She would have laughed loudly at Elizabeth = sad, so = rain going through to painterly stupidity and wet Darcy garbage) book as context. I was ready to give some scope, as the story had to be created in a short time. But completely forgetting half the core of the book in prejudice and making Darcy more and more outraged than proud made it almost unsurpassable. I could only see it as a mess of generally poor performances (if Knightley did not babble or jump to Ehle or do both and only calmed down a few times to show that she promised something - but seems to exaggerate on swings Emotion is not a substitute for a bad script and a bad direction) - although some were just a bad script. <br /> <br /> Tom Holland alone would escape censorship. While weakening the funny aspects of Collins a bit, he took a very interesting approach. Dench does what she can do in her sleep, whether here or in Oscar Wilde - but that should not be Lady Catherine De Bourgh's Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sensible. <br /> <br /> The shortened length could have been handled safely by a competent scriptwriter? No characters filling story gaps and helping audiences everywhere. Elizabeth could not come up with the Â£ 10,000. And while she wanted to reduce the time with her knowledge of Darcy's involvement in Wickham's marriage, the lines did not suit Lydia. It was the worst case of an incompatible representation in the play. <br /> <br /> It's really awful stuff. Anyone who discusses it and says that it works well in the context of the book is someone I honestly did not read or understand the characterizations in the matter. Wright seems to believe his characters were not the 1709s of their behavior in the 1990s. I'm not convinced that he read the book - he certainly does not understand it. He does not understand Austen's bitter joke or lightness - he has certainly made a stupid joke out of it. What was perhaps worse was the sad, miserable need of the lovers who set fire to the chicks. I love you, I love you everywhere, so that you can sigh and dismount. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Who can only watch it as a movie? Well, harder for me, unless I notice the bad acting, the faint Darcy and the noisy skipping nuisance of the whole thing. If you adapt, you can change a lot - but if it loses the mind and the main motivations, do not insult the book by taking its title.
