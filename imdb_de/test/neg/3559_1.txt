This was the most horrible movie I had to go through. 30 minutes after the movie and I could not stand it anymore. Seriously, do not worry unless you're a sentimental nut work or one of those pseudo-arty types who like this kind of tripe to feel more sophisticated. Boring, though the acting is good; The child is just irritating. Some scenes are a bit strange with very funny close-ups. I do not know why they made the whole movie in black and white, but whatever they hoped would have failed hopelessly. There was just nothing to see, and although it's a sad story, supposedly, it's just so stupid that it's hard to feel sympathy for the characters.
