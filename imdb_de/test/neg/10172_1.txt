This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's being marketed as sci-fi, though it's actually nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool. <br /> <br /> It tells a lot about the state of the Christian church when they have to resort to fraud just to hear the sales arguments. In turn, what do you expect from an organization that makes so much effort to protect so many child molesters in its organization? <br /> <br /> Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviance, hypocrites. and warmongers. We must not forget that our limping former president actually came out saying that "God told him" that he should invade Iraq. And nobody asked if he heard voices or saw things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the topic. No, this movie has nothing to do with UFOs, it's nothing but a religious production.
