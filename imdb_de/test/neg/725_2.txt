Others mentioned the inhuman dialogue in this series and I agree with that. <br /> <br /> If mother and daughter really were so astute, they should be queen and princess of the universe and not hang around in a small town. <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch a few episodes, but when Stakkato's funny pop culture drum-mumbling begins, I turn the channel over. <br /> <br /> to see if anything had changed (I was hoping for the better) but no, the same old "we are so smart with our references to pop culture" that I almost barf. <br /> <br /> Long time fans You are not happy with the newer seasons. Maybe you just get ripped off and tired of the rolled-up pablum that never stops.
