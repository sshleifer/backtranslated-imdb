I also borrowed this film from 15 people. NO has finished it. It was so awful. ???????? Not good ... just awful. She sits the whole movie in a chair. She is in a closet. The chair she is sitting in is nice. I can not imagine anything anymore. But 10 lines of text. To print this. My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie. Because he can give it to his friends without worrying about someone calling him back. He passed it around for 10 years as a gag movie. And that's how I got it. Then I tried to get my friends to end this terrible, terrible piece of shit. You could use this in Iraq instead of WATER BOARDING ... PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY CUBA. Makes a great Christmas present.
