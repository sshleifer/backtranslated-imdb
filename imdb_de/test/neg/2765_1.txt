Well-known noir devotees, do not be fooled, this is a stinker ... badly filmed, badly played and there is nothing ... nothing for the movie fan who is looking for another solid B-movie from the goldmine of the 40s and 50s looking for classics. I have tried it due to the relatively high rating of IMDb. There's no hint of taste, but I did not find anything in this movie that I could recommend to other IMDb members. This is a classic example of having seen a movie and the feeling that you have been cheated out of x minutes when it took the movie to its grateful end. Having Alan Ladd on the cover of the DVD / Tape is almost cheating, he is less than two minutes in front of the camera and has almost no dialogues! This is not this weapon for humans ... it's a classic in the lewd sense that the studios are lining up without a budget ... We're all looking for the big ones ... save your time at Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets. .. it is bad!
