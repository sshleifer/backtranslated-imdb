If this movie was just plain bad, that would be okay, the problem is that many take it seriously. To make it short, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no trace, and all the questions asked are not answered. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I visited several times in war-torn African countries and found the local misery and hopelessness on the ground very painful, but still no use). <br /> <br /> - Questions are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are not questions but statements. <br /> <br /> - I'm not a doc filmmaker, but what's the use of addressing the issue of arms smuggling, for example? The only element presented to the audience is the statement of a local reporter. The director does not even bother to show us at least one sequence in which he would wait near the airport to try to find heavily loaded trucks leaving the area immediately after landing. <br /> <br /> - The story of the fish takes less than 5 minutes and is supported only by a sequence in which the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. Did this guy do anything ???? <br /> <br /> - Poverty is shown again and again in endless sequences, but where is the point? You can drive almost anywhere in Africa with a handheld camera and unfortunately take the same pictures. Where are the big news? <br /> <br /> - Filming prostitutes watching and crying images of their murdered friend and prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulation that can be seen on Thrash and on real TV today. <br /> <br /> - The parallel between the famine that has devastated the country with over two million hungry, and the export of fish is absolutely meaningless, dishonest and makes no sense, as the audience is usually against globalization and to manipulate against western feelings. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after a scientist had published a very detailed commentary on the film, which brought a number of journalists who worked for decades in Africa to study some of the details. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The fish waste that has been sun dried and collected by some locals is by no means intended for human consumption, but it is exported for reasonably good money for animal feed purposes , I think I'm not the only one who got the impression that the director is proposing exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> - Poor smuggling is a reality (but where are the big news?) But not the way this film explains the problem. When smuggling the empty planes that land in Mwanza, they actually unload their shipment elsewhere in Africa. Then you go to Mwanza to pick up fish so as not to drain the trip (which means that they actually land empty.) Mwanza ...). <br /> <br /> - People eat fish in the area, contrary to what the movie suggests (about 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people live on it. Good for you! It is a private business of this kind that will one day bring the African countries out of poverty, not Western moans and endless foreign aid. I can not say how shocked I am to see the success of this film!
