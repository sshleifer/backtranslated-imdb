If this is classified as a "real life" of London, the producers must be on a different planet. <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, suicidal, darkest, grubby movie on TV. <br /> <Everybody is fighting, everything has bad undertones, nothing is done for real reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real picture of people in London or the UK, then this program is just the farthest from reality. <br /> <br /> There is not a good word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that there will be a big fight over the Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are absolutely amazing!
