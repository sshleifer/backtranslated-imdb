Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously pretty hard! I was so excited to see that because I loved the original and my friends saw it and told me it was really shit. Well, I finally see it and I was so disappointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave her a 3. Otherwise, she sucked. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job with Norman, he's just too tight or something. I do not know, it was just awful. Do not see it
