I suspected that this was the cat-mouse duo, but it was not something that should not have been done for his time. They disguise the "black face" method because they fly to Africa and even act like Stepin Fetchit and everyone else in one. There are some caricatures that are racist, but they are classics. As a mixed woman, I have the right to say so. However, if you are familiar with the historical aspect of these cartoons, try Merrie Melody's "Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs" or "Angel Puss" You will not find them on DVD because the distributors have promised not to turn them into mainstream but you can find them on a website as YouTube. I do not recommend to young children to see this, but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant, these are better suggestions. Not to mention that this cartoon has a bad animation, I know it was 1932, but I've seen better time for it. <br /> <br /> "Airplane" not required. -1 out of 10.
