Prior to the last call with Carson Daly, my local NBC partner after late night w / Conan broadcast much more rewarding programs such as Second City TV, 3rd Rock of the Sun & Carline in the City, and some stand-up comedy films. Nothing worth seeing these days, because all I can see is Carson Daly and his horrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he is neither a good speaker nor a comedian. In his show on June 21, he tried to use an Internet meme called the "Rickroll" in his show. He failed hard. This event confirms that Carson Daly is terrible.
