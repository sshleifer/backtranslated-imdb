André Roussin was a specialist in what the French call "Theater de Boulevard": plays where you will find the eternal triangle: man / woman / (male or female) lover. Many of his plays gave Elvire Popesco some of her best pieces on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to see her, because Roussin is far from Sacha Guitry. The French audience remembers 'Au Theater Ce Soir'. <br /> <br /> Still with me, Roussin's dramas were not made to be filmed, and this is pretty mediocre material, even if the screenwriters are Lewis Carroll I like Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is a feast for the eyes, but that could be the worst movie, coarse and predictable - even the natives intervention (bola-bola) is ridiculous - a fierce farce around a menage à Trois on a deserted island where Granger would be a sort of Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner his girl.
