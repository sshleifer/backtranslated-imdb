This is one of those movies you see with a group of people. You will have the best time. It's really bad, like showgirls are bad, but without the quality of showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best mix of bad actors, bad director and bad script here. Everything that can be wrong, what makes for an entertaining evening, you have here. The first line is "a number of teenagers ...". These people are as many "teenagers" as my grandmother. The director has no feeling of tension or tension. The 30 year old "teenagers" stand around and the "monster" comes out and attacks. This happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no tension that leads to this surprise or anything. It's more like you were kids pretending to be hunted by monsters, just putting together a few things. And when I use the word "monster", I exaggerate. Rather like a couple of Halloween masks bought at the 0.99-cent store. <br /> <br /> This script was undoubtedly cut off in a few days, no paraphrases and I can only imagine how bad and badly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no idea , This is another example of one of the bad things of today: anyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about this movie is, of course, acting. It's as bad as you can get. There is no person who has the least ability to act, and the lead is the absolute worst. He delivers each line in that monotonous fashion without any expression, and you have to wonder how someone who is so bad can play a role in any movie, regardless of who he knows. When he had to "cry" killing his girlfriend, this was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It's very funny to see these people reciting some of the terrible dialogues. But when the black man said before his death scene, "Tell her ... tell her ... I love her ...", there was a big laugh in our group. Funny, funny stuff. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this film will be rated bad enough to take its place where it belongs: in the IMDb with 100 films. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. Is it any surprise that the one "great" comment this film got here came from someone in Virginia (who has just commented on this movie and nothing else)? And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I've said it before and I'll say it again: People who work on the film are NOT allowed to comment.
