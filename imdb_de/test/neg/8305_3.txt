Low budget, but still scary enough to spark your interest in another start of the well-known Frankenstein story. This movie is also called LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The seductive Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay), fresh from the medical school, arrives at her father's estate and realizes he's still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by creating a lover for himself. This is more of an eerie melodrama than a horror movie. The cast includes Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could enhance the atmosphere. Still a funny clock.
