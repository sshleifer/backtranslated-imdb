This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen (nothing from or with Pauly Shore). I could not believe that a movie THIS could be bad! <br /> <br /> Coolio must be the only worst actor (again without Pauly Shore) who ever became a star in a movie. The temptation to press the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact, I would have been inclined to press that on a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR.) Prefer and do something more interesting than this Movie, z. For example, watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV.
