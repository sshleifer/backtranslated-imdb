Excuse me, but this work by director Peter Hall is terrible. If you can not come to the conspiracy, why not kill a cat or dog. That certainly reaches the audience. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. And believe me, I saw it coming, before she opened the package. How predictable you can become. Take a cute animal and kill it in a cruel way. I've never been a fan of De Mornay and this feat tells me why. Overclocking and a bit stagnant in the interpretation, I found them rather stupid and definitely boring. I liked Banderas, but felt he had to play against De Mornay. In other films, in "Philadelphia," where he had some sincerity in dialogue, he has done much better. In this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real. But the writers Green & Rush have prevented this with their banal plot and their threadbare dialogue well. Please do not let us face this kind of entertainment. Some of us are not deceived by crazy conspiracies, clumsy animals and generally lengthy conversations. Seeing her get away made me angry.
