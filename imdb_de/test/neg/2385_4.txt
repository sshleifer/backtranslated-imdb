What we are trying to do in this trendy movie is a "frat-pack" of college friends who are now almost 30 years old (which we all know, of course, that their generation thinks of as a "new 20"). Consisting of four men and one girl, we've come across the following types: Seemingly "unemployed" and frequent drug users, along with a person who has a successful job and is trying to be. They all swim in their own way, while at the same time trying to find a future and an emotional happiness. With one, possibly two exceptions, these are people to whom the reviewer will certainly never approach. There is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all her life. Except in the case of a person (who appears on the way to their search), no person in their lives seems to be focused on emotional gratification. The only sincere moment in this film is so when a knock on the door of the responding person brings in an unexpected and heartfelt "I love you". <br /> <br /> With just the exceptions mentioned, these individuals It's the sort that hardly deserves or deserves to be thrown away by hundreds of thousands of dollars in portraying their stories. --- without such problems in presenting longer and revealing heterosexual. Why could that be? <br /> <br /> ****
