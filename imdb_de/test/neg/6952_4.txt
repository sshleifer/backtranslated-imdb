Not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trash / cult genre is beautiful. Unfortunately, this film is full of originality and the performances do not meet the trash standards. The Creator's intention to make him a cult seems to have failed. Trash movies are trash movies because it happens. You can not create these types of movies for this purpose. I do not know if Mr. Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name), BUT if he is, I wonder why ... <br /> <br /> Terrible. Even the lesbian scenes are pathetic, so fans of erotic X-Ploitation movies will not be satisfied, as there are thousands of movies better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
