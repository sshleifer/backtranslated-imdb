I can not think of anything, I repeat, EVERYTHING positive about this "movie"! The entire 1-hour 45-minute movie could be shrunk down to a short 5-minute movie! There is absolutely nothing going on in most of the scenes, and it seems like only the camera has been intentionally shot just to extend the time of the movie! All you see is someone in the background walking around or watching TV without a specific topic, or even talking about it! I just have the feeling that I wasted 105 weeks of my weekend, my family and my friends in vain! If a movie is done badly or the scenario is not great, that's a whole different story. At least there's something to talk about, but with DISTANT, I just have to call it "movie" because it's a movie shot by a camera. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, imagine a 105-minute movie based on two or three lines. What will you end? 5% content and 95% fillers! Exactly so was "Distant" at least for us! Actors did a great job as actors who had nothing special, they barely spoke or showed any special emotions! I found this movie in the comedy department of a shop and relied on what I read on the back of the cover. I still wonder what was funny in this movie, except our face.
