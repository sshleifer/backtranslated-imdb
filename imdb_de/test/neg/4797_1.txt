I watched this movie about Matchstick Men, in fact I bought the tickets for Matchstick Men and went to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, thrills, jungle and exotic locations. They had all that, but also many films with a sense of history. <br /> <br /> All I can say is WHY, WHY, WHY did not they just make it a pure narrative rather than a juicy flashback story. <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies I've seen the movie from: Of course, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, the old Tom Selleck movie of the 80s, bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (Using Digital Extras). <br /> <br /> PS The only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character blows her space up.
