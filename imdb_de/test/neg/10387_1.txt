This film had very few moments of a real drama. After the first few minutes, the film spiraled into a spiral that did not quite bring us to hell, and viewing was, to say the least, a pure purgatory. The drama was more horrible than the theme of the movie and sometimes I could not stop laughing. The continuity between some scenes was bleak - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation, only to be replaced by other characters who had been elsewhere minutes earlier. That was certainly a parody of The Exorcist. The collector's plate in the church must have been full of copper the day Mr. Russo registered for it. I speak Latin Et tu Brutus.
