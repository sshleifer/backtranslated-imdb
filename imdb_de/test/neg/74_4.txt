Unfortunately, talented scriptwriter Alvin Sargent can not get riveting ideas in this trivial matter that a wayward mother and her teenaged mature daughter tried to bring her life to life despite the fleeting behavior of her mother in Los Angeles. Apart from some good sequences, I did not quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to deliver her as a devilish nurse), and her naturally grounded personality does not fit well as an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman is doing a lot better than her child, yet her work is uncannily restrained (and some of her scenes, such as calling for a boy to strip her are misguided and uncomfortable). Certainly not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it's not an upgradeable movie and has not proven to be an important movie. ** from ****
