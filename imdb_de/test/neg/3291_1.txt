They've seen the same tired, worn-out cliched sit-com stories, characters and stories a thousand times. First and foremost, there is not a single character on this show who is likeable even from a distance ... especially Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the biggest asses ever to be seen on a TV screen ... disgusting. If, in real life, a father were so unlikely, cruel, and generally unfit for parents ... Brotherhood would be the only option. To label the remaining characters as stereotypes would be too complementary. If these characters were life-sustaining, the lead to pull the plug would be light-years long. As this show has finished a complete season, less a 2 is a mystery. FOX stops "Arrested Development" and keeps it in the air ??? They tell me that the terrorists do not win.
