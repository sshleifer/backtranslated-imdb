The White Warrior is definitely one of the, if not Steve Reeves weakest films. Set in the 18th or 19th century in Russia (??) Steve plays a Cossack warrior trying to run over a crazy Russian tsar by running up a mountain landscape with his rebel band in a dull looking white and red tunic. The great Reeves body is mostly hidden in a stupid, knee-length tunic, with an even gloomier Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is rather minimal, with just a good mid-waist wrestling scene showing the great Reeves physique. This is an obvious attempt by the producers to bring Reeves from the Sword and Sandals genre to a different historical era with poor results. The dialogue from the script is difficult to understand in several places, and only the commentary of the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. I'd imagine Reeves had regretted this movie, but to try to get out of his toga, sandals and grandstand armor, he helped lead him to other historical characters like Morgan the Pirate and The Thief of Baghdad.
