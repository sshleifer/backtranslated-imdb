This movie is supposedly based on a nonfiction book. I am not sure which book the scriptwriters have read to write their adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of Frances Mayes in Italy. Instead, it's an uninteresting story that requires freedoms everywhere to beat men. Consider the following examples: <br /> <br /> ******************************* **** ********************************** <br /> <br /> SPOILER DETAILS <br /> < br /> * ************************************************************************************** ****** *************** <br /> <br /> Bash number one: Lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash number two: Lane ventures into an Italian city and is promptly asked by every man on the street. <br /> <br /> Bash number three: Lane is rescued by a charming gentleman from the horny townspeople. She falls in love with him after spending an afternoon full of love games. Later she learns that he is already connected to her and is cheating on her. <br /> <br /> Bash number four: You need to broaden your horizons as the cover is definitely included in the movie. Her lesbian couple friends opt for a baby through invetro (SP?) Insemination. I am told that in most lesbian relationships there is one person taking the female role and another the male role. After the female is pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to pull herself out of the relationship because she can not handle it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie has nothing to do with the relationship book it is supposed to be based on.
