This movie has been advertised in Greece for over three months as the largest Greek production of all time. Well, it could be, but ... When you hear about a big production, you expect something new, something different. What you can see here is a movie without reason of existence. George Corraface looks like he did not really enjoy this movie. His acting is so simple that it looks almost amateurish. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (called?), Is full of hisses. Fortunately, the few special effects that Istanbul and Athens showed in the late '50s and early' 70s are more like digital painting than computer graphics. After all, we see the same boy from 1959 (5 years) to 1968 (14 years), but miraculously, five years later, he becomes a teenager. <br /> <br /> So much for "the biggest Greek production". At least one would think that there is an interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. And all you get is a love story between 7-year-olds who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there is a political side too. A few ironic remarks about the Greek "junta" of '67 -'74, so childish that they seem almost forced. <br /> <br /> There are of course some good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, especially Ierokli's Michaelidis, the very good scenery and the great music of Evanthia Remboutsika; But there are so few for such expensive production. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Is it that bad, a movie? To tell the truth, I do not know. All I know is that at no time does it justify its huge budget (for Greek standards).
