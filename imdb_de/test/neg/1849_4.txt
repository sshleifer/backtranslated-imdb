INFERNO starts off with a pretty impressive effect for a TVM Starscape effect. We also met a scientist called Heller. Do not you understand? Brighter, hell-he, inferno. I think someone in production had some intelligence. However, as the TVM progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that the intelligence was discarded throughout the storyline to address an American TVM audience the tough liberal schoolteacher trying to save a houseboy from a crime, the medical doctor In fact, the story focuses much more on these characters than on the impending disaster, that all the potential tensions and drama that the scenario may have triggered in a cloud of smoke soon will rise. <br /> <br /> There's a problem I noticed on the screen and there's an explosion every time. There is a huge fireball that looks ridiculous and physically impossible. Look at the scene where the National Guard is fighting with a gang. A soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fireball. What can a little Greanade that contains only a few ounces of explosive, that! No, that will not work. There is also another scene where army engineers blow up a dam with plastic explosives and the same fireball effect can be seen. Can directors please note that explosives are not the same as napalm. <br/> <br /> After I said that I find INFERNO highly observable for a TVM and at no time did I want to turn it off. It had some potential and I would like to reiterate that the special effects are quite good given the budget and it is not so bad for a TVM as some people suspect
