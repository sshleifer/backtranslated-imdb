I could not believe the original rating I found when watching this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it looks like I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow and really boring. One of the sad things is that if the movie was rated with a realistic rating of about 5 or 6, then the expectation would not have been that high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case. When I look at the movie and see the bad story and the acting, I behave with a 3/10 score. <br /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is great at Lock stocks and also Snatch, and he plays a big tough guy, but he should stick to that role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger made comedy movies, they just do not work. <br /> <br /> He also can not be the lead actor, he plays better as a supporter or in some other way. When he plays Lead, his acting talents are "in sight" and are not really good. Mean Machine is another good example of this.
