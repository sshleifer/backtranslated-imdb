An art teacher encounters an antique wooden bed of gingko trees and places it in his home, but it has a terrible history and it is hunted down by an ancient ghost that takes its human form by ripping people's hearts apart. <Br /> <br /> This beautifully crafted horror? Well, actually it's more fantasy / romance than anything else, which creates a little shiver and delivers stunning images, but the plot was barely interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any life. The problem was that I spent most of my time keeping my finger away from the fast-forward button. It certainly would have sped up the slow pace of the movie, but on the other hand, I would not know too much about what was going on, which was pretty hard to understand or even made the interest in the first place. Performances ranged from too melodramatic or just boring, probably due to the fact that these characters are not convincing, obsolete and coma-inducing. The real backstory of the old bed and the ghosts is incredibly boring and messy, with too much focus on a bland romanticism, laughable when it should not be, and overall it's built in an ordinary way that lacks performance or conviction to wear the film. What balances the shortcomings of the story are really artistic pictures that look great, but the use of some pictures has somewhat baffled me about what they actually mean to the movie. What you notice is the faded color scheme, but sometimes the screen would look really grainy or snowy. This results in the raw intensity of the production valves, but it also adds some nice polished effects that go well with the soothing but sometimes restless score. The camera work was quite varied (though it did not add too much to the function), but in some of the more exciting scenes, there were too many close-ups or dark lights that made it hard to understand what you were seeing. Also shown are some beautiful moments of blood and blood, which are not clearly great or distinguishable from most other films. Lethargic strange film, with glowing images that look like something from a painting, but still is not particularly tempting. Careful, it could put you in a deep trance!
