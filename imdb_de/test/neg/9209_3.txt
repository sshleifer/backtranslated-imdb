The film begins with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who is finishing his lunch in a neighborhood neighborhood deli. It seems he does not have enough money to cover the check. Instead of reaching for his plastic, he stealthily looks around to see if the coast is clear and escapes without paying. Apart from Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) had been watching him from the other side of the delicatessen. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" has a brunette side that was considered cool in the '80s -boy cut follows him to let him know she saw what he did. He tries to refuse, but can not escape their accusation. He believes he is there. Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says she does not work for the deli and then offers him a drive to work. <br /> <br /> When she walks in the opposite direction, her over the Central Atlantic Coast begins to romp. <br /> <br /> We're supposed to be updated because "Lulu" puts straightforward Charlie in humiliating situations. It's fine if the two adults who agreed to get a bit confused in a motel room, but disgusting if they can not pay the check in a family restaurant. Stealing the work of hard-working people is not my idea of ​​"wild". Charlie is an idiot. <br/> <br/> "Lulu" is an idiot. She begins to betray Charlie as her husband. First to her mother (who willingly tolerates the charade) and then to her auspicious 10-year reunion (an event later used by another too cool movie, "Grosse Pointe Blank"). <br /> <br /> The "marriage" surprises the real husband of "Lulu" (Ray Liotta), who has just been released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is. I can not add irony by writing that I first saw this by sneaking in the cinema. No, I do not do that. I've taped it off the cable TV and assure you that I see it strictly in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br /> So I had to think about why I recorded it, if I do not like it very much, and finally, I was on a reggae kick 20 years ago and the soundtrack of "Something Wild" contains prominently reggae. The credits begin with the enjoyment of Sister Carol, who performs her version of "Wild Thing".
