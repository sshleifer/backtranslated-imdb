Oh boy. Films like these really bother me. If this film came close to the truth, I assume that Rommel knew Hitler for a while before the Second World War began. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed before. Well, I can not imagine that Rommel would have known anything about Hitler's government policy, so Rommel must be guilty of German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life tragic in the end. He has made his decisions and we have to feel bad for him? I can not do it. Nor can I buy the theory that if the more competent generals could go to war, the Allies would have more difficulty winning the war. If more competent people had taken the responsibility, the Second World War might never have begun. From film to film, the film jumps from place to place and most of the time it seems to be a story in which well-known actors play the historical roles. Leo G. Carroll did some good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without the ridiculous accents. But not very important otherwise.
