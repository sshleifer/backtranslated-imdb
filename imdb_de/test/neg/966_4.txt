This 3-hour TV miniseries was brought home by Blockbuster this weekend. The production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (especially Bridget Fonda) and special effects (including a big Jim Henson talking polar bear and reindeer). They would have had to spend a little more money to get a coherent script. The story was so laid-back that it really never came together. You can overlook Irish German Germans, but not excited storytelling. With pointless loose ends, which included a special guest appearance of the devil, this is certainly not a Christmas classic. Too bad that they were wasting good performances of the two female leads.
