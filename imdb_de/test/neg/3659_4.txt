Maybe I've seen a tidy version, but aside from a few breasts, I'm not sure what nudity these other commentators refer to. All in all, not as bad as I expected from the previous comments, although the end leaves you asking ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you could not see the scenes, and I think it only added to the weirdness and horror of the situation. <br /> <br /> Film quality could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent. All in all a decent scary (and yes, brutal) movie with a disappointing ending.
