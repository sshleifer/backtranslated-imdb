The basic idea of ​​ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent - two very unhappy women meet and decide to put their money together to rent an Italian villa for a month. To cover the costs further, two more strangers are added. What makes it interesting is the relationship before and during the holidays - especially to show how this beautiful environment changes your life prospects. Unfortunately, this good idea is spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble that are so bad that they ruin the movie. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her look ridiculous. Her "doe-eyed" expression and her blank looks really let you know if it's not a zombie movie or if she's just an idiot! And worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so abominable and bombastic that I was about to turn off the movie - it was so terrible and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer rated this film 10 - which is very difficult to understand. Sure, the movie has a great ambience and good plot, but these two gruesome stupid performances can not be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. I'm sorry, but this movie has been longing for a new release!
