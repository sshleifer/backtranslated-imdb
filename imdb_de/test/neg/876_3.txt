The lonely, unconnected middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks comfort to reflect on her immediate future. In a sort of bed and breakfast by the sea (well, literally in the sea), which for some strange reason goes down for the owner. Enter the lonely, arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest in the inn in the sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You will never suspect that these two fall in love immediately. A tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense. The locations, photography are fine. Gere is still one of the most rated actors in the cinema and does not disappoint. Ms. Lane must have needed the money, but the phones in her part with grace.
