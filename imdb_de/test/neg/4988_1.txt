When the cartoon's underdog debuted in 1964, at the age of 7, I was instantly hooked. He was in my book Top Dog (pun intended) (ie until Batman premiered ABC about a year later). Even as it became clear that Disney would be doing a live-action version of the once-beloved cartoon on Saturday morning, it was equally clear to me that it would be a piece of crap. Even reading the reviews in the newspapers seemed to confirm this. However, I've pointed out the following: a) Never try to write a review unless I've watched the movie from start to finish. and b) not spend a red cent on a movie that I'm almost sure I'm going to hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube: a) am fully qualified to write this review; and b) it took me only 84 minutes of my hard earned time. <br /> <br /> This also proves my point, namely, that this movie is not just a piece of crap. It is a steaming heap of dog feces. It resembles the TV series only in name, although they have done almost everything right with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> All in all, underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately I have not found t have to spend. <br /> <br /> rating: 1/2 * by *****
