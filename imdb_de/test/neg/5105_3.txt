I was prepared for a bad movie, and it's a bad movie. I think I should not complain. Twentysomething Tom (the gay poster boy Robert Stadlober) has so many problems that he does not know if he's coming or going. I would have stayed just for the pretty girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); No-nonsense Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann star of the film in the film. And then there's Tom's soulmate, wild Margarete (Jana Pallaske). It reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are nice memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and I even mean ridiculous, even for Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I had the ages of the characters. I suppose I would not do it. Pay attention to the indie idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder of "The Dog Marie", who act as street musicians and feel no pain.
