I have just watched this movie and found it largely as a waste of time with little or no salvation factors. I really do not understand where the positive reviews came from - the animation is awkward and unrefined, the plot makes no sense from an objective point of view, and there is no sense of intrigue or tension in what is trying to be an exciting and exciting movie. I've never read the book before, so I can not say if the movie was true, but like most film adaptations, trying to stuff so much information in no time is too much. The result is an incoherent and illogical plot in which you understand or understand the characters, or nothing at all. Overall, I felt completely detached from the characters and plot to the point where I could not care what happened to them, and the only way to see how this animation can be considered beautiful is Your normal standard animation is a Scooby Doo cartoon.
