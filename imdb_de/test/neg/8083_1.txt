I thought it would be an OK movie after watching the commercials about it. In some places it was funny and some very uncomfortable. The only person I feel sorry for is Horatio Sans, who got a hot wife cheating on him with other women. But he never had the chance to have a threesome with him until that and that was good, but they should have made the movie even bigger.
