Where should I start? The plot of the film, which deals with the love between two high school students during the war, is a living weapon, and their struggle to uphold that love is a very good action. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi, who was also turned into an anime in 2002, but I still do not have to read or see it. <br /> <br /> This review is about this live action adaptation. Unfortunately, this honest goodness was a terrible movie. It's not as if one could pinpoint certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is wrong, or action is to blame. Unfortunately, it's a series of inscrutable and ineffective elements that bring this film to a standstill. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. Not to mention that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they did not have much to do, and it seemed like a miscast. Neither of them seemed to have the physical reach to pull the viewer into the story and be too distractingly old for his parts. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the leads seem unrealistic and behave irrationally. The film also plays for the hearts and is ultimately predictable, but not compelling, and under-evolves the characters. There are also problems with the stimulation. <br /> <br /> Visually it is inconspicuous. The film uses Green Screen in too many scenes and unnecessarily. The other special effects are also cheap, especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used. There is also no visual flair, as if there were no cameraman or art designer that makes the scenes look consistent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were good but unobtrusive. <br /> <br Overall, the movie is not a treat, and fans of the series should not be discouraged from seeing it at least once just for the sake of completion. People who are not familiar with Saikano, this is probably not the place, because it is not a very good movie or melodrama. It's not the movie or the occupation and crew of the crew, it just is not inspired and that's what it kills.
