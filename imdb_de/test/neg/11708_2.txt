I find that one piece is expensive over time, and that this type of shooting (close-up of the camera, moving camera, large-aperture shooting, washout) allows for the production of such films at a reasonable price. As a style, he has, like everyone else, its advantages and disadvantages. As with any style, there are critics and supporters. There are probably those who believe that this type of shooting has an artistic basis. If only part of the saved money could have been spent on the script For whatever style, a movie needs good writing and good acting. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is usually very good. The font less. It consists of a collection of bits taken from the book, and much of what is relevant to the plot is left out, creating a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity. If you have read the book, under no circumstances be careful. If you have not read the book, are simply satisfied, and have nothing better to do, you can not hurt it, but be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better.
