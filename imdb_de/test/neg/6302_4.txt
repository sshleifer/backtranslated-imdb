"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is always referred to as the masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it pretty disappointing. The lead actors are great - Terence Stamp is aging nicely, Guy Pearce should do more comedy than the gritty roles he chooses, and I'm a fan of Hugo Weaving since I played him eons ago. The cinematography is great, but if you've ever been to the Australian Outback, you know the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that you could have shot it on the film equivalent of a box brownie, and it would still have looked spectacular. <br /> <br /> What is my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no sympathetic female figure throughout the movie. A woman who earns her living at a roadside pub with her ping-pong balls deserves our sympathy. Ticks wife is not treated much better. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scene in which they sing to a group of Aboriginal "I Will Survive" is offensive. Trying to draw some sort of parallel between the battles of drag queens and the trannies and the near-total destruction of Aboriginal culture, which I believe is based on the scene, shows some historical understanding that Paris Hilton is worthy of Last but not least, the movie's biggest mistake is that it's just not funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott really talk to drag queens while writing the movie? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have a rapier-like mind and are not afraid to use it. Well, I can understand that a lot of Drag Queen jokes would probably have rejected the movie, but Elliott should have been able to collect enough "matching material for the kids" to complete his film. <br /> <br /> So all in all a waste of a good idea and a great cast.
