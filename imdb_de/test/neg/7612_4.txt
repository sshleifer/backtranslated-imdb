I found this movie extremely disturbing. Treadwell is insane and disturbed, so he probably suffers from a mental illness. The material shown is he and not an actor, but it shows behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show recent pictures of a suicide? Let us not chop up words. The film shows shots of behaviors that led directly to his death. <br /> <br /> If you think Treadwell is some kind of hero, think again. The footage he shot refers to him, not to the bears and foxes he claimed would help. He did not sensibly examine their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. He just ran around in the bush, making sure he was better than everyone else. The reality is that he has put animals at great risk by desensitizing animals to humans. His selfish behavior did not cause his own death, but also the death of his companion Amy plus, who inflicted more damage on his beloved bears and foxes. <br /> <br /> But I'm also worried about the actions of Werner Herzog in putting together film the way he did it. <br /> <br /> A friend and I had long discussions about this movie that loved this movie. He believes that seriously disturbed people provide interesting topics, and cites the movie Downfall as an example. But downfall, they use actors. We have not seen the real Madga Goebells put cyanide capsules in their own children's mouths. <br /> <br /> There was something about using the real material in Grizzly Man, which reminded me of the awful football stadium tragedy that people were in. Crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped decided yourself, just continue to record the horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's footage is more about Treadwell. But Duke has done the same. His own personality and opinions are shown in this documentary, which is probably different. Scenes like the one in which he hears the tape are not required. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We did not need Duke to shed a tear with a former Treadwell friend. It did not contribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> The film showed us that Treadwell was very selfish, but it also showed us that Herzog is just as good.
