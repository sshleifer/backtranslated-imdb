This strip is worse than terrible! It took a good plot and turned it into a schizophrenic cinema. The photography is EXTREMELY amateurish. , , It looks like a 5th grade home theater project shot with faulty 8mm kiddie cameras. , , The cut seems to have been made by someone who had psychotic flashbacks (with drugs and alcohol), with the scenes shortened, followed by other unrelated scenes, and then chopped segments of the inserted scenes. , , completely unnecessary and groundless nudity. , , missing scenes. , , Day scenes that inexplicably turn into night scenes, and then suddenly day again. , , obviously no continuity. Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason's good acting skills are wasted, as well as the talents of the "Key" supporting the cast (forget the villain and the Anderson women - very amateurish drama). This movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. , , Did it professionally this time.
