This movie was played so badly. What about Jeff Bridge's accent, terrible and unbelievable. Should it be French or Scandinavian? The script was lame. To make the hero stumble over her boyfriend's grave while walking in front of the Jeff Bridges character ... Are you kidding me? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel into the house after disposing of bodies on his lawn. Do not these people just believe in calling the cops? Okay ... I'm going in the car with you, why not? MORON! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with having an affair with her father, is her mother angry or just boring? I did not see the original, it would be difficult to look at the movie.
