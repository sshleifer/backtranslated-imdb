After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for all those involved in producing this abysmal film. For one, the story was literally unbelievable and full of incredible stereotypes. The same is of course true for the dialogue, which leads to the lowest common denominator and offers absolutely unpredictable original lines. The drama was also terrible, and Kane showed the most different emotions throughout the movie. Even the use of modern special effects failed, as each prop was easily distinguished from its counterpart in real life. All in all, I would not advise anyone to worry about this feature, as it certainly costs 83 (not even 90!) Minutes of your life.
