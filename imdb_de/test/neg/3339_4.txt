Pretentious Claptrap that brings Herman Melville (!) Up to date on the vague incestuous relationship of a young man to his aristocratic mother being transferred to his Gypsy-raised, long-lost sister. Or something similar ?? Not that it matters to anyone to uncover his multi-layered storyline, which reveals pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (siblings swimming in a river of blood), and other bizarre touches (a gypsy kid keeps pestering passers-by on the street) she is beaten anonymously to death, the deafening music of a rock group used to demolish old buildings. Given the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who bathed at least naked), I expected much more from him; Apparently there is an even longer TV version of POLA X out there ??
