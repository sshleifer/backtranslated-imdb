There is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men. You can see it in TV commercials and program plots. Scammers are a great example. You could find many female cheats, but the vast majority are men. Why? The main threat to the power of a government lies in the male population. They are less authority and more of a physical combat threat. One way to reduce the threat is to dismiss men in society through the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are thrillers full of self-righteous policemen, including aggressive, big-clawed women who accuse anyone they question, trample on their rights, and make these men feel like scum. In Australia, many top male sports stars have recently been arrested for doubtful assaults and tipping. Another example of how the government controls male populations by arresting their heroes and claiming dominance. Fraudsters are, apart from the political machinations, a violation of privacy and a violation of the rights, in addition, most of these women attack the men! If it were the other way around, the men would be in prison !! If it were an honest show, they would find female cheats because they would not normally get caught because their male lover are quite happy to fight without difficulty and not rock the boat. Men's lovers want the men for themselves and want to own and control the men and so still let the men get caught.
