I've seen this movie over and over since it came out. I was fifteen and even then I knew it was cheesy. There was so much potential and I'm constantly writing the script in my head. The Capoeira ruined what could have been a good drama. I loved the fact that was shot on site. Too bad that the characters were underdeveloped. It's like writing a first draft of a script and then shooting the movie right away. At fifteen, I could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogues seemed to come out of nowhere and you had many unanswered questions. And was it just me, or did it seem like Lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena has grown into a kind of woman!" And the way he always touched her. Had an interesting conspiracy of action, Elena, who works for her drug dealer who is also a pervert. Too bad they missed the point on this one.
