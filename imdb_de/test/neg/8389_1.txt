This movie was so bad that it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera tilts slowly and gradually down and then moves up again. The sound is crisp and sometimes disappears. In another scene, the cameraman is only visible in a mirror. Then came the scene with instructions on how to put down a tent ... which, I believe, lasted forever and was completely irrelevant to the plot Most of the scenes grated with conversations that were also not quite relevant. In my opinion, these were just to fill in the movie and make it longer. Although these scenes were added, it was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was the severed head, which looked pretty realistic.
