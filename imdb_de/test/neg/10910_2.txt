Certain filmmakers can not go wrong in the eyes of national critics. This is one reason why you should never pay attention. This movie is a perfect example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") who she cares for the summer and relationships with some men. It's talking, talking, talking and more talk. <br /> <br /> For those who look at the cover and hope to be thrilled, there are some quick nudity shots and a few swear words, but otherwise it's a harmless game of French morality. A friend of mine lent me this band. He thought he would get a sexy French movie and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because it was so boring. <br /> <br /> How this becomes such great reviews is almost unfathomable.
