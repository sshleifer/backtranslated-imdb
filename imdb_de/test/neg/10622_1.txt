This movie made me bang my head against the wall. It's hard to compare such bad things with anything, but some say that watching this movie is like bleeding under the fingernails. And this comment comes from the cousin of the author. This movie was so bad that "Hulk" (the second worst movie of all time) looked like "The Departed" (one of the best films in film history). If you like boring family movies with predictable plotlines, you'll absolutely love this movie. If you have a brain, you definitely will not do it. When I rented this movie, I actually fell asleep watching it. The next day I ended it where I left off and it was the worst decision of my life.
