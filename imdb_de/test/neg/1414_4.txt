I liked the understated character Laura Linney played in "Love Actually" and she is very good at "Man of the Year". <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams does not give much performance, with a few minor exceptions this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been a misstep, but either the editorial staff raped her character or it was just a sad idea of ​​director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson who was getting old. So many weak achievements, such uneven results must be the fault of the management. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side of lust, and Walken's combination of entertainer manager and commentator on the film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But the story is a cliché, the presentation seems to have been like a very good picture and too many actions are half-hearted. The pace, the story and the direction are all weak compared to "Head Office" (spoof of "Secret of My Success").
