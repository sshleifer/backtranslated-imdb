The digital effects have been made cheap and the action sequences are dead. This was essentially done for television and it shows. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Planner looks embarrassed on the right! As for Robert Carlyle's Dick Van Dyke London accent, no comment! If you want to pass an hour or two if you do not touch anything, it will work. If you want to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and pick it up in the Asda bin, because that's where it goes! If the budget was bigger and Richard Doyle's book followed more closely, it could have been something special, but it's a bit miserable. Look at the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what could have been.
