Today, I had a real desire for a science fiction movie and decided to go for Battlespace. Unfortunately this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that director Neil Johnson has made over 500 music videos and I suggest he come back to that. Music videos are an absolutely good form of entertainment, and not everyone can cut movies. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is probably the voice. And that says a lot, because the special effects are sometimes appalling. Voice-over did not work in Blade Runner, and it does not work here. In the first hour, the main character will walk through the desert while her daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a great movie, but not like that. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are just bad and do not fit into the rest of the picture, so you just do not believe in them. And absolutely all pictures in the movie were filtered and not in a good way. Filtering as an effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad. <br /> <br /> And what about all those gadgets that talk all the time and do not shut up!?!? If I had used such technology, I would have gone crazy. I was just waiting for the guns to pop out, "I'm very sorry, but I think the ammo went out." No, stay away. This movie is just not worth the time.
