The achievements are better than the rating I gave to this work, simply because I do not support a film that shows every child or person with a mental disability how to get, cook and inject narcotic drugs. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting film that serves no purpose in the world but seeks to glorify and legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It has convincing performances that contribute to my disgust. What did these people think ?! I could not enjoy a movie like this. Suffice it to get someone who has never used drugs to think about it, and those who have redeemed and considered themselves are considering withdrawing. I'm surprised it does not make every clean junkie who sees it fall off the car. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this "movie" that is more than a How To Get Out Of Strength-Out documentary theater. This is the epitome of what's wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting. <br /> <br /> It gets a 1.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend rated:.
