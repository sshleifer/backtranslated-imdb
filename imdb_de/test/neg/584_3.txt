Although Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I have to say that their attempt to make movie films was neglected by Hal Roach. Why did Roach have to choose the Civil War, which undergoes all the concomitant racism that would follow. <br /> <br /> Raging southern cavalier Phillips Holmes accidentally picks up the young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky makes a card cheat visible on a river boat. In the Old South, everything is calm and laid back, and then the civil war ruins it for everyone. <br /> <br /> But even children can charm the worst in the world, and there is no worse than these damn Yankees. They just go south and ruin it for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although it was criticized for its Southern standpoint, Gone With The Wind has set out a good case for the Southern cause and the Blacks, though they are as servile as they would have wanted out of necessity yet three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it was not. Butterfly McQueen's character of Prissy, as stupid and empty as she was, has some dimensions. <br /> <br /> Here is perhaps one of the worst racial stereotypes ever created in Hollywood. The Spanky and Buckwheat society shows that children get along and that racial feelings are not inbred. It is not the servility of black people that is objectionable, but it is totally accepted by her. It is from this terrible watermelon song sung about the title that the news of General Spanky is bad news. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, he received an Oscar nomination for the sound recording, probably one of the very few Hal Roach has come out of the short subject area. However, General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind.
