He is the only reason to watch this movie. He does a very good job - much better than this crap earns. He is very handsome and very talented - he deserves more than that. Depressing is also Malcolm McDowell. He is another talented actor who deserves better, but like Esai, he performs very well. So if you're fans of both, you might want to be careful. Otherwise stay away. One more complaint - would not we have more scenes of Esai without a shirt?
