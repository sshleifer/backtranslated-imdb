What is this about? Kelly (Jennifer) seems to drop any moral behavior as soon as she arrives on the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) existent and exotic, even though she was a witness when he slapped his ex in the face, which he later justifies in the film, right or wrong? These two guys are the first ones on the island. Kelly is totally lost in every way and the big Juan P can fish and build a house. Mr. artisan. They seem to have a great time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, Kelly's husband) appears and, of course, he is a bit jealous for two days without knowing what his wife did with this gorgeous Juan P. Billy Z is the stereotypical guy and maybe not the nicest guy in the world. He does not like Juan P (because he met his girlfriend at the pier, who can blame him?) He is arrogant, too, but he paid a lot of money to rent this boat 20 min. Would not you be upset? But Billy is probably the type you want to hit in the face when you meet him. At the same time, he is not suspicious of the diving goggles Manuel has. Kelly and Billy have just lost some dear friends! How convenient that he just has them, no matter what! For some weird reason, Kelly likes this girl who beats Manuel and hates Billy because she's jealous. OK, Billy is overreacting, that's for sure, but Kelly does not do much to convince him either. She spends more time with Juan P, and even wants him to sleep with them since he was so nice (and although Manuel yelled at her and called her things because she had asked him some intimate questions, but Kelly is SO forgiving. ..). Yes exactly. And then she starts having sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before the incident on the island. At least they have intimate sex on the boat and talk like people, if they like each other. Now you can think that this scenario is possible. But really? Do you cheat your husband after two days on a coconut island just because he's jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar? (I would not argue if the relationship was really bad, but the director does not give much clues if that's the case). For God's sake, Juan P has not really proven to be a good person. Catch fish and build a wooden house to get into somebody's panties. Is that a good site? They do not try to befriend Kelly's husband (which would be very easy if left alone most of the time on the island, just be respectable) I want to have sex with Kelly. Kelly's character is simply untrustworthy (if she were stranded with Billy and another attractive girl, would not she be angry or what ?!). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane does not play a very nice person and Juan P is not much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused and thinks that having sex with Juan P can solve everything because her husband is so funny and aggressive towards poor Juan P. So ... for all who read this ... What do you think? If you were the Kelly character, you would consider deceiving your husband and knowing that someday you will be back to real life, and suddenly Billys may not be that terrible person. He is just too jealous. And if you were where Billy's character, what do you say if he's completely wrong in his behavior? And Juan P character, what do you really think of him? One thing is for sure. Manuals exist! Ps ... The voodoo thing is so totally wrong here! What the hell was that ?! Serious! Someone tell me
