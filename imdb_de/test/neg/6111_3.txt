I somehow did not see this movie, although it was quite successful and sparked many discussions in Israel. I am sorry that I have not postponed it indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The topic 'Kadosh' is a very real and painful topic for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the Orthodox family and society. The basic situation that exists in the premises of the film is possible; the problem is that the way in which it is shown and the "solution" that preserves the described conflicts in the film is wrong. Gitai does not seem to have much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach of choosing characters who are either fanatical or unable to express their human sentiment makes the whole story look simple. He is also not much better for his female characters, though he shows at least more sympathy and also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and talented actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall, Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his cinema is too simple, he focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be of interest to people they do not know, but in the context of really irrelevant the whole story. Starting from interesting premises, we get here a boring film that seems longer than it is, with a very static way, obsessive dealing with music that plays not only from a musical, but also from an emotional and an emotional perspective conclusive, if not confusing. What difference between this film and "Ha Ushpizin" has evoked and described the same social landscape, and they have managed to transfer human emotions to the screen. In 'Kadosh' there is too little cinema as well as too little human emotion.
