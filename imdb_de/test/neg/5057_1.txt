Sorry for all spoilers that contains this. But if you still want to read on, I really wonder why so many people are so high on Kevin Williamson. Let's take a quick look at his work as a scriptwriter, right? There are screams 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which I find quite funny, but very overrated. By turning Scream into a franchise, it no longer became a parody of the horror movies and it just became another one. Then I know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. He wrote on Halloween: H20, but even he had the feeling that he did not appreciate what he had done with this monstrosity. Then comes the faculty of which I can only say that she was terrible. (Lots of fun to make fun of). Do not even take me to the ridiculous, soap-opera Dawson's Creek, I could think about how bad that is for hours. Then we come to Teaching Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are a lot of small implausibilities in this. For example: In most of the colleges I know, the Valedictorian is NOT the only one allowed to attend college! The idea that Katie Holmes' character would never go anywhere unless she was a Valedictorian was absurd. Have you never heard of financial help, damn it!? I do not think you're expelled from high school or you do not go to college for cheating on a test. There are a number of others, but I will now jump to the big one. The end really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was okay because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers I could kidnap because of this logic? I'm sure the police did not say anything to find out the whole story. That would not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added a nice flair to a character, which (as one previous commentator stated) had NO reason for everything she did. And did anyone notice that Katie Holmes absolutely can not act? Her self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "They wanted me to fail, Blah blah blah." Her last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I do not regret losing $ 8.25 for this disaster is that she was beaten a bit. No, wait, I regret having lost the money: it was not real and she survived. Mr. Williamson, if you're reading this article, you made the same movie (some acts of violence and / or scary material that clever kids make that makes sarcastic jokes and makes references to other films) only a few times too many times (I count 6, not Scream 3 and whatever comes next, and I would appreciate it if you stopped, otherwise I would just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow.
