I falsely saw this movie when I thought it was the zombie strip of another radio station. The Shonky production values ​​and low prices quickly revealed that it was another cheap sci-fi channel style. <br /> <br /> Bill Moseley's pivotal performance is initially dubious Radio Shock Jock, but as the movie progresses, it becomes less and less convincing as it is actually being asked to act. The rest of the cast has little to do other than look worried and has no depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is boring, flat and totally uninspired, as with so many of these films. It does not even make a decent piece of convincing Gore, the zombie make-up is literally miserable, except for one notable exception towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film seeks to contain originality and a message. It's a mixture of half-baked and torn-down ideas, somehow equating this outburst with intolerance to Islam and the war on terror. This is miserably handled with all the intellectual means of a 6-year-old. As characters, and apparently, the authors are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - they all describe people of a particular skin color as "Muslims". The best known is that a character is Muslim only by the skin color. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists causing the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the far superior Pontypool had a similar budget to Dead Air, but seems everywhere where this movie fails miserably.
