First and foremost, I hate those stupid rappers who could not act if they had a gun pressed against their forehead. They curse and shoot each other and behave like a clich√© version of gangsters. <br /> <br /> The film takes no more than five minutes to explain what's going on before we're already in the cinema. Warehouse In this movie, there is not a single sympathetic character except the homeless who is also the only one with half a brain. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both Hill Billies and Sadler's character as much of a villain as the gangsters. I did not like him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The film is full of senseless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people are falling through windows, glass is flying everywhere. There is almost no action and it is a big problem if you do not root for anyone. Everyone dies except Paxton and the homeless and everyone gets what they deserve. The only two blacks who can act are the homeless and the junkie, but they are actors by trade and not annoying ugly, brain-dead rappers. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. At least they have characters that interest you, a sense of humor and nothing but real performers.
