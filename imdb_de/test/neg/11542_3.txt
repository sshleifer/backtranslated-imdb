Just awful. It is almost unbelievable that with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a clumsy, passionate mish-mash can result. But this is television for you - filler between commercials. The first warning sounds from the complexity of the re-creation of the epoch, which screams in banner type "1928". Flivies and Touring Cars, Fedoras and the West, Cloches and Speakeasy-Jazz (mockingly played) - with all the attention for pointless, artful details, the important things are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like narrative clarity or plausibility or competent writing and acting. The storyline sets one of Hammett's agents ("Hamilton Nash"). Whether it's called "Ham" or "Nash," we think of "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating a fraudulent diamond theft. Thus, the young woman who allegedly wears the Dain Curse (the charming and talentless Nancy Addison, who returned to soaps where she belonged) is introduced; It is part of a religious cult, led by Jean Simmons, and also appears to be dependent on drugs. There is also a mysterious gaseous drug that enters rooms .... <br /> <br /> But enough. The writing is never more pedestrian, as if it reaches for the poetic or high flown, and the plaster parrots only as they know it: by grotesquely overreaction. Simmons is treated like a little king of Old Hollywood, but the Grande Dame treatment does not wash. For some reason Hector Elizondo enjoys a second bill (after Coburn) for a superfluous part. Other well-known faces go through and do their resumes little good. The actors are not even photographed to look good; Jason Miller is a particular scare, but extreme close-ups of Coburn are also merciless. Coburn has probably capped that role because he's very similar to Mustache with a mustache. He needed more guidance than that; No one has given him the slightest hint as to how he should play his character, the tone of the story, or how the various storylines of the plot interlock (at least they do not do so). So he lets his big Chesire Cat grin fly open, whether it's required or not. <br /> <br /> The Dain Curse is available on videotape in various lengths. For those who are so brave "to see for themselves," the shortest cut is the most beautiful cut of all.
