My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples and we all went out at about the same time. <br /> <br /> That's the only movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It was just painful to sit through. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us and asked if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> This has never been before or since Pleae has not been rented. You will really regret it. I am really convinced of the vote summary. Maybe the personal taste has something to do with it
