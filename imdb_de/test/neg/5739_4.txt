This proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco with British funding; Unfortunately, the result is indistinguishable despite the stars and director (apart from his outstanding discomfort and the approach of the border camp). The former is cited as a couple of would-be robbers by a wooden Franco Nero and an ultra-hulking Telly Savalas (if anyone is able to believe the two actors, who generally radiate cool as a duo bumble-bee crook, he's more gullible than I am!). <br /> <br /> Your 'job' goes awry (ends with murder and with cases of cutlery instead of jewels!)? The mismatched criminals, however, see an opening to their dilemma when they accidentally "kidnap" the son of a British diplomat (a Miscast Lester who can even step on triggering Savalas where it hurts at one point). Nevertheless, they never really trigger him, and their only intention is to cross the border into France. Along with them is Nero's girlfriend (a wasted Ely Galleani): she has had enough and decides to run away while the others sleep. The crazy Savalas notice this and kill her after she has hit the girl. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester have woken up? the former says that his accomplices might have crossed him twice, so he goes on with the boy in tow; After a short time on a country estate of a wealthy old lady (who is completely unconstrained by Nero and Lester!), Savalas overtakes her. They continue their trek, where the trio meets a family of German campers: the situation degenerates to the point where Savalas closes them in their caravan and throws the property into the river? although he himself is seriously injured; Normally, everything ends with the heavies being killed just as they reach the border. <br /> <br /> The film therefore contains most of the typical elements of the genre? Sleaze, sadism, violence, chases (the consequences of the opening robbery when the getaway car causes chaos in the narrow streets of the city and even disturbs a funeral procession is downright farce) etc; A somewhat interesting aspect of this is that in the end, Lester himself was definitely (irrevocably?) Shaped by the experience. Excitement when a crime is committed.
