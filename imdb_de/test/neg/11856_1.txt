So bad, it's entertaining, especially during the cocktail hour, and believe me, you need a beer, a drink, or whatever, to get through this turkey. Where do you get the financial backing for such "horror" movies by color numbers? The fun in this movie is the prediction of which characters are eaten in which order, and the so-called "uniforms" that carry the "military" jokers. Incidentally, birds of prey are not the same birds of prey that we met in Jurassic Park, but a cousin species. (Sorry, no spoilers here, you have to watch it to find out for yourself.) Do not expect the plot to make sense, as easy as it is, just go with it. You could make it a game ... take a new drink every time you hear a specific sound ... or better yet, every time someone is squeezed by a "raptor". With luck, you will not remember seeing this "C-Grade" movie for TV!
