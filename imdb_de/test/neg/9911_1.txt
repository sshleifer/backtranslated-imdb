This movie is a terrible thing. I laughed the whole time. I had to stop in some scenes because my mother thought it would not be polite to laugh when people die, but in this movie, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into a tornado. <br /> <br /> Explosions of cars thrown at buildings by wind forces look like the old "R-Type" scrambler game. Dialogues are very bad and I'm interested in how they managed to convince some of the actors to star in this film. It's just amazing how such a bad movie can get into the TV. <br /> <br /> Just a real reason to watch this movie is a joke about nonsense and absurdity.
