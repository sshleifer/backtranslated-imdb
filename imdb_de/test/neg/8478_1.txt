The faint apology for a story in generic waste of time involves a guy who wants to be an animator but can not get his career off the ground. His super hot wife is more successful and she does not seem to care that he's a loser, but the man is not happy with it and wants to make more of his life. One day, her dog brings a magic mask that changes his life. Unfortunately, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask. Once he finds the man with the mask, he tries to get it back, and that's the whole story. If that sounds exciting to you, someone has to throw some water at you to wake you up. <br /> <br /> -This movie is awful. I can not say otherwise and I just can not stretch it enough. The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife, who was hot, but apart from her, there's nothing about this movie that's worth seeing. I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic, but what about the adults who need to bring their kids to look at this garbage. Why must we suffer through this vile sack of horrible crap? The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great storytelling. This is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to pay off the franchise and judge by the ridiculous Bo gross. I guess the franchise will not go on. <br /> <br /> - The cameraman has to be hit hard, because the sugary colors of the film have the feeling of vomiting. If there was music, I did not pay attention because I had already pierced my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the dreadful dialogue. Then there is acting or at least what is considered acting today. You could look at an infomercial and act much better in it than in this movie, but I can not really blame the actors, because it's the director who deserves the blame that he did not seem to realize the actors were one take another fuck. If a new line wants to start a franchise with this one, they have to start their game by hiring writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will look at any crap that comes out. <br /> <br /> -Bottom line if you are sadomasochistic and love to torture yourself. Please be sure to check this because it is painful to look at, but if you are not and you really like watching movies that are good, then avoid it
