Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who that is and in which soup kitchen you are eating right now. To say that this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name on the TV program, I thought it was a parody ... maybe it should have been. Could have made for a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene where they are in the middle of the flight in an airplane and the door is open and there is no wind. They could have come at least for a fan. <br /> <br /> Look for several Canadian & c-list actors in the movie. This is the kind of movie that screens out the b-rate cable stations you'll never see except on a rainy Sunday.
