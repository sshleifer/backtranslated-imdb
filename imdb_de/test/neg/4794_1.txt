This movie is just as bad as it gets. If you like the logic (or lack of it) like national treasure and bad acting, this could be a movie for you. Otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money for a beer. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like a poorly produced promo or demo image to promote the people involved (eg actors, special effects, etc.). They accidentally produce really bad talent. <br /> <br /> In such a case, the film company should be asked to reimburse customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It is really bad.
