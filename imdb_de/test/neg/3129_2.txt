The sometimes memorable dialogue of scenarist Frederick Fox and a study of old-pros can not save this lukewarm Western when the whites are being held in the desert by a gang of bloodthirsty Cheyenne Indians. Apart from his occasionally catchy dialogues, Fox's screenplay has no surprises for this run-in between whites and Indians. The characters in "Dakota Incident" attract little interest, certainly not enough to highlight them as some of Fox's chosen dialogues. Unfortunately, a good dialogue is the only contribution from Fox, as this conventional little sage brusher contradicts with a lackluster ending that contradicts his previous 80 minutes. The end is designed as it comes and lacks credibility. Most characters are sympathetic, but some just lack common sense. Dale Robertson is as Robben John Banner, one of three bank robbers, who with its low bottom, no account partner. John Doucette (Rick Largo), a veteran of the Western character, denies the best of the bad guys, while Skip Homeier, a banner of Frank Banner, wasted an unyielding role on an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to shoot banners at the beginning of the action, but our left-handed hero makes his own death. He later detects Largo and beats leather in a town called Christian Flats. Of course Largo bites the dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers of a stagecoach from Christian Flats to Laramie turns out to be the cashier from whom he stole the money. John Carter (John Lund) is not only looking for banners himself, but also wants to clear his good name at the bank, which has issued posters for his arrest. Obviously, the authorities misunderstood and expanded Carter's role in the robbery. Carter is ready to take banners to Laramie and hand him over to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change as he crosses with Amy Clarke (former actress Linda Darnell of Twentieth Century Fox), who wears a bright red dress and still wears a lot of bosoms. As everyone else mentioned in their reviews, Truecolor from Republic Studio expresses RED in everything, from Darnell's outfit to the blood shed on the floor. The problem with director Lewis Foster, who deals with this common runaway, is that after the stagecoach, everything gets seeped, a wheel is lost, and our heroes wash themselves in dry clothes to defend themselves against the Cheyenne. After all, the good guys and the Cheyenne no longer have ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" never has stereotypes. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician defending the way of the redskins. By the time this 88-minute Dustguard is over, you will feel trapped in a ravine and threatened by the plundering of Cheyenne yourself.
