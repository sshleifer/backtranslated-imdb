Whoa! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention awful? You can only say through the DVD cover that I should not get this movie, but unfortunately that was not the case for me. Well, somebody brought this house with me to look at it And when I looked at it, I just wanted to strangle the person because she used my money. I'll certainly take it back soon, but I could tell you as well as long as I remember, because I definitely want to forget it. This movie does not even deserve to be described as horrible. It is more than terrible. Probably the worst movie ever. The acting was so, so terribly disgusting, and the deaths were absolutely lame and predictable. I did not even laugh at how bad this movie was, which scares me a bit. I do not see this movie, just be ashamed if you watch this movie site, and I'm extremely sorry for you if you watch this movie because you think this will be DECENT. Closing words: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
