I really despair of the woman when talking about this joke of a program, as if it were intellectually involved and promotes the liberation and independence of the woman. This show is the biggest insult to women in addition to all these libidinous hip-hop videos. Talking about $ 100 for lunch in elegant restaurants like a bunch of reckless teenage teens, indiscriminately looking for unnecessary fashion and jumping to bed with the nearest man, this is considered empowering. > <br /> Apart from the harm done by the female sex, Sex and the City is NOT ENTERTAINING. Not even it was funny, captivating, exciting or original. The episodes are monotonous. Each character consists of factory-made mannequins that behave the same way in each episode. Not a single one of these flat, unattractive women has developed. The worst is perhaps the main character Carrie Bradshaw. In addition to being hideous, her preference for analyzing relationships is too high. In addition, the show portrays men as a bunch of empty sluts who can not engage in healthy relationships. Even if there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. The total lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo-feminists. The saddest part of the whole show is that these women lead an unhappy, miserable life. Any intelligent woman would never envy her. It's a banal show with even more banal characters. The New York City Tourist Board must hate how this garbage appears in their otherwise beautiful city! Luckily this train accident is over! Desperate Housewives is considered a suitable replacement for SATC. Although DH can be quite far-fetched, it explores women in more diverse ways. It also treats men more respectfully and is actually entertaining!
