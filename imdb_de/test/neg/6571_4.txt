Director William Shatner allegedly had a much "darker" movie in mind when it came to "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier," but Paramount's suits contemplated the huge cash receipts his humorous predecessor insisted that the new film also laughed a lot. So what we get is probably the weakest and dumbest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are countless bad ideas and a few good ones. If you're in a charitable mood, you can watch 'The Final Frontier' the same way you would with a TV show so-so episode. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a good actor and offers one of the best "guest star" appearances in any Star Trek movie, big or small, with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, constantly raises the movie when he threatens to sink, which happens too often. Charles Cooper is also good as a fat old Klingon General Korrd. Too bad that his role is not as great as he is. If the story of Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology because I was willing to blame for the incessant stupidity and the unconvincing action scenes on his director's feet. The reason is that I always felt Shatner was the least "attuned" of all Trek regulars to anything that makes Star Trek work and what makes it special for its fans. After reading his Trek memoirs, I realize he thought the show was another action-adventure series that happened to have a science-fiction setting. He preferred Gene Coon's vision of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular Western series "The Wild Wild West". Shatner also mentioned that a popular Star Trek episode was "A Piece of the Action," a stupid episode of Coon's second season. Would Shatner finally get the opportunity to make a Star Trek feature film, would not he follow his instincts and produce an action-packed movie with a lot of humorous humor? Well, somebody did it because 'The Final Frontier' was that. Shatner himself definitely returns as The Great Ham, and as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of "The Cutes." In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say what's worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godly dialogue. The gags about broken devices in the Enterprise have gone all the way from 'Wrath of Khan' and through this fifth Trek movie they have run into the ground. So too the idea of ​​a "skeleton crew". A new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura, and suffice it to say that one does not feel the flames of passion between the two. It is a meaningless subplot and adds nothing. The climate scene in which God encounters does not contribute much. Whether this was a good idea or not is questionable, but the scene itself does not make much sense. (The abilities of the creature "God" seem to change depending on what is needed.) About half of it is a tired repetition of the climax of "Finding Spock." Leonard Nimoy succeeds in saving Spock's integrity, even if he uses such nonsensical lines as "Get a grip, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley surpasses Shatner and Nimoy as usual; In the last Trek movies, he really did act as an actor. So this trek trip is not terrible, it just is not good. There was supposed to be another true-to-life Trek movie before the baton was handed over to the "next generation," and he was far better suited to the job than "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier."
