I have never looked at IMDb before, but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to do so. I would not even have finished if I had not been to someone's home. The movie was bad on many levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was created. The more I watched, the more he seemed to be acting as a person who seemed desperately to be famous instead of acting out of conviction. Second, the others in the film, except for Treadwell's parents, and The Airline Pilot was as unconventional and hackneyed as he was. God, they worked artificially. Third, Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does not even make sense, as he did more harm than good by getting the bears used to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really loved the bears, but there is much research that suggests his efforts have been misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help. Fourth: The entertainment value of the movie was not half that of other wildlife films like March of the Penguins and Winged Migration. The filmmakers have, in my opinion, arranged bad scenes and given little incentive to continue. <br /> <br /> As a person who loves Alaska, bears and other wildlife, I would like to see more people dedicated to preserving our wildlands. Hopefully, their efforts are less focused on people.
