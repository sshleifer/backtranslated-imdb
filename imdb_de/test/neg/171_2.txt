Oh God! It could be a very interesting movie and it is. I would have liked to give a 5, but I give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! The shoot is really bad !!!!! It wobbles all the time in a completely tasteless frame! <br /> <br /> It's really painful to see this very interesting movie in a movie theater. You got seasick fast and you have to make a big effort not to puke on your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's really a shame, because the story is not processed linearly, which is rather rare for a documentary (and a very good idea!). <br /> <br /> Take a look at the home!
