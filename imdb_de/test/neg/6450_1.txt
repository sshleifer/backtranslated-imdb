Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I'm sure that Mr. Osmond wanted to make a righteous, heartwarming Christmas movie, this movie is as cynical and creepy as they come. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute children, unsuspecting adults and stupid villains. The production values ​​prove that this was filmed either in the smallest space or by really inexperienced filmmakers - I suspect the latter unfortunately. The worst part is, strangely enough, the music. You might think that someone with a long musical career could be better than the title song, but you would be wrong. Even my mother did not like this movie and she likes the Osmonds AND juicy stuff.
