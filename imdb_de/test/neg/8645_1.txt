I saw this movie in the movies because of its potentially interesting subject, the good cast, a director who had previously shot the highly rated "Once Were Warriors" and my love of noir-ish LA films in the US 1940s and 50s , I would argue that it is quite easy for me to please in this category of film; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I will prevail and enjoy a reasonably decent, if derived, effort. But I found this movie completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite a good situation in which I can place the story, nobody seems to say or say anything remote interesting or entertaining in the entire two hours plus this sad chaos. Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue that are banal or embarrassing. The narrative is casual and unbearable, and none of the events it depicts are handled well enough to do anything but kill the audience. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and in the end I just did not care what happened because I did not believe in anything in the movie. <br /> <br /> L.A. Confidential came out a year later, and regardless of whether a version of the story is more lifelike, the latter film rightly receives all credit for its excellence in each department. Mulholland Falls, on the other hand, fails in every department, a fact that becomes all the more tragic due to the amount of talent. If they ever show that in an airplane, I'm still going out.
