--------- SPOILER ALERT -------------------------- <br /> <br /> This was the worst In the series, the horror is disguised as a political satire and as subtle as a sledgehammer, not very scary and not very insightful. Did Micheal Moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage? I'm really tired of Hollywood using the conversation as a political campaign against George Bush and repeating the same conversation over and over again. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike the film, which cleverly tackled the problems of the Vietnamese returning soldiers by returning the lead character as a blood-headed zombie and slowly building this theme, this was a real horror movie as well a good social comment because he did not become ambitious, exploitative and preaching. <br /> <br /> I think Joe Dante thought this would be a horror movie that terrifies Republicans, Conservatives, Libertarians and me. The last in this list found the movie totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitative at the same time and I do not mean the good one The kind of exploitation often found in "drive-in" films, exploit in the most cruel and abominable way: to use the death of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This movie assumes that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against a conservative president if they were revived as zombies, which is a flawed premise, as I recall for the most part, following George Romero's rules; Zombies are mindless, carnivorous creatures that work with pure impulse and though the zombie Andy was able to speak in DeathDream, he could not engage in conversation and was driven by his addiction to human blood. Okay, zombies are mindless creatures driven by the impulse, not the intellect. Obviously they are dead. Why should the dead be allowed to vote first? I interpret this film as meaning that the only war that a liberal Democrat can win is that he is dumb for him. I think he meant to say that the people who vote for presidents like George Bush are the mindless zombies, while the real ones are mindless. Zombies are actually the ones who make the intellectually sound decisions. Yes, anyway. Dawn of the Dead was much more responsive to this idea, but used the idea of ​​thoughtless consumption. This movie is not "Dawn of the Dead," even if it's not fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film addresses the problem while the soldiers are alive, that a majority of them voted for a Bush-like president, but after they died they would vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they are zombies that are usually considered brain-dead creatures, destroying them ridiculously after voting. <br /> <br /> If you're doing a zombie movie, Mr. Dante and calling George Romero's name, you'd better have mindless zombies that like to tear people and eat their guts, not zombies who choose. I also like how the zombies are just "evil" conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with a social comment, skip this miserable, preaching piece of garbage and watch DeathDream instead. <Br /> <br /> The worst of the Master of Horror series.
