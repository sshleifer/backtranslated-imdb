Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. She needs to be the focus of attention and will be stupid to do it that way. With her attitude she is sent to a charming school. There she meets the typical characters in today's cinema; the nerd, the awkward, the housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and in the end "Adela learns, so to speak". The plot tries to have a deeper meaning for the condition that Adela is in, but she does not deliver it at all (at least I did not buy it). What remains is the superficial interaction with the same clich√©s you've seen in a million movies before. In addition, the director seems to have a breast fixation, Adela flashes a few times too many boobies, at least I can not realize that they are relevant to the story If you are like me and do not like to see a teenager pissing people out and in Doing a behavior reversal in a flash, which I found very incredible, consider before you look at it.
