Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies where I have to take care of the people somehow. I could not care about anyone in this movie. This should be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (down to the nano level). The thing is, it has overlooked so many things. There were characters who could be funny, but they were not. There were characters you would like, but you did not. For example, the guy who thought the Beatles had ripped off his songs. There was so much potential there, but he just talked like a Beatle and complained about how they had torn him down. Haha. And the previous poster talked about the scene "I am the walrus" as if it were something special. What? He played "I am the walrus" on an old piano and sang in disgust. Is there an inner joke there? It stank safely at face value. This movie feels like a movie to me people say they like it because it sounds "intellectual" or "hip" when you say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art / garbage message that the artist expresses. If you want to be entertained, stay away.
