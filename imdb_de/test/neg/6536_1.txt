So ... that's what SXSW Film Festival and Sundance are all about, is not it? Well, I think I can tell as long as story, script, dialogue, drama (except for Ms. Aselton), cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant. I remember telling other filmmakers for a few years The biggest problem with digital video was that we now have to wade through a future sea of ​​crap to be seen for anything that's worth it because now everyone and his brother (or the brothers in the case of Duplasses) could go out and make a movie. "The swollen chair." Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> This feature-length video is another chapter in the grim, ever-expanding world of "dudeology" movies. guns armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written flat script, and some friends call them actors who decide to make a movie and videographer one afternoon. Do not get me wrong - I'm all into independent cinema (ie Hollywierd is shit). However, you can not deal with some of the realities of this system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplass brothers had a real budget to raise real producers, such a script would never have been clear! And that's the problem. There are no more testing procedures to prepare films (sorry ... videos) for production. Just take a DV / P2 camera and go! And what makes it even worse is that high-profile festivals like the ones above actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. And why? Exactly because it is not a budget. <br /> <br /> I think it's especially important in today's climate of indie films to stop giving video makers the chance to pick up the language by calling themselves a "filmmaker". There is a big difference in my book. If you need to go out there and actually put your script on the line to ask friends and family or business people for real money to make a movie and know the potential losses, then you know what it means to watch a movie his "filmmaker." But a couple of hundred Sam's Club for a few DV cassettes, a bit of soda and chips to buy, it does not bring. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I have to mention how annoying it was to listen to a woman who was referred to as a "buddy" throughout the movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves this heavily overused nickname only for his male friends, if it concerns at least his friend Mike. <br /> <br /> I think it's high time that the indie film community started to call these abominations, no-budget videos for what they are, and at the same time, prestigious festivals boast that they strive so casually, great praise. Either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy of adding a new category to their festival ranks ... "Dude Films".
