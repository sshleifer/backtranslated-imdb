OK, fans, it's released on DVD. But the only reason to watch this is 1) saying that you did it (because of its notoriety), or 2) if you're a diehard Bill Paxton fan. I'm not a die-hard BP fan, but it was fun to watch, and it was the only thing that kept me from getting bored. It's a shame, because this could have been a good filming film done by someone with some intelligence (and a cast led by someone, besides the totally fake and talentless Judd Nelson). Sure it is disgusting, but it is bad and not in a good way. If after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopically dirty this movie is, you are still interested in doing yourself a favor and instead see a good bizarre revolting dystopian filth. Films by John Waters, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Basket Case", etc. come to my mind. There is much better out there.
