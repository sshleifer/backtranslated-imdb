All criticisms of this film are quite valid! It's pretty boring and stuffless. A couple nodding over their "good meal" changes. A middle shot of a desk while a telephone rings until someone finally comes, sits down and answers at a fairly leisurely pace. Quadruple takes or more when people look at things. Lonely banjo tuning and games, pause for a beer. To tell a fawn a joke about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn how to feed his babies, including many mouth-sized expressions (needed for the weak point). The sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which becomes inedible for the squeamish when it comes to burnt people. Many seemingly stock footage close-ups of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the woods. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a forest fire, then some decades later some people the same woods are killed by an ax. The killer was obviously not too happy with the ax he stole, and kills other people with other opportunistic weapons or his bare hands. <br /> <br /> If it's true that the movie will be cut in the available version of-print videotape. If a lot of material has been cut, it deserves another look at DVD. Otherwise, it just is not very interesting and would probably test the patience even of the hardcore outdoor Slasher fans.
