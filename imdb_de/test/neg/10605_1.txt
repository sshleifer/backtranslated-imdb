OK, number one - this "movie" is a "90s" version of a crappy 70's show that nobody remembers! Number two: As soon as the movie started, I was confused. It was like halfway through the movie. There was no action! it was very annoying! Terrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it's just not believable that the small, skinny Omar Epps can track a tall, grown-up man without a gun and scare him into talking! It's a ridiculous "conspiracy." I'm sorry, but for me kids today can not even put their pants on one leg, let alone catch 'nasty, subterranean killers'. I went out of the theater and demanded my money back! I can not recommend this movie to anyone over 12 years old!
