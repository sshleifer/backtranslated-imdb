I did not like this movie. I rented it, hoping it would be something like the 10th Kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered it was not. I just found it annoying. The acting was bad, the characters were incredible and the time jumps were crazy. I can only recommend this movie if you're in the mood to see a crazy guy walking around, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can not believe I wasted my time on it.
