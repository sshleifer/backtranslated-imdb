I will not ruin it for you. Although you probably would not mind if it was corrupt (you'll know what I mean after you saw it) Bad story. B-rated film quality. Typical horror - stupid situations - rare timing. I should know if they try to push a lot of hype into their advertising or even add "quotes". Just tell me that the movie has been bombarding a big time. And they try to involve everyone just to break the cost of making this bomb. I wish I could take back the time I looked at it. I was stupid and thought there had to be something great around the corner. But I was constantly disappointed. Normally you do not waste my time adding comments to a movie. In fact, this is my second contribution. I just felt I might be able to stop some of you from wasting money on something that had a hype of hype.
