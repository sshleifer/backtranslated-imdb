Grown up in westerns and in the face of Western Western today on television and in the theater, I was really looking forward to Commanche Moon. After two nights, and not one, it seems to have been shot on a tight budget. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones level stars are striking. There is Val Kilmer, but what's up with him? Four or five buildings on each side of the street as well as the mansion Scull make up the entire city of Austin. The capitol is never to be seen, just inside the governor's office. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is often hokey, meaningless. The plotline is discontinuous. All in all completely forgotten.
