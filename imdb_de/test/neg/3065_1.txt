The evil has never looked so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When a friend of mine picked up this DVD at a bookstore for half price, I did not know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth the laugh, but I did not know how ridiculous it really would be. <br /> <br /> The first time I missed some dialogues (if you could call it that) because we were all too busy making fun of the plot of the movie. It seemed like it had been filmed in less than a week, and they did not have the budget to fix some of the minor bugs. Wait, did I say "minor"? I meant exactly the opposite. For example, the main character is referred to as "Ken," but is referred to as "John" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy the plotting holes enough, look at the acting. No one seems to be worried about the zombie raids in his state, including the mother of the main character, who is missing for days while sitting in front of a fireplace reading a book. The movie is just as funny. Maybe they did not have permission to film, wherever they were, because during the BIG MOTORCYCLE CHASE SCENE the characters follow the traffic rules. The zombies that just killed twenty people actually stop at a stop sign that comes from a parking lot. I do not even do that, but then again I'm not a biker zombie. The end of the movie looks like he runs out of money. It ends so suddenly that you feel like more ... At the second glance it ends soon enough. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with your friends, choose this movie. It's a great unwanted comedy.
