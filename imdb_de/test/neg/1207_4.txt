I rarely laughed so hard at a movie. Note that I laughed at Iron Eagle, not MIT, because this is probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of the Sci-Fi Monstrosity Cyber ​​Tracker). You should also remember that this movie is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> Even if you overlook the absurd conspiracy (the idea that a 16-year-old could go to a US Air Force base, an F-16 steals fly to the Middle East and kill about a thousand people without The film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense, for example, Doug Masters uses a machine gun in his plane to shoot a steel girder, a control tower, and a tent - all of them Things explode in a massive fireball Why? The enemy plane explodes in a strange way reminiscent of a paper airplane exploded with fireworks. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I really enjoyed this movie. Although not in the way the creators probably wanted, but still I laughed about it and later bought the DVD, and it is also due to the great presence of David Suchet as b Improved terrorist leader (perhaps you remember him as an insulted Belgian detective Poirot?). Overall, the movie is therefore a laugh and a light-hearted alternative to a more serious fighter plane films like Top Gun. Even though it's just as subtly homo-erotic (see the embrace between Doug and Chappy, something happens between them!)
