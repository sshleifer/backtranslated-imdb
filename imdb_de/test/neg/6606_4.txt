A very mediocre film based on a great series of stories and novels. I hope someone will one day be able to film it properly. In the meantime search for the books (by A. Sapkowski), a very intelligent, postmodern fantasy. Meanwhile, there should be a translation in English, as there are certainly translations in German.
