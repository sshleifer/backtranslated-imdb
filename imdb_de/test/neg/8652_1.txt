Oh my god, WHY, did I waste my precious time on this movie? It's pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Yes my life. I'm ashamed of Yash Raj movies, the poor guys have to live with the terrible news that they produced this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the dirtiest, sexiest and most eye-catching movie I've ever seen from Yash Raj Films. I scare for them, I really do. Besides the terrible drama (or NO drama) of Uday Chopra, combined with the lack of talent of "Look At My Boobs" - Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki has no good at all. Even the music does not conform to YRF's standard. The director, Arjun Sablok, did embarrassing work here. Honestly, I expected more. Much much more.
