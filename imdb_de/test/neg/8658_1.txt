It is definitely not worth spending money or time. It's the same choppy act of a man and a girl meeting and falling in love. However, this is with a western touch. However, it fails miserably to present a love story or to give the western touch. We never have the feeling that the hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth for any of their characters. With a better cast, the characters might have been able to get some justice. After all, it's a no-fun movie, no acting, no topic, no plot, no comedy, no action, no thrill, no romance (I associate romance with something more passionate). Not a movie that you want to take with your family. If you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I'll wait for the day when Bollywood movies are something I can wait to watch, and I can call my friends a must-have movie.
