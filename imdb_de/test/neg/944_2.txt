Seriously, I do not understand how Justin Long is getting more and more popular. He either has the best agent in Hollywood or has recently sold his soul to Satan. It is almost unbearable to see on the screen, it has little to no charisma and a terrible comedic timing. The only movie he tried to anchor from afar was Waiting ... and that's almost entirely because I worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Apart from its terrible track, this movie has many other burdens. I understand that this is supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does not mean it has to completely insult our intelligence and hack the writing so badly that it borders on the offensive. Lewis Black's great talent is also wasted here, since he is the hardest when he is uninhibited, which certainly does not allow the classification of PG-13. The only bright spot in the film was Jonah Hill (who seems almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the weight gain he has lost in the meantime). His one-liners were occasionally funny, but certainly not enough to make it almost bearable. If you just want to turn your brain off completely (or better yet, you do not have one) then you might enjoy that, but I can not recommend it at all.
