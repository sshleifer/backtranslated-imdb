This film should be renamed: Sex in the 70s In a part of New York City, called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This film does not talk much about sex in the 70s, unless it focuses on the hypersexual public environments and private sex rooms in New York City. I doubt the Manhole Bar in the 1970s was a symbol of real sex, and this type of sex is much more prevalent in the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the time span is like an explosion. And it's pretty important to document the scene that the movie refers to. But what the movie calls "sex in the 70s" is the title a bit misleading. Technically speaking, it is not an Oscar candidate, but the rudeness of the film feels appropriate to the theme. <br /> <br /> All in all an "eh."
