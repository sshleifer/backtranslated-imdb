Another Lo Wei production that wastes the talent of a young Jackie Chan completely, To Kill With Intrigue is a weird mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and normal kung fu fighting, which is rather boring despite some surreal WTF moments and many ridiculously bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> To protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the killer Bees, a gang of ruthless killers attacking his home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a heartless hangover who drove her out and she so saved from the danger. During the attack, Cao's relatives are all killed, but of the gang whose leader has a scar, he remains relatively unhurt wife, seems to have the shots for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin, whose security he has entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. While searching for his true love, Cao befriends the director of a courier company whose precious cargo she has got stolen by the leader of the evil 'Bloody Rain' clan. After being injured in a fight against members of the evil clan (a funny scene with lots of stupid weapons), he was finally nursed back to health by the scar-faced killer Bee (who shows her love by burning his face!). Finally, Cao learns he's a lousy character judge: his friend Chu Chuk is none other than the power-hungry headhoncho of the 'Bloody Rain' clan planning to marry Chin Chin himself. <br /> <br Come to the lengthy fight in which Cao is repeatedly kicked before he strangles his treacherous ex-buddy with a scarf to death. <br /> <br /> Even tough Chan fans will find this an annoying task Only the last fight managed to show some of the star's amazing acrobatics. Fans of general Asian craziness may dig up the scary look of the killer bees at the beginning of the movie (with a character inexplicably reclaiming his severed hand!) Or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero, but for most this movie has a very limited appeal.
