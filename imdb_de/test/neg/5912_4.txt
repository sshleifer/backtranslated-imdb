1989 was a year when Eddie Murphy was not so hot anymore and started making films that would soon be forgotten. Strangely enough, it was also the year Murphy shot his first film, but it would also be the first and last experiment. "Harlem Nights" was not exactly what you could call success, though it was great to see the two best black comedian Murphy and Richard Pryor together. Do not blame the actors, as they have all played the way you expected, even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy laugh. The worst thing about "Harlem Nights" is both the scenario and the awful decors. Everything is located in the 1920's, and everyone has benefited from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adoptive son Quickie (Murphy) easily collect $ 10,000 a day, but soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their share of the biscuit. Sugar and Quickie are not guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can see "Harlem Nights", that's for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name Murphy, you better avoid it, as this movie is nothing more than a lame excuse to joke see.
