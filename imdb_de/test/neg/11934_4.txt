I would bet that a monthly salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was made for TV. Other reviewers confirm that MSR was a movie and I will get involved. The logical answer must assume that she was originally filmed for television and instead was theatrically released after a studio change of heart. Each actor is first and foremost a television actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... all TV actors. Lee Van Cleef shared his time between television and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has made only 3 or 4 "real" movie appearances in the last thirty years of a highly productive television career - a positive finding made for television. Minor Players are experienced small-screen actors seen on old repeats of Gunsmoke, Wild Wild West, Streets of San Francisco, and more. <br /> <br /> The ho-hum sets are identical to the Universal Studios tour sets, which are often seen on old TV shows. And the cut reveals the rush of television with one or two takes, with limited camera movement, positioning, cutting and lighting. The soundtrack, which contains only the original Berstein themes, comes from the television of the seventies. Yes, I would bet the money was turned for television. <br /> <br /> This is an important point in the assessment of MSR. Originally I looked at MSR over the cable, assuming it's an old theatrical version. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven" it is a joke, a cartoon, an amateurish attempt at filmmaking. Acting, Lighting, Writing, Attitudes, Action, Cinematography, Music (Bersthemen excluded), Editing, Pacing, ... on and on .... all pale in comparison to the classic "Magnificent Seven", which is close to the '60s Western perfect and one of the greatest action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> However, as I suspect, the movie is actually better than the average, as a movie from the early 1970s that was made for television. Those unhappy enough to survive the 1970s as adults know what I'm talking about. MSR could have competed against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similarly boring network shows. In the seventies, "Gunsmoke" was a quality show focused on character development, not action, and shooting twice a week. The first shootout, usually a murder, sets the hour in motion - the second shootout brings the episode to a climax by solving the guest star, his nemesis, or the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon in a different way. MSR has more action than a whole season of Gunsmoke. In this light - within this frame of reference - MSR is passable entertainment, a cut above the television tariff of the decade.
