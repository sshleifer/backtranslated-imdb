I'm a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books, and the myth background produced some other good stories and the like. And in the last few years, some boys came along to watch the films about the work of H.P. have turned. for the larger part flatted Flicks? and showed it to the public in places like the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Well, as I said, most of them do not have big buds, but at least they know the heart and the "soul" of Lovecraft's work and films like "Cool Air" or "The Call of Cthulhu" - that's what I would think - Gifts for the fan base and other loons, who like the creation of HP. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon who just tear down the name and make a movie that would have been fun if I had directed it myself and filmed with friends on the beach. That's what Mr. Zuccon did, it seems ... but while the earlier films by Aaron Vanek or Bryan Moore might not be up, they somehow had more to offer than a story, real characters, and a connection to them Lovecraft! If you bubble names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon", a movie does not become a Lovecraft adaptation. Anyway, this movie will not only make fans of the myth to shudder and hide, it will not be directed to people who like 1. good movies, 2. laugh about bad movies, 3. like good C's - record Splatter movies or 4. watch everything horror has written on the DVD cover. I will not go into the "disappearance" of this waste of time, as it has been discussed by others on this site, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie I made with some geeky friends. Apart from that, there is a lack of ideas for storytelling and it goes into ridiculous "feeble-nonsense-but-it-art-things". Homemade flicks of this "quality" are fun when you know all the guys and Ha-ha and see how XY coughs the wrong blood out of old tomato sauce and so on? but hey, you do not put this in a DVD case, explain it for a real movie and want money for it? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 because I do not know ?? Trouble or something like that
