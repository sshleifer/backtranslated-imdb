Let's be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. My wife and children were really promising in their first season and then just went downhill. It's so bad that words do not describe. Acting and writing are so terrible on a constant basis, I wonder if Damon Wayans deliberately produced such a vile show. Every idea is ridiculous from top to bottom. Damon Wayans calls it completely and George Gore II is so horrible that I shudder on each overreacted line. Can anyone really see this show and find it entertaining or even funny? Please, I implore you. Do not look at this show. As soon as TV members no longer use this syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute rubbish.
