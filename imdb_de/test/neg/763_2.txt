For a scientifically sophisticated super dog that was supposed to be the answer to a petit crime, CHOMPS was a jerk. All I ever saw was that Chomps was sitting, walking or running. Or run, then go, then sit ... and then get up and stretch, then go and jog to K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes it had all the answers to the daily jumbo. But mostly it just sat a lot. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is that Chomp's Mr. Bigglesworth could not turn off in a celebrity death match.
