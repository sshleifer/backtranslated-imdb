What's going on with American movies these days? Hollyweird keeps making films in which men behave like women and women and men alike. The idiotic director and author of this film has to have his heads examined. The main problems with this film are the obvious extreme feminist portrayals of the sexes. In the scenes of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend gulp from the beer bottles as if they were on an oil sailor tanker at a bar in Iceland. Mendez constantly kisses every girl she sees afterwards. She also provocatively dresses in every scene, but curses like a guy. She gets very emotional when she struggles with Will Smith for a while as she tries to "defend" all women from bad guys everywhere. <br /> <br /> The men are not better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything to win a date. The men in this film either deal with sexual favors or can not speak clearly when confronted with a woman. Men in real life do not behave like that. <br /> <br /> What we see in this movie is a product of culture that went awry. Everything is flip flop. Boys behave like girls, girls behave like boys. All of this happens while the extreme gender preferences are heavily involved in the story. Men are portrayed as soft and stupid, but are mostly only interested in sex, while women are portrayed as macho and overbearing, but only as a delusion for their emotional insecurities. <br /> <br /> This film would be good, if it were, it would not be disgusting to the audience. The content is not the culprit. It is the way in which the content is presented.
