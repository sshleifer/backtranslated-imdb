This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. I say that without exaggeration and believe me, I have seen many bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars have flown into this film and hundreds (thousands?) Of craftsmen have spent so much time working on what writers and producers MUST KNOW that this would be a colossal failure , <br /> <br /> A 90-minute movie feels so long, boring and incomprehensible, you know that something went wrong somewhere. Even Jamie Kennedy (whose work I've enjoyed elsewhere) is just terrible in this role; Obviously, he was never screened, as no producer who was brave enough entertained him in any way, especially in the Mask of The Mask. Just awful. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not wait to see the reviews from the big movie critics, because I know they do a better job than I do when they tear this train accident to pieces. <Br /> <br /> The producers of this film should be embarrassed, and more importantly, theater films should NEVER be filmed again.
