A real insult to the original "Spoorloos", one of the most disturbing films (and I intend to compliment it!) That I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original is cool and ingenious, the remake is flat and even boring, especially the "happy end" finale takes some tension in this film. <br /> <br /> During such a distortion (especially a "grafting") "happy ending" (which was not there before) is often the case with "Hollywood" remakes of European art-house films and would have expected The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this crazy chaos was created by the same filmmaker who made the original "Spoorloos" ... <br /> <br /> Why Mr. Sluizer decided to do his masterpiece ruining it in this way is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination at any cost, as it might spoil the original for you, even if you * afterwards * see it, let alone the other way round .. ,
