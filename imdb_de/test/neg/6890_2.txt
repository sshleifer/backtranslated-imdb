Skeletons In The Closet takes the father-teen son genre to a new level. This is a movie that serves no purpose. The plot is laid out in the first few minutes, there is no tension, the characters are clich√©s and despite twists trying to confuse and disguise, everything goes exactly as you think. After half the movie, I could no longer stand the snail's pace and began the fast-forward. The movie ended exactly as expected. Linda Hamilton is as always great and the other actors are above average, considering that there seems to be a lack of direction. If you really believe that you need to see this uninspired, lackluster wannabe whodunit, watch the fast-forward.
