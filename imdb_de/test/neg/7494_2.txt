Maybe it's unfair not to like a movie for what it is not and not what it is, but I hoped that a filmmaker would finally make a film about rural gay men and women in small towns. Instead, the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) Of the natives (and those in remote areas) and the really cruel torture / murder of a young gay man for dumb people chatting about AIDS, sin, hellfire, and perverts , So much time has been devoted to the ghoul preacher who spoke the bible and gets gay people what they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more of the people who came to the "gay bar of the small town", not those who refused. Besides, the young man who was murdered is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is more of a warning than a celebration, and it is very suspicious.
