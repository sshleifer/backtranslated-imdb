Anyone who has seen the steamy, stinking piece called Congo understands my title. And I feel for you. This movie was not only bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was stupid and the cast was awful. Dylan Walsh? Rumor has it that Julia Roberts threw her ass off because this movie was so badly blown. Huge diamonds? Killer gorillas? Gorillas talk? Hmmm. Sounds like a hit! OH! Tim Currys accent is so bad in this movie that I'd rather be deaf! I recommend this film to bulimic people who want to clean up after a heavy meal or Kavorkian patients with only one more reason to die. If this is true to the book, I would say, let's burn a good old Footloose book and destroy every specimen. If future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain ourselves? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Do not look at it! Run away! DO NOT VIEW THIS MOVIE! If you think it's full of action, suspense or cool effects, you're wrong! If you think it blows more dick than Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So if you still want to see Crapo ... I mean Congo, I say after you've just taken 50 Tylenol PM.
