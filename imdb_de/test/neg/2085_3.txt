I saw this movie over 20 years ago and had pretty good memories of it. When I got back to Cinemax this month, I realized how little insight I had on movies back then. This is a very ordinary Western spaghetti with absolutely nothing special. Screenwriting, directing, acting, photography are all great stuff. Stay with the Sergio Leone Western!
