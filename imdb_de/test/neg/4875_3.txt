This movie is not worth seeing, at least not in the cinema. The story is difficult to understand and understand (it starts with ten minutes in which 3 years ago something happened). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just so bad / weird it sometimes looks like it. American sirens and lights of Swedish police cars are just one example. The acting of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is as always good, but I think that Jenny Lampa looks very bad as Jasmine. Zara Zetterqvist looks pretty good, she has not been seen in Swedish films for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it is released on DVD or shown on TV.
