Aside from Frankie Muniz rattling too fast (Malcolm in the mid-flashbacks?), This movie still does not arouse any anxiety. The idea with the "Countess" and the surrounding story was funny, but the plot and many subplots just do not tie together. Plot Synopsis: The murder of ghosts lures victims through video games. Throw some blood spatter and special effects and you have another bombing would be a horror movie. The spirit friends are much too much like the spirit in "The Ring Two". The acting and the constant and dramatic change in the emotions of all people are incredible. Save your money.
