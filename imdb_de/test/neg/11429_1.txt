Ah, here it is! A movie that is said by people to remind me of the epic "trainspotting". OUCH, I was an idiot to believe, and ALSO how my buttocks hurt after I forced myself to watch this creature from start to finish. After the first 10-15 minutes, I just wanted it all over, or at least they could have included nudity or action, or cool acid house music, to be worth the time ... but no, when I was done So I put it on my CD shelf and hope I never have to choose it again just to show it to a friend so eager that he / she does not want to hear my warnings.
