Let's get to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the side cast is ridiculous, and the lead actors look like they've been forced into it. The story challenges us to believe that there is a subterranean lesbian sex cult where members are murdered by their psychiatrist, who happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crime and develops into Peta Wilson, whose job is to be the sect's recruitment. The sex scenes are synonymous with bad porn. When Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she's in pain. Barkin's talent is totally wasted in this B-grade sexploit jerk, and I hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in the movie.
