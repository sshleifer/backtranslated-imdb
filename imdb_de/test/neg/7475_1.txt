When the opening shot is taken seriously by US Marines who respect the US flag hard, a movie has a hard road ahead, but unfortunately it went downhill from there. There's a military advisor who seems to be retired as well, which makes it even more startling that this unbelievable violation of protocol and law went unnoticed. Even more astounding is the way they simply report how a Marine KIA is reported and then buried in a very short time, without the slightest explanation as to how they have identified the body, or if there was any body at all. The US government still finds the missing item from World War II and it takes months to identify the remains. The downed military will remain MIA for months or years and will not be declared KIA until the remains have been positively identified or after years of bureaucracy. This is expected to happen within days or weeks. Maybe this is the case in Denmark, but not in the US. Obviously, none of the people involved ever had the slightest commitment or respect for the US military. In addition, there are a whole host of other ridiculous moments when characters make Zinger out of nowhere. There must have been some really extensive meetings between author and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such a hogwash. A working script might have helped, but this script was apparently put together from Cliff's Notes. There's no way to tell if the script was so terrible at first, or if it was the author or middle management executives in the studio. In any case, this is a horrible movie that should never have been done.
