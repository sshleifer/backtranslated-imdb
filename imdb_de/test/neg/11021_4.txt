... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. It also gave us observable films like BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately, for anyone involved in this debacle, THE WOG BOY is not included if they appear in one of the two lists. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing this movie, simply because of the politically incorrect title broadcast politically incorrectly on BBC 2 late at night, the spokesman did not even mention the name of the movie, so I expected something so offensive anachronistic that my jaw would fall into disbelief. It was incredulous, I could not believe the financiers thought that this would be a big international hit. <br /> <br /> The problem is the cast and the script. I know that Australia, with its small population, does not have a large pool of actors, so I'm mostly forgiven, but that does not stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy to work, you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor, and I'm sorry to say, but Nick G does not have the skills. I had never heard of him and seen nothing else in which he was otherwise. Maybe he is much better at other performances. Here, however, he is just irritating, unconvincing, and I lost count of the number he was robbed for the camera. The jokes themselves are very shallow and predictable, and when you return to the script it seems to be very underdeveloped. I mean, who thought a running gag about a female Minster Of Work who has it behind a limousine was funny in the beginning? Feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest, saying, "Look, this script is not nearly good enough, make it more subtle and structured." <br /> <br /> I was tough and tough in requested this review. I gave the movie four out of ten and would only have gotten three if it were not for the really funny sequence in which Steve flashes a recent Affair show just for herself on screen and calls it "Dole blodger". This shows that screenwriters know the timing of comics and social commentary. Too bad that they did not come with a much better written movie
