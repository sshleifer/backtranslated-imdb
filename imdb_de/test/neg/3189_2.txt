One Night at McCool's wants you to think it's a hip and clever black comedy. It forces its "quirky" characters and "outrageous" situations on the viewer like a crack-dealer who works overtime. The premise is of a gold digger woman named Jewel, dating men to steal and sometimes murder her so she can have all the worldly possessions she so desperately desires. You know, that would not be a bad strategy if she were chasing rich guys. In this movie, you really want to believe that a foxy con artist would spend time with bartenders and Andrew "Dice" Clay. You're welcome. This big mistake in Jewel's scheme is really the only conversation found in that stinker (and that's unintentional). When you see it, it's not hard to believe that a good movie could be in there somewhere. One night at McCool just could not decide which direction to go, so he sat like a dead armadillo in the middle of the road. It tries to be sexy, but the clothes are not removed in front of the camera, and the few scenes of the body are terribly pedestrian. There is a recurring scene in which a hitman asks the protagonist (played by Matt Dillon) after sex with Jewel. It seems Matt does not know, and the audience does not. Why did he even date her? A night at Mccool's also wants to be funny. Sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings did not work at Three's Company. What's worse, this film really looked like a dark atmosphere accompanying its comedy. A bit like a co-operative sophomoric movie, but his flat screenplay could not play either subtlety or a dull directional hammer at any kind of shock. What remains for the audience is a movie that's too busy satisfying everyone and losing all appeal.
