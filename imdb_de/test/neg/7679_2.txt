The original Airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two B-movie episodes (Airport 1975, Airport '77) were at best entertaining fun, at worst an entertaining camp. However, this gross and inappropriate final entry lacks any entertainment value and a shocking contempt for the audience. It is unbearable and not even good for laughs. <br /> <br /> All three "Airport" episodes were theatrical releases made by Universal's TV Wings, but this is inferior even to the modest standards of a television movie of its time, with cheap production, grotesque casting and visual ugliness and tasteless, listless "comedy". The project was clearly doomed to failure by Universal Executive Jennings Lang's "creative" effort, who personally produced and received a "story" editor. <br /> <br /> Everybody starts somewhere, and the writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) could do this As in the previous films (especially the notorious 1975 airport) it had an element of self-centredness, but in Roth's turgid, incoherent writing and even in the comedy Airplane is nothing to spoof! The crude remained untouched. <br /> <br /> What makes the Concorde: Airport '79 particularly offensive is its offensive abuse of professionals. The worst victim is the highly gifted Cicily Tyson (Sounder, Jane Pittman's autobiography), who was mercilessly reduced to a miserable negotiation accompanying a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. <br /> <br /> A special kick in the groin area is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who plays the real lead role despite being buried in the cast list. As the official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actor in all four films, Kennedy had more than earned the lead role, and his captaincy move would have been the only possible reason for this post, except for the squeeze of a last buck of heartiness Kennedy offers real humor in this mechanical muckup. He briefly puts aside the bravura machismo and reveals a truly sweet and tender side as well as his lovable and heroic character of "Joe Patroni". Unfortunately, we must never forget how fat and old and above the hill is Kennedy, and the very handsome boy Alain Delon calls him relentlessly "Porky Pig" as part of a mate tie that falls flat completely. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this airplane wreck, proves to be the only preparation for a hateful joke about Patronis, Kennedy, and the cost of the viewer.
