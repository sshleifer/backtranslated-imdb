Formal film about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilean, who wants to inherit a fortune, gets involved in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered was Valentina Vargas. No real surprises here, though it's nice to see Vargas. Great-looking Chilean landscapes, but Malcolm McDowells part is very small and does not contribute much to the film. Michael Ironside plays a bad guy as usual, but that's not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are common.
