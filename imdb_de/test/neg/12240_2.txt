The comeback is a parody of inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you - it's not a good movie. Tom Brady (the director) probably thought it was funny to refer to sports movies (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! To The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) And in a couple of sex jokes, the funniest thing ever would be plane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slippery job, you would have thought it was written in a week. I've found that the movie is good when a director loves the genre. Obviously, Brady does not love the genre he fakes. This movie is a rancid piece of garbage that is not worth seeing, so do not look!
