The Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their little daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real daughter) are doing strange things when they move into a big, newly-inherited house in Ireland. Crunchy bodies are found in the cellar, a turkey spurts blood, furniture movements and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady emerge to frighten the little girl. Paranormal investigators are finally summoned to evict the evil spirits, but Maura is still obsessed and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver. <br /> <br /> This film is full of clich√©s, but there is an outstanding performance by Alexandra Paul. .. too bad that it does not belong in this movie (no other, which occurs to me by hand)! She can barely keep a straight face and her over-emotional and hysterical screaming tantrums are a pleasure to see. In any case, she is much more interesting than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
