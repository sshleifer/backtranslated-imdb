When I think of TV movies, I always think about this movie, I've seen it a few times on Sky Movies, it was awful. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I saw this movie. was just on the Internet and came here to her: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on vacation with her son (William Flemming), in this resort they somehow meet with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / owns a bar?) and Kathy Johnson. It's like a weird romantic thing, William starts falling in love with Kathy, and Paul falls in love with Linda. <br /> <br /> A guy walks out on a street, he has a mark on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a deep-sea diver who saw a light on a dive or saw something and converted to religion), says he'll take care of this person, there's a gap in my memory, then there's a big break-through of the virus, I think Linda offers her help to find a cure, Kathy gets infected (William notices a marker on Kathy's arm.)), with the virus, does Joseph too. <br /> <br /> Paul says a few lines to Joseph, then Joseph stumbles away, the next time you see Joseph, he is healed, as this information is used to cure the infected, then there is one Beach party, the end.
