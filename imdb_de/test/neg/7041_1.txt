I am an Indian living in the United States. Why India continues to mimic like a stupid animal everything that is not American for me !! The main problems with the movie are not the inhuman plot and the stupid comedy. It's true that this movie has a lot of sex, touches, women who dress like trumpets on the street, and a lot of curses that are not on TV. <br /> <br /> To the producers and directors of this film I have the following message: They continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our nation by doing this kind of garbage. They continue to make young women believe that it is okay to be feminist and have no morality. They continue to make dance songs, which are among the lowest of adult clubs and bars. I am ashamed to be an Indian after seeing such films. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the United States government suggested that Iran could best be destroyed by sending mini-jackets there. This is not necessary for India. We will destroy ourselves with such a garbage.
