Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It is a shame that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s due to mistreatment on the part of the producers. MacNee probably regretted this just like any other fan. Linda Thorson was fine as a spare part and her episodes retained almost all the features and aspects of the rig episodes - only the rig / macnee chemistry was missing. The New Avengers should have stayed on the shelf - a shrinking Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and a man who's the hell of a gambit. Also, the humor was enforced and poor - of course I only saw a few episodes because that was all I could see, but I think I got the idea. Try as many as you can and do, it's almost impossible to revive an old show as a new format or movie.
