Rather inadvertently, Fonda, Stanwyck and the minor cast had a 3-1 point. <br /> <br /> I've never seen him - just look at him and he's just reached the part where Henry Fonda is carrying babs across the threshold. If I keep watching, I'll just see if Fonda and Stanwyck are able to pull it out of the dump truck. <br /> <br /> But after reading the other comments from the audience, I'm not optimistic. <br /> <br /> The opening of the ski scenes was enough to disturb my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously made in a recording studio, and the editing between the outdoor shots and the close-ups was horrible. I do not know much about the technology of the time - but I can not believe there was nothing they could do to make them more believable. <br /> <br /> My second breath of unbelief was when Fonda was wiped out and (I imagine, because of the extreme cruising speed) that he was dug head first into the snow up to his upper body - Stanwyck pulls him out with obvious difficulty - and (I imagine she is such an experienced doctor) does not respond at all to his seemingly unconscious state and his flaccid posture. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm fully capable of exposing my unbelief, but I could not get over the fact that she had just started a man with a man for possible head injury and that he was paralyzed for life could be. Not my idea of ​​big yuks. <br /> <br /> After completing this comment, we have just seen Kirk's first jealous outburst, and Dr. Hunt is doing an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate anymore - the script, the background music or the story !! Argghhhh! I'm done. Game over. Click.
