Slow, lumbering movie with terrible actors as a whole - but beautiful places and garments to admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who, as always, does a compelling job. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so stupid !! But Dalton is always worth a visit, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor who is older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is only worth a look to see it ... and he seems like he's wandering into a Roman romance, a poor guy. Your time would be better if you look at Mr. Dalton in the 70s "Wuthering Heights" or the early BBC version of "Jane Eyre" of the 1980s. Poor Sela Ward, so beautiful, but so wooden ... sure she was better in other films.
