It's one of two movies on Tales of Voodoo Volume 1, but there's no voodoo or supernatural in it! The box will display "Hell Hole," but the screen title will be "Escape from Hell Hole." The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole (1978), also known as "Escape from Women's Hell Hole". A group of women bathe in a river and apparently the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom they easily overpower. No nudity in this or any other scene. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena drives in a car and seems to be known and loved by all women. She invites Indri, with her and her uncle M.G. Once they get there, it's clear that M.G. Indri wants to take virginity. M. G. He runs a kind of house of prostitution, and is either responsible for a corrupt branch of the military, or leads a paramilitary unit, or prefers his guards to wear all military uniforms. <br /> <br /> The women who reject him or otherwise cause trouble, are put in a prison. Indri is sent there. The women are tortured and sometimes raped by the guards. <br /> <br /> Various unsuccessful escape or rescue attempts are being made, but they inevitably fail despite the apparent benefits of women: they outnumber the number of guards and relatively few. The guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or handguns. <br /> <br /> WIP genre enthusiasts may like it, and the fact that it was made in the Philippines is something new, but otherwise .. eh.
