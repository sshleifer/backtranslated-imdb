When a movie called Hell Ride comes out, expect a certain amount of biker clich√©. With character names like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent", I prepared myself for the worst and was just hit in the face by it. Dialogue, soundtrack and recording style are standard on biker films. The dusty desert blurred with the heat as bikes ripped down the street as "CC Rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawning! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. When I saw old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a damn frilly shirt) driving along a dusty desert strip, I reminded of two men desperately trying to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best, but with such bad material he lost. Even a performance by Dennis Hopper in a full Easy Rider swing could not save him. And let's talk about the shop we bought. Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It is not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so outstanding is that he knows it's overkill, so he just gets out of the way and gets it up as far as possible. Bishop took this movie so seriously that it was just a bad copy of the genre.
