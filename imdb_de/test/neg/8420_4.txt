Dry, irreverent, but sad satire from detective films. Michael Caine with the Stone Face plays a British author of dirty crime thrillers traveling to the Mediterranean to write the memoirs of a wannabe gangster; Soon he realizes that he is being persecuted and his life is in danger. Caine narrates the story with clever wit and soft sarcasm, but his real achievement is without energy (Caines flashes of rage or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and he does not connect with anyone on the screen). Other performers (notably Mickey Rooney, a silver-haired Lionel Stander and Lizabeth Scott) are very good in colorful Outr√© roles, although Al Lettieri has an obvious role as a seemingly cross-dressing homosexual (Lettieri is insulted without being able to defend himself an unenviable position). The author and director Mike Hodges has the germ of a good idea (satirizing 1940s detective films without compromising the hard-boiled talk and stubborn milieu), but he does not have a strong sense of humor. If a Bogart peer - who asks a question about a hawk - is the best joke, what follows is anemic. ** from ****
