Although many Billie Dove fans are enthusiastic about their work here, I have to pass. As a socially prominent member of the British Smart Set, her British accent is essentially nonexistent, and her line readings sound just like line readings, and her emotions are tranceous and cumbersome. Basil Rathbone, usually a good actor, looks weird through and through - in his case something like Italian, though we're not sure. The script manages to keep its exact ethnic origin a secret. He is further hampered by the script that gives him one of those old filmic diseases that have to do with nerves and that need surgery. The only real entertainment is the famous Kay Francis, who in his role as a corrupted countess wears a lacquered bob with side curls that shamelessly engulfs men, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. She manages it with her unique serenity. She is the only creature in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
