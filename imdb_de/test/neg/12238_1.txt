If Jack Black were to be the lead actor, I would have stayed away from the movie right away. It actually makes some of his films look good compared to this movie. This movie was filmed as a cartoon from 3-8 years ago and would have been much better. It is nothing more than an idiot of the dumbest skits from other films that cause a big mess. The film looks like it was filmed one day without any thought at all. There are a few times when it looks like there may be a turning point, and the movie does indeed have a plot for the movie, or at least an action would evolve, but the stupid sketches that are inserted ruin the whole movie.
