I'm sorry to rain on the parade of everyone. Just a small background about me: I like and know a lot about the Asian cinema, especially the Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly, I'm a newcomer to South Korean cinema, but if that's the best of the best, I'm sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded about foreign film appreciation and do not fit the stereotype of the "stupid American". , , Well, not perfect. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the high praise that is given to this piece of nothing will be bestowed. This is a disgusting * and * ridiculous movie. Hammy acting - everything is done badly and exaggerated, as if begging for the attention of the uneducated viewer. Terrible camera work, with emphasis on pointless close-ups derived from MTV aesthetics. <br /> <br /> The plot is full of holes as a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for entertainment, I want to close my eyes to small, inappropriate details. But excuse me, what happens here that * can * withstand a comprehensive test? This story of an incredibly complicated and contrite revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story you can read in the supermarket. (I do not want to spoil your "indulgence", if that's the word, do not go into details of the plot.) The fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the "hero" who takes dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time after training ONLY during his imprisonment and punching a wall!) The really "outstanding" features of this film are two: the grim and incestuous sex (brother to sister and father to daughter, well, we got it since Oedipus developed, right?) and graphic violence. The cut body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - along with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die to make this film?) Have no aesthetic function / motivation. <br /> <br /> A celebration for the S & M, which was admitted, but even for this a celebration without merit and subtlety. Heaven, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-discussed work on a nearly similar topic was not that bad. <br /> <br /> The unquestionably good press that makes this overbearing, exaggerated, overlong piece of redundant piece of Korean shores I wonder what's going on. I do not believe in the ultimate design, and I'm often willing to accept that a movie I did not enjoy might be better than I could perceive. However, I have no qualms if I call this here the way I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming qualities. My 2c? Find something that works better with your time.
