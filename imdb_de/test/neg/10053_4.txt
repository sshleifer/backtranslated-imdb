CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie, it is announced that the bridge collapsed within days of being captured. The impression is that the attack was all in vain. In fact, Remagen Bridge was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies wanted to achieve for six months. Since the Remagen Bridge had been taken, the war ended in a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge only has to pass one day after its conquest. This was enough time for the Americans to send combat technicians and great protection to the other side, and they could then build a series of pontoon bridges. The capture of the bridge was a complete success, meaning that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer. In contrast to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was greeted with joy by the troops who did. They knew how important the battle was. <br /> <br /> This film has little to do with real history. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time it was produced.
