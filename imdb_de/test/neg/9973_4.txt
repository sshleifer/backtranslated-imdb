I was looking forward to watching this movie and was extremely disappointed to find it complete and totally garbage. Akerman's direction is both harsh and clichéd (how much more cliché can you get at night than Paris?). The male occupation seems to have been exhausted because she opposed Egon Schiele's frightened self-portraits. But the issues of jealousy and betrayal, which should be in the foreground of a film of this kind, are virtually unexplored. What's left is a turgid melodrama that takes an age to get started, and even longer to finish. The only advantage of this kind of movie is that you realize how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.
