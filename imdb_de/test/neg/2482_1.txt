Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that people dig this garbage. Most television shows are pretty bad, and this has been a current trend for some time - they are getting worse and worse, but Las Vegas definitely brings it home. What a horrible show ... <br /> <br /> The actors are a bunch of C + -Lossers who have never gone anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows what he thinks when he joined posted this post)) so it's not her fault that this show is shit. You just can not help it. Blame the producer and the authors. I can not believe that they shot that and were really proud of their work to send it out.
