I saw the North American premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was more than disappointed. Due to the mood in the audience, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a long time to get to the conflict. He refuses, however, to solve it. Instead, he wants to tell us the story "To be continued". Is it a spoiler that reveals that a movie has no end? I think it's more of a warning. That's only half a movie at best - not the good half.
