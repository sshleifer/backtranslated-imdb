Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and asked me how it could be in the Oscar list. The saddest things are: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Ghengis-Khan, the cruel and powerful emperor of Asia, be played by a benevolent, good actor with warm and loving eyes - with the exception of one scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: There's nothing about how he became Emperor; nothing about where he spends 20 years between his childhood and his mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. Click! - Immediately in the next second, he leads the huge army without any reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Ghengis Khan is only nicely explained by the help of a wolf / god / the one who was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man love his wife this way after not having seen her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the sword fight, if you just ride your horse through the enemy lines and sit there with two swords and all die around you? Does Ridley Scott know that too? <br /> <br /> 7. Why does not Khan's mother look older after 20 to 30 years? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (None. Literally.) Do not waste your time. Really. The work of the cinematographers is good; Nature is outstanding - but the film can not be shot without a director and screenplay. The real Ghengis Khan would execute the director in a second moment. <br /> <br /> Best regards.
