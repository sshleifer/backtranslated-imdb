I remember a holiday in Florida when this movie was aired. I had set up my video recorder for recording. The anticipation killed me. I had known about the movie since it was announced half a year ago. We came back from Florida 4 days after the film was aired, and I immediately looked at it. I tried so hard to like it, but I did not. <br /> <br /> I'm a huge fan of HUGE 3. And as such, I know a lot about them. So it was not like I expected to learn anything from the movie, and I did not. I was more interested in the depictions and accuracy of their information. Much was wrong with this movie. The actors, the script, the reenactments, ALL could have been much better. Paul Ben-Victor is a hugely talented actor. But let's face facts, Moe Howard was far beyond his reach. He does not look like him, he does not sound like him and therefore can not act like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his portrayal of Curly did not quite score with me, although he did so well when Curly fell ill. John Kassir's portrayal of Shemp could have been better rehearsed. It was more of a bad impression than a presentation. The worst was Joe Besser. They made him thin and annoying than he really was. It was just laziness. I do not like the Joe shorts because, as the movie shows, he was hardly ever hit. But he was not that annoying and definitely not that skinny. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate stooping. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is far too frizzy and too red. I know that's too technical, so I will not count that on my list, why I did not like this movie. Back to Shemp, who is just my favorite henchman. He is written as a whining, trembling chicken. He had many phobias, but he was not that bad. He did not leave the group at first because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like him, Shemp went off, because he received an offer from another studio that he simply could not refuse. Instead of the truth, this movie chooses to wet the bed, no less on Larry, walk into a closet, and bow shyly out of the group. Another problem is that Shemp has made almost as many Columbia shorts as Curly did as a henchman, but only one, Fright Night, which was his first, is shown. His career was almost completely ignored. Besides, lousy editing has caused a terrible and unforgivable mistake. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died in late 1955. That would make him old at death? Well, here's a hint, it's not 59, as the movie indicates. <br /> <br /> Now to write, which in my opinion was flawed only because this movie had leaked out. Some of the lines are stupid and could be much better developed and / or introduced than they were. The one line that really impressed me was at the end of the movie when Moe shows the promoter how to close his eyes. <br /> <br /> "That's how we do it, make contact with the frontal bone, not the eyes, but look real in the movie." This line was poorly written and badly inserted into the movie. It's supposed to be one of those lines that make the audience say OH! Amazed and I am sure that some people did, but the end of the movie was not the place for this line. A better place, you ask? How about when you first appear in Columbia and get introduced to the sound effects engine? I know that initially there was no sound for the eyes, but Moe could have said, "What about that?" and Eyepokes Curly or Larry. Jules White then says "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" There were many wrong lines in this movie, which is a clear indication that the script was wiped out. Another is the origin of the name Shemp, although it's not that bad, and I'll let that one slide. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie good? It shows how the henchmen of Columbia were screwed, what they were. I'm not sure if Moe was an errand boy, but that was the kind of dramaturgy that should make the viewer sympathize with them. I know that this movie was a dramatization. I do not know everything will be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect. However, some of the things they invented and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's stroke is not as close as in real life. I know, I know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatization is to make real events more dramatic. Curly's blow in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. Here is what really happened. Curly sat in a chair in front of the screen when a scene was shot. They called him for the last pie-fight scene, but there was no answer. Moe went to fetch him and discovered that his little brother had slumped his head, half paralyzed, unable to speak and running tears across his face. Moe then said "Babe?" and tried to help him out of his chair. Poor Curly falls to his knees. Then the ambulance was called. All in all, this movie was not terrible, but it was definitely not good or even ok. This film portrays the henchmen helpless and inaccurate and sometimes goes overboard with dramatization. There is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this movie. If you do not believe me, look up a name called Stooge in the threestooges.com news forum. It's about one and a half pages long. I can let some things in the film slip. But others were unforgivable. The Three Stooges were geniuses, and many of today's comedies are based on what they did. Do not Believe Me Look at the Simpsons, and more Ren & Stimpy. But this film can not capture her genius. It's inaccurate, which is very important, which is important, but if the title of the film is going to be the Three Stooges, above all, it has to show their ingenuity and originality.
