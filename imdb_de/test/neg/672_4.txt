Noteworthy here is the CinemaScope color cinema by Leon Shamroy, including the use of color filters for various scenes. The Alfred Newmann Score is the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood has ever produced. Too bad that it is no longer available on CD. The actors never come for the occasion though. The accents are so different, from the subject British Ustinov and Purdom to Baxter and Mature Hollywood that it seems like a real hodgepodge with no central vision. Tommy Rettig is scary American. Performing styles range from zombies to stilts. Only Ustinov as a compassionate one-eyed servant steals the show - what is there to steal from it. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god, Ra - pursued by the authorities - has its interesting points. However, when the plot of the film subsides, the haunting music and visualizations are preserved.
