A poor basketball movie. A grumpy coach with a doubtful background comes to a small high school basketball team in Indiana in the 1950s and trains the boys to victory by "dismantling them first and building them up." Object. Photography okay. But the plot is absolutely predictable. No real negotiations. Nothing added to make the movie exciting. They know what will happen from the beginning. Suitable for 4th grade.
