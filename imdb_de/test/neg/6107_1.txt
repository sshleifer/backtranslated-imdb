The film is a crude misrepresentation of orthodox life and practice. NEVER, a Jewish court will enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to ever happen. Childless couples find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community, as depicted in the film. They are treated extremely sensitive. In fact, many great rabbis spent their lives without children and never opted for divorce. The portrayal of Yosef, a terrible human, is supposed to show, perhaps unconsciously, the behavior of a typical Orthodox male. In fact, it is as typical as a violent drunkard typical of secular society. Both exist in their own world and both are despicable. <br /> <br /> It's surprising that so many people get a picture of a MOVIE-based society (from someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that because of their narrow-mindedness and their insular lifestyle, it is only the Orthodox who direct all secular people to violence and immoral behavior that they read about in newspapers or see in movies.
