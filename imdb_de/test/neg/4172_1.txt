Apparently this was a laureate. Apparently someone had a gun against his head and had to nominate Maize: the movie. <br /> <br /> Or that must have been a mistake. <br /> <br /> This is the unsurpassed movie ever made. The show and the cut are the biggest horror of this movie. Two little girls get lost in a corn field and are persecuted by someone who hears laughter under his rubber mask. The little girls run into their hero father and then run away from him, W.T.F. The hero-father in the movie does not lose her in the few minutes he saw it. <br /> <br /> The girls were obviously not trained actors and had no common sense. They were so annoying and so infantile in the movie that they did not even seem comedic. They kept screaming like a broken record, which is why I got up and left. You can not even hear this movie without almost cramping it. <br /> <br /> I can puke a better laureate than this trash.
