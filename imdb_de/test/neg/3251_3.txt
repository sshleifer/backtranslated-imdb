Usually I give sequels the benefit of the doubt and scissor the matter. But that is very bad. Exactly what happened in the first movie happens here again. Just the same Only they wanted younger kids to see it (this is responsible for the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny, but why they threw a "fck" is inexplicable to me) to change Jackie Mason's character from Dangerfield. Let me explain that in CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield has played a stockbroking real estate owner who upset the upset members of the Bushwood Country Club. In this film, Jackie Mason plays a stocky real estate owner who upset the upset members of the Bushwood Country Club. A big effort to change the contents of the script, right? No I do not think so. A very listless Dan Aykroyd shamelessly copies the character of Murray Murray. He even goes after the gopher (now more like a gremlin) in the same way as Murray. <br /> <br /> There is no laughter. An example of the "comedy" in this film: Jackie Mason prepares for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his robe. He goes to the door to get dressed in his bedroom when the door handle breaks. Impressive!?! That's the best thing they can do. Eight years to think of a whole new sequel and that's all we get!?! I could have pulled a better script out of my ass. <br /> <br /> See it only if you're a die-hard fan of the original. It's the only way you can find any laughs in it. Everyone else steers clear.
