Renee Zellweger shines, but the rest of the movie just does not work. It's like a hamburger-yello-mold salad - an interesting idea, but who would ever have thought that it would actually work on film? I like the two previous films of director LaBute - they were mercilessly honest and uncomfortably funny. This movie manages to be merciless and daunting - with huge cuts. (As a high concept, think: the Doris Day Rock Hudson movie that Sam Peckinpah might have made - now reduce your expectations to today's mass-produced state of Hollywood.) These actors are as talented as Freeman, Kinnear Eckhart, Vince and Janney FAST bring their scenes to life, showing how talented they are to rise above material that just can not hold together. I would have found Freeman's crazy, well-talking speech at the end of the film funny (in the Lynchean way) if there was not a nagging suspicion that this unconvincing presumptuousness should be taken seriously.
