I'm sorry if I disappoint someone, what I want to say to this TV movie. But I paid money for the movie and found that this movie is a disaster. The director is really bad. After looking up the information here, I realized that there may be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing. Maybe they have no budget, but still Ang Lee's sense and sensibility had little money, but it was a hit. The director in this movie did a really bad job telling the story, and the movie could not even sustain a reasonable continuity in itself. It always pulls me out of scenes. Maybe someone has to work hard on story / board. The dubbed sound is terribly bad too. My God ... Normally, I would appreciate any movie because behind it are the ideas and ideas of an individual. But this time I'm just angry: "I really want to beat something HART." ... just do not do the work if someone can not do it optimally. Poor arts (it's not even art, what's that?), Really hurt people.
