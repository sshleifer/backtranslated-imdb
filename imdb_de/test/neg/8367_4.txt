At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety that loves her live action movies and the animated stuff) when you're a kid, if you're a kid in the heart, almost as much as you hardly know that you are an adult, if you absolutely love every movie in which animals are seen, especially if they do tricks or if you are not overly demanding. I am a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this movie enough and I will gladly look at it again. <br /> <br /> But boy, it has a lot of problems. The main flaw comes from a combination of too many characters, too many plot threads, and too little time to worry about them all. Within 82 minutes, we have adults who marry, adolescents fall in love and try not to be awkward, teen competition for love and jealousy, children playing spy games, dogs falling in love, dogs playing football, dogs having puppies , manipulative parents who do everything they can to help their children achieve victory by learning a lesson from their children, housekeeper dilemmas and crooks who cook and execute elaborate plans. I'm probably forgetting something, but these are 10 big issues that need to be dealt with, with less than 10 minutes per thread, to deal with and probably weave them into a coherent whole, both of which are not too complicated - this is a breeze. Film, after all - and that's also funny and heartwarming. Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, who was fully responsible in his first round (he has much experience with the second unit), was not up to the task. I am sure that it did not help that at least three screenwriters were involved and probably also dictate producers. <br /> <br /> The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely choppy. Events often occur with little reason and explanation. People understand and do things first and foremost because they have to - and fast - so that everything arrives where it must arrive in less than 90 minutes. From one cut to the next, time could advance by about six months. We have both adults who appear to be mentally handicapped and children who intuitively find out what a dog is thinking, and throw in an unexpected action. Some of the threads should have just been removed because it's hard to get too involved with the movie, once you get familiar with an idea, it's already over. Also, unhelpful is the fact that one of the threads is essentially a rip-off of a hundred and a Dalmatian (1961), minus a Cruella De Vil character. And another problem is that, given the way the film is being processed, I have to assume that the dog Air Bud probably could not do much with football. Unlike the first two films, a dog doing a sport is almost a pensive one here, and when we see it, it looks very fast; Every now and then, these snippets seem to be supported by computer animation. <br /> <br /> For someone like me, there's a cheesy charm for Air Bud: World Pup. The script and the performances often vary between ridiculous, hokey and somehow clich√©d. I tend to like this combination. It makes the movie a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. And sometimes, as in the end, when the movie gives up on consistency and essentially becomes a commercial for the American women's football team, Air Bud: World Pup is so blatant that one can not help but love.
