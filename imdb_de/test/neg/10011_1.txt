A big disappointment for an incredible movie. Unbelievably bad. Very presumptuous It would be nice if someone only gave an important role to a young woman who is not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We do not really learn anything about this character except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We do not know, why. Nicholas Cage performs excellently, as always, but I feel that role and script have failed him. And how can he have an erection on the deathbed after he could not play the whole movie? Really awful and I felt like I needed a bath.
