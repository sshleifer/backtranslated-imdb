The first DH was not that great, but I really did not expect it. However, this terrible movie was uncritical. I really try to see the bright side and give such films a chance, but I just could not find a really good thing about them. I appreciate what Bill Cowell wanted, but this movie was just too boring. The story of the movie is really not that bad. Actually it is something original. But the movie form is really as bad as many people say. In my opinion, this is with "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000" at the top. I know a lot of people who really throw garbage and shoot movies like this, but I really can not think of any other good things about it.
