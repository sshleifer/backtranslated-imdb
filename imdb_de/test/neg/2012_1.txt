Oh dear gods, that's terrible. Stay away, stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never has my brain hurt as much as after this movie. Action, if you may call it that, is enough to cause internal bleeding in your head. The story is so skinny that it's still there ... no wait, scratch that. There is not a complete story, but every now and then there are a few thin lines that stand out from all the scary stuff, and believe me, these few lines should have been shot. The best way to enjoy this movie is to throw napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from afar. <br /> <br /> Some call me sarcastic in this review, but I'm just trying to save some of you from a serious headache. However, if you're a visual masochist (as I am), which I would like to call, please continue and look at this monstrosity.
