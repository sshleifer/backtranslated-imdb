On Saturday morning, the time for "Looking For Lola" came on HBO. I decided to give it a try, although the description of the movie looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The movie was unbelievably unbelievable and there was absolutely no chemistry on the screen between the main cast that I shook my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes where he skips the bill in a fancy restaurant and where Lola (lead actress) allows him to use her boss's house to make his parents feel rich, it was almost as bad as he "daydreaming" about the people around him doing the Macarena (it was awful!) and the two actors finally falling in love. I always wanted to change channels, but I tried to give him every opportunity to become a cute love story with a few giggles. That never did. In fact, it got so bad that I decided to end it, just to be able to say that I've seen one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, instead of being criticized for not having "a fair chance had given. The last scene in which Lola tried out a dance was the highlight of the film. She does not come in until late in the marriage (even the scene where Mike tells the priest to hurry up, then he just rips off the papers, claiming that this was done was in line with the credibility of this movie), and then he "convinces" the judges. Look at them. The two male judges are already embarrassed, what time it is. But after watching them on stage (ok, she's dancing well, but not particularly impressive) everyone comes along, including Lola and Mike's families, other dancers who were there, and even the judges. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write a review. Watch at your own risk.
