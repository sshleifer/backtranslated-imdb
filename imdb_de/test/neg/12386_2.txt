OK, this "horror movie" should be a joke, right? Tell me, it should be a joke, then I will understand. <br /> <br /> A big croaking bird with huge claws - or at least a claw - falls on unsuspecting people on the ground and devours them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow are overreacting enough to keep things interesting, but at least you'll enjoy a hearty giggle when you see the "monster". It looks like a mix of a crazy chicken and Mortimer Snerd. <br /> <br /> Each of the directors Fred Sears hurried this picture and knew that the bird looked absolutely ridiculous, or he really thought that his movie and his creature were genuinely frightening. I prefer to think - and hope - it was the former. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
