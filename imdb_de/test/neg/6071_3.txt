Dreadful! <br /> <br /> Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the film is by far the worst I've seen over a composer and the worst of a release Masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictional things to improve a biography that could not otherwise be so "charming". This was done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this B-copy here is a mistake. Beethoven had a strong personality but was a sensible artist. But here in this movie he looks much more than Mike Tyson! I also wonder if, despite his deafness, he has heard all the whispers in the last few scenes (maybe a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with a nice maestro. Most of them conduct modern Wagnerian orchestras today. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
