I took my 14-year-old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely terrible! This movie should be rated at least R. I'm not that strict with movies, but that was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain a comedy, and I knew the comedy would probably be crude, but that was far more than crude. I sat there looking and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how grossly sexual it was. I could not believe it would be okay for a 13-year-old to read and see this content. I do not understand how the rating system works.
