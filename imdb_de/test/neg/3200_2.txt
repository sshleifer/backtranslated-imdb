I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but not as good as the first critters. The third episode is a bit boring, but nice. And what is that?? What a crap! It's stupid and really, really boring. It's the worst of the series. I can not see it anymore because I fell asleep at the first clock. And Ug's evil side ... eeewww ... that's one of the most horrible moments in the movie. For the first 50 minutes, we can not see the small, furry monsters. Therefore, the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the film. > <br /> 2/10
