Duncan Roy's writing and directing is really and regularly below average. Actually it stinks somehow. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, selfish) remake of Dorian Gray - an absurd, distorted dialogue between the 'upper class' characters, who is at the same time idiotic and overbearing, amateurish and bent to the ground. Characteristics and script - and sometimes the drama - creak like a school play ... but worse, there is a kind of self-assurance of the peacock about the direction that only destroys the soul, if the director obviously did not understand it ... he just is not good. Diana Quick shuddered with embarrassment. DR you should just get out of the movie ... seriously.
