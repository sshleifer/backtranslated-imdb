I'm not going to say that the show is anything but bad, because there are some funny parts like Spencer and some random incidents. But other than that, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom kids go shopping for. Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she is mediocre in ICarly and is not as funny as she tries to be. The actress Sam plays seems to be half asleep most of the time, and her antics are so cliched that I would think of her. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is okay, but not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. But some are annoying. Here are some: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14 and have a web show that reveals too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 (WTF), with little to no advertising, and they can continue to assume that their lives will not be attacked by crazy people. <br /> <br /> 2. Their web show is praised too much ($ 100,000 annually to promote sneakers, a free trip to Japan, Plain White Ts performance, etc.). Honestly, anyone over 6 years of age will not find his "comedy" entertaining. <br /> <br /> 3. How come they are so "average" even though they own a three-story loft, Spencer can barely afford and yet afford many basic amenities and they can afford all the equipment for a web -Shower feature? 4. All adults are idiots. All of them. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5 foot tall girl, no matter how vile and stubborn, can tear down trained police unless she's muscular. Sam is thin and petite. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can drop and live 9 stories in a lift. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can handle criminals better than bulls. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. Actually, it does seem harmless, but getting kids to think they might be offensive to their elders when they live in Seattle, when they're only 14 years old and have an irresponsible idiot and reveal personal information is easy not correct. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, who is three years old, enjoys the show. What happened to the cartoons when I was their age?
