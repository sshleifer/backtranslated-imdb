Love sublime says the title. Another blurb during the film's promotions talked about inner and outer beauty. Well, in this case, the beauty - you decide internally or externally - will come from a lightly clad Zeenat Aman (or the slightly dressed / undressed) Zeenat Aman, whom director Raj Kapoor described during the filming as a "Volcano of Giftedness." Of course you can not accuse him of sarcasm - after all, he has promoted his own film. <br /> <br /> The paper-thin plot is a disfigured woman with a well-proportioned body. a great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar), in which the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He not only wants her face, but also her voice. The acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music, in which Lata Mangeshkar gives good numbers. The rest of course is Bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty against external beauty. !!! You do not have to be Einstein to find out who the director was focused on
