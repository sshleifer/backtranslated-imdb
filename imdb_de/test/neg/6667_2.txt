This film gives an insight into the suffering of a family at the death of a child and the healing that can eventually come to them. The family learns on Christmas Eve 1991 of the death of their son to ruin the Christmas time for them. They have not celebrated it for many years. There is an interesting comment by the daughter reminding the audience to consider the needs of the surviving children in such a situation. The Matthew character refers to Jesus, but I suspect that other comments come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if other viewers would recognize these comments. If so, this would be an interesting addition to the data in this film.
