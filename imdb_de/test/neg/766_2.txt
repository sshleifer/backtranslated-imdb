Tom and Jerry transport goods by air to Africa. As white men, however, they are worried that they can not be safe. Therefore, they wear black face to adapt. Once they wear them, they adopt black dialect and inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the aircraft as a raft. Before they reach the land, they suffer the advance of an overly handsome octopus and a more serious threat from sharks, a swordfish and a whale. Once ashore, they frighten you from fantastic creatures and duck into a cave. Inside, it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in Blackface. And when you leave the cave, things are even worse than when they are discovered by cannibals. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a particularly sloppy effort by Van Beuren Studios. For example, a lion Tom and Jerry do not know enters the cave before doing so. But the animators must have forgotten it, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the end that is not an end: it's just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to a YouTube poster, the cartoon "originally contained the voices AND cartoons of a popular 'Negro' comedy team known as Miller & Lyles, but Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle had to revise the animation into a "Tom & Jerry" story. "/> They should not have bothered. The raw animations and the poorly executed gags make the movie a loser from start to finish.
