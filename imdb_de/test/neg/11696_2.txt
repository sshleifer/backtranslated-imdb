Having just seen Acacia, I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian and Korean horror and had great expectations for this movie. Man, I was disappointed. When I saw that, I always thought, "You sure do that to meet me later, unprepared," and I had expected for a while that something brilliant would happen. But I realized slowly that the movie is really that bad. It's the cheapest money on the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The basic story may not be that bad, but the way it is filmed, it seems to be the most laughable act ever. The tree as a "frightening" device might be fine if used skillfully, but the filmmaker keeps giving us different shots of ... yeah, a tree, over and over again. He seems to hope that the tree will do all the stress and agglomeration work for him, but it just feels like it is: taking pictures of a tree. For heaven's sake! <br /> <br /> Slow build-ups can be very effective, and a movie that gives the viewer few glimpses of the wrong can cause a good fear, but not acacia. Sure, we can take a look at a kid on a tricycle disappearing around a corner, and again meaningful shots of the tree from above or below or from the side, but these scenes are just not scary. You feel stupid, especially because you realize that the director thinks it's scary. They are just not. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I agree with some other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, the "descent into madness" of a figure is ridiculous. What Acacia really breaks, though, is the terrible editing. It's hard to understand why scenes were cut as they are, but it's bad, and it destroys every spark of interest it might have. It also gives me a feeling of patronizing because I can see what they want to do with it, but I can not believe that they think I would be interested in such cheap tricks. <br /> <br /> There are many great Asian ghost movies and many bad ones, but that's by far the worst I've ever seen. You have to go through the list of "what should I write in Ghost movies" and check them all off, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.
