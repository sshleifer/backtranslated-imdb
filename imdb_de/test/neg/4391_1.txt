This movie really hurts when watching. Not only did I not even laugh, I got a serious headache. Sometimes I was so sorry for the actors involved. The best way to sum up is that sex comedies are probably the least fun and least sexy of all time. I'm just sorry that I can not vote less than one vote. To grade this with a rating of one is an insult to any movie that scores at least two points. To hear that someone actually pays these people for another movie convinces me that there is just too much money in Hollywood. RISE YOUR TAXES !!! The continuation of this film could be a crime against humanity. Perhaps an international tribunal should be convened or US sanctions imposed on the filmmakers. Really really.
