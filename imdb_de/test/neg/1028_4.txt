I think only a select number of people were really interested in seeing a male hustler work in New York, but I would bet that even those brave souls were shut down by the irritating patchwork technique and intentionally muted sound recordings show here; The fact that these inherent "defects" were a direct consequence of the film's low-budget / underground / experimental nature is, in my opinion, not so important. Anyway, for those who tend to, the film shows a pronounced male nudity, and Joe Dallesandro understandably became an underground. and gay ?? Symbol! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure that shows the daily routine of the Hustler protagonist offers some mildly interesting scenes: his meeting with an eccentric older artist (and finally posing for him); the one in which Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual way of working and gives his specific approach to a few future "colleagues," including perhaps the most unlikely Hustler? a bespectacious nerd! Fortunately, the movie ran for just 89 minutes against the IMDb claim that their total length is 105 (but the latter could be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I've seen a few other Warhol 'films' films, and this movie is not as satisfying as the most bearable example I've ever seen, BAD (1977), and just a little better as that like MY HUSTLER (1965), who were mostly a burden. The fact that this was just the first part of a trilogy was not good, but as the saying goes, you have to do what you need to do, and the other two chapters had to follow in quick succession ... <br /> < Despite my generally negative reaction, FLESH is still valuable as a time capsule of the 1960s and a prototype of the underground scene of that time both in the cinema and in real life. For the record, a picture of Dallesandro from this film graces the sleeve of The Smiths' self-titled debut album from 1984, and the transsexual Candy Darling (which seems rather unremarkable here) was featured in "Candy Says," The Velvet Underground's opening track, immortalized the 1969 album of the same name. The latter band is my absolute favorite, and one of the reasons is that their unique and groundbreaking music has described a lifestyle that is so different from my own that this is truly a case , in which I ... much more acoustically experience than visually!
