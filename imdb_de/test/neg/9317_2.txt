Help! Once again, Paul Schrader sabotaged his own intentions with boring, pedantic storytelling. I arranged a holiday so that I could see this "world premiere". What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an exorcist film? High intentions are fine, but if I wanted to have 2 hours of theological chatter, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as portrayed at a younger age, is a potentially interesting topic. But an exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly sluggish presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, creates a strange production. Who is this movie for? I did not look at the Harlin version, but at least they seem to have tried to create a kind of visceral thrill. The first film was excellent, but each sequel was unloved and meaningless. Why do you keep going? I suspect Schrader managed to get a lot of money. But why should we go?
