Sacred Sweet Murder This is probably the least funny movie I have ever seen. You can take my word for the truth because it's on TV right now. It's really one of the most wretched productions I've ever seen. There is not one single redeemable aspect of this strip. it just lacks any humor. The only good thing it may have is that it is so insatiable that it is completely unthinkable. In fact, I just sat through a ridiculous negotiation and can not really tell you what was going on. The only reason I may even remember seeing this movie is because it is so completely humorless that it will forever be remembered for that fact. If your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and spare you the boredom.
