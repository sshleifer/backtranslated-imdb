SPOILER - This film gives away plot points and discusses the end. I hated this movie - mainly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film has glorified war and military technology - and blasted things really well. We get cheered as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies to pieces. And no US soldiers risk their lives - so it's a funny war. Aesthetically, there is no hint of real human emotions in the film, only complacent, privileged people who are sarcastic, feel superior, and do what they want, regardless of the consequences. And when it comes to consequences, the film makes only a few small hits, which has actually caused the arming of the Afghans. I had read an earlier draft of this script and ended on September 11 - Charlie Wilson realized that things had gone horribly wrong. But the audience would not feel good. This is a good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick.
