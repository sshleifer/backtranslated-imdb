When I shot this movie directly, I did not expect an amazing piece of cinematography. (Not only to say, just because a movie is in the cinema, but also.) Just loosely based on the story in the epic poem, this film offers a unique view of the history of monsters and superman. The general photography can be summarized as contradictory with its mixture of Middle Ages and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). Get away with a rock and techno soundtrack. The fighting scenes are unbelievable but entertaining, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting weapon combinations I've ever seen in the movie, even though they're often incredibly inefficient. The special effects used for the Monster Grendel are surprisingly effective and one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> As Beowulf, Christopher Lambert delivers an average performance. It will not be as memorable as Highlander, but at least it was not as poor as Fortress. The cast is rather neutral. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good action adventure story with a complex and engaging storyline, I would not recommend this movie. However, if you want a fleeting movie with many battle scenes and a somewhat predictable storyline, you will find a copy of it.
