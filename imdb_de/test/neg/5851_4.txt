The commercials for RAT RACE made it seem too youthful for me, but since my friend adores this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally gave in and watched it with him tonight. I let him see David Lynch movies and all kinds of obscure indie stuff (I forced URBANIA to do that recently), and I felt I owed him a harmless Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I did not want it to hurt feelings, so I saved my bitch for you. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but many things irritated me. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie", so I was a little surprised when I discovered that the first scene was about a porn movie. (I can hear it now: "Mom, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has nothing else to do in this movie except to stuff some nonsense into a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's quite convenient that all the characters within a timeframe played the slots where the gold coins were. What would have happened if they had not done it? Would these millionaire players just sit and wait? And how did they even get those gold coins in the slots? <br /> <br /> But I'm working on a plot that's necessary for the movie, so I'll continue. About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter: They meet for the first time, but throughout their ordeal, they do not argue with each other about themselves. Why should their relationship be complicated? Could not they have been on vacation with mother and daughter? Why business before a long-ago assumption? And why is the daughter portrayed as a hard-working career woman chained to her cell phone and never again needing to contact her company? Did the script simply forget this subdivision and the character trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this film - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; It's exhausting when everyone is crazy and has no identity. And one more thing - the events are not plausible. Sure, the characters can do some weird things, but the characters themselves must be credible. Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example. Frank Drebin has pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is theoretically possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's another kind of fun that makes the difference.) A RAT RACE character who defies the laws of nature by leaping into a raging move destroys any plausibility the movie may have ; These are obviously not real people, so why should I take care of them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral problem. The characters receive their means of transport almost exclusively through theft. I know, I know, this is just a stupid comedy, and the same actions did not bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but in RAT RACE there are a lot of lawbreakers, and that bothers me now. I'm not going to engage in the entire sequence of airport sabotages, except to ask if the scriptwriters did not consider the impact of such an action in real life. Was this scene funny before 9/11? <br /> <br /> I will skip the unpleasant things about the heart, the drugstore of my own family and the Nazis (whose structure and payoff worked better in an episode of "Seinfeld")), and complain about that Rowan Atkinson started getting annoying and ended unbearably, I do not know when I liked a weird character less, and the three Oscar winners need new agents Whoopi fell off the best, but she did not have much to do with her (loved the copper perm and the purple lipstick) Kathy Bates' part was shrill but graciously short Cuba was ... oh man Cuba, baby, please fire your agent! After INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR this is your third blow (be glad I did not see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS.) It's time to return the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor to the rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR) ... An actor of her size does not have a shop Running half naked through the desert and being examined by a Transvestite Lucille Ball impersonator. Are you still reading the scripts for your films, or are you grabbing a bag and accidentally pulling out your next project? <br /> <br /> There are other small points that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker get involved?) to make the loot that fast?), but basically RAT RACE is a bit more than the number of Character types hindered by arbitrary obstacles on the way to a rather inconspicuous and inexplicable end. You give the money to charity? What is the end of this?!? Yes, that is "noble". It does not matter how likely it is that cross-promotion / licensing by whores Smash Mouth (say they never sell no?) Will give a charity concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would really do that? Yes, they say it is the journey, not the destination, that is worth a trip, but there is no journey without a destination. If there ever was an example of a "false happy ending", that would be it. What a crappy ending to a movie where I had fun in spite of my stupidity (I admit, the piece with the cow and some Lucy stuff to enjoy it together with the figure with the tongue piercing) - at first I thought it incomprehensible The language would blow me up against the wall, but he became my favorite). <br /> <br /> But as far as my friend knows, I found RAT RACE pretty funny and charming. <br /> <br />
