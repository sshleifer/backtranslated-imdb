After watching this movie, I had the feeling that I had just eaten a box of outdated, tough Cracker Jacks, just to find no prize in it. This movie has a real promise: Pornstars in a Skinemax feature! Unfortunately someone forgot to tell the producers that we like some T & A in our T & A flicks !!! Sure, we get some quick flashes and a few "bathing in the creek" scenes. But where is the sex? How can you have four girls, "students", in this kind of movie with just a miserable 5 second lesbian scene? Good night, USA Up All Night makes for more thrills! Look, we do not see this kind of movie as great cinematography, script, or action. We want to see a kink! What a failure.
