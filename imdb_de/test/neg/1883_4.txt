I seem to be in the minority in this case, but I found One True Thing sulky, fictional and generally uncomfortable. Not that the acting was so bad, but the characters seemed to be little more than archetypes (the bad dad, oh, but wait, maybe he's not incurably bad, admit, the woman I was with has the movie so you may like it, but I did not.
