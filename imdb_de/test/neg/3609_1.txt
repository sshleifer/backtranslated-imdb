Thinking it could only get better was the worst assumption I've ever made. Drivvle does not describe this movie adequately enough! <br /> <br /> Not only the plot is thin, but I get more emotional behavior from my petfish! <br /> <br /> It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite, whom I respect as an actor trying to do the best he can with the little thing he needed to work with ... <br /> <br / > I think a box cut out of Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job and was indeed more vivid. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! That could be really dangerous for your health!
