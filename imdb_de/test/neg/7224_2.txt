The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it shows bands and their music when it changed in New Jersey in '81. The film itself has at least three major flaws. First of all, there is narrative throughout the movie that is not needed at all. In the few places where there are some explanations, adding a small dialogue would have gone a long way. Second, there was no apparent attempt to sync any of the audio signals. In fact, it is obvious that most of the dialogue was later recorded without any attempt to compare the film. The third mistake was at the end. I will not put an end to the brave souls who would endure the torture of being put through the film, but they commit a major sin in screenwriting. The money or the time is not worth it, unless you are a fan of one of the illustrated bands.
