I have never chosen 1 for a movie in the IMDB, but I am sorry for this movie that the scale does not go down to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I've seen it in a sneak preview, and it was my worst movie experience I've ever seen. The stupid jokes do not bother me. I can live with the stupid story. But when I see those dumb grinning "main characters" with their pseudo-foreign language (only Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt like I hated that I never thought I was capable of that. (If they had omitted, the matter would have been acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about that. You can laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous, but that does not make it any better. It's definitely not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside Germany, be happy and be happy that this terrible job will most likely never be in your cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you live in Germany avoid this movie at all costs.
