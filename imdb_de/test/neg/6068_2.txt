For a movie that I was really looking forward to, I was very disappointed. I did not expect this to be another Amadeus, but I had expected Beethoven to get a more significant display in recent years. <br /> <br /> The performance of Ed Harris was outstanding, but the plot was so faint that the movie simply moved from one bleak scene to the next without continuity. <br /> <br /> The only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th film, and from that point on I could have done without end. <br /> <br /> I was very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missing.
