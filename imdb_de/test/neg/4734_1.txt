This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it costs the rotten movie of 2007 (made by me). Anyway, in this movie, all the ingredients of a good movie missing poor performance, the story is just crap. I am really very disappointed that they could have done better things than this piece of garbage. I just wasted my time and money on this movie. I wish the production company could return my money. Anyway, I have high expectations for this movie and I have been disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to look at this. So if you want to waste your money on something, do it for something other than this piece of garbage.
