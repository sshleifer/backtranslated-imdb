I had no idea that this movie was produced by "WWE". Wrestling is lame enough. Why did they have to further pollute their name by making a movie as grumpy as this one? I found it a complete disappointment. If I had known that this movie would be so stupid, I would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. Of course I give them the cool effects. but the killer did not seem to be as scary as he could have been. He was missing some things. But I'll let you point out to her. The plot was a great idea, could have been better. Maybe in the future WWE will stick to its stupid wrestling and stay out of the movie industry.
