What a crap this movie is. The script just does not exist. The movie sometimes looks like a music video. However, it can not even be that way, as the soundtrack does not really fit. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. You'd think it would be a recipe for a successful movie ... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this movie killed me. The scene in which Harlan is interrogated by a police officer is just pathetic. As a rule, the latest Seagals films are barely visible. What the hell happened to the guy? I know he's old, but can not he make "Hollywood" give him a decent script or something? Does his pastry go to India for his antics, that he takes over everything that they serve him?
