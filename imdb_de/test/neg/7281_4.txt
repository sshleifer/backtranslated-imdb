I really do not understand how anyone can enjoy this movie. I do not think I've ever seen a movie as boring as this self-bred piece of garbage. It would probably have been better if the director had not spent most of the film presenting his own works of art, which is not really that remarkable. Another thing I did not really like was when a figure was punched in the face and spit out a gallon of blood shortly thereafter. I do not know how people bleed there in Japan, but I hope they have lots of blood donors.
