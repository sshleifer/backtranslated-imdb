You can only describe it in one word and that would be WOW !!! Wow, I really did not think that such a bitch could ever be published. If you see a movie called Ninja, expect at least some cool martial artists, right? However, none of these men knows any martial arts, and it seems they went to China and picked the first people they saw on the street, training them for a day in martial arts. The actors are far too much played, the special effects are ridiculous and there is no action that makes sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot!
