About the spoiler warning? It must not "contain", it contains spoilers. Readers take care <br /> <br /> Okay, first I have to know that I can not beat the actors. They only work with what they are given. The problem was the script. It was terrible. There was nothing believable at all. Sure, if you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, there will be a terrible mistake here and there that puts you in the awful, terrible, movie-ready situation. But those girls just made a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only girl clever enough to call the police was the girl who was added at the end because he had already killed one and hit another with a car. Speaking of hitting her in a car ... why the hell was she trying to overtake a truck and not run away like a normal person? Does not the one who wrote the script honestly to God believe that policemen will not examine a bloodied door? Honestly, it was not exciting. The only tension I felt was the frustration of how reserved the girls were. Well, that spell went much longer than I wanted for such a bad movie, so I'm not going to worry about touching the end, except for the fact that it's unrealistic and lame.
