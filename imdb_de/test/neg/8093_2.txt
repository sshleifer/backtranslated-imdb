Extremely flawed, but only an observable "comedy" that runs like a Farrelly Brother. The most criminal is the casting. I could not put Jerry O'Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds for a minute, who could pull any woman into the hat of a hat, nor could I believe the (the very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop. The story is predictable, but manages to cause some grief on some occasions, even though the "disgusting out" was meant to be a "shock comic" scene (one with an amputee testicle and another in a sperm bank) terrible. If this movie is on TV, it's probably worth it to see it when you're extremely bored, but do not waste your money by renting it!
