I only recommend it in one way .. it was innovative. Innovativ does not mean that it's a good movie, it can give you an idea of ​​what you can record and implement in your own films. <br /> <br /> The simple action is simple. I've reached the point I did not care if they destroyed the building or not. If I had to hear that annoying giggle again, I swear I would throw the DVD out of the window. And there is also the protagonist. They try to make him adorable, but he is a crazy pervert! He sniffs the girls' bra, sneaks them when he's naked, puts his bra over his eyes when he sleeps, puts his bra on an inflated sex doll. um) <br /> <br /> What still irritates me is the shabby tint. In the photo gallery on the DVD, you can see what the movie looked like before converting it to grayscale and adding color (also digital). The movie looked much better, without the effect of film, just to be artistic ... bah. I could understand using such gimmicks if the movie quality were crap. <br /> <br /> I think most people who liked this movie thought it was good because the chick was naked for 5 to 10 minutes. This is not comparable to delicatessen (as so many are trying to do). Delicatessen has characters that you can get involved with and like ... these people grunt and giggle. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that this was also trying to be similar to a German Impressionism film Old Silents One of the problems with most foreign, especially artistic, films is that they are on to concentrate on an artistic composition and forget the "space" of the scene. As a result, the audience does not really understand what's happening; it happens because it does not capture the space of the environment. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's garbage. The short film on the DVD, Surprise, was a lot better.
