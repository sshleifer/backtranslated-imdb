The reputation of "RVAM" was ahead. I've heard of it for the first time in one of these Medved movie books, "The 50 Worst Movies Ever" or "The Golden Turkey Awards" or something like that. At every meeting of the movie, basically, it was said that this movie was so bad that you would bleed to look at it. When the Exposed Film Society finally showed it, it showed me a kind of cathartic experience that only a true film stinker can offer. <br /> <br /> "Robot" was not that bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, that's definitely a "Z" movie through and through. Part of the dubbing (as usual with K. Gordon Murray 's imports) is terribly cheesy, and the film itself appears to be structurally somewhat Frankenstein, as much of it seems to be footage of a previous "Aztec" Mummy movie released by the A dead giveaway: the question "What happened then?" When asked more than twice in the dialog, look at newly composed material, with little regard to the plot coherence or In RVAM: "What happened then?" or "What happened then?" is expressed at least four times in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Even without structural problems, action and dialogue can be achieved For example, how the hero explains (explains and explains) the backstory, adding a remark about Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who suddenly shut up became a wicked master criminal "and began his search for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards have. No background, no explanation, he suddenly became angry. Obviously, this was aimed at a fairly indiscriminate audience. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight is the "robot", the supposed "showcase" of this film. This robot is the robot's worst special effect since "underwater kingdom" or even "Santa Claus against the Martians". Compared to this garbage, the Tin Man of "Wizard Of Oz" looked like the Terminator chassis that Linda Connor chased through the foundry in T2. The Aztec Mummy itself is well designed and executed. He is recognizable undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, yet different from the bandage collection "Boris Karloff", which is known to most American audiences. But whoever designed the robot in this episode had no sense of the concept ... or budget. At least they could have given him a few knees, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title fight is terrible and takes less than 60 seconds. (I've seen the matches on junior high playgrounds be more convincing.) Then the movie just stops. This seems to be a bit off considering how much time the movie spends building up to fight itself. Despite all these problems, the movie is not terrible or incompetent as a Coleman Francis movie or a Larry Buchanan movie was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of the Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like a Coppola movie. It's just boring and boring and stupid. The actors are competent (in a kind of B-movie way) and somewhat photogenic; Especially Dr. Krupp seems to have a wonderful time hanging around in his cloak and "Phantom of the Opera" suit, drawing plans and caprices. I often rooted for him, even though he is the bad guy. <br /> <br /> I've seen much, much worse, anyway. Write this with "Samson Vs The Vampire Women" under "Interesting Mexican Juvenile Curiosities."
