After the pleasing atmospheric original and the strangely stupid second piece, this incredibly boring, slow and uneventful sequel looks like a flop. Once again, the shrewd criminal mastermind The Bat tries to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The Bat builds a funny chunky robot with a human brain to achieve this vile target. Rafael Portillo, edited and bored by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, is a cruel continuity (for example, the Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but miraculously alive!), A dreadful thing! sluggish script, overflowing footage of the first two flicks, a snaking narrative, a paralyzing lack of action and impulse, largely bleak execution of (not) a understandably disinterested occupier and a poorly staged fight between both the mummy and the robot (the movie breaks finally, with the said big brawl into a stupid life, but unfortunately it takes barely two minutes and therefore turns out to be much too late to relieve the severity of the general overwhelming boredom), this anaesthetically dry, drippy and torn snorkel is a complete washout ,
