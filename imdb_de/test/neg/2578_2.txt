This is a known fact, Mr. Seagal can not smile, he can act, he can kick his ass, there is a faint smile, no real smile, no loud laughter and no real reason to watch this confusing movie. We consider Mr. Seagal to be overweight as Dr. Wesley Maclaren, who urgently needs a haircut and his real daughter Ayako as his office assistant appeared. Story: Okay so Wesley lives with his sweet daughter Holly in another damn outback. They sit and enjoy their red flower tea and their omelet, and at the other end of the city, an overweight militia leader decides to make the whole city sick by spreading a virus that travels through the air and thinks he will survive within two days he may have had an antidote. Problem, there is no antidote and what exists keeps the virus down for a while. The CIA gets contacted and also they can not help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter Holly. She is being hunted because she thinks the healing is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab his daughter and bring her to her grandfather, who is an Indian. Together with his sister-in-law Ann they go to a base where there is a hidden laboratory to find a cure, but even the soldiers die slowly and others die if they do not find a cure in time. And to shorten the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley are infected with the virus ... hmm. A weak fight scene. The terrible movie and all men desperately need a stair master.
