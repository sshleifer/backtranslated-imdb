This movie is hard to integrate into the creepy space comedy genre and falls into two of those areas. It actually takes place in space - but it's neither funny nor scary. The plot is grim and the one joke about the computer's intellect is dubbed to death. They say Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran, and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the most of their hamming script. The homo-like relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is suggested, but never explored, while the attempt at sexual tension between Fran and Rick is so brutal that it is ridiculous. All in all, this is a turkey that is best suited for late night television, preferably when ironing.
