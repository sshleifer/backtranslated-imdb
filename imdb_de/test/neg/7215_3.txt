I saw a promo for this movie on the Spike channel last night. He was grouped with a Patrick Swazy repeat of another movie he did and thought that Swazy was in this sequel. Boy, I was wrong The screenwriter also played a major role, and I think the budget was a little tight. I am surprised that Will has seen Patton in the movie. He has much more to do with his name than playing in a "c" movie like this one. Bussey Jr tried so hard to portray his father's image (one of the best villains of all time) that had failed miserably. The only redeeming qualities in the movie were the chicks that look good and with a lot of T & A just do not have the time or your hard earned dollar worth renting it
