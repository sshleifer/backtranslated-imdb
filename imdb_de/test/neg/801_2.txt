The box was set in 1976 for no apparent reason to keep the set designers busy. Directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko') and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple reportedly financially hard to fight, though both have a successful career - they as a high school teacher, he as Optics specialist at the NASA Research Center Langley in Virginia. They have a child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, the Lewises find a package on their doorstep containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from 'Mr. Steward 'indicates that he will return at 5:00 pm to explain the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, appears at the appointed time, nattily dressed to fit in an elegant Savile Row. He is polite but business. His most striking feature, however, is his face, half of which was worn and handled improperly. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, but unfortunately he is thrilled with his own make-up reminiscent of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) of Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight". It's like the elephant in space: you can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting. Steward explains that he will come back in 24 hours to get the button. If you decide to unlock and press the button during this time, he will give you $ 1 million in cash. The only catch - and it's a big one - is that somewhere a stranger dies. It could be across the city, perhaps on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a token of good faith, he gives them a crisp $ 100 bill to keep whether they push the button or not. Arthur and Norma are skeptical and believe that the whole thing is a fraud or a sophisticated fraud, but it does not take long for them to wonder what happens when they hit the button? Would you really get a million dollars? Would someone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma hits the button. Nothing happens. However, her initial relief raises an alarm when Steward shows up with a briefcase full of cash the next day. They decide to put it down, but Steward tells them it's too late. "You already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limousine retreats, Arthur notices the license number, which he later learns is registered with the NSA (National Security Agency). <br /> <br /> At this point, as a secondary film, the film begins to fall deeply into unobtrusive territory. The characters begin to jump nosebleeds and flash peace signs. In the meantime, the city is raided by plump, limp cronies in bad shirts, who follow Arthur like a scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. Arthur is eventually caught in the threatening bookworms in the library (?) Where Steward's spidery wife appears - whom we have not yet seen - and informs Arthur that he has to go to the library to leave the library of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?" Arthur asks, seeming much less confused than he should be in the circumstances, and certainly much less confused than the audience at the time. "Eternal damnation," says the spinner threateningly. Arthur steps into the middle column of digital fluid effects and suddenly appears after a short absence in his water cocoon hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and Arthur falls with a shower of water on the bed, strangely dripping out of the water pipes out of reach of the camera, while Marsden and Diaz drenched the bed. <br /> <br /> It's confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> Finally, we learn that Steward was once public relations officer with the NSA until he was struck by a lightning that was destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead, but was later revived and transformed into a kind of superman who now serves "those who streak" and whose powers have enabled him, the CIA, the NSA and NASA all to take care of yourself. <br /> <br /> And what is the purpose of all this devastating garbage? Obviously, Steward's job is to give people a kind of biblical character test (eg, the "bondage of Isaac") to determine whether humanity is worth saving. When enough people pass the button test by refusing to press it, Steward's godlike gentlemen spare the race. Unfortunately, the people who push the button, like Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral ruthlessness. To do this, they undergo a series of bleak 'lady or tiger' tests that have the effect of one of those things. Saw movies, "except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent conspiracy. <br /> <br />" The Box "represents the kind of mindless mental masturbation that undergraduates enjoy babbling after a few beers - Richard Kelly's boring practice in the existential pettifogging finally collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility, the tortured mixture of unbearable ideas finally, if you mix too many colors, solidifies into a meandering gray film of a movie as thin as one of the stunning in-flight Movies whose plot does not suffer more or less from being interrupted by a leisurely nap. <br /> <br /> There's a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, a tech-savvy guy, gets curious about how the button works When he opens the unit, he is disappointed not to find anything inside. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Box, I know g exactly how he feels.
