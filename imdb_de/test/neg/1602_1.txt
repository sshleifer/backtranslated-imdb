I found the sleeping cell interesting and exciting to watch until the last episode, when nothing happens, their F ****** BS, you Americans portray Muslims as terrorists and the Americans as heroes, it's the reverse way I hate it, if every American television program ends predictably. I was hoping the bombs would go off in this stadium, but I knew that would not be the case. To save the day again, the Americans are the biggest terrorists, g Bush the leader of all, he's guilty of 9 / 11, and I am amazed that you accuse us of these shows again and again, they are all the same! I have a good show about terrorism called "The Whitehorse," and Bush himself is the cell leader. It's the same with 24, whatever it was 24, sleep is a sham and should never do a season 2, her F *. **** Joke! and you are also American producers.
