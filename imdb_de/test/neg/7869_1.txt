Dear Film Director: <br /> <br /> If you're trying to create a sense of urgency, it may be best in the future to keep your hero * running * instead of jogging / mixing. Especially if you try to reinforce a timeline. For example, if you try to convince the audience that the villain really kills the hostage, if the hero does not find them, it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes this could actually happen. But let us tell you. Making a good movie was obviously not your goal. Their goal was to pump some garbage that makes more money than it costs. Otherwise, you may have hired some actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bored Viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I can not say it's the worst because I made it. It was bad, bad, but bad. Dude, where is my refund?
