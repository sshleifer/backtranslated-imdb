Three words: What a bunch ... Two words: Do not bother! A word: sucked! There are no reasons to see this movie. Even these Seagal groupies should hold back from this movie. The martial arts, the typical aikido, are terrible. The martial arts movements themselves are good, but the cinematography is pathetic. The movie is actually in slow motion when Seagal gives its victims its "kill move". Even worse, the same movement is shown three times in quick succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's acting was just stupid, but I still give this movie a "6" for acting because the roles of the "bad guys" were actually pretty entertaining. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. His character also has this dedicated work ethic, which means that all his parcels are delivered to the right people on time - at no extra cost - and nothing stands in his way. Not killers, political leaders, explosions or even death. I expect some degree of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this film in which random and terrible acts of violence in no way affect the evolution of the film or its story. There is a reason why this movie was used directly for video, and there are countless reasons to avoid it. Nobody should deal with this threesome. <br /> <br />
