THE STAR PACKER is one of some 152,000,000 westerns in which John Wayne worked in the 1930s. Well, the number is a little over the top, but it almost seemed like many. This is because these B movies were created quickly with very low budgets to be the second or less feature in a theater. Most B's were pretty cheap and tended to cut costs, and THE STAR PACKER is no exception. In order to save costs, no secondary music is used, runtimes were kept under an hour, the writing was often rather distracted and the actors are usually less talented - and Wayne himself was by no means a household name at the time. Some of these Wayne features are pretty good, while others, like this one, are observable, but also quite stupid and irrelevant. I've enjoyed this movie and most of the other movies, but that's probably because I've been bumping B's a lot. <br /> <br /> Wayne Stars as John Travers - a US Marshall who investigates the actions of a local gang to track them locals out and steal off stage. This is odd, since the film was apparently filmed in modern times or close to it, using phones and modern machine guns - things not expected in the Old West. Such anachronisms are quite common in B-Westerns - since Gene Autry films (for example) are plentiful with them. Wayne's buddy is Yak - played by Stuntman and a real friend of Wayne, Yakima Canutt. The villain is an unknown character called "The Shadow," and he gives his instructions over a black screen that hides his face! It sounds just like a character from a movie series - the kind of villain kids loved, but adults groaned because they were so stupid and a little bit like Blofeld or dr. Evil! The problem is, if you listen to his voice AND pay attention at all, it becomes obvious early in the movie that this "shadow" is George Hayes. Now, when we talk about Hayes, this is the same guy who was later referred to in movies as Gabby Hayes, but here and in some of Wayne's other early films he looks and behaves NOTHING like Gabby. In THE STAR PACKER he was well dressed, articulated and clean shaven - imagine that! In real life, this was obviously the real George Hayes - though I doubt he was evil! As you can see in the last paragraph, there is really no secret in this movie. They have only acting (passable and nothing more) and stunts - which was pretty amazing. Again and again there was an amazing stunt after the other - men jumped from horse to horse and great fighting scenes - all by the way of Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often John Wayne's doppelg√§nger in movies - and that took decades. The problem with some stunts, however, is that the filmmakers seem to have actually killed a few horses to see these great "stumbling horses" later in the movie. Until about 1940 filmmakers often stringed thin metal wire and galloped with horses over it! The legs of the horses were usually broken and the horses then euthanized! One of the worst examples of this was the movie JESSE JAMES, in which several horses were brutally killed. As a result, the American Humane Association insisted that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to confirm that animals in production were NOT injured. Therefore, since 1940 movies carry this little disclaimer. THE STAR PACKER was made long before the disclaimer, and I can not see how the horses did these "tricks" without getting killed, occasionally bad acting and an incredibly cruel attitude towards the horses. I am not a bleeding heart, but I simply can not understand this disregard of a poor old animal.
