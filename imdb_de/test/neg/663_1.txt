I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (on a military base) to watch Superman Returns was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie that was played was "See No Evil I was looking forward to it, and just a brief description of the movie on the schedule ... but my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try ... As soon as I saw that it was produced by WWE, I knew that it would be terrible. The few people in the theater laughed most of the time, and it was the first movie I honestly considered, and I saw "The Ringer" ... okay, I was out of this movie. but I was too busy sleeping. The death of evil was pretty good in the end, but otherwise it was just stupid.
