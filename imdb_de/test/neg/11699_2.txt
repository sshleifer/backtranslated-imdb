Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before I saw the movie, but I was very disappointed with this movie. In my opinion, the filmmakers have removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with other Hollywood-style elements. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, too, as this film has a great cast, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman and the largely unknown Alice Krige. They are just not worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Actually, I was all in favor of going halfway through, but a friend convinced me to stay until the end, knowing that he had to do better. He apologized to me during the credits.
