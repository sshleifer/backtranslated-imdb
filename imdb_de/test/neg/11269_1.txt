"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's say "the shogun samurai") is somewhere between awfully boring and startling pain. As a historical epic, it could have been so much more likely to be a rich saga ... but it's really just another cheap 1970s action movie with a story based on real-world events and a Sonny eye-opening Chiba. Before this half movie, I was even tempted to commit Seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat, howling in the ears to a melody composed by Ennio Morricone (that is no insult to Morricone). The use of zoom lens cinematography is more disgusting than fascinating. And as for the action, it's really nothing but a series of brutal attacks and oh no. What a horrible movie.
