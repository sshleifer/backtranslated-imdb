Which crack do you smoke? This movie is wonderfully entertaining, but terrible! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so obviously wrong that it's kind of sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so funny that it's almost unmentionable. And when Joe put the bucket over his head and beat up the other man in the army, I peed myself. I could go on ... <br /> <br /> Entertaining, all right. Good no. Well done, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a commentary on America as an empire, it's actually pretty good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not particularly surprising, especially in the context of American cinema in the 1980s.
