Was a college acting exercise filmed and released as a movie? The formal posture and stylized bustle of a "horror" soap opera for people who dislike horror movies but want to tell friends that they've seen a horror movie. It even offers soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Do you scare books that fall off the shelves of the library? Do you scare doors when closing? Then this strip is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have done it. Were you ignored in your rape because the rapist was the cool boy? Scary is not this film, but the filmmaker's view of the world. <br /> <br /> And then the little twists are not even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie, who do not want to see it now, and who want to see another movie in which everyone conspires against the weird child.
