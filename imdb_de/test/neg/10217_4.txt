ALERT: This review contains important SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by the number of votes it received (my vote was the fifth), few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, in the late 1980's, professional wrestling was pretty decent. A women's federation called Ladies Professional Wrestling Association was opened. It was a great league and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the list. I've always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring and acting skills. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed in the early 90s, so for someone as talented as Mimi, it seemed natural to start an acting career, right? But there was an alternative to that? This movie is really bad. In the further course I compared him again and again with an underrated film entitled "Survivor Quest". Only this movie is missing everything, which made "Survivor Quest" so pleasant. <br /> <br /> When I started the tape, I went to Fast Forward through the preview to get to the meat of the band. At first I did not pay much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a movie with Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought, "here's another movie looking for Mimi." But as the preview progressed, I realized that there was a preview for ?? was. 'Beyond Fear!' You know you're in trouble if the only preview in the beginning contains the movie you're about to see! The plot of this thing is pretty normal. Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer who lives with the guilt of hurting an opponent / friend. Therefore, she focuses on her second career, which she shares with her friend Sammy: As Wilderness Guide. On this special occasion, she gets a troop of three pairs. Two of the couples are just there to take up space. They think that a couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean woman, are being investigated because a problem arises between them in the middle of the movie. However, she is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the forest, which constantly upsets the Korean woman. The joke is funny when you hear it for the first time, but it's certainly not the ninth time they're doing it. The third couple just hurts, it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They swap insults, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he's not playing cruel jokes on his obese wife. Just like a typical American couple! Before the hike, Mr. Page spies two stupid boys and their prostitutes. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out that Mr. Page has taken it. So the danger starts when the two guys follow the group on their journey and we wait and wait and wait until they finally do something. If this is the case, it is a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the actor. They try as much as possible with the material they need to work with. The main culprit is the director Robert F. Lyons, who again plays bit games and has to stay away from the director's chair. Lyons begins and stops scenes in such a sloppy, sudden affair that you think he suffered from dyspepsia throughout the shoot. There is even an incompetent moment in which a scene with bright daylight is chopped off between the night scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and background noise completely transcend the dialogue, so you need to move your ear right next to the speaker on your TV. Do not bump your head on the screen! It is not worth listening to the poorly written lines. Speaking of bad writing: Lesseos gets there as a co-writer part of the recognition. The few interesting developments between the characters are often abandoned for recordings of thugs or bad jokes from the field. Early on, Lesseos strikes a bat with a knife, so you do not believe they are in danger from the two stupid thugs. When the crooks are finally kicked by Lesseos in a well thought out and long fight with the hind ends, our performers all laugh together, even though one of them was shot and bleeds everywhere. Yes, in the end everyone is happy. All except the poor souls who witnessed the film wish the good old glory days when Mimi performed in wrestling. Zantara's score: 4 out of 10
