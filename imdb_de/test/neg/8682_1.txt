<br /> <br /> Very boring, tedious adaptation of Amis' amusing satire. The hero is not portrayed as a sympathetic loser, but as stupid criminals. Most of them are pure caricatures in which only Helen McCrory brings real quality and gives some of the joke of the novel. The setting of the era is as in the 1920s, not the post-war period of horror comics and rock'n'roll. A real guy even for the standards of bad british tv. <br /> <br />
