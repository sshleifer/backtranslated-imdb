absolutely nothing about this movie is funny, interesting or relevant. Apart from the fact that two characters end up together, nothing is resolved and there is no action. and by the way, what's the deal with the cover of the DVD? It has a female ass in Daisy Duke shorts ... where was this scene in the movie? Nobody ever wore Daisy Dukes in this movie! Surprisingly, almost the entire performance in this film is good, and Jack Black plays a full song (could be a persistent d-track ... do not know if), but those are the only redeeming values. Overall, it's just a waste of time.
