Gaud√≠ Afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise in a biased key. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis made a good cast (Juliette Lewis' crazy character was taken out of reality incredibly, I know a young American lady who chats like her !!), but GA does not show much about his exaggerated plot. <br /> <br /> Even though filmmaking is all about faith, there were some inconsistencies in the script. Two examples: You pay 14 euros for the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at 7 o'clock in the morning, and you can not leave the terrace without paying the bill (they will charge you immediately if they do not know you ) or get off the taxi quickly (Americans always tip taxi drivers, although they do not expect it, but the sequences shown in the movie were ridiculous). Believe me, reader: Come and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you've never been here before, you may not care, but good films should be credible and ignore your background. No one knows about GA here and I will make sure that does not change in the future.
