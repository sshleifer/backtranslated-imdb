When I saw this crap, it reminded me of the title of the movie FIRE, which includes this garbage, in a fire. I do not even know what to say, the actor blew, the fire really looked spotty, Andy, the chicks are not exactly supermodels. And finally, I do not know what people are complaining about, I own that damn movie. Yes, happy birthday for me. Well, I think it could be worse that maybe I was left behind fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I miss is the fantastic Tornado movie I hear sucking balls. <br /> <br /> Well, until my next crap movie peace
