Most of the comments on this film are positive, so I thought I would try to restore balance. I came out of this movie and wondered what was going on. I know it now and still think it's a bad movie. I dropped off a dream sequence first because it seemed too obvious. I was glad I had a free ticket to the movie or I had reclaimed my money. Film critics and critics love this film, which only confirms that most of them sound more intelligent than examining how an audience can enjoy a movie. The 8+ rating of this movie is so misleading. In 20 years, this film will not be comparable to true greats like The Godfather. The film offers good performances from both main features, but that's not enough to save the movie. (still are the lesbian scenes!)
