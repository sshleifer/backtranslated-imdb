Did you find the title funny? Oh, do not you? Well, because you're excited. Learn to laugh, because if you do not laugh, you do not live. So, please lower your standards of what you think is weird to a mere child's. Do you find it funny now? Still no?! OK, that's because you're full of yourself and too easily offended. If you do not laugh, you do not live. And if you do not like me, then send me hate mail so I can write another review and state how much hate mail I get, and try to twist it so it looks like I'm an ass. Are you already laughing at my hilarious title? Still no?!?! That's it! You are a racist! You MUST laugh or you are a racist. Why else would not you laugh? Oh, that's not funny!?! No this can not be. I want it to be funny, so that's it !! Laugh, damn it !!!! You're welcome!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! You're welcome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's it. Where is my notebook and pen? And where is my Richard Pryor DVD? I have to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thank you thank you. <br /> <br /> This is basically what you get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please do yourself a favor and change the channel when the show of this bum appears. Even basic cable channels are 100 times larger. I do not even say that because I hate him. I'm serious. This show is like growing grass. Not sure, at least grass does not steal jokes. I honestly try to save your time. I even tried to watch his show. I said to myself "maybe he is not that bad." But no, that's him. I went completely crazy when I saw his show. I tried to gather during the commercial break and focus on the show, but I could not. I went out again, I think I was thinking of something more interesting like restoring my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, that's so bad. <br /> <br /> Here's my last thought - There are so many things you can do in 30 minutes. Do not look at a show that tries to push racism into your face in vain. I can support shows that try to break down the tension of race warfare, but this guy simply offers more racism than stopping him.
