Sylvester, the cat who blows on a ship where Tweety is sitting with his owner, Grandma. Oh, I do not even have enough words to convey how much I despise both the Tweety and the Granny figure. They are just not funny for me and have made this short work to the task. Sylvester is a great character in his own right, but there's only so much he can do when faced with the terrible fear of this cursed bid and the old witch of a grandma. This animated short is featured on CD 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and includes an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
