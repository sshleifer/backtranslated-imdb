Every time I watch this show on TV, I want to absolutely and truthfully scratch my eyes out and tear my ears off. It's so unbelievably awful. The jokes are not funny, the acting is totally awful and the whole show is a big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's guts, and I just want to slap her in the face or stab her with a knife when I hear her speak. It is not talent, low IQ and a big waste for society. I think she would do a favor to the world if she just shut up and is gone for a long time. Please, I say this with all my heart, NOT AN EVISODE OF THIS SHOW !!!!!! It's not even worth 30 minutes, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself Watch this show for half an hour.
