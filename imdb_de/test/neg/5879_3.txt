I picked up on this movie because it was a movie with a focus on Jewish comedy - something I had not seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached the film openly and was interested in how it started. The opening is well arranged, and the first half of the movie gave me many reasons to laugh, and that's good. However, the humor soon became repetitive, the action confused and tense, and I realized that I did not like the movie anymore. I tried to avoid that, but the movie became pretty "cheap" - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor stops, but he did not. I must confess that I may have missed some of the humor because I am not a Jew myself and have little experience of Jewish culture. Considering how much of the humor was telegraphed in this film, it's unlikely I've missed much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, and if the movie was thought about a bit, it would have been seen all the way through. I wish I could give the movie a higher rating, but strictly speaking it would have been better than TV series or a series of skits. There just was not enough rewarding fresh material for a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> One comment on the casting - the lead role looked like it was meant for Ben Stiller, but I do not think about it. I do not think the movie would have been more worthwhile if it had been there.
