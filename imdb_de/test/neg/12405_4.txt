Your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before you go to the theater. Even the harshest advocates seem to agree that the audience can be shared in their appreciation for this unique film in the middle. <br /> <br /> Unlike most HK-actioners, the fight scenes are curiously kept away. When they happen, they are rendered in a jerky style that makes it difficult to see exactly what is happening on the screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with those of Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin and an appeal from HK's top acting talent chewing the scenery. As with some early works by Wong Kar-wai, the dialogue could be more precise. <br /> <br /> In short, the ashes of time require a forgiving attitude. At about the same time as Wong Kar-wai's spectacularly successful Chungking Express release, it's clear the director is not so confident in working with the elements of martial arts film. Those looking for tense action will probably be disappointed. Those who are fascinated by the director's aesthetics will probably find this unique.
