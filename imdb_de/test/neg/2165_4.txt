With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00 I had to buy it. I've enjoyed a few moments, like Hawk's trouble with the amusement droids, but I really only saw Matthias Hue's scenes. I really liked the showdown in the end. It was a cross between Clint Eastwood's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "For a Few Dollars More" (a 3-man quickdown showdown with a musical pocket watch as a countdown timer). Apart from that, I really can not add anything anymore. The actors gave good performances (all but the "Assassin Droid," whose performance was nothing outside the comedy), but the film was really lacking in depth and purpose. just not enough to fill an hour and a half of the standard movie time, so we stick with the main characters, who ask each other for about an hour from place to place, until the ball starts rolling. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about four times and claims two-fifths of the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the film budget. I do not think we've ever seen this "perfect city" of New Angeles, which has always been talked about, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways. Hardly a "kingdom" in which the owner / creator of a whole city would be. It was always talked about the "super high security" of New Angeles, but in total only 15, maybe 20, guards were counted. even when the alarm went off; Not even close to Matthias's approach to "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the actor / actresses in this movie, you might want to see him. Just add to the list. However, if you estimate one and a half hours of your time or $ 3.00 of your money, you should miss that time.
