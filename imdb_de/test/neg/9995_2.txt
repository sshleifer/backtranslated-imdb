Many people said that this is a great movie where Hoffman did a great job. I went from hovering incredulity to fidgety boredom, almost to go out. there are none. <br/> <br/> Hoffman goes all out. he is committed to performance. but sometimes he plays a concerned man who looks like a concerned actor chewing on the backdrop. <br /> No characters in the movie except Capote are much more than wildcards all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the movie shows Capote's manipulative, cleaning, dishonest sides. It shows them so often that I wondered why - do the filmmakers believe we have to pin everything down? and again? and again? it often refers to the genius of capote but does not show it. It shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers, but never convinces why. <br /> <br /> but my goal is not to deconstruct the movie. I'm sure others will have different interpretations. For me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.
