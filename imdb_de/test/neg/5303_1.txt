This movie was embarrassing. Ulma Thurman looked like she had some illness, and John Travolta looked like he was going to sleep. I expected this to be a long-running sequel to Get Shorty, not a half-baked remake of the same movie (except that some characters have different names and garments). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend filming this as my worst enemy. I feel like I was demolished, and Hollywood once again tempted me to see another terrible episode (I also suffered from Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005!
