This guy is a real piece of work. An angry, immature boy in the body of an adult man who packs all the charisma of a rock, goes to places that most people just want to visit, and does his best to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could go over an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes," even though I just want to highlight the worst: Crete. While the locals do beach picnics for their "glory," this clown can behave like an irritated, spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. What an idiot. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes disbelieving in a bunch of cooks (who probably had better things to do than talking to a foolish American like work). They did not find that Abba was terrible. Everywhere he went he drew up Abba. This is the kind of talk you would hear from 13 year olds who see too much MTV. <br /> <br /> While in New Orleans, he was annoyed that a particular restaurant tasted French fries better than his own, so "accidentally" spilled them on wine to ruin them. What a strange, emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is his clumsy voices, in which he tries in vain to bring a perspective to a situation he appreciates too fat and too ignorant. He's trying to use all those "big" words to sound like an author, but he's actually just a presumptuous hack whose ignorance has convinced him to say something. Incidentally, that's probably the good thing about this Joker's TV show. It shows you, no matter how incompetent you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will be like that. <br /> <br /> Then he talks with local guides whose English is obviously only English rudimentary. He will use the vocabulary that every writer, as he believes himself, knows instinctively that he is most likely not understood by these people. Does he care? Even important guys like this Bourdain clown do not use a language for communication; They use it to make themselves important. <br /> <br /> Mcg13jthm's report on this page is a perfect example of the kind of mind Bourdain is attracted to - that of a weak IQ misunderstanding. Watch as the reviewer tries to justify Bourdain's sociopaths with simple, childish excuses that make little sense. "Bourdain can complain, but he does" a lot "and not only that, he was" forced "to do that show, but tries to redeem himself." A jerk attracts fools, and if you read Mcg13jthm's review you should know for sure if you're the person who wants to enjoy this utterly useless, pointless show. <br /> <br /> Finally a bit of "fairness" to my diatribe, I admit Bourdain would have been amusing for a moment if I had met him in a bar. But as a television presenter of a travel show designed to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a miserable, sullen, hopeless, gloomy and depressing failure. <br /> <br /> A failure.
