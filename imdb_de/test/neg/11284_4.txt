I have to admit that, despite all the media advertising and the Oscar nomination, my expectations of the movie were not that high before I saw it. And I really found what I expected. a film that is sympathetic to both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, authentic to foreign audiences and enough fun for all. However, it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable to all, so the film remains average for all. <br /> <br /> The entire film tells that a story took place within 24 hours. To integrate the short story into a movie length, some scenes are added without a link to the main story. These are mostly the ice-sale scenes to the eccentric natives (ie goatherds, old women, etc.), and each of these sales scenes is attempted to be of interest to the audience through sketches with comic dialogues. The topic is mentioned as a universal problem: a local producer's fight against holding companies and monopoly, but that was the interesting topic twenty years ago. Most readers will remember Ferhan Sensoy's "Hero Trader Against Supermarket" in the 1980s. This was the right story at the right time. In short, the story is not strong enough and it's worth it to be a movie yet. Apart from some Gibibbers due to the local accent, the performance of the cast is so successful. The main role is Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language, but he is still successful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, against a limited budget, noteworthy efforts by the director and players obviously give a good mood to the movie. However, this is not good enough to compare a movie to Italian neo-realists or to earn an Oscar nominee. <br /> <br /> Note: In reality, the ice cream seller would normally stop his own production and be the distributor of a Manda brand competitor.
