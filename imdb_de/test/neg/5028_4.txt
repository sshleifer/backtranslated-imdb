Will there be an end to the hyping of films dealing with social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay, "Care" is about kids, "Care" about perverts who abuse boys in a school, and how disgusting it could be. If it is a movie with a bad script and bad acting actors, it will remain a bad movie. "Care" is a movie that could have been, but is it because it was a TV movie I do not know, but everything seemed so limited that it looks like a cheap movie seen by some housewives and fathers, who decide against go to bed. There are so many unanswered things in this movie ... the relationship with his mother, for example, or the death of a battered kid we do not know about anymore. "Care" should have been much better.
