Man was so hard to watch! It was not funny at all, not well done and it had no sense or purpose. the spectacle was terrible. it was not well done at all. It looked like a few kids my age would just play around and make a pointless movie. It's by far the worst broken lizard movie ever. If you are a broken lizard like me, you will be disappointed and bored. Please skip this pointless movie about ugly boys looking for chicks. You will not regret my advice. By the way, do not say that you found this review unhelpful just because you did not agree. that's stupid, like this movie. The only OK scene was when Captain Rugby played and got kicked out of the crap. I liked that because I found his character damn annoying.
