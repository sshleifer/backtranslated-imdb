I ... no words. No words can describe that. I'll try it because of those few brave people who put the knives in their toasters ... after watching this show. This ... Cosgrove Person ... Her acting is like a female gorilla dancing on the nest of very excited insects. Maybe I exaggerate. However, I feel that the description fits for a regular day of writing this show. <br /> <br /> The characters in this disgusting pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock flying into the sun every day of the week. Although heart attacks were not experienced while acting like fools on the cheap-built sets, I have no doubt that this will happen eventually. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this * burps loudly into the faces of the actors * is that of a foolish girl hosting a weekly live webcast on the creatively titled iCarly.com with her brainless friends, one of which is a Equipment that the producers of this show probably could not afford. Her legal guardian is a kind of idiot who seems to be her older brother. <br /> <br /> I did not see the whole show for fear of cancer, or maybe a cold, but some of the plot points show I've seen the brother get stuck in an elevator, the bouncer of the apartment almost died and the world's thickest priest came to visit. No really. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you have passed the unborn age or if you have joined mysterious cults due to secret traumas in the past. If you decide to watch it, you need to laugh when the laugh track prompts you, as this drowns out the repetitive sound that will eventually put you in a coma if you hear it too long. <br /> <br /> The show receives a rating of one star because the IMDb inexplicably did not accept the use of negative numbers.
