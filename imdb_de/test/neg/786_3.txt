Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: This is an all-star cast, but "The Box" proves once again that it's no guarantee of a solid movie. The premise sounds promising: a couple is visited by a mysterious person who offers them a million dollars. The downside is that someone dies, a person they probably will not know. So what are you doing ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that, the story completely derailed. An uninspired conspiracy about an extraterrestrial plot involving NASA can not be explained here. <br /> <br /> "The Box" is a disappointment, could have been much better. But because it's based on an ultra-short story, that explains the continuity flaws.
