If you think that Reshammiya as a singer is too painful to watch on TV, try to watch him for 2 hours in the movie. His face is boring throughout the movie, and it's very funny to see him playing the demanding and intense scenes. This is far from a real love story (spell checker, reshammiya - it's not love or reinstatement), and it's complete with him doing a mithun da dance. He escapes from prison, etc. If you want a good laugh, there is nothing like it, especially the scenes in which he cries in Mehbooba. If you despise the nasal twangs and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of Reshammiya can do for you, then you should not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not laugh from the beginning at the very end The only saving grace this film has is the cinematography, the locations and a few songs. Even if you are a hardened Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
