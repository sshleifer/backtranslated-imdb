Honestly, this sequel is terrible. I'm a fan of kung fu movies and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Bride with white hair 1 was actually quite good and that is a huge disappointment. BWWH 1 was, in a sense, brilliant with a unique, evil villain with weird balls. The couple from the first movie played a small part in this movie. Instead, the film revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters who want to avenge their fallen clans. But there is no antagonist in this movie, so revenge is mute. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is the kung-fu or the lack of it. They literally had a street style knife fight. The character in the end refused to fight because of a lack of choreography.
