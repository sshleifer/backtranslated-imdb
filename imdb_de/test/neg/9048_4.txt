"Eaten Alive" is much simpler than the "Cannibal Holocaust" by Ruggero Deodato, but it's also a much gritty movie. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally funny, but the plot is so stupidly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience in the end. The tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust), together with Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell, here with an unbearable accent), seeks the jungle of New Guinea for the sister of Agren, who was brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov). , Along the way, they witness the (sometimes real) torture of animals and some cheesy cannibalism. As directed by Umberto Lenzi, the movie is so exaggerated that it's hard to take it seriously, but if you like Trash Cinema with more than a few unintentional laughter, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
