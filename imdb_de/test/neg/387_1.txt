This is possibly the undoubtedly worst movie anyone has ever done that actually took it seriously. And not as a result of acting, because as an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be the best, just to escape electroconvulsive therapy after the actual photography. As one of the 57 people who actually saw the movie in the Theatrical Version, I've never seen a movie where the movie ended, the credits roll, home lighting and no one moved from its seats. About five minutes after the house lights came on, people came out of their comas to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay, we got it, that was a joke, right? , Finally, after the gatekeepers had distributed disguises, and we swore that we would not acknowledge that we were there, we felt it was safe to go, and we prayed that we would not leave the auditorium. I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time (I have Cinemax for the sake of goodness), but I am still bitter that I can never find those two or so hours of my life that I lost looking at Closet Land.
