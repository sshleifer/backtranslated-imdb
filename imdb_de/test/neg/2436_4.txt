This movie runs like an English version of an ABC after the school special with nudity. One wonders who the target group should be. It's not as if the authors are too busy selling a plausible plot. Although virtual sexuality has some observability, it is flakier than dandelion meringue. It's a good movie you can see when you're snowed in, the cable is unplugged and it's the only tape you have.
