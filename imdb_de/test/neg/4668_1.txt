First. I do not look down on Americans. I know many people who are intelligent people from the USA. But this movie is so bad that I only had to comment. <br /> <br /> First of all ... films are usually far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Many scenes are so incredibly wrong. For example, the departure of the 2 spaceships. They see how they drain the full tanks in space. Only a small distance from each other. Do you remember what exploded the Space Shuttle in the past? Just a tiny Winsy part that came out. Here it is common to refuel fuel tanks that are so big, if not larger than the whole ship. Which idiot would lift 2 spaceships and do it at the same time? Second, the Russian station is a piece of crap. I hate to introduce you to that, but astronauts are going to Russia these days. Because their equipment is much more reliable than that of NASA. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA only uses it to pay the bills. And there is no better alternative. And the list of whoppers goes on and on. This really is an insult to people who take space travel seriously. And I know half as much as these guys. But the most annoying part (read: the whole movie) is the propagandist and patriot scumbag, with whom one is suffocated. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was watching a CNN business spot for an hour. The actors solve their little problems by shooting at each other, giving everyone, with whom they meet, the middle finger, starting fights, ignoring the police, etc., etc. But when it comes to their love for their country and their land Sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone is in line to commit suicide (bomb detonator)? Maybe I miss the feeling of being a true "patriot" who can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. Drive with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart and drive in a circle until the battery runs out. But this movie was too much for me. And when I finally got hold of it, I pulled the flagpole and American Flag fabric out of my Hiny. I realized that I was glad that this movie was finally finished. I do not know why so many good actors have participated in this narrow-minded, stereotyping propaganda film. But I feel sorry for them. This is a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as "Uncle Sam" considers you a good patriot. Where everyone is happy, as long as it is another land that has been devastated, nobody cares.
