When I bought this movie, I expected that there would be a fun 1970s commercial movie. Instead, I got this boring party from amateur author Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Milligan. With his strict cut, his fast pace and his wonderfully known actors, you would almost think that you ... watch one of his home videos! Seriously, I could not even stay awake the first time I tried to see it. The scenes of boring people dragged on, and whenever someone was killed, the movie slowed down. Sometimes it got faster, and the voices of the characters sounded like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The script actually seemed a little better than the movie, and it seems to be more appropriate in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleep pill, in which the actors constantly stumble over their lines. The cover said, "Your best cuts were strangely erotic ... but quite brutal!" Trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this movie. Oh, we see characters that look like lumpy cottage cheese, but that's about it. And as far as "brutal" is concerned, the viewer is the most brutal with this film. And also...
