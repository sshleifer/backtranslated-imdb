This was one of the most horrible screenplays I have ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but with a standard, serpentine puppet monster instead of a slim Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the action of this classic monster movie with the production qualities and drama of The Creeping Terror, and you have an idea of ​​what this movie looks like. <br /> <br /> The film is being dubbed, even though it is from the original actors (I think the film was originally dubbed in Italian for the audiences of those countries, then renamed for publication in the US), which make the movie look weird ... the sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, just do not really fit the action on screen, even if the actor's lips move properly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... he's definitely a long way from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or any of the great movies he's in. Add this to his other sci-fi travesties (Year Zero Panic, X The X-Ray Man), and you see a once-good actor who got into a Boris-Karloff syndrome ... I really do bad horror movies made abroad, just for work.
