When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was quite impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be more entertaining. At first I thought it was a disturbing, unseen evil force (after reading the book) to scare the audience - but it turns out to be a mundane killer. Anyway, I'm a pretty open-minded person when it comes to movies, so I thought the movie might bring some kind of groundbreaking effect on carnivorous vines. Unfortunately, he has not met my expectations the excessive amount of clichés and lack of originality. To top it off, the female protagonist continues to annoy her with her stupidity. If the movie is not deliberately a bad movie rated as malignant by the B category and entertaining in the hilarity of Badness, no film should ever have a main character that irritates you when you expect the audience to turn up to take care of the character. Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were not developed, the monsters (plants in this case) remained unclear, and clichés dripped everywhere. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is lightly effective are some of the bloody scenes, though the Gale gets pale compared to movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Logically failed logic (for example, why a character would not count the top of a rope during a second attempt to get into the ruins when he just grabbed and nearly killed someone) would add up, and the audience, even if it's only a small one still annoying. The film could have saved itself by using characters or a kind of story-telling device to censure or "cash-in" idiots who did something stupid (or at least let the characters recognize or regret their own mistakes). But if one continues to allow idiocy to take over, the audience will surely give up all concern for the character, which in turn removes the horrors of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a poorly finished movie. An example of a successful movie with nearly twenty stages to be killed is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (and also the prequel), which certainly scared and had far fewer logical flaws. In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, look at it, if there is nothing else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this sub-par movie and see something that is really scary and highly satisfying, like The Hills Have Eyes Remake.
