This movie tries to demolish Predator, but this movie is much better. This movie has really terrible special effects and a thoughtless action. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearance of military and scientists is a combination of rough and robust male Delta commands and pretty, but tough, female rangers. None of them are too bright. All characters seem more than willing to run alone into the forest and fall headlong into a spear or a sword and their deaths. Some of the pyrotechnics are very big and must have cost a bundle. But the close-ups of the creature, like most death scenes, are ridiculous. Every clich√© that the authors could think of was used. If you are looking for a witless slaughter, this can fill the bill. The night I saw it was very slow, so I went through the whole thing. I have to admit that it has been a while since I saw such a bad thing. There is very little to redeem this movie. I am amazed that such a garbage is produced.
