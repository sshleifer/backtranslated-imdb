That did not really interest me. If they had let go of the comedy / slapstick and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, it might have been worth it. <br /> <br /> The longer the movie ran, the less I liked the protagonist / mailman. He has interesting things to say, but he is also a hypocritical, insecure fool. <br /> <br /> 3/10
