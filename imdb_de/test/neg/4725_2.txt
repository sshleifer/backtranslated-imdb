The following "review" is one from the wrong side of the title, which means two things: you will hear nothing but praise that comes from me, and do not let my judgment fool you. I could also tell you that this review does not include spoilers, but technically ... that's a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... screwed the rating. I will just wander around a bit. It's been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can not enjoy this piece of jerk, you just do not have a sense of humor. First of all, this movie should be taken seriously, and that is the main aspect of the fun. The history? The son of a doctor is terminally ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that having a heart transplant is the only way to save his son. So he decides in truly crazy doctoral style that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. Of course, the gorilla heart is "too strong for a human," so the sonny boy turns into this vile ape-man who immediately sets out and organizes a deadly and raping spree (because that would just do a horny beast it not?). The make-up of our monkey man is funny. There is no other way to express it: the boys face looks like a shit! I'm talking about human excrement, the solid brown kind! Beautiful! The Gore in this movie is also wonderful: Apart from real footage of open heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but rather evil) looking blood and blood effects: a decapitation, a sycophant, a throat jaw, scalp scalping Somebody ... It's hilarious and indeed it's completely incomprehensible why NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES has ever made it to the notorious UK video nasties list, because all the evil things that are portrayed in this movie are simply too ridiculous are taken seriously. Oh, and there's only a bloody monkey around. Needless to say, LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and compelling story of science that went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> If you do not try to shock depictions of female nudity with poorly staged bloody or random acts, this movie manages to be very entertaining, with ingredients such as nonsensical dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, stupidity of action, and unbelievably bad Play. Maybe just a few random examples? About the sets: You can clearly see that the set designers used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) over and over again to build different interior sets (eg: One side of the sickroom - the window side) - where the unconscious one Wrestling Girl is lying, looks suspiciously similar to the window side of the basement laboratory, escapes from the Ape-Man: The set designers also took one of the side windows from the laboratory, made it a little bigger and fair it placed in the conference room of the hospital; all walls in each building are the same gray; ...). Then there is the park. Clearly recorded in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose. Whenever there is fighting / fighting / rape, the grass simply shifts and shuffles and you can see the gray concrete from the studio floor below. <br /> <br /> Just a few random lines that bring out the actors' mouths: <br /> <br /> - In the conference room where all the doctors talk about the disappearance of the unconscious wrestling girl (a disappearing, that Of course, bad debate about the hospital would mean debate), Papa Doctor says intelligently, "We are in a difficult situation". <br /> <br /> - In the same debate, a colleague-doctor notes: "A sleepwalker! Every sleepwalker gets up." Disappearance of an unconscious wrestling girl. <br /> <br /> - After our investigative detective has come to his conclusion through the amazing process of his own logical inference, he tells his supervisor that the killer must be half a man, his supervisor replies that it is absurd and added the line: "More likely lately, more and more, you see many of these images of horror on TV" ... really one of the best lines of the film. <br /> <br /> Other laughter: <br /> <br /> - The two scenes were Daddy-Doctor and his Igor-like assistant kidnapping the gorilla from the zoo and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital - These well thought-out kidnappings are like taking candy from a baby. <br /> <br /> - Daddy-Doctor talks a lot to God, right? <br /> <br /> - Sonny Boy calls Daddy-Doctor more than once on "Daddy". <br /> <br /> - An old lady screams "Aaargh !!!" A dead man! A dead man! A dead man !! A dead man !!! "<br /> <br /> - The plot stops regularly to wallow in scenes of touching women, just to keep going and not to do anything with that concept, sure, Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny Boy's gorilla heart a second time Time with the unconscious wrestling girl, but do you think something great is going to happen after that, like Ape-Turd-Man, who grows breasts or something that tries to rape men this time? Our leading wrestling beauty (Norma Lazareno) ) does not engage in a wrestling contest with Ape-Turd-Man near the movie ... But Ape-Turd-Man almost shows maternal love ... almost (and I say "almost") ") in real KING KONG style (ie the top of a building and the people on the floor are pointing and screaming). <br /> <br /> Okay, I think that's enough. I've recorded more than my two cents here Vomitron's rational rating for this shabby piece of hilarious filth: 2/10 Review by Vomitron From the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. Watch this movie, people are worth it!
