My wife received free tickets from our employer for our family to attend the premiere of this film. I just regret the price of popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted with this garbage movie. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD of the original mask and I really enjoyed it. I reckoned with a remake that does not quite match the original in production or writing. However, I was not prepared for this vulgar rubbish heap. Weak acting, bad action, a bad CGI baby who transfers gas and urinates in hyper "mask mode". A woman turned into a huge nose and spit slime .. fun, right? My eight year old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this was over, I asked him what he thought. His exact words; "I hated it, it's like the Scooby Doo movie, you take something good and you have to add all the rough stuff." My twelve-year-old daughter and wife hated it too. My wife later told me that my son asked her twice if we could go. He has never done that. I am proud of him. If you do not think that I am a Puritan kind of man, from the moaning and lack of laughter that I heard in the theater, I think most of the patrons agreed with me. <br /> <br /> This movie shows all the bad things kids entertainment today, and all the positive reviews MUST be made by people who are financially attached to the movie.
