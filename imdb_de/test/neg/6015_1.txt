What's the point? Was not that done earlier, better? And again? Why does Werner Herzog waste his good talents and his time with such a garbage? Should not he make a movie somewhere - I mean, a real movie? <br /> <br /> It felt wrong from the start. Werner Herzog would never have tried to make a film about the myth of Loch Ness - at least not on such a small scale, surrounded by losers - so that the conspiracy was unbelievable right from the start. The actors, who were supposed to act as if they were not acting, obviously acted. The story was not interesting, the "everyday people" that were needed in each mockumentary were invisible, the personalities were stale, the jokes were not funny, the effects were unconvincing, and the end was nowhere to be seen. I just do not understand the point , It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah. Maybe if those who invented such a movie wanted to make a movie that ridiculed people who were really looking for a real Nessie, that would have potential now. But Duke is not a believer and has never claimed to be. A mockumentary on cryptozoologists would have so much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a failure.
