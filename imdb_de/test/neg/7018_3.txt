Lucille Ball can not sing or play or dance. This makes the quality of their performance in MAME all the more terrible. She must not make the low-brows slapstick that made her a hit on TV, so she has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Ms. Ball never learned this ability because none of the tender moments have warmth. How does she really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words she says. This blank look from Ms. Ball is supposed to convince us that she is emotional, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. That's why every scene she's in is flat. <br /> <br /> When Ms. Ball opens her mouth to singing, we are immediately alerted to the reason why the studios named her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career. It was stated that she demanded that her voice be used, so that this is a mistake of the ego and the leadership. It gets even worse when she sings in the voice over and she has to act "the moment" without words. Who believed that would work forgot who played Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell played the role on stage and in the movie AUNTIE MAME. I am also aware that Angela Lansbury has won a Tony for her performance on the original 1966 Broadway musical. None of these women were known for their voices, but both could have done better than Lucille Ball. Why they went with her is the worst thing about blatant miscarriages. <br /> <br /> The only person who comes out unscathed is Bea Arthur. It is big and wonderful, catlike and distributed in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you are always waiting for this movie and invite you to join in the fun. But the movie never does that and you can not do it. Nobody but Bea Arthur seems to have fun. <br /> <br /> Another bad review goes to director Gene Saks. Saks is known as the award-winning director of stage and screen musicals and comedies, including the Broadway musical on which this movie is based. None of these skills and abilities are helpful here. The poor cut and narrative quality in this film is under a director of his caliber. This glaring mistake in running the movie is not the fault of Ms. Ball.
