The only good thing about this movie was the end. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you go home. No, that may be a little hard - the dance in the movie was sensational, but unfortunately the plot ended. As long as the cast danced and did not talk, the movie went well. As for Chayanne's debut - not so bad, but hopefully his next movie will have a bit more depth. If you want to watch the movie, wait for the rental or the television. Do not make the same mistake as me and pay 8.50
