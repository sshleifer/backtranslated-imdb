Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of cake and food. <br /> <br /> As always, pure sadistic portrayal can be explained as a clever, thought-provoking way of reducing violence to the public. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Mr. Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It pays to respond. How very brilliant. <br /> <br /> The youthful part of the audience may not be smart enough to follow all the wise clues to higher levels of consciousness, but I am confident that one day they will see the light. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making our little world a little better. You deserve a medal.
