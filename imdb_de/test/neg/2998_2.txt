First the easy part: This movie is a presumptuous Crapola! <br /> <br /> It reminds me of "Magnolia". And then I thought, "Wow - someone made a movie even more stupid and irritating than" Magnolia ". <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to have been made by someone Much in film school, but knows nothing about storytelling The trite plot elements and the sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic that should be funny or satirical are not the "elegiac" parts are beautiful coffee table pictures with mediocre music, the "emotional" parts are kept simple. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that the movie shows no love for the characters except for a little cornball dignity Priests. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe the respect some people gave to this picture.
