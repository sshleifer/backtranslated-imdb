This movie is over the top !! Sadly, I have to say that I have been able to see the first 15 minutes of this movie and everything that goes beyond that. I have to force myself hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It is totally stupid and very fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing this steel suit, and acting is really bad, especially the one who plays the character alien. He is so annoying !! Do not waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I would rather sleep or spend my money on other things than watch this movie. 1 of 10. If possible, I would give 0.
