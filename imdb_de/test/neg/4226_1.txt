L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These films are generally popular, <br /> <br /> and the rating of 6.9 that it currently has suggests that this was also the case. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities. <br /> Some non-spoilers, for example, contain a five-minute scene in which the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes breathing. <br /> <br /> If you wondered, this is not art. It's also not a <br /> <br /> comment on humanity it seems to have after the title <br /> <br />. It is actually boring. There are numerous attempts in this <br /> <br /> movie to say something about humanity. You might think, "How would I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> Not that these options are uninteresting if they are done well - only the <br /> <br /> these are the canonical options. For sex, this film does its best to make it unattractive and disgusting. In the first five minutes - that's not a spoiler - you see the bloody vagina of a murdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember? Later, a few people throw each other and have what the director wants us to believe is raw sex, but in fact it is. <br /> invented and too symbolic - but worse, uninteresting , <br /> <br /> I like being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing films usually show something in someone's <br /> <br /> their humanity that they did not know existed and a bit <br /> < br /> afraid of it. L'Humanité tried to do just that and failed, and I went out of the theater without being disturbed, but disgusted because I thought I was wasting my time in the theater, even though the film was for <br /> <br /> was seen for free.
