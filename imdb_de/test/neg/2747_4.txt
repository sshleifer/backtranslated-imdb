"Afterlife" is about a somewhat arrogant, reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and cares for his sister, who has Down syndrome. He can not deal with her and would basically just take her from his hands; He has better things to do. At some point he realizes that he wants to take her across the country by car (she does not like flying). <br /> <br /> If this sounds familiar to you, it's probably because you've seen Rainman, a movie far superior to his counterfeiter, AfterLife. That it copies the basic requirements (to hell with a few characters and even scenes) is not the basic problem of the movie. The basic problem is that I'm not interested in these characters. <br /> <br /> Brother Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a bit of a womanizer. He has a girlfriend who comes and goes down in history and she learns to like Down's Syndrome sister (again by Rainman). He is a journalist and tries to talk to a doctor who is in for a scandal. When he then takes care of Roberta, the sister, he does not have much time for her and sometimes leaves her alone for too long. When she leaves, he gets even madder at her. Am I destroying anything by saying that at the end of the film he becomes a nicer, loving person? Roberta is not determined to be "normal"; She is "normal" and wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Down syndrome, and her performance is simply the best thing about the movie. Why did not the scriptwriter research her character anymore? Well, probably because that would mean that the characters would get in the way of the story. As we already knew the story, did not the filmmakers see the problem they created? <br /> <br /> For a movie about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (the father is absent, I think he is) dead, but I'm not sure), it's amazing how little of that Film affects the emotions of the viewer. The scenes are so standardized and boring, with such a predictable standard dialogue that I can roll my eyes take care of the characters. Here are the characters so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I did not really think that there was much to worry about. "Rain Man" has an emotional climax, but that moved me because I took care of the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of highlights, this movie has a stinker. There is a sequence at the end of the film that starts with an incredible situation and ends in an even worse area. An unforgivably cruel trick is played by the audience. The sequence is intended to move the audience, but is terribly manipulative and offends the viewer's intelligence. The audience is not stupid and they know when the movie is cheating. What a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is not a single scene that has the effect it should have. There are some weird sequences, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, I can practically see the script in front of me, moving predictably and uninterestingly, never meeting anything that touches the mind or the heart. There are the wrong arguments reserved specifically for the movies, the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Why should supposedly "realistic" films fail to realize that anger in real life can be irrational and that people sometimes can not express their feelings and maybe say things that make no sense or can not say anything? All actors in this film deserve better material. This film is not fact-based, but I think a documentary about a family with a Down syndrome member would be much more interesting. That way we might have had truth and emotions. For some reason, the characters in this film think that an emotion is only to say something aloud and create a matching facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (out of 5)
