If you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of Mount Everest, you can enjoy this movie. Just skip the view of the mountain. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) However, if you believe, as I do, that life is precious and should not be wasted, then this movie will leave a bad taste in your movie mouth. Six people died, five Sherpas and one member of the Japanese Party just for a man to try to drive down Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The film raises the question of whether the expedition should continue. His personal goal was still worth living, and he responds with a strong "yes." <br /> <br /> The skiing is in the last 15 minutes. He briefly skis, then crashes the rest of the way, until he stops in the snow.
