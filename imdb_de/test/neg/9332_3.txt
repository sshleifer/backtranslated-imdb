Most unshakeable biblical hocus-pocus, which runs for over two hours. The only thing that saves this movie from God's Wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialogue and a good fight scene that comes way too late in the movie. During most of the two hours to the action scenes is too much talk. The dialogue is so inappropriate that the movie only asks to be faked by MST3K. George Sanders is absolutely terrible; One of the most animated, overly theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better. His stiff, wooden acting, combined with the terrible fortune-cookie wisdom statements, make for a rather boring and stupid Salomon. It seems as if every time Brynner opens his mouth, something mindful and ridiculously high-mighty come out. To a certain extent, Sanders and Brynner are not to blame for the crabby, weird dialogue and typically biblical one-dimensional characterization, but otherwise they have made little effort. Brynner's accent is even reminiscent of Schwarzenegger's; That's no plus. Only Lollobrigida manages to embarrass herself by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way that plays a role in such a dumb movie. To call these biblical characters one-dimensional would also be too much for them. The characterization is semi-dimensional.
