The main part of this light musical history is in the fictional Midwick College, where Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) participates, because stage actress Grace Hayes, his real mother, who plays the same role here and manages to work here, provides her love interest through her secretary Mary (Healy), who is his real wife. Led by a weak script and additionally hampered by excessive editing and poor editing, this film offers some treasures among its eight songs, including the track number, and has beautiful twists by Soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as the owner of a food stick, and the dynamic Tap Dancing Roland Dupree.
