There is a special sky for people who make the world laugh. In addition to Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, The Marx Bros and ..... (fill in your own favorites), there must be room for everyone associated with "Airport 80 - Concorde, the Movie". Above all, Robert Wagner surpasses all expectations that represent the comedy performance of a lifetime. I never thought he had it in him. The only way he could have been funnier would have been to wear a red nose and a rotatable fly. British moviegoers will recognize the fat movie of Cannon and Ball pretending to be a Russian athlete, a nice trick if he could have done it, but he could not stand it tragically. George Kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and my goodness he triumphs! Braow wrinkles with timeless dialogue and every word is lovingly turned into cowardly Coward. Only once in twenty years does a movie in Hollywood revolve around "Airport 80". In all the years of effort and struggle, sweat, tears, lessons from Lee Strasberg, life from suitcases, in the trunk, etc., etc. Come to success. A work of art is created that lasts as long as there are films and machines on which it can be shown. I think I'm ready for my medication now.
