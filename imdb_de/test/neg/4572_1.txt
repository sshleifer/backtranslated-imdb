I would not call myself a big fan of the genius of imaginative stupidity, so maybe I'm not the best audience for this show. Although I am a critic, I have a sense of what I personally like and dislike. This is the later. <br/> <br /> The lack of humor is a big turnaround when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy and cool and cheeky for about 4 minutes and then you get boring, if not the badger animation from a few years ago ( ?). This is the exact opposite, with a stiff script and overclocked syncs, it's just stupid and very boring to undergo. Unfortunately she had a big market ahead of her and a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> Waste of time.
