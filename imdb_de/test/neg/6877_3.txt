Here he is. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here ... Ray The Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, the enemy, Ray is a complete prick. This is partly because of the cheeky things he does. Also because he has a scar on his face. But mostly because Ray The Prick was milked. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray does not channel the evil. He is not even cursed, not even by a voodoo spell. No, Ray The Prick was milked. As DeNiro once said: "You can milk everything with nipples". And Ray was milked. From evil. <br /> <br /> How do you milk the evil you ask? Snake Nipples, I answer. Snake nipple. Why Ray, you ask? Because he's a sting, I answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Watch the New Line Pictures extravaganza titled "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick." <br /> <br /> Did you think your new horror savior would be Jeeper The Creeper? Well, not anymore, because Ray The Prick is here. And I am afraid. <br /> <br /> Pity about the atmosphere, PG-13, unoriginal-crafted quality of the film because Ray is a star.
