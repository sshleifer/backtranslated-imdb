I do not know, maybe I just was not in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of mundane melodrama. It was too long and seemed at least slightly incoherent (of course I did not pay all the attention ...). For an entertaining account of the Battle of Stalingrad see Enemy At The Gates. It's true that some pretensions are ridiculed because it's a Hollywood movie that does not show the "warlike reality of war" like this "wonderful foreign movie," but it has a better flow and is just more fun. In addition, there are already enough "blatant" war movies, and this movie just seemed to be amateurish. But hey, you might like it, so go ahead now; it just was not for me.
