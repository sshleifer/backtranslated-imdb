First of all, I do not know if I should use my imagination in this movie or the director was trying to save money or a little money! Let's go .... <br /> <br /> Basically, there were so many years and gaps that I do not understand, it's like the movie jumps from 9 to 20 years to 30 and you make so many holes ask, how the hell did that happen? and why? I think that's a big river. Forget the criticisms that lament the story again and again, this film has not only historical facts, but so many shortcomings. So most people say, look at this in the cinema, you'll lose all the cinematographies like rivers, deserts and so on. That's true, they are beautiful. That's why I've been waiting for the 1080p BluRay release. OK! nice scenes, but what's the point of it? I turned off the movie after an hour and a half, I just lost interest. The film has been doing the same things over and over again for years (at least Mr. Director, for example, after 2 years after 10 years!). I mean, I could not see the movie I understood what's going on! Anyway, I wish I could include Verderber, but if you decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how that happened. you will know what I mean! Do not look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
