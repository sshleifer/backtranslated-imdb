If you thought NBC's 10.5 would be stupid, you'll be glad to hear that FX has invaded the guts of TV Hell and crushed their fingers into this pseudo after 9/11. The conspiracy was not only stupid, it was a complete rip-off of 24 and a bad rip-off. The film style was the now overused "Docu Action" look, complete with cuts of grainy B & W "Rawcore". I'm not sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said before filming the director. I do not know what they wanted here, but it reminded me of the guy in the office who thinks PowerPoint presentations with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool." <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 "terrorists" are taking over a nuclear power plant in southern California. Right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where in Ying-Yang safety precautions are taken. For the sake of reality, they have taken 2 CHiPpies out of service. Because they could stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Willis was dealing with more terrorists in this stupid Nakatomi building. Leslie Hope (Teris Bauer on TV) plays a CHP official who has trouble speaking on the phone after she was shot in her bulletproof vest. Her voice sounds like a TV commercial by Sally Struther, whiny and monotonous. Her character is just a plot, and after she has done her little duty, she is disposed of immediately. Yes, Teri Bauer has died! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood plays as FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who constantly points out how to punch foreign diplomats in the face. His boss is out, so no one in the Department of Homeland Security believes his prognosis. He is the sensible representative of a group of paranoid officials who are afraid of being responsible for any kind of disaster. He is calm, he is strong, he is boring. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about Meltdown - OK, maybe Teri Bauer's death was pretty unnecessary and funny - nothing else redeeming.
