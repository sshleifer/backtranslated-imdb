I knew that I was LONG for 90 minutes when the opening voice mispronounced the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like Scare Crew). And sure enough, 90 minutes later, after seeing witnesses beyond the dread drama, the boring drama, the scarecrow's blows are not near their intended target, but still "beating" it, Ken Shamrock's "drama," and that dumbest illogical end that I've seen my life (ok, no, I'll take the last bit back, in about a week). After all this, I cried openly that I could not just go to Lacuna a la Jim Carrey and just erase it from my head. My thoughts that director Brian Katkin should have made an OK film under the right circumstances that I had after seeing "Slaughter Studios" are now completely out of my mind. My degree: F <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert become topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until September 22, 2005)
