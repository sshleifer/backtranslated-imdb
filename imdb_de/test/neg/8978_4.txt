Although this was the first documentary by Hunter S. Thompson, I've seen that, despite all the big star appearances like Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey, and a few others, it was an average average. That disappointed me and still it was a bit interesting. What always showed me were some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not so good, mostly because of the old men walking around and things that every fan would already know. I still think they milked it, because it could have been compressed by at least half. If you are a fan, I would like anything that has to do with hunters. best regards
