This was just a horrible movie. I once looked at it when I was about 12, I'm 19 now and I do not think I'll ever forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I still feel sick when I think about anything terrible that could possibly fit into a movie. I really do not understand what kind of people would enjoy this garbage. It's not enough to just turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the dumbest TV movies that are made for the TV just like the next person, but this is something completely different I do not like watching a movie judge until I've seen it myself, but trust me to do you a favor. Do not look at this movie.
