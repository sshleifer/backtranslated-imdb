A waste of time, talent and shelf space, this is a really bad movie. What are the big leaders like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz, and Dan Aykroyd, who waste their time being in garbage? The little criminal Reeves appears at the wedding of his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) and leaves the bride. A comedy, thriller, romance? Honestly, I do not know! Reeves is in the lead role, and casting Dan Aykroyd as a cop is so horrible that you have to see it to believe it! The only bright spot from a dark, dark tunnel is Diaz and even she is not so good. Rent something else. Anyone involved in this mess should, in shame and loot, keep the heads that will be forgotten in the years to come.
