Have you ever watched the movie "Marathon Man"? The part at the dentist? I prefer it, as if I happen to be sitting by "Random Hearts". It was not just uninteresting or uneventful - it was terrible, painful and torturously boring. At one point I briefly lost consciousness. For the average layman, I seemed to sleep, but the other movie cartridges knowingly realized that I was actually knocked out of the bordom. I thought I would die. When the movie was finally over (I think it was twelve hours, but I'm not sure), I gave a disturbed "Thank you Jesus, it's over !!" to which all other moviegoers cheered. If I had to listen to Harrison Ford's drone for another second in that monotonous whining, I would have been forced to look for something sharp that was jamming in my eyes to distract my attention. This is 136 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
