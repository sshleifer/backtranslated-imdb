You know, I'm sure the boys were sitting in the office one day and saying, "How can we make more money?" They had made every possible toy variant with their current characters. So they decide, let's steal the Star Wars idea A PREQUEL, and we can all invent new characters and sell them as toys. By the way, something they have done in puppet master 3, but who cares? Anyway, they choose a time before the first film in which Toulon is still alive, he and the dolls are sitting around, and a wooden head rolls on the floor, and the dolls want to know whether it is a dead family member or something is playing no role This is how the story of the puppet master's lineage begins. It's long, it's boring, it does not care for a body. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is, they tell the origins of these new characters in the movie, but give no clue to their fate. HOW TO GET WHAT, as soon as the proceeds from the new toys pay off, they can create a new (and fourth smooth) episode titled "PUPPET MASTER 8 THE SEQUEL ON THE REQUIREMENT OF THE FATE OF THE DEAD RETRO PUPPETS!" Hold your breath!
