This movie is sometimes scary, maybe no more than when a naked George Kennedy tells his hooker friend that he wants a little more sugar. Luckily, his nakedness is covered with a blanket, but the picture is even more terrifying than anything you can find in Schindler's list. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film was inspiring; It inspired me to watch another movie. In a scene where a stewardess talks about male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it's called a cock pit?" Charming. <br /> <br /> And yes, unlike what some have written, this movie is very, very bad.
