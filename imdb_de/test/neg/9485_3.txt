I was once a big Olsen fan. I got this movie when I was six years old and saw it almost continuously until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf until yesterday and collected dust. I was speechless. Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve-year-olds who will spend the spring break in Paris with their grandfather, the ambassador. Along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two sweet French guys who show them the funnier side of Paris. I think the two guys were fine, except for the wrong French accents. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and the humor is shallow and hackneyed. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two flat girls with too much make-up on their faces. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you are not interested in Olsen twins or family movies.
