I love John's work as a singer, but the movie was boring and "worth the time". <br /> <br /> I thought he had done his job "ok". When he says, "You have an affair with the old man," to his co-star, I somehow chuckled at his facial movements ... or their lack. <br /> <br /> I would suggest the movie if you like John's music, but not as a Saturday night video. <br /> <br /> If you love his music, then the video contains some music from him, but not much. <br /> <br /> So ... best
