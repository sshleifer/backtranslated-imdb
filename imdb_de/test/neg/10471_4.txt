.... OK, small town, clueless sheriff? Check. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Ne'er-do-well friend of Sheriff's hot daughter who hates sheriff? Check. Land developer who greedily brings profit to people? Check. The developers accidentally unleashed an ancient monster and then pressured it to cover it up. Check. Natives warn of mass extinction and destruction if things are not back to what they were? Check. Amateur CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check. Seriously, virtually all the clich√©s of your typical sci-fi original movie have been grouped into a classic, bad, good movie. The only one missing is the scientist / expert trying to convey his knowledge. There's a paleontologist with three students who get robbed into my Bone Eater pretty early in the movie, but they're basically extras in the movie. And I can honestly say that I pretty much predicted everything. except for who survives and who does not (though I have to say that the actual death of one of the characters was wrong by about an hour). I swear I could have made this film myself if they had given me all the characters. Still, watching the movie is fun, but for no other reason than playing MST3K with your friends. If you want some mindless fun, it's a great movie you can watch. That's why I give this film a surprisingly respectable 4, even though it deserves a much lower rating in every way. On the other hand, if you're looking for a movie with an actual plot, essential characters, or good special effects, would not you choose a sci-fi original movie, right?
