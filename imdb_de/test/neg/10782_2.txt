If you, dear reader, have never heard this film was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy-Klunker The Man. This down-to-earth pals-action comedy from the 80s unites the entertaining Billy Crystal with the late Ethiopian shim-master Gregory Hines as witty police officers from Chi-Town who do not abide by the rules. That's pretty much the scope of the movie. The interest is attracted by Hines' line delivery, which is incredibly similar to Will Smith's, and by cameos from now more famous actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and "NYPD Blue's" Jimmy Smits. My favorite scene is, I do not know, the chase, I think. Basically, I just see this movie as a big help in breaking off action buddy flicks. Well, these and Lethal Weapon 4 ... and Rush Hour 2 ... and the man ...
