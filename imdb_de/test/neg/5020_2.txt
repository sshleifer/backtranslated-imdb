First of all, I would like to say that I lean politically liberally and that the film was offensive. I managed to see all the shame of a movie. This film dwarfs original ideas. Yes, it was originally my 2 stars instead of 1. Are our film writers so uncreative that they can only do that? Acting was horrible and the characters were mostly unlikely. The lead actress in the story did not have any good qualities at all. They made her a bad guy, and I did not see that at all. Maybe I missed something, I do not know. He was the most down to earth, most relevant character in the movie. I did not spend any money on this garbage. I almost wish PETA would save this horrible, offensive movie and make a protest. That's all I have to say!
