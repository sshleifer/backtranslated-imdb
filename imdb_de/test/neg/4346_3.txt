Not "confusing" in the sense, "Gee, this movie is really complex and therefore hard to follow!" But confusing in the sense, "Gee, this movie really has no idea what he's doing!" <br /> <br /> DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a collaboration between Hong Kong and South Korea, but everything is nonsense. A film about parallel universes mixed with time travel mixed with a love story mixed with stupidity. <br /> <br /> The film has the kind of concept that outsmarted the mind. Again, the mind is not burdened with certainty because it is so grand and complex, but in the sense that it is so ridiculous and you can not imagine anyone ever developing such a terrible premise. Nothing in DREAM OF A WARRIOR Meaning, and that's because the entire movie should never have been made. It is pretty awful. The only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior (not the female lead role). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
