If you want to see how you can ruin a movie, study it very closely. In fact, it's so bad that people should buy it just for that reason. In particular, note how most scenes look like they are exhausted in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this film on all levels. The overall impression is that someone was given a below-average screenplay, would-be actors, an average director and absolutely no budget. With such a formula it just had to be doomed to failure. <br /> <br /> I rented it once, and I swear I was stupid to look at it. If you're a humanitarian man, buy this horrible, terrible movie and burn it - UNMOUNTED - as a favor to the world. It has no identifiable conspiracy, bad acting and then throws something about nasty ugly women, just to complete the whole thing really. I would suggest watching the paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape! Serious. The color would be better. I wish I could forgive these negative 10 stars.
