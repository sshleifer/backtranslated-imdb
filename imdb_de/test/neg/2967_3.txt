There were very few good moments in this movie. Only a few characters were formed and not so good. There were plotting holes large enough to drive a truck. The pace crept ahead like an old man. There were many moments when the movie never came back like Coco's stripping. What happened to her? How about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We have learned absolutely nothing about him. What about the electric piano? How about the rich girl who got an abortion? What happened to her? That was an interesting subplot. Overall, this is not a good movie and I recommend another musical that was included in this movie. LET'S TAKE THE TIME LEAP ONCE AGAIN !!!!!!!
