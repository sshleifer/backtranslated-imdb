What should I say about this movie? A married couple has more than just one another. After some time playing around, it gets more serious. A difficult decision must be made: continue the old situation or start over, following the heart. Guess what happens in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be very low. But a good story does not have to be expensive. It looks like a play that has been transformed into a movie only by using several cheaper places (at least very few other people), more than just the stage, here the house. From the first minute, future developments are as clear as water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you might think about watching a soft porn movie. In this case, you know in advance that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this film disappointing, that explains the vote (4).
