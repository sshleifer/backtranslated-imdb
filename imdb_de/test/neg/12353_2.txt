Rabbit Fever is a memento collection of sketches, each of which focuses on a female personal device created in 1998 by a single episode of Sex and the City (the second half of 1998) and not by the early episodes, all directed by director were made known). From the opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of ​​predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a rampage of the world with the addiction of women to lonely pleasure. <br /> <br /> As Germaine Greer explains rather arrogantly, they have invented a gadget for women that eliminates the need for men in the bedroom. The Rabbit Vibrator (which, according to some statistics, accounts for about a quarter of all vibrator sales) is named for its small, rabbit-like long ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while rotating beads in the shaft stimulate the vagina's interior. The film questions characters who visit Rabbits Anonymous to overcome their "addictions," as well as celebrities such as Tom Conti posing as a professor, or Richard Branson (amid scenes in which rabbits are banned in planes) that he's free Rabbit wants to offer to its passengers of the first class and finally to all. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to endure 85 minutes of cinema, the sketches do not have the writing. You could say that a Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais are funny enough, and even though it might lead to late night television, there's no catch for getting people to multiplex in multiplexes to see masturbation jokes. <br /> <br /> Lines like, "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how are you?" Wear thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word "rabbit" gets a laugh. , , and one more thing and one more thing. Frantic midnight rides to buy batteries may be amusing in real life, but here they seem quite laborious, and the special emergency service is rightly welcome. <br /> <br /> The BBFC has strangely received despite the zero an 18-certificate violence, barely explicit sex and sexual references that are less "perverted" than any late-night comedy show. The company protested the decision, but the BBFC did not budge. At first glance, this seems too over the top, and consumer advice simply says, "Contains frequent strong sexual references." One might think that teenagers would find masturbation jokes more fun than the most desperate stag parties, and the topic would be worth a debate. But Rabbit Fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to his topic. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably The Rabbit Song by Ruocco (who plays a band called Thumper in the movie). For those who fell asleep and woke up at the end of the credits, there is a bonus scene at the end reassuring them that they have not missed anything.
