If, like me, you're actively seeking the world's rarest and craziest (and often terrible) worlds, then look no further than Hong Kong's supernatural horror edition in the early '80s. Often you mix bizarre black magic with kung-fu and stupid comedy and are usually packed with a lot of scary creepy-crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, millipedes, etc.). These movies are as bizarre as it gets. <br /> <br /> Succubare is definitely a typical example: a hill tribe whose wives prevent their husbands from turning away by casting evil spells over them (when they go, they cause writhing creatures to fill and die a painful death), some so-Martial Arts and many realistic animal killings (many of which are carried out by a geek who has absolutely nothing to do with the story), this movie is just strangely. <br /> <br /> A long scene where tribal women hunt for snakes and insects, accidentally throw the creatures into the baskets on their backs and are mesmerizing. a tribal festival where a poor ox is hit on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting; and the moments when worms crawl in open wounds and vomit on the floor will whet your appetite for a while. <br /> <br /> However, it is the live animal chewing that makes Succubare truly legendary for the status of fans of filmmaking. It is quite abominable to see and yet strangely captivating: The geek dapples around on a snake, slams down a thick, juicy toad (angry!) And devours hungry a mouse (which bites from the head and then pushes the rest) /> < br /> No great movie (damn it, it's not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all. He gets 4 out of 10 points from me, which is probably more than he deserves, but I reluctantly respect that I can easily feel sick.
