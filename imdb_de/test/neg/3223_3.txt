Well, I'm a big fan and supporter of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought it on eBay on eBay for my friend's birthday. We sat down and it was so boring. I can not remember having laughed once. It only takes an hour and a half and it seemed to take forever to finish. Elizabeth is great. Maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkley. If she had not been there, I would not have seen it, but every time she came, my face lit up. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth could not save this movie. Just the general story and the terrible comedy make this movie a movie you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life. It is a very forgetful movie.
