Um ... I think I'll be the only one who says that, but yes, I was a little bored during the movie. Not to say that this is a bad movie, it is indeed a very good attempt to portray the innermost emotions - dilemma, grief, love ..., especially the debut of the director (read from somewhere, is that true? ). I felt that something was not quite right, maybe it's just me, I'm not enough attracted by the characters to immerse myself in their world. This is a simple story about ordinary people and ordinary lives. In simple and short dialogues, the director tries to talk about the life of a simple man and how he can deal with the news of his illness by laughing her off every time. Oh yes, his laugh was kind of cute in the beginning, but gradually it comes to me, such a deep, heartfelt roar for a gentle man! I have to say, I did not feel the effects that most readers felt. In fact, I was more attracted to trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon grains with his sister, which clearly shows that they feel comfortable, the grandma who came back for another shot - that's kind of melancholy, the thoughtful gesture, to write down the procedures for his father - hmm, but that's predictable. Do not confuse me with being an action lover, independent films are my thing! Maybe I just have a very high expectation after seeing a lot of deep films that have a stronger footage. Some Asian movies are worth seeing: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (shows loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialogue) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (also loneliness) 15 (Gangster lives in local environment) Before sunrise and Before Sunset (Just to mention that these are not Asian movies, fans will understand!)
