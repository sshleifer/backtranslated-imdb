I agree with all previously published comments: This film was a waste of time and energy for both viewers and those who made it. Terrible CGI, terrible script, stupid storyline and hey, the setting is Alabama, but it looks like California. But worst of all is the nook of Native Americans, who pulls every cliche imaginable out of the boss surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, the people who speak without contractions. ), Indian whistles playing in the air, etc. It just shows a lack of respect and understanding that I would rip my hair out. An Native American with some self-esteem would have thrown his TV out of the window at this garbage. Finally, I would say that this movie is pretty offensive to everyone.
