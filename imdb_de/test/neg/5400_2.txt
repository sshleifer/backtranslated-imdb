A unit of the Delta Force Army, tasked with finding a series of missing, non-vanishing green berets, is in a battle for survival against a disguised skeleton man, the alleged spirit of an ancient Indian warrior, who revived at that time Archaeologists were disturbed his grave. The skeleton man rides a horse and has the ability to float back and forth with a kind of dimensional portal, and does not appear to be affected by bullet fire and explosives. The horse of the skeleton man leaves no hoofprints and he can silently ride from behind and around his prey. The film's view through the Skeleton Man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color. In other words, he does not seem to be human. How can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, as sharp and intense as ever) and his group of commandos stop this threat? For some reason, the Skeleton Man murders employees at a nearby chemical plant. What are the motives of the Skeleton Man to kill endless humans? And why is a blind Indian who lives in the forest of our commandos spared when the skeleton man as a human slaughters his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> As stupid as it sounds. Just unbelievably terrible. This is the kind of movie that can kill brain cells. Casper Van Dien is second in the credits under Rooker, but is saddled with a ridiculously signed character, who leaves the film quite early. Rooker deserves more than that. If I were an actor, I would not want this movie on my resume. The Skeleton Man is a Templar Knight from a de Ossorio movie. He has a spear that can knock down only certain people while exploding a woman's head on impact. An arrow shot from the bow of the Skeleton Man actually destroys the propeller of a helicopter plane. For nearly 99% of the movie, bullets are shot at the Skeleton Man, and he can go in and out of this portal thing, but in the end he suddenly becomes vulnerable to attacks. Oh, and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man moves freely through the forest from this portal. The movie is written and edited by clowns. The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced professionals, make really bad decisions in this movie. The mind fails with this movie. Good for a few laughs, and some gore scenes make this filth of pure crap to look like garbage film.
