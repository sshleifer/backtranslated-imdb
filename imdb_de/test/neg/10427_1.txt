and I have seen many movies. I saw it in the theater in 1989 and until today I remember the nasty urge to go outside. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent or even the sanctity of cinema - this movie has nothing to offer you. It's usually a pitiful showcase for the author of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. As we see the progression of Belushi's life on screen, Woodward appears in the movie as a ghost figure. The most insulting scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author above him, and he weakly chats: "Breathe for me, Woodward." There are too many terrible things to mention. Least of all is the opening at which Belushi jumps out of the body bag in the morgue and gets into a taxi driven by a man named "Angel". I will leave it at that.
