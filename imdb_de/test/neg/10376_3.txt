Formulaic up to the max. No title reflects the actual content of the series: "Fighting Nazis in Morocco" (actually the Ranch of Iverson). The action is only to fill in the pauses between the fistfights. The package claims in 40 chapters about 40 "fististic encounters". That's at least three chapters! In addition to being seen as a Frenchman with a Spanish accent, Duncan Renaldo is really keen to watch how many pieces of furniture are knocked over, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up. When the protagonists begin to fight, you can bet that everything is in the room as well. A tribute to the battle choreographer, who is the real star of this series! <br /> <br /> Two positive comments: The characters sometimes lose their hats during the fighting, and the best part is that the girl side kick (in fact a journalist, since she's here) actually takes part in the chaos. mainly by shooting and killing the bad guys. Even before Linda Stirling kills the main villain in "The Hunt for Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, there are just too many jumps out of the way - before the plate falls down, before the car drives over the cliff, before the speedboys explode, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you, and so on, and so on. <br /> < It is alleged that this series has partially "inspired" George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones film. However, this is more of an implied concept than the actual story or development of the series. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron shines as a moving rock, a role he played in all his films. Unlike other series that have fewer fights, more stories, better performers and evolved characters, there's nothing to see here unless you see all the furniture smashed. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 for all the furniture battered
