Incredible. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen another "Oldboy" because the one I saw was a poorly written, ill-conceived, exaggerated, dirty piece of "Kraapola" that ignores even the ridiculously violent scenes for a moment the eyes of a child unfit, could hardly satisfy the fantasy and the thirst for a consistent action of a seven-year-old man. The "depth" of this sad brew was exhausted in a small piece of wisdom "Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, cry and you will find yourself alone", the kind of boring fortune cookies, the great author, the Shakespeare or the what Regarding IMDb, Kurosawa would have thrown into the bin without any further thought. Where this movie should have ended up, if we did not live in a time when the cheap shocking and the perverse disgusting is confused with what used to be called "great art". In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It's not 1 in 1000, just for occasional camera work. In no case enough to save this failure of the children from worthlessness.
