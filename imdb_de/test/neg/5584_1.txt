The positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateurish in terms of direction and works in every way. If the IMDb will allow filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films, that is a very sad thing. This movie has a marketable premise, but it is absolutely cruel. <br /> <br /> Film is subjective, so everyone has their own opinion. However, this film is comparable to Ed Wood's work, but without the charm. Thinking differently shows a bad taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not a personal thing. I do not know anybody connected to the movie. I'm just a movie lover who thinks the reviews on this page are totally inaccurate, so I felt compelled to find the balance and give a closer look to the movie. It is very poorly done and the direction is also in film production among the numbers. The drama is the worst thing ever set for the movie. The best thing about this film is the poster and DVD cover. In addition, it is not worth the time.
