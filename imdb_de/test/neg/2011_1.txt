... and that's a damn shame! Please let the sun rise and have all copies of Dracula 3000 burned. This has to be the worst vampire movie of the new millennium so far (I have not seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they are not getting much worse). Do not be fooled, be the cool H. R. Gigeresque cover of the movie. That's so bad, it's almost funny. I can not describe all the emotions this movie has evoked. I laughed my ass off, I screamed at the screen, I sat there and nodded in disbelief ... This film wrote "cheap & cheese". The best part of this film are the opening and opening shots, which contain more or less good CGI of two spaceships. But when Casper Van Dien's voice over sounds, you smell a bit lazy. In fact, it goes downhill quickly thereafter. <br /> <br /> The crew of a rescue ship finds an abandoned ship, the Demeter, who seems to be on the ground. They enter it, sealing their fate. Above all, this movie is a shameless low-budget alien rip-off mixed with vampires. The plot of Erika Eleniak, Aurora, reveals that she is a robot. Coolio exaggerates drug use, the bloodsucking 187 (Pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). The character of Casper Van Dien is Captain Van Helsing (hahaha!) And he looks like ... er, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as captain Varna, the former commander of the Demeter, is shown only on one screen and really seems to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what are you doing in this movie?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Count Orlock, one of the most wretched and ridiculous Draculas ever to have stuck the canvas. Take a look at his outfit. Instead of a cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he wears a cheap fringed Halloween suit from the old school. You thought Richard Roxburgh was not convincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see the performance of Langley! <br /> <br /> The set designers are too much for this game. The interior of the demeter looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old steel factory, which they adorn with glaring lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop master must have forgotten that this movie plays in the year 3000 because the characters use weapons that look like the current .45 Magnums and "Prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around to move. <br /> <br /> Apart from a dried out corpse, there are a few prints and a dismemberment, there is absolutely no blood. And the vampire teeth and contact lenses look damn wrong. Add to this the lame, stupidest and most abrupt end of all time: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one last (bloody) showdown with Count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control room. Then, Aurora explains that before upgrading her program and joining anesthetics, she was a "Protheus 3.2 PB," in other words, a pleasure bot. So she says, "What are you waiting for?" Humvee replies "I do not have to tell myself twice, come on, girl," she picks up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and credits. No sex scene, no Erika flashing her boobies, no bloody climax, ... Another shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over Must be seen for every bad movie lover, but I have to warn her: It sometimes gets very painful. Anyone who claims that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium is clearly crazy or has not seen Dracula 3000 yet.
