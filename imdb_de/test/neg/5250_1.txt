Haha! Only if you've never seen a "dimension movie" to have a real treat! Beowulf was primarily known for SUPER LOW BUDGET horror / slasher films and was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more in the style of ultra-cheesy. I missed the K-R-A-F-T label on the site. <br /> <br /> Consider the anachronisms! (a little out of place and time) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords .... <br /> <br /> But we saw: telescopes, soled shoes, lighters, cigarette lighter, speakers , Electricity, body bags, tin foil cans and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something happening in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, but a horrible movie. It is very ridiculous. It really is a comedy that looks like a horror movie! I could not stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - He really has a fall in his career working for Dimension Films. <br /> <br /> But I learned my lesson. I'll watch the movie studios in the videos, MUCH closer. <br /> <br /> DOES NOT VALUE REELS OF FIVE. If you want a good laugh, it's hard to overlook this work! <br /> <br /> This train had some spots - I especially liked the blonde Bimbette! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
