then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film jumped back many years before French Spain. The film gives little information about what happened, and I do not remember much about it. The movie then becomes confusing. The movie begins when Ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of judicism by the church, especially Father Lorenzo. She is asked the question and has to confess. Even the wealth of her family can not get her out of jail. Her father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the descendant of a chimpanzee, hoping to release Ines. All it does is give the church a reason to condemn Lorenzo fleeing to France. <br /> <br /> Then the film skips many years, and the French Revolution is in force. Ines is released from prison. It was very good make-up work to make Natalie Portman look like she was torn to pieces. She finds her family dead and seeks Goya for help. She tells him that she had a child in prison. Goya meets with her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He is the father Goya sees the daughter and tells Lorenzo that he decides that he best sends her to America so that no one will know. But before his plans are realized, the British join the Spaniards, and Spain regains power, and he is now the persecuted. This part is not well told in the movie. It's like the movie shows that this happens in one day. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: The movie is good until it skips many years after the Inquistion. Then the movie expects you to understand what's going on. It then became too confusing for me.
