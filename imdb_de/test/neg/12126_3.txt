The plot of "Open Graves" is very simple: It's a board game called Mamba, where players die in real life the same way they die in the game and intentionally annoying and there's not even that a little tension. I liked Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but she is totally wasted and immeasurable The only reason to see "Open Graves" are some interesting camera angles and the sexy Eliza Dushku. If such films are the future of horror, then I seriously give a shit. A generous 3 out of 10.
