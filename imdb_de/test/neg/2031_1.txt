Somewhere in the US, young Clair manipulates her friends Mic, Billy, and John and shows a letter that Bob would send to them, and the group beats them cowardly, and Bob and Mic kill him with a piece of wood in the woods. Mic is sad and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. I think "The Wind" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The terrible screenplay is ridiculous, and it's almost impossible to write a summary because there's no story or action, just sequences of non-contiguous scenes. The amateurish directing and acting are amazingly bad and terrible. It's unbelievable how producers invest money in such garbage, distributors publish this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was curious how bad this movie can be, and I was impressed because it is worse than I could imagine my lowest expectations. In the end, I wonder why IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system, because garbage really deserves this vote. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
