Yesterday, this movie happened on HBO, so I watched it. That was a mistake. I think I was sucked in and kept on watching, even though it was very similar to a train crash, terrible, terrible, but somehow you just can not look away. shaudenfraud I appreciate! ; <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for models on an island in the Caribbean. One by one, they are all murdered. You drink cleaning fluid, you get blown up on a waverunner, you go over a cliff ... so these are NOT accidents, but for some reason the police are never called and no one thinks they should "wrap" the hang and home not only out of respect for the dead, but perhaps out of fear for their own lives. They just keep on shooting, because THAT is the most important thing. Forget the dead models, we have a magazine that we have to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the subplots is the evil owner, played by Lee Majors, Rex. He is the most obvious suspect and every time a model is killed, he whirls his mustache and says, "Well, I can not say that this will not be good for the sale," mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha " So absurd Another subplot is when it turns out that Rex is one of Baby Dady's models, only when he learned about the baby did he try to persuade the girl to break her in. She did not, but it always annoyed her because she suggested this. <br /> <br /> They try to give false hints and point to a guy named Raule, apparently because he's the only one who has an accent and looks "scary." <br / > <br /> At the very end (sorry to pamper, but this movie turned up years ago, so if you have not seen it yet ...) One of the women was found dead in the pool, that was the last straw !!!! Vanessa Angel, forget her figures The name comes from Rex with a gun, they fight, the gun shoots and now she is dead too! While lying on the floor, his business partner tells him that the magazine will be worthy of all this bad press SS and it's all his fault. He gets him to hand over the magazine to him. Once he does voila! All the dead models come alive again, and you find that the whole thing was a clever trick to be back at Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone else has said; If you want to see something like this April Fools Day, that's much better!
