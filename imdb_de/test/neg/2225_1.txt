What bothers me about so-called "science" programs is that it is portrayed as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live millions of years ago. First, no one can conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the Earth is millions / billions of years old. It's a flat theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods, with big assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot. Second, no one can prove that evolution ever happened. All missing links from Darwin are still missing! If you look at all the fossils on earth or on earth, they are whole animals of a certain kind, eg. A dog or a cat. No one has ever found the skeleton of a dog that turns into a cat, or the example presented in this series, a dinosaur that turns into a bird. <br /> <br /> This is an absolute hogwash. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal that transforms into another species. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything originated in it. <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious world view that is hidden under the banner of science. Science is something that we can observe and repeat. What you see here is SCIENCE FICTION. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a sci-fi program that has the decency to admit that it's a science-fiction program, then look at Star Trek or Star Wars.
