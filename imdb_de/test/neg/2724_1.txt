I'm the only one who has noticed that the "realism" of the ship from the 19th century is wrong. Actually, it is a 15th century, around 1620, when the memory serves me, because the "realistic" ship in the film is the Mayflower. As far as I know, the Mayflower NEVER went to Australia or even tried to travel to Australia. I do not know who worked with R & D for this film, but using the Mayflower and hoping that nobody will notice is indeed a bad job. I wonder how other people have noticed this little mistake. Not to mention that the movie was horrible in itself, I would have expected better from Sam Neill.
