We all have to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that someone like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before he made good films. In fact, the movie was dated even before it hit the cinemas on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war against Europe was over for almost two months, of course, not even Harry Cohn could control the events of London's history. I wonder why the public at that time did not question why an NS spy ring helped the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater. The cape and the dagger were the territory of the OSS in this part of the world. <br /> <br /> If you're an FBI man like William Wright, having a mental friend like Nina Foch is fine. He is about to embark on a mission to the Orient to name the key underground leaders to launch a general uprising against the Japanese occupation in China. Germans who plagued Otto Kruger's house find out about it and the whole movie is spent with those guys who have already lost the war trying to help their allies. By the way, they call them "Japs". When Foch is kicked out of a raging car and knocked unconscious, she dreams of Wright's danger and sees on the Golden Gate Bridge what will happen to him. She goes there and thwarts the plot. <br /> <br /> Everything you would expect from a beautiful noir film is here, the foggy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit sets, Budd Boetticher tried his best, as did the cast. But they just were not convincing, probably because they could not believe this gossip itself. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but it is unlikely that Nina Foch's dream and psychic consequences may have been further developed, and the developments were left on the cutting edge. I think it was just a lousy script. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures had the fast paced events of history here against them.
