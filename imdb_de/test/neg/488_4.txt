This short film was the last and only Shemp short by director Del Lord. The problem: It was pretty weak and the caf√© scene was pretty much a copy of a short Curly Busy Buddies (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny and the opening part of the cafe section. However, there are many plotholes in this short version. Why, for example, do the henchmen hide in the bin when the police arrive? In the remake "Of Cash And Hash" (1955) director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the junk hiding in the garbage bin is that a gunfight takes place between the police and the armored car robbers. The scene where Moe has problems with the oyster was previously made with Curly in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The spooky part of the house was not great, except for the fun scene outside the spooky house. To top it off, the end had no stitch. Rating: C-
