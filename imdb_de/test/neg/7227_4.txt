If Daphne Du Maurier had set REBECCA in San Francisco in the 1950s, it could very well resemble this upright, highly unusual noir by Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and embraces the life of Richard Basehart (who happens to be the guardian of the Dead Woman's Son) ... it's absurd and exaggerated, but also entertaining highest level. Cortese is awesome and slowly falls apart as she recognizes the mistake she has made. Basehart is fine, albeit a bit bland ... although the lighting in the end makes him seem very threatening. Fay Baker is a very good woman Danvers-style caretaker. Wise is a good director and he keeps things in a pretty neat clip. With Cortese (or at least a stunt Cortese) at the wheel, he puts a now classic classic under control.
