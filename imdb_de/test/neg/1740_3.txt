In this feeble attempt to bring your typically barren Japanese horror movie more in the direction of a scary cult hit, the device did not have the ammunition needed to engage the viewer throughout. Translated into Vortex, Uzumaki is just that - an irrational and overflowing tribute to the strange downward spiral of nothingness that has seemingly fascinated a whole small town to dementia-obsessed madmen. While this will surely lead to a pleasing B-movie on the surface, the traditionally tiring drama, directing and scripting will all but have Asian horror fans shake their heads in dismay. What might have been translated into a Japanese equivalent of an early David Lynch piece is more of a spiraling game before it even has a chance to self-explain - which of course is not the case. Apart from a few clever techniques, the film rarely combines the dizzying topics with the boring writing that eventually appears as cheap exploitation in the cult genre, replacing the real substance with hollow images. When the movie was over, there was hardly anything gained through any of the interactions, except for a few scenes or images that towered over the one-note movie. I salute the creators that they have at least tried to steer the genre into more supernatural, metaphysical realms and understand the gross losses in the translation, but with zero substance supporting any of it will likely tempt Fanboy's bong -red cellar
