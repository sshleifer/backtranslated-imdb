I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see that it was cheap. Badly written and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also heard a version in the audiobook. We could not take the movie seriously because it should have contained the missing elements. The experience of seeing this was as if the Blair witch were visiting Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy with a bedpan and actually show its contents. The witch throws the contents at the boy and the whole family laughs. I found it uncomfortable and very strange. I really can not understand why anyone would think that would be entertaining. It shows another scene in which Dr. Mize arrives and urinates Betsy Bell in her dress on the steps of her house in front of her mother and her brothers. Instead of the mother who leads her away, it's the brother. How sick? The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes of how your body disposes of the waste, asks for toilet paper and goes in and makes those disgusting faces happy with sound effects. I think they should have left it all out. The make-up of Reverend James Johnston as an older man did not really make you think he was older. It was thought that he had been dipped in fish dough. The blood of Joshua Gardner when he falls off the ladder is even worse. John Bell's death scene looks like they've got flour out and tried to do something to make him look like a seriously ill man. Too much morbid comedy with bad problems and inexperienced participants was the sinking of this picture. These people would do better if they were advertising local TV broadcasters for bathroom products. They chose a good topic and could not produce it correctly. I rate this movie Capital F minus.
