Seymour Cassel offers a great performance, a tour de force. His supposedly flushed beach stud Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film revolves around a nerd who has just come to the beach to honor the dreams of his dead brother. What he gets is lame Surf Hijinks. Men who have cheated, boys who fight, and boys who get drunk when they see surfing documentaries on a Friday night with the whole city of LA. Duke takes in the nerd and tries to teach him how to play volleyball, as if to touch a woman. The next time my wife speaks back, I'll pretend to point the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the movie is going to be a good drama because the first half of the movie really did not make sense. Duke plays a wonderful volleyball game, the best he has played for over ten years. The way the scene is shot is beautiful. You can feel the heart of this man for the game and the love to be on the beach. These five minutes will be among my favorites of all time. 3/10 Bad to fair, the rest of the movie was lame.
