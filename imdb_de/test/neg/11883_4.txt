This is the voice of a person who had just finished the second season of Rome with almost a pull and took the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this movie begins at the end of Rome. If you find Rome an abomination, a disgusting screwdriver of little historical accuracy, you could enjoy Empire: Augustus. However, if you feel that Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the intricate intrigue, the ambience of decadence and the work of the actors, empire will obviously appear to you as an overly shy, superfluous and boring soap opera that does not have many redemption possibilities offers factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who look a bit better for my taste than those in Rome. I especially did not like Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drug addict to sex addicts. There must have been a lot of strength and dignity in this woman, and the actress in the Empire fits much better. O'Toole and Rampling are good and some others too. But then ... If you know and love Atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find her portrayal of her in the Empire - as a tearful goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. It is believed that there are some bitchy characters in the Empire, but these actresses rely heavily on staring at the men, not much more. In this epic you will not find any interesting female characters. There is also the painfully funny Maecenas, whom we see as screeching drag queens, though there is little historical evidence that he was so (he will once be referred to in the annals as "effeminate in his pleasures"). The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés on clichés. Cleopatra's great hall looks like a computer game or a children's playroom in an Egyptian theme park. There are a lot of really bad 3D graphics that do not meet the 2003 standards. <br /> <br /> The action is presented as a series of flashbacks revived by old Augustus. So we get a brief overview of some historical events, some well presented, others not. It is wasted a disproportionate amount of time to show Livia as the "eternal flame" of Augustus. This affair does not burn for a moment, the dialogue is awesome and everything is spiced up with a rousing musical score. Whatever the reality that is supposed to capture the show, every last remnant of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most actors are not English speaking). <br /> <br /> Everything is lukewarm in this epic. Although there are more historical accuracies than in Rome, but dramatically it is simply boring. The characters lack depth and dialog sharpness. The camera work is often limited to static shooting, and the lighting does not offer anything that pleases your eye. <br /> <br /> There's really no one to love and no one to hate in the Empire. Whether you like Rome or not, there are much better movies and mini-series. Ancient Rome: I would recommend the rise and fall of an empire.
