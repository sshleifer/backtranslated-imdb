I regularly read Kathy Reich's Temperance Brennan novels. So I'm very surprised that she even asked about this show. <br /> <br /> It's horrible compared to the books. The character of Temperance Brennan is a down to earth alcoholic in the books and a divorced mother of a college aged daughter. In 'Bones' she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), which in typical PC style is not a mother. The emphasis on her assistant staff, with wild details about who experienced how many sexual exploits, is in contrast to the books. <br /> <br /> In complete consideration of the PC movement, she portrays the enemies of the USA as a peace lover (!). Some of the information is not even correct, for example, that they come from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan Arab ?! I'm sure if negative references were made to "disadvantaged minorities" or to women or to GLBTs, the producers / writers / directors of the show would have to apologize. In a typical far left-wing fashion, all racist attacks go to the highest-performing minority group - Asians, as Agent Booth of David Boreanaz repeatedly talks of Angela Montenegro as "squinting." Forget the stuff and forget this show. After the episode "The Man in the SUV," I thought I'd try a second episode to see if it got any better. It only got worse! I do not even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide, and I'll never see the show again.
