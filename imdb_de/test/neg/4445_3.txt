In an up and down career with all sorts of films, Altman tries to try science fiction, and it clearly shows that it's not his strength. <br /> <br /> The film is practically incomprehensible. It seems to be a catastrophic combination of experimental theatrics and a large studio trying to jump on the Star Wars post-War move (not that this movie was ever modeled after that model), but you can imagine the studio is on something another hoped Paul Newman science fiction film). The story is non-existent, the characters are alien to us all the way. <br /> <br /> Altman has been feeding dogs with corpses throughout the movie, which obviously make some sort of point. But since the movie is so poorly thought-out, beginning with the lack of conspiracy, it's really not about anything. <br /> <br /> The production is confused, the photography is picked up by the blurs on the edges and the score is awful. However, "Quintet" has a redemption feature. The film is not only clearly turned in snow and ice, but also the interiors are kept cold. You see the breath of the actors in every scene. You really feel the cold.
