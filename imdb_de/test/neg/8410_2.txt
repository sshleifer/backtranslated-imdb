With its few surrealistic accents, LWHTRB looks like a terrible horror, but as a major implication to the original it flutters miserably. <br /> <br /> Things start promising during the opening speech of the Telefilm. We see and hear some interesting attitudes and sounds: the baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife that Rosemary carried to the Castevette apartment and was shaken (the crockery protruding from the parquet floor); and the emptiness of Bramford himself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs are heard here from the dialogue of the previous film). Also interesting is the easter egg hunt, in which the title child participates (the eggs and baskets are also black). Once the story starts, it never really "rolls" ... And what happens to Rosemary when she gets on this driverless bus and gets taken to God knows where? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a bad substitute for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (as Southwestern Whore, raising the kid "Adrian / Andrew" with Ruth Gordon in the lead) Repetition of their "Minnie Roll. <br /> <br /> Although this was not an absolute failure, this series should have appeared in book form at first, then maybe we could all have been a bit better informed ... and not left in the dark. A Legacy Successor "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate successor to Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
