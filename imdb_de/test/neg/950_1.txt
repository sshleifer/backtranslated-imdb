I saw this movie some time ago and was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was seeing the trailer, which I expected to have a very stylish marshal-style movie with lots of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about. I was very disappointed because it looks like once you've seen the trailer, there's nothing left to see (if you expect, as described above). My then girlfriend gave up halfway and while I kept looking at something interesting, nothing happened. I found no attachment or real interest in one of the characters. I would say that you should not bother, unless you have a few hours of your life that you do not really want to lose.
