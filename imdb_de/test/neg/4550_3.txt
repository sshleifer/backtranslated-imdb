If you like Soap Series, you like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch soap series like GTST, Westenwind or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you do not like it: Stay away from this movie. It has the same visual style, the same quality of acting, directing and writing. The film was a great success in the home country, but was not sold outside Holland and Belgium. Pretty strange for a commercial movie like this. <br /> <br /> Maybe it says something ....
