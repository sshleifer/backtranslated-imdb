return; What a huge disappointment !! After reading the summary of the story (the dead are coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush !!!!!), I could not wait to see this. It started interesting and immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I did not have to see (I can just watch a good old Australian comedy!). There was pretty much one or two horror scenes and they were not even so scary. I could not believe that this came from Joe Dante, who could have done it with a balance of thrill and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
