I saw this movie last night, and I have to say, it's the worst thing I've ever seen. The entire movie is a train accident and not the actors. It's the terrible script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** Okay, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. His nerdy son is disappointed. The bathroom is going crazy. He gets free vacation. He goes with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their boats crash. They stay on an island. They are stupid and do not even look at the nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, that's it. What makes this film pathetic is the humor. It's so awful, helpless and stupid, you can not even laugh. And it's not a silly funny humor either. I could not laugh the whole thing.
