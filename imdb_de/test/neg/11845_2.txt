The biggest and most disturbing things in the Raptor movie, which ended for the Tyransaurus, were identical to Carnosaur, except that the kid in the Loader was played a bit better and had action than the adult. The similarities to the Carnosaur films were rather bad in the plot. The only good thing was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. Then it went downhill from there. Would have been nice if another plot had been developed instead of cloning the earlier films. The Raptor film was supposed to have received lessons from Jurasic Park series in various plots. The only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie is Aztec Rex. The repeated scenes, as taken from the Carnosaur films, make a person think of these films.
