Well, I read the other comments. Did not think it sounded good, but decided to record it anyway. Maybe not so smart to read all the bad reviews before watching the movie, because of course I would notice all the strange things. Excessive use of crossfading to black, a few strange camera angles and crosscutting dialogue for different conversations with the same people at different times! But I noticed everything I had thought: Well, that would probably be boring if everything went chronologically. The talks are not so exciting, but somehow compelling. And the constant fading of really short scenes gives the impression that the story is becoming an interesting part. Skip the boring bits. At the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting as well. Do you survive? <br /> <br /> So I actually liked this movie? No not true. The director had some interesting ideas to prevent the audience getting bored while trying to introduce the characters. But he exaggerates it. It gets annoying and sometimes confusing. This was apparently just the second movie he directed, so in the future he may be learning really good material. And if you (in the future) sit there wondering if the director's second famous film is worth a look? If he's good in the future, look at that crap and ask yourself how he ever made a third. Otherwise, this movie is not really worth seeing, unless you are very interested in filming and would like to see a way to see the obligatory boring introductory scenes in something to see.
