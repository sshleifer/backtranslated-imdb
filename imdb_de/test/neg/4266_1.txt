The worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie is garbage. Everything is bad in this movie. The direction, the script, the arts, the cinematography, the performers or something else. <br /> <br /> May I say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is a boy. It must be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years, besides, he is a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> The cut tries to save her, but with very bad material in her hands, she can not work miracles. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is bad, the lyrics are bad, it does not help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned not to "make" a movie.
