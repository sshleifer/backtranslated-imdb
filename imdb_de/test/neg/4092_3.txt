The biggest problem with this movie is that it has nothing to do with Bruce Allmighty. The first movie, according to the imagination of every daydreamer, was to be able to control his surroundings the way you think fit. But Evan's experience is completely different. He does not have the control Jim Carrey whirls around, and instead, the story revolves around the power of faith. Well, that would have been alright since the first movie preached the same message. The problem is that the sequel preaches at the expense of comic relief. And to insult injuries, it also throws politics into action. You have the distinct feeling that this film has a clear message, and the main objective is not to make you laugh. To sum up, this movie is a mix of Eddie Murphy's The Distinguished Gentleman and Charlton Heston's The Ten Commandments. I'm not sure if Steve Carrell makes a mistake here. One has the feeling that his character limits his abilities as a comedian. Former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny, he is basically an adversary who has become a protagonist, which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movie message is about.
