Think of "Charmed" with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this image. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to leave the door open for Part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend his money wiser. I would suggest a 'Charmed - The Movie' because it kicked his ass compared to 'Charmed' and I only saw this show to please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and see it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. Or better still download, so you do not waste your money. The first 15 minutes were fine. But the funniest line in the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says, "Kiss my ass Harry Potter," as he drives off a cliff. Although they are not worth kissing Potter's ass because Potter is a lot cooler and at least his films have a story. The Goblet of Fire was even scarier than this !!!
