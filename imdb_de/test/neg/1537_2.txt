Well, the writing was very sloppy, the direction was unsightly and the editing made it worse (at least I hope it was the editing). The acting was not bad, but not so good either. Pretty much none of the characters were sympathetic. At least 45 minutes of this movie was a waste of time, and the other hour was not used near its full potential. It was a great idea, but another good idea wasted. It could have ended 3 different places, but it just went on to a most predictable Hollywood ending. and what was unpredictable was made so bad that it did not matter. the end was not worth seeing at all. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these movies. the movie looked rushed too. The movie just was not really worth seeing, and if I had paid for it, I would have been very angry. Maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a really good movie and got a bad one. The movie about everything was not terribly bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave him 2 out of 10 B / C. I liked the idea so much and I liked a character (Justin, I think the super-smart). and there were also some very cheap ways to cover up plotting holes. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not nice. If you see it, wait for the $ 1.50 movie or video, unless you like every movie you see, and you'll like this movie.
