What? - That's it? The city Sheriff (John Agar) blows up the mutated gorilla with a dynamite stick hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? Did I just see that? <br /> <br /> With the instrumentals of The Wildcats, "Night Fright" is a movie that was only earned in 1967. The heyday of the gorilla was over and everyone but Ray Corrigan was a monkey suit just asking for trouble. Record this in black and white and set the story back about thirty years. You would have at least a rating of 4.0 for the IMDb. But unfortunately, he would never have had a chance to see the light of day. Oops, there's another peculiarity - you can never tell if it's day or night in the story because they seem interchangeable. <br /> <br /> I'll give you that, some of the early malt shops scenes looked like they could have aired as Coke commercials. Now when I think about it, these were probably the best-looking and best-lit scenes in the picture; Coca Cola must have paid for her. If they had seen the finished movie, it might have been better to stop the release.
