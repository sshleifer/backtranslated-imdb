SKELETON MAN was fine in the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called "Special Force Agents" came on the screen, it went downhill faster than a fat child on a sled. <br /> <br /> The opening makes us think we could have a crazy but funny horror strip on our hands, but no ... the filmmakers ruin any hope when the "Special Force Agents" show up. I wish the writer chose a different path and had to chase down the "skeleton man" of teenagers until one of them finally got the upper hand. Instead, the "Skeleton Man" chases down some embarrassing "Special Force Agents" and sets them down until the captain finally gets the upper hand. "That was the way it used to be, but it would be better for a movie like this. <br /> <br When the "Skeleton Man" finally encounters his so-called "death" in a building that explodes, the "Special Force Agent" captain is asked by a police officer outside the building, "What the hell happened there?" My answer to this question: "Who cares?"
