Okay, I think I'm a fan of spindly, mutilated and destroyed Stephen King stories (when they reach the screen), as one of us sad masochists out here. I know very well that most of them are done badly. I expect it. I plan it. I humbly allow it ... <br /> <br /> But THIS time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I've seen this thing a few years ago ... all right. I thought, I remembered that it was pretty good ... WRONG ... as I say (in a wordy, annoying, cumbersome way :) I really did not try to be snobby or expect much, but what was that? what, a mini-series? I have only ONE thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can I You MAY justify pulling the thing out, minute by minute, scene after scene of endless, utterly unconscious and totally slow dialogue? I mean, EVERY bl ** dy scene is made up of two people who 'discuss', how they move back and forth, and D ... R ... A ... GI ... T bl ** dy good O ... U ... D After about one and a half hours, which I think is about half the term (I did not look, I'm sorry :) I was FINALLY fed! After one and a half hours something else happened than the original accident ...? They ran away while the 'shop' type killed eye doctors, news photographers, and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of meandering dialogue. I'm sorry, I promise that this is not what I have thoughtless action without interruption; I love MANY movies in which not much happens, but at least in them, when they talk and such IMPORTANT things are said and characters are deepened, thoughts are conveyed ... SOMEWHAT !!! ??? Okay, I admit the actors were not so bad in and of themselves (except Stephen King of course :) I liked the shop guy, I thought the two "older" guys were fine. I liked the general and the main wife. It would only be so if they could cut out all the filler's hours, that's all I say. I mean, it's SUPPORTED to be a sci-fi thriller, kind of ... right? They know exactly what the price really cost, as the shop-man has done unnecessarily many of his phone calls. This time around he's talking to God who's going to get emotional (for him anyway) and behave as if he can not handle it. .. WTF !!! ??? The guy has clearly proven to be a cold-blooded, efficient killer. What the hell was that? So, just multiply that by about 500 and that's basically why I switched off halfway through. Either that was it or hang me up, I swear it! I mean, there are other "adjustments" of the king out there that are lame, but at least they are moving ...! Well, I think if you may be immersed in "history" yourself and do not mind crawling around and have the SUPREME & DIVINE patience to wait until the end, it may be worth it. <br /> <br /> But I doubt it seriously and humbly ... <br /> <br /> I do not write these things very often, but THIS time I just MUST or could not sleep at night (like me it did.) DURING the show! :)
