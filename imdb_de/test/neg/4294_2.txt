"The Yoke's on Me" is undoubtedly the most controversial movie in the 23 years of Stooges. The reason is understandable. By today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely, if ever, shown on television. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that the Japanese seen in the movie were not soldiers; They were Japanese and Americans who were sent to a relocation center during World War II. They were treated and portrayed as the evil enemy in this movie. According to reports, including the US government, which apologized and compensated in the 1980s, the Japanese were as loyal and diligent as any American during World War II. Her imprisonment during this time is a dark spot in American history. <br /> <br /> There are some stooge laughs in this movie, but the memories of how Japanese-American Americans were treated during that time make up for the entertainment value. We must not confuse the loyal Japanese with their portrayal as a transgressor in this film. Loyal Japanese-Americans and the evil world of Japan from the Second World War are not a synonym. 2 out of 10.
