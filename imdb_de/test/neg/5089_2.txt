Wow, I just saw one who saw this. <br /> <br /> How CRAPPY is the post production in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not happy, I could literally have done a better job. <br /> <br /> ALL post production is faulty, everything. Who has cut this film, should be excluded from the film industry. <br /> <br /> Besides, the script was a train accident. absolute Rubish. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in the Spongebob accent. WTF does his character there? But for me, the biggest mistake of all was character development, interaction, dynamics and dialogue. IMPRESSIVE. I can not believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 2 out of 10 points. 1 for Samantha, who is a great actress, too bad that the production has turned everyone into amateurs. <Br /> <br /> The other 1 is about cinematography, which was good indeed. <br /> <br /> Other than this friend, this is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know You even feel like writing a detailed post, it was just a terrible production. Poor actors, they did not know what they were getting into ...
