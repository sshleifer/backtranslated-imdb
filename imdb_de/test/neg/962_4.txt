Rudolph Mat√©'s film from 1950 receives a redesign for the 80s. Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but that has now gone down the tube with his marriage. The initial exposure suggests the idea in the eyes of the beholder that everyone has something against him. When the revelation comes that he was poisoned, we are not so surprised, unless you know the original of course. After saying that he has less than 48 hours to live, Dexter decides to trace his steps with the help of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they find that many obstacles stand in their way. <br /> <br The film starts promisingly in black and white as Dexter staggers in the rain to the local police station, where he wants to report a murder ... his own, but the Huey Lewis style of the 80s, which accompanies this scene , just serves to get rid of any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this will be pretty bad, it's just a question of how bad? Of course, we will soon be using the old Flashback medium, but now the movie goes back to full Technicolor. There are a few short tributes to Noir, as the hugging couple is in front of a blind, but there is nothing to recommend here, the performances are terrible. Ryan in particular makes her usual dizzy blonde with a Cutesy Pie Smile program. The film is a lazy attempt to put an already unknown film in an already good film premise. Obviously, he tries to redeem an audience of Body Heat. The apparent results are undoubtedly addressed to a young audience. 4.10
