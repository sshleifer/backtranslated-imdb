this movie made me look at Paul W. S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy it! I will not even dream of comparing Requiem to the films of the Alien or Predator series. This is a HORRIBLE TEENAGE B-HORROR FOOTAGE SET IN A US SMALL TOWN WITHOUT CARE At least a lot of handmade art was carved into the film sets, there were bags of eye candy that were not featured in any of the original films - but by not convincing characters / plays was ruined. Requiem is bad at acting at the lowest imaginable level, and it's missing in every other department as well ... It's a blessing to include alien and predator suits in this kind of trash.
