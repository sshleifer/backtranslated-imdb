I left the theater and was only 10 years old. It sucked so bad. The conspiracy was terrible and the spectacle was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed and the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I visited this catastrophe with a friend and even at this young, innocent age, I did not even laugh at the movie. We (me and my friend) are still laughing about how bad the movie was. At the end, we went to the "R" movie where my parents were. Bottom line - this strip was just bad. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-Who? This movie could have scared me a lifetime if I had watched the popular animated cartoon on television as a kid, but luckily I had never seen it before. So I was freed from the pain, but I will never win back the precious minutes of my life that I wasted.
