Yes. A Norwegian needs two great books and a concept that works well with the movie - this movie is truly the worst Swedish movie of all time. I hated it so much that I even thought about going beyond it, something I've never done before. But it was so terrible that I was almost captivating. I just had to sit until the end. Similar to some Stallone action roles of the early 80s, this REALLY takes Swedish action back to the Stone Age. So full of logical mistakes and stupid mistakes that it's almost amusing - but who could ever see any good in the horrible acting when Mark Hamill survives a minefield or the stupid ass, useless and irrational action? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: did not we go through, when the clocks are down to zero, the hero flees in a flash and two friends become enemies, who eventually reunite? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And one more thing: the product placement in this movie is incredible. While other countries have understood that this should not be so OBWIOUS, the Swedish film industry does not seem to have understood at all: Just look at the credit card Hamilton uses to open a window. Or or or ... this movie really drives me crazy.
