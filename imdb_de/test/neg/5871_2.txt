This is one of the movies you will find if you stay up late and just have a simple cable. It's hard to believe this movie '95 was made, considering it's from the late '80s. Brave teenagers with varied home problems face a crazy ice cream man looking for the best taste: Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely crazy and just scary, how scary and absolutely ridiculously gross it is. Actually, the really scary thing about this movie is the kind of problems these kids face at home. The fact that these children have no chance of escaping from their quiet suburbs makes any random madman in the neighborhood appear like a walk through the park. <br /> <br /> The most laughable part of this movie is the fact that this is stereotypical "Fat Kid" is so obviously a slender teenager with a mountain padding under his wide sweatshirts. I guess either a) they had not invented / could not afford a big suit b) the casting director was too lazy to find a dumpy kid star or c) we should honestly believe that this kid starved and has a tremendous amount extended belly. <br /> <br /> If you get up at 2 in the morning and need something ridiculous and disgusting to break with your intoxicated friends, take a look. I would rather sleep.
