This is possibly the worst of the worst. I'm a big fan of the horror movie industry and I can believe this movie was made. The acting was youthful and the story completely idiotic. The camera work was also teen. A scene that comes to my mind is outside a store. It is night, and you can see the moon, but all characters have shadows that throw themselves on the wall. There was no street lamp to see. A character is gutted at one point, but may reappear later after leaving a post. Come on!!! It felt like I saw a middle school game. I've always expected the characters to wave "hi mom" to their camera and mouth mate. I can only give it two positive comments ... it ended and it was good for a laugh. Please do not borrow this movie !!!!
