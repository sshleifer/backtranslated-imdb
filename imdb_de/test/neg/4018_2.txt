If you're used to Lana Turner on the Postman Always Rings Twice, compare it to this low budget, low talent and low quality movie. Well, it just embarrassed me that Ida Lupino 's singing' piano playing scenes. When the first scene began without singing and everyone was staring at them flatly, I was sure they would all roll their eyes and start walking or at least talk to each other (she stinks, come on, let's get out of here). The actors are flat - the emotions are exhausted. And Ida is a thoroughly spoiled bi-otk - just a 100% diversion. It was as if Betty Boop met with conscious sedation on a tank warden in nowhere in the United States. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, her breast was ... no matter. I was sad for the rest of the actors. If the right actress had starred and the male actors had more emotions, the movie might have had a chance. Excuse me for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world. I would not have minded if it had not stayed out of this world.
