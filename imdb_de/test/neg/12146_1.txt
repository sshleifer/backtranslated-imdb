That's a joke, is not it? This can not be a real movie? It is not even a real video? Give each Harvey Milk High School kid a video camera and they could make a better movie than this one. The filmmaker can not be serious ... right? Is this a satire? Comedy? Drama has gone terribly wrong? The script is as determined and boring as you can imagine. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could lead to a better script. Dialogue is not a cliché. Cliché dialogues could turn this holiday chaos into a camp fun - but it is not, and it is not. The Worst of the Worst: A landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment wearing a bathrobe carrying a frying pan, like something out of a "honeymoon" episode. Whaaa ??? I have seen better acting in acting clubs in middle school. One of the leads is an attractive Lunk, the other not. Both can not even create a convincing kiss. So much for romance. The supporting players are overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a disgusting soundtrack, and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet. Most of the dialogue is (mercifully) incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This outdated cinematic fruit cake is not even worth being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay holiday of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. In every way. VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS do not dance in your head - they will crush every expectation. Take an eggnog and stare mindlessly at the neighbor's Christmas lights - it will make better use of your time.
