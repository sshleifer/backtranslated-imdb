Oh man! This series must be the worst anime I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It started new, exciting and fresh. And I liked it very much back then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and ingenious. <br /> <br /> Then over the course of the series, it fell more and more down ... and I explain all the reasons. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) <br /> <br /> Okay, they destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early by reviving his 50-year-old dead girlfriend, who is dripping and wasting time. <br /> <br /> They introduce a pervert named Miroku, who is supposed to be a kind of religious figure for the show. (That really annoyed me because it was out of place and stupid.) Then they introduce a demon sinner named Sango whose sole purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwash brother The villain of the series, Naraku, who started as a really good villain, lost his touch after a while. (He was getting old pretty fast, and it bothered me that he was the only villain in the series to do anything.) The characters all became woody and without emotion. And the end of this terrible series was a disappointment for any anime fanatic. Nothing has happened. Naraku was never killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never completely fell in love (because he was still in love with his 50 year old, dead chick). Plot holes remained open. The animation got worse as the series progressed. And at the act nothing has changed. (I mean, they drew it on over 150 episodes, and the plot has not changed ...). And they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied. I was disappointed, disgusted and annoyed like crap. At least I had great hope that the series will end well. All I got was a pulled out commercial for the manga. Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about swords and the like, I recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". The show is progressing and going somewhere, and it also has really good animations. <br /> <br /> But stay away from that bland apology for anime, as good as you can.
