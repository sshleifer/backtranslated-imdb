This film was different from most Jimmy Cangey's movies of the 1930s in that it was NOT filmed by Warner Brothers / First National, but loaned to a smaller studio. Because it was a poverty alleviation studio, production values ​​are lower than you would expect from Cagney movies. Besides, the plot is certainly one of the strangest I've ever seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good guy in this case - fighting for the law. That's not too unusual, since Cagney often played lawyers - such as an FBI agent's OSS leader (the CIA's forefather). BUT, to make him an investigator for the Bureau of Weights and Measures was indeed strange - especially because he sometimes behaved in the same way as in the film G-MEN! <br /> <br /> All in all a time traveler and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the videotape I saw on Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever seen. The sound was horrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had many torn films and gaps.
