Flashdance is one of those horrible, stupid movies you actually like just because they're so crap. I just saw it on TV, and my friend and I were surprised at how stupid it was. It's true that Don Simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of ​​developing a rather cheap, cheap movie with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell (admittedly catchy) pop. So Flashdance is a peculiar pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne has started in advertising and that shows because Flashdance is almost a commercial in itself. You've already decided to watch it, but the movie has this strange, panicky undercurrent, as if it's afraid that you could change your mind anytime. It sells to you over and over again, with professional editing on average and brilliant close-ups of wobbly breasts. The story is gossamer (I honestly can not imagine another movie I've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but it's a very fictional, calculating movie, so it feels consistent. People say it's outdated, but Flashdance has always been garbage. Viewers in the early '80s knew it was just cheesy T & A, but it works in a stupid way. There's a flabby romance for the kick-flick crowd and stacks of oily, writhing women bodies for their dates, all set for a pulsating disco beat. How could it fail? It helps that the dialogue is meaningless, so you can grab a popcorn without missing out on something important. If this is not your thing, you can always laugh about the interpretive dance. The scene in which a stand-in for Jennifer Beals on stage in front of a TV with a fan and a face full of white clown make-ups leads to convulsions / "dances" has torn us to pieces. A real guilty pleasure.
