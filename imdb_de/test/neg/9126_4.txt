The final frames of the original American Graffiti provide one-line summaries of the fates of the film's four male protagonists. Although it was somewhat sexist to omit the female characters, the end of the original film provided all the information about those people who even the most passionate fan of the movie wanted. Someone thought that the detailed lives of these characters could make a lot of money after the end of the original movie. Bad train. An insurance agent and his wife, a nerdy private in Vietnam, a drag race driver and an overgrown hippie to make interesting characters in interesting situations, were far beyond the talents of those who wrote this almost unsurpassable film. With most of the original cast back and only Richard Dreyfuss feels good about staying away, "More American Graffiti" is a jumble of stupid situations involving protests, car racing, country singers and the Vietnam War. The use of split-screens, once thought to be innovative and daring, is misused to distraction and adds confusion to the already confused processes. This is a sequel that demonstrates almost everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Maybe it should be shown as teaching in film schools. Even the use of the old music, which inspires the original, is bad here. If you want more "American Graffiti", you will see the original twice.
