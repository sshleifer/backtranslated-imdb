This movie was pretty messed up. There was nothing really going on. The only character who had attraction was Bobbie Phillips's Maya, and she was not even worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard, double crossing of the double cruiser. With a few too many double crosses to make sense. Sometimes that means that it "guesses" you, in this case "let you wait". In the end, all I wanted was for everyone to be jailed or shot.
