It's a shame that a movie with such good cinematography like this did not have an action that should be supported by the work of Sarah Cawley (cinematographer) and Adam Lichtenstein (film editing), and above all, no sense of what's going on in Mexico City. The film tries to portray life in the city very realistically, but it can not. It is a shame that a lot of film is wasted. An American girl is looking for her abducted brother. The first story in the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems there was no effort to come up with a better illustration of the ordeal, especially when it comes to hiring the staff of the US Embassy in Mexico City, when it's about a problem like this. Compare, for example, Frantic (1988), who deals with a similar problem. The same applies to the role of the municipalities. Compare, for example, with Todo el Poder (1999). The film is worth a look if you want to get a feel for the look of the city itself, paying little attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists that require a fairly comprehensive attitude of unbelief. Who will believe that a Mexican patrol from Mexico City will catch the main characters on the Mexico-US border? And that this policeman can use his radio from the border to Mexico City! Only the producers of this film. It is worth noting that the Mexicans speak at least Spanish in contrast to Frida and other films about Mexico.
