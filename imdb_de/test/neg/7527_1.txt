The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on her face despite extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a lousy, uninspired, uninspired story without imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Is today's movie audience too hip to write by H. G. Wells the way it is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more appealing story, even with awkward low-budget effects, beach party Eloi and Morlocks steroids like Smurfs. The 2002 version must have HG Wells spinning in the grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and get trapped in a time paradox is an old science fiction -Cliche. This distracts completely from the love affair with Mara (which happened to Weena!), Which made the 1960s version so adorable. This sets an unfortunate and distracting tone at an early stage that complains the entire movie. If Guy Pearce's character were so brilliant, would he or his buddy Einstein recognize the paradoxical dilemma of the time? Is not there 800,000 years in the future? not less from a Morlock, Doh !! What is wrong with time travel, just to have fun, adventure and curiosity - as embodied in the 1960s version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if you had seen the first movie would you even realize what Pearce did with the time machine when you first saw it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of ​​"traveling" in a fourth dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director does everything to make Pearce's character geeky, a worn-out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960s, Rod Taylor was also a bit nerdy (at least near Weena), but managed to be shrill, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. One of the key themes of the '60s version - abandoned in the remake - is the idea that an endless war is leading to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is meaningless - and does little to science literacy. For more than 4 billion years, the moon has suffered much stronger asteroid impacts, making any nuclear device look like a banger. Yes, science fiction needs an artistic license, but that's just stupid and pointless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying the time machine is also stupid. Apparently, our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is a kind of machina ex machina. Disappointing, Pearce never returns to the 1800s to tell his story to his unbelieving friends. Week is the time travel to the distant future and back. <br /> <br /> 6. When Morlocks walk around during the day, H. G. Wells' wondrously scary, gruesome portrayal of them ruins ruined creatures of the night. A real cinematic chance lost. Besides, Wells portrayed the Eloi as frail and childish. Those guys in the movie looked like they could fight Morlocks if they were not that big baby sluts. <br /> <br /> 7. The one smart Morlock? a kind of bleached Star Wars Evil Emperor - had potential, but is so lame and distant that he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic climax! In the book, the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated and fight to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The Goof-Ball Hologram at N.Y. Public Library is too much. It sheds light on the idea of ​​human cannibalism. The version of 1960 simply had the "speaking rings" that brought a cool bleak eulogy to humanity. Decoupled evolution is a serious thing. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a tired, contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and borrow the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt). At least you can fast-forward the boring parts, just like our time traveler.
