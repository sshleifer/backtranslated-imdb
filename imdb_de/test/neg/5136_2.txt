This movie has good intentions, at least in the message: "Do not worry, no matter how hard it can be, fear will kill you in the end." It's good news, but the container is so flawed that the message is crushed by bad acting , complete lack of credibility in the feelings, dialogue, as if he were reading aloud, cliches instead of breathing, living people. <br /> <br /> It abuses effects like slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in acting and thus lack of emotional power ... <br /> <br /> The suicidal ideation still reminds me a low-budget movie from the 90s, when lesbians seemed (at least on celluloid) to have a complete inability to lead a good, happy life, and the tendency to be caught in exaggerated dramas, often with separation, Death or prison were connected. <br /> <br /> If it had been focused on the rewards of living life, depending on how we feel it (and not how others feel it is living), it would have been less dramatic and inspiring. But it does not focus on pain but on loss, leaving the message on a theoretical ideal. I can not see how this film can be an inspiration to anyone who can come out or overcome fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a really good movie to overcome fear and live what you feel, you will return to the great "Desert Hearts" (even better: reading The novel!)
