I would like to believe that the above quote (especially the English subtitle translation), which was actually written and not spoken in a rejection letter that a publisher sends to the protagonist, should be self-referential in a tongue-punch -cheek way. In this case, director Leos Carax apparently neglected the actors about the true nature of the film. They are all so terribly serious in their depictions that I have to conclude that Carax is taking himself seriously or is so much contempt for anyone, especially the audience, that it can not bother him to let anyone into the joke , <br /> Some writers can get away with weird, bizarre movies because they work with verve and unique personal style (eg David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach while still incorporating surreal elements into the fabric of the story (eg, Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). In Pola X, Carax throws the viewer into confusion and confuses him. Well, here it is: the tempo is unpredictable and choppy, in particular, continuity is often omitted; superfluous signs abound (eg the gypsy mother and the child); most ideas are overworked; The lighting is often bad, especially in the often discussed sex scene. Unconnected scenes are pushed into the movie for no apparent reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> In order not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the music, as well as the cacophonic industrial-techno music that was played in the sprawling, abandoned complex that the main characters retreat to in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's "factory" of the 60s?) , , Much of the scenery was beautiful, an obvious attempt to stand out from the dirty city situations. Even in middle age Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has "it". Her performance was also the only one among the main characters that did not sink into Bathos. <br /> <br /> There used to be a time when I found such films as "Pola X" more beneficial. Experimentation is admirable, even if the experiment does not work. But Carax is not trying anything new here. The film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless previous films, and after several decades of filming and literally thousands of films later, I just can not stand the patience for this kind of unoriginal, ill-educated trip. At this early moment of the 21st century, you will ask: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, are there any directors in France who know how to make a worth seeing film? Rating: 3/10.
