"I hate you, you hate me, Barney stole your SUV from you with a big pile and a kick in. Do not you want me to hate you too?" "Jingle Bells Batman smells, Granny shot a gun Barney and let him pee, and now there's no Barney anymore." What I mean by that is that Barney is a departure from the underground world? And the kids in this show are 12 years old. If I were her, I would not believe that stupid idiot is called barney. Well, producers, why do you believe that crap that Barney says? You are always happy. That's stupid. You should be sad sometimes. I'm right? Bottom line Barney is so stupid who watches this ugly creature.
