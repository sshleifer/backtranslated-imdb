An excellent example of the disaster that occurs when you combine a challenging script with two actors selected for their physical appeal. It's rare that when I first watch a movie I'm consciously aware of acting because I'm trying to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of "Full Ride," the drama was so weak that the film was not worthy of a story; I was too busy (at the first and only watching), alternating between laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, for most members of the cast, pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak, individual talent limitations are not in conflict with any truly competent action. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are physically at least well matched and find common ground when they look way too old for the credible age of their characters. Unfortunately, the script requires particularly intense and compelling performances to portray their characters, exposing only Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent. On the positive side, they know enough not to look directly into the camera and do not stutter. <br /> <br /> Better to have used a less attractive couple who could physically go through for the right age. The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation of "An Officer and a Gentleman," but it would have offered a talented pair of "teenage" actors a beautiful showcase. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I am only a child.
