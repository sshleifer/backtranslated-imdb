Sometimes there is a movie that is so bad that you are always watching in awe. This is one of those movies. Of course I can not help feeling that I'm biased. I'm from Chicago, so I looked closely at the scenes and do not think Billy Crystal is funny at all. I can not stand all English photography (Tony Scott, etc.) when the smoking machine is working overtime and all the soft, muted lighting. I think we should believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the story. If you really think about it, these people should be imprisoned, not the bad guys, because they are more dangerous. And of course the clich√© of the cops is about to retire. But the funniest scene is the climax on which the good and bad guys in the Thompson Center (a state building!) Are shot to death. Of course it's a cool building, but it's a huge drug deal in the White House.
