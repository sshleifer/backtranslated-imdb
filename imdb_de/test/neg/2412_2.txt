The only good thing about this film is the artwork on the advertising poster by H. R. Geiger. Anti-Nuke protesters, who all looked like punk rockers of the late 1970s and somehow became non-violent (with the exception of their leader, Splatter) occupy the cities. Burschenschaft boys come down to the punks to use violence against them and make them victims. Bad acting and bad action then depends on the real victim, of you as a viewer. I gave this a "2" because some sexual scenes give at least MST3K potential. <br /> <br />
