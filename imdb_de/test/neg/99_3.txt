Four things fascinated me about this film - firstly the main character: Carly Pope (known by "Popular"), who is always a pleasure. Secdonly has the brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Third, it is filmed in collaboration with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. I was completely disappointed. The whole plot is absurd and complicated, with very low resolution. Pope's acting is fine, but unfortunately, Owen is not used enough. The other actors and actresses are fine, but I do not know them all. Apart from the beautiful puzzles that are scattered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen), this movie is not very good. So the moral of the story is: just look at it if you really want it.
