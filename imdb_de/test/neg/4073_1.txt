I should not have seen the movie after reading the review here. I saw the whole movie by fast forward and ended in 25 minutes. Although it is a low budget movie, it could have been done better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts more like a thriller and tells you to shut down in minutes. And why was the movie called "crash landing" when it landed so well in such a bad climate? <br /> <br /> Without being behave, all were characters in which they moved or acted like children. <br /> <br /> And should not forget to comment on the Joker - the main hijacker that would have been more appropriate if this movie was a full-time comedy.
