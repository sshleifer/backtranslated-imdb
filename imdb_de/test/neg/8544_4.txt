An expedition party made up of constant quarrels and heinous tricks goes into the perilous African jungle in search of a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named Diana (delicious brunette actress Katja Biernet) dressed exclusively in a scrawny loincloth much of her hot, shapely body) worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called Mabutos. Director / screenwriter Jess Franco has failed to bring style and power into the generally wicked and meandering process, crawling along the slow tempo in an often torturously slow clip and staging the rare action scenes with a single lack of skill and serenity. The lousy synchronization, the sheer amount of grainy "National Geographic" -like wildlife shots, groovy, jazzy lounge scores, terrible acting, unconventional narration, unobtrusive narrative, lukewarm softcore sex scenes and static photography do not help either. Fortunately, there is plenty of delicious nudity in mind to lessen the boredom sensibly: In addition to the delicious Biernert, both Aline Mess as a savage, evil high priestess Noba and Mari Carmen Nieto as an engaging, treacherous Lita on the other hand are very simple eyes. The beautiful jungle landscape is also very nice. Overall, however, this picture is barely visible and therefore immediately forgotten.
