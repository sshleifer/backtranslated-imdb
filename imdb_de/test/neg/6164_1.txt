Unfortunately, House of D is just terrible, with a ridiculous storyline, terrible lyrics, a bit mediocre acting, and indeed everything else is just below par. A single child in Paris and manages to convince the beautiful Parisian woman that he eventually marries, although she does not speak her language. She is shocked when he reveals her "secret" years later! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> He then "bestows" his ordeal on his own son, and we believe he believes that this is just the biggest birthday present a father can give his 13-year-old boy. If only things like that were so easy! David Duchovny abuses his own wife Tea Leoni in the role of his mother and strikes again. Leoni makes me laugh as a comic, but she's just wrong for that role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with this is that none of the characters are sympathetic. I just did not care what happened to them. I was hoping that Robin Williams and his trademark "child in the body of an adult" would fall into a village pothole, but unfortunately it should not be, and we had to endure his miserable performance all the way. > <br /> Anton Yelchin and Williams's daughter Zelda were not bad, but I suspect the rave reviews others give them is simply because they were not nearly as bad as everyone else in the movie. They were not great, let me put it that way. <br /> <br /> There are so many stupid and subtle aspects in this film - Erykah Badu, the bicycle, the Catholic school and their staff of idiots, the comfortable stupid characters, etc. - that this review would go on forever "I finish by saying that House of D is a very bad movie and I am almost embarrassed by Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is how much I was so encouraged by online "friends" to see that I've come a long way. <br /> <br /> I would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so It would be so bad if I had only spent a few hours in the local cinema, but instead I lost a whole day and found that mine so-called "friends" are either stupid or dishonest, because this is a terrible movie!
