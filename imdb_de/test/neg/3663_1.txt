Not the best movie in the world ???? That was an understatement. Personally, I did not like this movie at all. Not because of the plot, not because of the violence and nakedness. Nudity did not necessarily have to be there, she did not do anything for the story, except maybe that the girls had a hard time, and that they were naked, they probably got more confused. But one of the things in the movie I hated ... was that it was sooo dark. They could not really understand what was going on. I think if it were not so dark and you could see where they were, maybe it would not have been that bad. Everything you know is a cellar somewhere. You see no house, no street, the killer in it, all you could see was its half face for about 5 seconds. I want to see something in a movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes pretty dark and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. Then you hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that really impressed me, which was good about the movie, maybe the excitement in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not the tension, how the movie will end, but the tension of .. I will in this movie only see a few naked bodies and different flashing lights. But honest people, that was a Saw meets Blair Witch Project wannabe. Both first-class films and both with the right lighting to find out what was going on. Forget about this movie, if you can see ... if your blind man ... you might want to hire to hear the screams when you go into these kinds of things. But if you're blind, you probably will not read this .. so anyway ... BAD FILM !!!!
