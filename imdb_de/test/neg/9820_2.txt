I assume that the rave reviews on this site are from people who have never read the book. Unfortunately, for those who love the text, Hollywood surpasses itself in destroying this text. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure from where on earth the love interest of the woman came, except that she replaced the cat, and why our Rogue Male did not buy a helpful family in Blighty - in fact most of the book was cut out and by your usual crude love replaces history. The ambiguity about the World Leader was completely eliminated, and our villain got a name (none of them appeared until the second book). I just gave him a 2 and not a 1 of the wonderfully bad Cockney accents. Joan Bennett far surpasses Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins and this is a small way to save him. <br /> <br /> Okay - Brits probably should avoid that. Trust me :)
