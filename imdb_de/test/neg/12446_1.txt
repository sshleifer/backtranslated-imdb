Wow, this movie really got under the normal gamut of boring, boring and uninspired movies I've seen lately. Acting was poor and robots. The story was so bland that one could summarize it with a simple 5-minute short film. The audio was so bad and dirty it was hard to even hear it. Maybe it was unedited by the camera from which it was shot down? I'm not sure which movie the three glowing reviewers commented, but it was not that. Perhaps the director had his hand when he saw that his film received a good rating, at least before the actual reviews popped up on this film. Absolutely suck!
