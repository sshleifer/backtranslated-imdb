I found that a very disappointing experience! But I have added a better option of a similar style at the foot of this entry. <br /> <br /> This "Felicia's Journey" is fascinating. It has drama. But it's full of stereo types! <br /> <br /> So, it's ONLY for judging temperaments with no concern for fairer justice and fairness and truth, beyond black and white ratings that match 30 second NEWS ads that are our daily multimedia experiences , especially news, bulletins, true or misleading in such representations! <br /> <br /> It's so exaggerated, it reminds me of the fairy tale of "Little Red Ridinghood"! Imagine the innocent young girl who crosses no borders and is questioned by a guard, but is released without evidence to dare to search for her "Romeo" who gave her no address "helping hand" and befriend them with his unlikely story generated by the shift! <br /> <br /> It seems to suit the directors and the management team that no one has faith or prays to God, even in times of desperation! <br /> <br /> In these early settings, orchestrating and telling a lot of what's coming! A nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale dissolution, without truth or integrity or credibility! ... then a turn and everything is over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a MUCH superior movie looking at similar topics with much more credibility and much more insight, check out the movie "Man of Flowers" by Paul Cox / Norman Kaye (1983) !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you will NOT be disappointed!
