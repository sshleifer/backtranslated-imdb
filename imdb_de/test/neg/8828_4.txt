It's very possible that I simply did not give the film a fair chance because it was immediately unattractive to me (something similar happened to Triplets of Belleville), but I should have really noticed it when I put the film and my movie on hold Roommate, an exchange student from Japan, immediately started laughing at the movie and said it sounded stupid. Well, I do not agree that it's stupid, the animation is very simple, but clearly very skillful. It's like a classic animation with extra layers that add another element of realism to it, while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal. <br /> <br /> But the topic is completely unattractive to me. It has an interesting message about greed and greed, but it's so uncomfortably packaged that it's not worth learning, especially because you already knew it. The sound effects, while the man, for example, loudly devours cherries and cherry pits, are indeed repugnant. <br /> <br /> There was a clever scene of animation as we dived endlessly into the hole that the man in him finds in his head when he pulls the tree out of his scalp, but it takes so long that he does everything others seem to overshadow. There is so much material in this one sequence that it's almost as if the whole movie is about it. <br /> <br /> As I said about Triplets of Belleville, this would have been a great thing for a late night TV program like adult swimming or its Japanese counterpart, but an Oscar-nominated movie? I have the impression that there is usually no long list of animated short films for the academy.
