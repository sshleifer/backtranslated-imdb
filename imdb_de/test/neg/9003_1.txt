Take it as a cameraman who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and from 1950 to 1993 Warners Bros and Paramount. This is a crap. Sure, it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party, but trying to sell it on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. The hero is almost ridiculous and he really thinks he can draw something from his comments on the specials. I hate to see his fan club. The old movies were not associated with the action in many scenes. What the hell was this garden scene with three of the worst actresses. I have never seen a garden on a ship. They could not even emotify. I would not mind if they could play acting, but the only one was the Translvanian-accented guy. I'm sorry, but this is not a smart movie, as some people say. I would think that horror movie fans would be offended by this movie piece.
