I can not believe I got into this movie to do a favor that my friends ask me early on April 14, 2007. This movie is certainly painful and sickly boring in the theater. I have not even experienced the bloody influence of his "discouraging scenes," which I totally deny to attract the public. The worst has even kicked me because my girlfriend did not come to the theater in time because she was busy helping her boyfriend find a suitable lodge for one night. I was not really disappointed, but this movie is indeed a matter for me, bad plot, useless plot, naive created and I do not remember what to say. <br /> <br /> The title does not work I can not say that the horror and the horror have not overwhelmed us viewers. Maybe the beating of the animals could get more goose bumps if they show the real situation play in the cinemas. Good luck to anyone who tries to look at it anyway.
