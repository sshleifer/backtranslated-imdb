I really wanted to like this movie because I have admiration for the Italian rip-off cinema (especially Jaws rip-off!), But the simple fact of the matter is that Monster Shark is not very good. All signs that this is a big garbage are there; We have one of the kings of dirty cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, on the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiw, who plays the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give the best as well. A kind of film to run for his money, but somehow the movie still manages to be quite stale. The fact that the "monster shark" does not happen too often is probably a good thing given the creature design, but there are never enough places where the film can be pulled through without it. The plot focuses on a resort on the south coast of Florida (or rather in Italy), where several residents with missing arms and legs have appeared in the water. It does not take long for the local authorities to decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it's up to a colorful crew of sailors to catch them alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that it always feels very pointless, and as the character or plot development is little, even the least demanding audiences are likely to get bored soon. This kind of movie is not known to be brilliant, though the fun factor of movies like 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' is missing most of the time. What I love about lead actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to take himself seriously, no matter what movie he's in (though he's only made four). This is certainly the case here, though Bava never really allows him to fully immerse himself, and he often feels like a spare wheel like the rest of the movie. Much of the running time is spent watching the different characters in the American camp and is not very intriguing. Bava, however, ends up with an entertaining jumble of action as the central monster finally wreaks havoc on its potential hijackers. Overall, there is really not much to recommend for this movie. Like I said, I really like this kind of stuff and even I found myself boring on many occasions. Only for Italian hardcore fans!
