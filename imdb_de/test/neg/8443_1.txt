I was seriously demolished with this purchase. The other posters pretty well reveal the shortcomings of this poor, poor movie. My DVD I bought had the 1978 Piranha poster on the cover with the credits for the movie on the front "Director: Joe Dante" etc. I was really disappointed to find the wrong movie on the CD. I'm actually a fan of many bad movies. Somewhere is always something funny or at least amusing. NOt this movie! I'll actually spend the three dollars in gas money to return that two-dollar DVD just for the sake of the matter. Obvious wrong packaging here. Probably the worst movie ever. No redeeming factors at all. Boring !!! It's not even worth trying, just to see how bad it is. Serious.
