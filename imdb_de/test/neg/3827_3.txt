Everything went well and looks interesting. However, the attempts to create emotions between the characters are so incapable of really deterring horror and insulting serious audiences. The story based on "I went with a zombie" is probably much better, though unfortunately I have not seen it yet. "Ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in reality it turned out to be very bad, which is a pity. It's hard to say what's wrong with that. I think there are just too many incompetent scenes and it's hard to believe, for example in the love story between Alice (Alice Dodgson's name is the girl Lewis Carrol allegedly inspired to call his heroine Alice) and the younger one Brothers. There was absolutely nothing built between them and in the end they marry. Anyway, that looks great and was worth a look - but the movie is being played so badly. 10.3.
