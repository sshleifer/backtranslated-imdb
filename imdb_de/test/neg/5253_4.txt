I've heard a lot about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania and a lot of the film was filmed here in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. In the end, I was disappointed. It's not as horrible as other users have said, but it's definitely bad. It's about a monster killing people in a 6th-century castle, and Lambert coming to kill him. Lambert is good because he plays in all his roles, but the rest of the characters are bad and the action is not that good either. Maybe the only thing that could have saved this movie is the special effects, very bad. Oh, and one more bad thing: the music. The film tries and manages to create the atmosphere of the 6th century. All action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very bad. I mean, Action on Rock works perfectly in a movie like Charlie's Angels - where your action turns perfect. But that was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
