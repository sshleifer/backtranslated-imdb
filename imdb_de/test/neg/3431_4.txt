This (very) low budget movie is fun if you're a John Krasinski fanatic but is otherwise disappointing. At least it was short, so I did not feel like wasting too much time. John's scenes are weird enough, but the attempted "deep" scenes with Lacey Chabert are pretty disgusting. It starts off as if it could be a funny movie, but some of the characters are just so fancy, while the others are way too serious that it just goes flat. Do not let me start with the end. It was completely implausible and did not even fit the rest of the movie. I'll say I did not get bored, so I rated it over three. Fans of John Krasinski will enjoy seeing him wearing bandanas and stockings and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and definitely read John's deleted scenes, they are better than some that were actually in the movie.
