A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It does not matter if it's a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a bad movie is a bad movie, no matter. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I'm scared, was a very bad movie. Above all, by making characters look dangerous or macho, they do not bring aura over them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (Amitabh Bacchan's character) that in this case we should have been aura of his "power" and what did the "charity" of the character show? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This fact was said by a commentator and Amitabh kept giving facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but why should it mean anything if no story or story goes with it? <br /> <br /> There was no proper characterization of the characters who worked under "Sarkar". Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he is wise? The flow of the film was usually boring, as scenes were created by the godfather (as the policeman Abhishek Bacchan suggested). The older brother was killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed by order of Pacino), but it was trying to grab too much of the film with too little history and depth to go with him. That was indeed the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of intricate details like a godfather in 2 hours, even with few dialogues, you'll get a highlight show from a cricket match, never when you get the full effect When watching a full game, this will be possible.
