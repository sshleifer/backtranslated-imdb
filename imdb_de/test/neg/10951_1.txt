First, I'm a big fan of crap films. B-class is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately, this movie is just bad. I dressed up as a zombie for a party and my make-up looked better than the one in this movie. Especially the big guy in the beginning, it just looked as if a child had drawn with colored pencils on his face. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I have no reason to say so. The effect is also extremely amateurish, as obvious blood tubes emit a straight stream of blood from the heads of the zombies when shot. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people commenting on this film are trying to improve the rating. No one without a finger would classify this movie over 5/10. Honestly, it's a shame that the people who worked on this movie are raising their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone avoids this movie, it's not worth to waste the 90 minutes of your life. Absolutely terrible.
