This was a decent movie for the first half. Too many cheap BOO! Moments but the tension builds up, the bad guys are scary and everything seems to be well adjusted. The kids are not very deep, but hey, that works for teens. <br /> <br /> Then it just gets ridiculous and tries too much - the "why in the world would he / she do that?" Moments overwhelm anyone's ability to expose unbelief, the phrase involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some semantic content into the movie that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped. There was laughter in the theater at moments that were by no means supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> Great premise, but poorly written and does not stick together. Some very nice shots, but they are hard to enjoy if you roll your eyes.
