Piranha starts as expected, stupid whites will discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while, it could be a cannibal movie. It starts like so many others and shows nothing but shots of untouched Amazon rainforest. As far as I know, it could be Florida. At this point, you realize that animal mutilations or natives will emerge. Instead, you get the theatrical talents of William Smith, who played in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, a celebrated hunter whom I would call Jack Palance Light. He's taller in stature, but not the kindness of Jack Palance. You do not get that many with the locals. Where is the piranha? Should I ask this question at all? Caribe is hunting people now, I think. However, he does not really follow anyone until the end of the movie, but just stares at her. Caribe rides a motorcycle in a hyperdrive way by Smokey and the Bandit. The motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason beyond an action sequence. I can not tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a jungle motorcycle race. Actually they never live, they die? Are you interested? Someone wants to race with motorcycles? Attention: This film is extremely dry. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.
