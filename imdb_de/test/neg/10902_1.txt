Obviously, in the eyes of some, there are not enough horror movies in which young people are being chased through the desert by a mysterious, bloodthirsty madman in a truck. I mean, all we've got so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man. REST STOP may be the worst. It's about a girl and her boyfriend leaving their lives behind to start living together in California. On the way, they stop at a dirty toilet so that the young lady can relieve herself, but when she returns, she realizes that her boyfriend and his car have disappeared. From there, she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup who tracks and terrorizes her while hiding in the toilets. This movie is so unoriginal that it gets boring. The drama is annoying, the blood is mild and the murderer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the film, is anything but memorable. Terrible - horrible movie ...
