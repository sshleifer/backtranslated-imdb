Rourke has done his usual part as an eerie, bitter, Neanderthal, wild, evil idiot, in the same way as Picture Claire, Out in Fifty, Get Carter, Double Team, and the rest of them Garbage in which he is currently located. <br /> <br /> He has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this is just garbage that undervalues ​​Rourke, devalues ​​him, and does not matter for his characterization as an actor. Still after seeing "One Prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome", "Barfly", "9 1/2 Weeks", "Year of the Dragon" etc etc. I have considered Rourke to be an outstanding one for many years , smart, intelligent man. I think he has changed since then. <br /> <br /> He looks calloused and calcined. <br /> <br /> "He walked around with gloomy eyes / Despair inhabited his chest / And made the man a perfect pest." (Belloc, "The Example"). <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no other reason to watch this boring movie, except that Rourke was there.
