Basic structure of a story: beginning, middle, end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure is played, and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story takes place backwards. Sometimes it's just not linear, a la pulp fiction. Regardless, everyone has a beginning, a middle and an end. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I have ever seen that has no end. <br /> <br /> Beginning: The girl's best friend is expelled. <br /> <br /> Middle: Girl needs to cope without a best friend. <br /> <br /> End: Not available. <br /> <br /> There was no end to this movie, but at least it was completed. <br /> <br /> It is an exercise in apathy; We get a party mix of characters and they all turn out to be duds. Boring, vain, vapid and pale imitations of people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action in this movie: NOTHING HAPPENED. Nothing happens at all. Mischa Barton tries to talk with a clumsy English accent, Dominique Swain laments a lot, and Brad Renfro gets blown off by an old man. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> When the credits rolled, I had a terrible feeling that many prisoners must experience: periods of time, those precious minutes of our lives, have simply been wasted. <br /> The only passable point (and that's ONLY a very emphatic point) is Brad Renfro. He is doing well. I like Lacey Chabert, but no luck here. Due to the good work in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton for this travesty, but I hope all the performers were struck in the face for their involvement. <br /> <br /> Please, I implore you. Avoid. Do not be fooled by the thought "I will form my own opinion". My sister told me to never see this, and I ignored her because I wanted to decide. That was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie before. There are many that I do not like, but I've never hated a movie before. Until I saw that.
