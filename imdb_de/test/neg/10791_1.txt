This story is about a safari in Africa that meets a guy called Trent who persuades her to look for a white-maiden tribe. Of course, they turn out to be Amazonian warriors and catch the men. The rest is pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> This film contains everything you would expect from a bargain entertainment movie about Africa - the considerable use of often irrelevant footage, from animals that are NOT native to the continent (such as orangutans, mosses) , Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a dark-makeup white actor who plays local, bad actors (mostly from Trent - a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounds like Chico Marx), a man in one Gorilla suit and white bikini-clad women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors - like a tribe of angry female Tarzans. As it stands, my guess is that the movie was made for under $ 49.95 - including development costs and the rent of the gorilla suit! What I did not expect was an IMDb rating of 4.9. This is bad, but not so bad, considering that this is a Schlock production in every way and there is no reason why the movie is so highly rated! Now I'm NOT saying that the movie is not worth watching - it's combative and stupid enough to make it look good - especially with friends. Just do not expect anything that resembles a professionally made or competent movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is a little dialogue with this jungle classic: <br /> <br /> "Oolama like a strong white man Oolama wants a strong white man ..." <br /> < br /> "oonga-bunga" <br /> <br /> "me-te-tonga .... no, .... keeel ('kill') man"
