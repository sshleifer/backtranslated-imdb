Why was this movie made? What were the creators of this thinking?!?! The first 8mm movie had at least one meaningful and potentially interesting plot. The first film dealt with the snuff industry. This sequel is about ... the porn industry !! Yes, as if the snuff industry, in which people are allegedly killed for entertainment, are in league with the adult film industry, where people are filming other people in non-stimulated sex acts and situations for eroticism. Just the idea should warn you how bad the idea is for this movie alone. It is not helped by a lack of plot, character, drama, direction, script, logic, theme or even sound design. This is a remarkably boring movie that never caught my attention. Literally, nothing works. Why should a mystery thriller about the porn industry work with murder and betrayal at all? I'm not very interested in adult movies, but I've certainly seen them before. Why would someone make a movie about the evil and that he would do it in a sequel of a movie about snuff films? I do not even know if there is an industry dealing with the snuff film, but I hope that is not the case. The idea of ​​a snuff film alone is terrible and only people who are really sick and angry would be involved. I do not think the adult film industry is about murder and torture. I'm pretty sure many people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than hurting and killing people. It is never okay to hurt another person. The adult film industry is not about hurting people. It's about making films that are distraction and a waste of time for me. What is this movie trying to say? It does not work
