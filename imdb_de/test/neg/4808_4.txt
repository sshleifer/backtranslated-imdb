When I saw this movie for the first time, I said to myself, "Hey, the hell it sounds like a good movie, why do not we lend it?" Yes, I rented it and went home to see it. When I put it in my DVD player, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, nobody told me that this is a Mexican movie spoken in Spanish. Good that he had subtitles. <br /> <br /> SECOND, it was naked, naked nude! Since I have no background in Mexican films, you could see my shock when I saw him. * GASP! Covering maiden eyes, NOO * THIRD, predictable, to say the least, but actually predictable, was no excuse for me when I like movies way beyond the top. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, how Heidi and Kike were reunited, so cheesy. <br /> <br /> FIFTH, how the movie ended. It was a bad, bad ending. Mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval of the mayor's election was that her daughter knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I had hoped that he would not accept it so easily, the director might be in a hurry. <br /> <br /> After all the beating of the bad stuff, the goodies are here. The film was actually pretty weird when Maribel was awkward in the kitchen and everyone, Heidi's attitude, and Valentina's words were poetic. What I really like about this movie was the song Valentina made with her friend. That's all and for the other things that I did not mention, they were just so-so.
