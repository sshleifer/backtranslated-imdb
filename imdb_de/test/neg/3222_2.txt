A great gangster movie with brilliant performances by famous actors with great action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It's quite amazing to see such a large selection of well-known actors who have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie, no doubt this is one of the worst they could possibly appear in. <br /> <br /> First of all, the storyline is what you would expect from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing special. The way it's told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is (when I thought the two hours were almost over, I was pretty surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> The action scenes Just like the television series broadcast from the 80s - for example the A-Team. It's just that these scenes in the 80s (especially the A-team) were far more sophisticated than in "El Padrino". It's especially fun to see the guys raising their guns and still hitting something (not to mention people taking cover behind car doors and later looking like they've been shot through). <br /> <br /> The acting fits very well with the plot. Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it's so overreacted that you think it's a parody (but unfortunately not). <br /> <br /> My advice is to stay away from film, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
