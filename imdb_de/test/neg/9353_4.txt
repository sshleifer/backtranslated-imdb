I saw this movie again on Cable in 1956 and a few days ago. The movie did not improve with age. But on the contrary. It's a true spaghetti epic. <br /> <br /> The Trojans are heroic and sympathetic. The Greeks are evil, petty and sneaky. What if Paris ran away with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
