This homemade horror movie tells the story of a guy who kills people with the story of Edgar Allan Poe stories. The local police have been abusing the case for several years, now the FBI has taken control. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one thought to swing past his house, because he's hanging around there, running around in his vintage clothes and torturing the random locals. So the FBI chick is kidnapped, and her father is involved as well, the former senior investigator of the local police. To top it off, a pack of crazy college kids decided to camp in the house and smoke a lot of grass. <br /> <br /> Mostly the FBI Agent ends up like a little girl and not one of the burly college boys thinks he just wants to stop and swing with the rickety Poe-Boy. The Dead End Road is mostly overreacted and sometimes underactivated. It smells like a low-budget production with friends who have stupid points too numerous to cover.
