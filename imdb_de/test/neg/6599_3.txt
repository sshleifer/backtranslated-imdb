This movie is like so many biopic TV movies I have seen: formulaic, exaggerating, poorly played, and above all, premature. <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that the movie was shot and filmed before the acquittal of child molestation by Michael Jackson, which I believe was one of the most significant periods in Jackson's life and career. It would probably have made a great end to this documentary drama. However, this movie already bites more than chewing, as too much detail is jammed in this overly ambitious project. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson led perhaps the most interesting life of any musician. let alone the modern pop star to this day, and his story would probably require six behind the music specials, to be precise. This movie was trying to over-express within three hours, and it's needless to say that it failed. Flex Alexander did what he could when he played Jackson, but he came more like an SNL cartoon from Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would be rather difficult to find someone who portrays Jackson exactly, without meeting with the King of Pop himself and studying his methods of insanity. However, on a tight budget, you can only count on what you see in the tabloids, and they do not necessarily reflect a precise account. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely stupid. The Caucasian make-up on Alexander's face makes him look more like an inverted minstrel show, and anyone who's in a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's. It's also amazing to me that the film documents how Jackson got under the knife to undergo plastic surgery, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same nasal size. This kind of exposure of disbelief the director expects will not be able to withstand television viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting when real Michael Jackson recordings (ie the time he was hung up) over a balcony in Germany was inserted into the movie in real time. It was a nice try, but it just did not work. <br /> <br /> If this movie released in theaters is released, it would only make a profit from its stickiness. It even gets pale compared to "Mommie Dearest" and that says a lot. Most of all, this was a movie that was likely to go into filming like many non-HBO television films. It could have been much better if it had only related one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it was just child abuse allegations, it would probably have been much better and even more intriguing.
