This is just another bad Chuck Norris movie. Norris plays a policeman in the footsteps of a twisted serial killer of women. He locked the guy away three years ago, but the guy somehow gets through the bars he's in by using dental floss. Then the killer escapes in a cleaning cart and drives him over a 400-foot-high cliff. He spends time renovating a theater that is undergoing renovations. The Irishman Jack O'Halloran is the best in this movie, but like Superman II he does not say a word. Somehow this should make him more threatening. Ron O'Neal of Super Fly and Steve James are wasting playing the city's mayor and Norris' Sidekick. The film also contains the idiotic subplot of Norris and his girlfriend, who has an illegitimate child; It's such 80s. When Norris's "serious" twist is coupled with overblown musical clues that predictably signal each impending scene, the movie becomes a chore. The construction during the search for the murderer in the theater is interesting enough. Norris crawls through the shadows to discover the hiding place, but the final battle is disappointing after he started in such a promising way. It's another disappointment of Cannon Films and it's like a TV movie. * of 4 stars.
