In the last 5 years I've rented some bad movies ... totally on purpose. See, I'm striving to be a film critic, and as we all know, terrible movies happen every year. About 3 months ago I rented these. I've seen it all the way ... and cried violently. This is one of those movies that are so damn bad that you feel like puking. It really made me feel sick in the stomach. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000?), But this one takes the cake. The plot was hard to follow, the lighting was terrible and the sounds almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here, this film would be -11 for me. This may seem strange, but I highly recommend it. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but do not say I did not warn you. I do not think this review could be more accurate, so I'm done now. <br /> <br />
