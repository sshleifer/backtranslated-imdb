For me, Bollywood movies are generally not much to offer, although they are still very much in demand, and Bollywood is a big filmmaker because they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> The only motive that led me to watch the movie See how much an American actress could change or influence the logic on which Indian film is based. This not only changed the history of film, but also this mixture caused a ridiculous series of events. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's quite common to see scary things in Indian movies because they have their own world in their own world of movies. But once you encounter such incidents an American makes you laugh. For God's sake, you can believe that a famous American actress is in a desperate situation and feels powerless. Can you imagine an American actress falling in love with a dance teacher whose fianc√© has already fallen in love with America's friend and met at the same time? There were many similar things to mention. The less said, the better. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was wrong when I expected too much from Indian Movies.
