When I saw this for the first time, I thought it was a joke. All I could think was, "You get the 8mm camera, I'll get my little brother's toys, we'll make a movie!" Why would anyone turn a science-fiction movie like this in a modern era like 2001 seems like it originated in the early 80's. With actors that are Indian like a cigar shop, a script written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera stolen from a burning farmer's shop, poverty special effects, plus a graduation, a director who believed this crap would make her famous. The end result was not spectacular, complete with unpleasant dialogues and continuity. Venus must have been fun and I'm sure everyone involved had a great time with their stupid little movie. A 2 out of 10 for a brave, hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
