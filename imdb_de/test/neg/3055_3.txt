When I saw this for the first time, I found that parts of it were pretty scary. But the horror is somewhat undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that they do not care what happens to them. There are some really good moments like Angela's speech about demons, and the short-faced demon itself is effective. However, this really does not stand up to repeated consideration or a thorough analysis. It's all rather cheesy and cheap looking and often downright silly, pornography and listless jokes that too often replace the horror. The music is excellent and the epilogue is certainly amusing, but this movie does not have much to recommend, it just looks like another Jason Stalk and Slash fare.
