Hellraiser: Bloodline is the place where the continuation of the Hellraiser series is well used. Gone are the imagination and the invention of the first two films. Way is the ethos of Pinhead and his henchmen. The sick wishes of the people are over. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been destroyed by the confusion of a picture. All that's left is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This watered-down apology for a Hellraiser movie is filled with endless Psycho Babble, making Pinhead a foolish, bubbly philosopher, not a harbinger of fate as he should be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic film formulas, separating the characters and killing them one at a time. Pinhead is not an alien. The connection between the box and the "demons" or "hells" is never established, it only comes to a victim and sits on a sideboard. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist is called "Rimmer" and the producers obviously think it's really funny because everyone keeps saying their name. Actually, the movie should have been renamed to give it the name of the characters. <br /> <br /> Shame on Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
