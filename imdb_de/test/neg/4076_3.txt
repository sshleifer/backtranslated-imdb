If you are not a fan of the 80s and you have to be a particularly strong fan or one of the two leads, there is nothing in this film that is recommended. <br /> <br /> The story, as others have said, is boring, almost pensive about the basic idea of ​​the characters and the idea of ​​making a slightly manic comedy. I looked at it for about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a turn would happen, or somehow get going, but no ... It's not unsurpassable, it's just boring. It passes. It goes by with insane running pieces, slipping feet in strange angles, screaming screaming, but I did not get any sense of energy or manic fun, it just came as forced. Needless to say, there was nothing special to laugh about. A little mild amusement here or there, but not anymore. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the mention of feminism, all it means in this case is that almost only the main cast is female. If anything, it's actually uncomfortable ... Two female leaders, good, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, the landlord is a landlady, okay, her friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly look for the same building, oh, female ... I was not looking for that, but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to film the film that way, and he felt compelled again and annoying. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the 80s fashion and culture, there's plenty to see and if you're a fan of Helen Slater, it's fun and enjoyable to watch. There are also some screen times for Carol Kane, which is great, but not enough ... <br /> <br /> Total: 3/10. If you're a big fan of the '80s, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, maybe you could expand her to a 5 because of her size, though it's still the fact that it's a comedy that is not funny, what she does considerably impeded. If you are not a fan of these things, you can make it 0 because there is not much more to enjoy here.
