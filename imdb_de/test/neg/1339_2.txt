I saw this movie last night. Usually I do not comment on good or bad, because I think films are like books, because there is something for everyone and everyone is different, the taste varies, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. In the end, I thought, oh my god, that tests my patience. How many women really look and live like this when they "bottom out", and if I could just borrow some money from my mother to live my fashion and live dreams - gosh, life would be great! I wanted to make a nice kick-date movie with my girl (my favorite husband likes to watch movies and I knew this would not be his thing), something light and gentle, but this was a bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie was not like that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she has held on. Bad. Bad.
