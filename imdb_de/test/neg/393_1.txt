I have one word: focus. <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. in order. Let's discuss the fine points. I do not know what the rest of you are, but in my first year at the film school, they taught us a lot of useless crap, like "They'll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers" - but they also showed us how to do this crazy thing, the FOCUSING the lens! it was wonderful! you give a little spin and wham! everything is clear as a bell. The person who filmed what Alice found has to learn a few things about the finer points. Lighting too. Not only is this film totally out of focus, it also shines like the corner of someone's basement. <br /> <br /> does not get me up to speed or plot. They could have shortened the beginning and end of each shot by about ten seconds. <br /> <br /> but who cares? There is not enough lurid in this film to compensate for the absolute lack of respect for the best friends of the film - FOCUS and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> Words to the wise.
