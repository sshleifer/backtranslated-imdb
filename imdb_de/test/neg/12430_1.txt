** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> If fans of bad movies gather for more than a few minutes, the name is always that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap thrillers such as A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY and unconventional conspiracy flights like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE HOLE NESS HORROR is, to say the least, a Humdinger. Considering the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake. The film is characterized by early (for the budget) dazzling underwater photography and creates something atmosphere despite everything. Then it degenerates into a windy dialogue spoken by nameless actors with Scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much sculpted bagpipe. Once the campers sing "They take the high road, I take the low road" just to add another Scottish clich√©. If the Scottish citizens ever decide to embark on the Political Correctness political move, they will sue Larry Buchanan for this film, regardless of his surname. The monster looks like a giant paper mache doll and makes the dragon in Beanie & Cecil look scary by comparison. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie tries to land, and to avoid a few patrolling soldiers, the fifty-meter-long creature tries to hide behind a tree - and the soldiers do not see it! THE HOLE NESS HORROR is a true madman who has to be seen several times to be believed.
