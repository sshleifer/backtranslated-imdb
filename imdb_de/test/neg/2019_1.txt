As a huge horror movie fan, one of the hardest things to consider considering the lack of countless good movies in the genre, and having seen hundreds of films in my life, I have to say that Dracula 3000 is by far who is uninspired, lame and badly done garbage, I had the misfortune to see. Stay away from this movie! It's so bad it's not even ridiculous. The special effects (did I call them "special"?) Probably made for a few grandioses, the acting is terrible and the screenplay should have ended up in the trash after the first reading by the studio that decided on this misery , The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. For you who like nudity in your movies, do not be fooled by the R rating. If you think you might even see Erika Eleniak half-naked, you're wrong. She is fully clothed throughout the movie. And the cover is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that even remotely recalls the impressive cover used to draw unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> A pity that the rating is only 1 to 10. I would say this movie is a -10. Be warned. Do not waste your money or your time doing that.
