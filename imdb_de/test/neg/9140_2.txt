I'm a huge fan of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is quite right that the stunning images of Detroit Station are the first and last memorable scene in the movie. I really wish I had gone after that instead of keeping hope alive throughout the movie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt disappointed. <br /> <br /> The score is almost a remake of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one part that struck me as fresh. However, it was good enough that I will probably still check the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But remember, when you see this movie: If at some point you find it's you I do not enjoy it, go ahead and share it - you will not miss anything because it does not get better. <br /> <br /> I'll even summarize the summary here (Warning! Spoiler!): Many shots of athletes who look almost good enough for a Nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicably boring frontal shots of wax puppets of famous people (WTF have you thought here?!?), Some giggling babies (cuuuuute), some "bitchin '" Photoshop effects, some pictures that suggest a comparison between the rivers of water, information, money and people (I think) ... and then some fast, disconnected scenes of mass violence ... and then a few of stock space footage. <br /> <br /> I could make this movie in 10 seconds. Here's my pitch: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy father with a shaved head and Lycra bikeshorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with a string; 5 seconds of the scene in "Network" in which the man talks about fighting with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows, money flows out"; 1 second when Reginald Denny was hit with a rock, and then 3 seconds when Alan Bean hopped around on the moon. <br /> <br /> Well, that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life that I just saved. Of course, I get a copy of After Effects and apply one or two filters so it does not look as blatant as it is. If Steven Soderbergh reads this, hey, I do not need much money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about "Life as War", I suggest "Bowling for Columbine" It does not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer under the black turtleneck, but at least it's funny.
