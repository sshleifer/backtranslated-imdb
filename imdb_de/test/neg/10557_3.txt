How did so many talented or at least charismatic actors go into this nonsense? Nothing is very good about this movie, but the worst things are probably the script and the director. <br /> <br /> Apparently this is director Damian Nieman's heart because he wrote (and did) both writing and directing. He is himself a map magician and seems to have named characters in honor of other famous magicians. As far as I know, this was his first feature film, and there's a chance it's the last one. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what's wrong with that? But I would say the story and the characters are not believable (the script) and the director does not give the movie any boost (the director). Plus ?? The poker scenes are bad in the worst Hollywood manner (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The alleged twists in the movie are either completely predictable or absolutely unbelievable. They eventually tie up a story that can best be described as "some decent scenes"!
