First. Should Cameron Diaz ever act again? To name a poor performance would be an insult to poor performance. That was a historically awful performance. Any little chance that Diaz had as a serious actress is now completely done. Laughably horrible. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie was extremely boring and not thought-provoking at all. I can sit down and think about human nature, without having to watch terrible actors and play a terrible story. Third, there was not a single sympathetic character, and worse, it seemed like the design I made. You should not please a character or feel sympathy. It was pretty effective. I just wanted everyone to die, to be honest. Aliens included. Child included Everyone was just one big Mope in this movie. Everyone literally just made moped and called it a movie. You could hardly distinguish the zombie employees from ordinary people because they all looked like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing really makes sense. From the reactions and emotions of the characters to the literal act, everything seems random. This is just a really bad movie, disguised and disguised as a "think mans movie", which is supposed to be confusing. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
