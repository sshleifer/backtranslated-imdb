Do not borrow this movie. In the end, I bought the "previously viewed" band for $ 4.00. That was close to the rental price, so I thought I could buy it as well. I'll throw it out after I finish this review. The film, in which Lowe plays the main role, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow pictures and poorly executed cuts. I thought I would see a thoughtless action movie, what I wanted to see, I did not even get that. This is an exercise in slow movements, with no script, close-ups, terrible editing and a poorly developed plot. I can not believe that this actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. At the end of the movie, we do not even know who they are. Believe the hype, stay away.
