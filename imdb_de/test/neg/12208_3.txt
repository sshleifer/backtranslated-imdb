All you have to do is read the cast list and credits to assemble in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but unfortunately, unfortunately! How much great acting and directing talent one of the richest narratives of literature could have turned into such a monumental BORE is completely impossible to me. It's pretty to look at with beautiful photography, especially the Yarmouth sequences, but, EASY THEN !!! No need to go further! Skip it and try the Selznick or the wonderful BBC miniseries from the 1980s.
