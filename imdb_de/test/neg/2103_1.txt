There are spoilers, but trust me, I'll do you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I like to see shitty movies again and again. Inspired by Mystery Science Theater and our local jokes skills; We went in search of films that were worth seeing, which are not really worth seeing. But trouble comes to paradise if these films can only be found if you buy them. And I'm convinced that I would not give a cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. As another reviewer has said, movies are like this, which is why downloading movies should be legalized for free. I prefer the idea of; instead of directly to VIDEO you have directly to INTERNET. In this way, the ass bags that made this travesty will never make a profit. What you unfortunately know, they do. They're hiring a bunch of actors who can not act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber bands that you can get in the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jelly and the two main characters that seem to switch between frontiers Mexican jump who speak only Spanish, Arabs who speak 100% English fluently, arbitrary nudity, a guy who is shot ten times, including one on the side of the head and the life and the most retarded end in film history, book , Cave drawings and Hustler magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would turn into a half-way snake scares me ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is great for making fun of it, but you need to make sure that there are at least four of them and you spit out all the jokes in a quick fire, because if you only see 1 second in this movie, where you do not laugh at the ass, you will feel physically ill. That's no joke. My friends and I ate chicken wings and now I can not see anything like this without Sh! T to be remembered. <br /> <br /> This movie is one about Alien Vs. Hunter, by far the second worst movie of all time. And I have seen many bad movies. By the way, it's the same production company as this movie and the bald guy is in both too. I just thought that you would like to know this little funny fact. -100 out of 10.
