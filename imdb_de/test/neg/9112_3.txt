This film suffers cruelly under his direction "Julian Grant" and his incompetent lead, Steve Guttenberg, who is trying hard to win a competition similar to Bruce Willis! The writing is a reckless Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates doing a decent job. The movie is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what the Hollywood studios thought and actually favored weak directors like Grant. And I would say to Sean Bean, "what do you think about joining a movie like this after such great films as GoldenEye, Ronin, and Patriot Games?
