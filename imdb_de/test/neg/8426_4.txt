I can not say more about this movie. It's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and The Strongest of the World, it really does not fit into the timeline of the show, though it's supposed to be placed just before the start of the TV series. The action is generally pretty nice. The plot has a nice base, with a good background, why these guys hate each other. Pretty good in general, because ... The problem is ... there's a lot of really weird stuff. I mean, really weird stuff. Like The World's Strongest, this song has a really, very strange song that could only be produced in a drug-induced haze. Worrying is the fact that Gohan is pretty much drugged while singing. Creepy. The bad guys are weird and weird ... more than the usual DBZ guy - this seems to be more like a Dragon Ball movie than a Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it's entertaining enough, but ... just ... weird.
