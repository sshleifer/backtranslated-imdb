In a word, terrible ... too many storylines ... um, yeah ... who takes her child to dig a body in the middle of the night? and what's up with his wife who stole the skeleton ... who's doing that? Why did the shrinkage fall right in the neck? and all this dog thing ... I mean, really! Since Sparrow told from the beginning, he simply destroyed the tension for me. I mean, when he tells the story, he clearly got around to telling it. So there's no chance he'll come down. Where is the tension? <br /> <br /> Of course, in a movie like this, you expect a lot of holes. But there are so many that I completely lost track of the story. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did the woman dig the body? (Who does that?) Or go alone in this crazy, eerie asylum? and where do all these candles come from? Why does the author have his mailbox in the damned book? I mean, come on ... And the book happens to be in the bookstore next to the woman's bakery? Far too comfortable ... Oh and Happy Birthday Honey, here's a book about a serial killer ... What a DIVINE GIFT! The book is 20 pages long, half of which is empty, and he needs Freak forever to read it. If he was really obsessed with this book, would not he have read it all at once? <br /> <br /> Slightly comfortable for him to bump into his future wife for about 23 seconds (carrying a cake!) dismissed from a psychiatric clinic .. how old was he playing? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Was I the only one in the end rowing the bus to actually pull the guy down? Not good if you choose the protagonist to bite him in the end. <br /> <br /> It seems like this was written by the committee. I suppose the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23 ... It seems they needed a tricky hook to make the audience think there was something supernatural happening in the end, it did not seem to have anything to do with anything. I mean, I did not expect the godfather, but everything about this movie was totally disappointed. Without all the numerology stuff, this movie could have been alright, instead of a crazy Se7en knockoff. <br /> <br /> Not scary, unintentionally funny and otherwise a total snoozer.
