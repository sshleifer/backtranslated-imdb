The Salena incident is located in Arizona, where six death row inmates are being removed from the state prison for unsolved reasons. When driving along the heavily armed prison bus, the bus gets an apartment and the driver has to leave the street. Then, two blond birds emerge and after seducing the incompetent prison guards, the six prisoners are released, but at a shooting range their escape car is damaged, leaving them all stranded in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to drive to the nearest town in Salena, which is several miles away, and take the police hostage. Once they reach Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely deserted and not a single person is in sight. They soon discover that the entire city was killed by carnivorous aliens and they are firmly on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Alien invasion Arizona in the US on DVD and apparently the working title Terror Town This vile sci Low budget budget horror movie was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert. He has no real salvation traits, to be honest. The Salena incident is a kind of film that gives films a bad name. The film could be roughly divided into two parts. The first forty or fifty minutes focus on the prisoners who feel like a thriller, the guards, and the escape, though it's pretty poorly written and staged stuff. The dialogue between the two blond birds and the prison guards is so bad that it is unintentionally funny, as the two fitted birds chat the two unfit prison guards. Funny stuff, unfortunately The Salena Incident is a sci-fi horror movie, not a comedy. Once the escaped consumers and their prison guards arrive in Salena, the sci-fi horror mode activates as the aliens emerge and begin to kill our clich√©d character, which is good because they are annoying. See, the whole movie is shit because it was poorly written, thought out and made. I can not really care why, but trust me. The Salena incident is terrible at every level. <br /> <br /> Apart from being a bad, boring and stupid movie, the Salena incident is also bad. The scenes of the action scene are terrible, the aliens look awful and are never shown on screen at the same time as the human figure. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to say what happens. The special effects are also bad, the aliens look garbage and the CGI computer effects are absolutely terrible. The cut is bad, the cinematography is bad, the sets are cheap and the whole thing is really an eyesore. There are a bit of Gore, there are some gunshot wounds, someone is torn in half and a severed hand is seen. <br /> <br /> Obviously shot on a low budget The Salena incident has low production levels and looks cheap from the start. Shot in Superior in Arizona. Acting is not terrible to anyone I've ever heard of, though the actress who plays the doctor looks pretty good. The Salena Incident is a terrible sci-fi horror movie that's terrible About every path, not 90 minutes away from you, mine or another's time.
