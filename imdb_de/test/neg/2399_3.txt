I'm sure the people who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in particular, implying that the US Do a good job, but not clean up afterwards. So sow the seeds for future problems. Moreover, they do so without making the Islamists an enemy AND not making the Republicans an enemy, as the Republicans are in office and doing this supposedly great thing by overthrowing the USSR by covertly providing a war in Afghanistan /> But seriously now. , , Do we really want a movie that says repeatedly, "Let's kill some Russians!" How is the best an American can do with red blood? And should we find this congressman adorable because he surrounds women with big hair and eye-catching clothes? Even his supposedly clever assistant, who's always dressed professionally, always looks at Charlie as if he's simply the most wonderful, prettiest, and greatest guy. Like she's Nancy Reagan for his Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a bang-up job in her role, but basically women in this movie are really demeaned and it was really annoying.
