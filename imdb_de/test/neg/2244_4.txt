The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and exciting. The second half was pretty bad. The comic revenge story has closed and we see many Nazi comic characters and some badly traded "good guys" knocking them down. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence, but I think it should have at least one purpose in a movie. The violence here made little sense, except to create a genre film in which many people are mowed down with rifles. We should have some fun. <br /> <br /> I've recently seen Reservoir Dogs. There was a movie that used violence effectively. Within the world in which the film was made, it was realistic. There was never an exaggerated sound effect. It was a thriller that played it directly. Inglorious Basterds should have just played it, but not. I rolled my eyes as the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets on the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the backstory of any of the Basterds is really simply declared Nazi hunter. We also do not like any of them because they are too busy cutting the scalp and shooting people in the face. It's about "revenge" and very little more. <br /> <br /> It was 2 1/2 hours to work here, but few Basterds have been thoroughly investigated. It seems like it was just a revenge movie. We saw that in Tarantino's last movie Death Proof, which I did not care about either. It had the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half was pretty good again. I wanted to see the heroic deeds of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much longer film about the resistance movement that was seeking revenge on some comic nazis as they all went to a movie premiere in France.
