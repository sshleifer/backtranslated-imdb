Terrible, sophisticated writing by a "doer" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in LA and the US at the present time. The bubbly positive reviews are a mystery to me - but they could only be delivered by people who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded regardless of how superficial, simple, and simply completely unrealistic the results are. If you want to see a movie that is realistically about the current L.A. races - the movie you need to see (and probably already saw) is Pulp Fiction. There's more honesty and realism about the race in two minutes of this movie than in the full 4 hours (oh I'm sorry, it just felt like 4 hours on) of that stinker. <br /> <br /> If anyone has to prove that the road to hell is paved with good intentions - then this is the movie for you.
