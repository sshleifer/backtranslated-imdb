I've been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, saw the specials and saw the Karen Carpenter story. This movie really did not show the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie she seems shy and quite lonely (except a girlfriend). The real Karen Carpenter was a lot different. She was open-minded and friendly. She had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she saw a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day, and then she would go to her hotel room. In addition, Karen took pills to raise her thyroid so she could lose weight but stop taking her because the psychologist did not recommend her. The man of the Karens in the movie is also called Bob Knight, but was called in real life Tom Burris. Karen was not divorced from Tom, but only separated. Karen should sign the divorce papers on the day of her death. Agnes also found Karen naked in the closet, unlike the movie in which she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend.
