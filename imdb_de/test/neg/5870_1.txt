It's often difficult to decide what the best movie you've ever seen, as it can vary by genre, actor / actress preference or even the mood of a particular day! However, in my opinion, this film is by far the worst movie I have ever seen !! I found the acting terrible (were there any?), The conspiracy was just idiotic and the props were totally unreal. Could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production? I Do not Believe Even the friends I saw the movie with were in agreement that it was the worst video we've ever rented, and we still joke about the night we watched this movie ,
