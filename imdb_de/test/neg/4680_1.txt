I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he's the most delicious comedian that's been around for ages. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines that cover the range of topics from Bush's melancholy to the dingy successes of 1970s producer Robert Evans. I am a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her wide-ranging innocent / schizophrenic routine. Whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high voice to a chapped and throaty voice, I can not help but giggle. I liked Brian Posehn long before I knew he was on "Just Shoot Me," and it's something that is so innately funny about his aging nerd-like personality. All three of these talented, unique comedians are titled "The Comedians of Comedy," a Netflix documentary about their US tour. They really deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they deserve so much. I thought, no, I DID, I would like this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics, each of which has its own routine parts, "The Comedians of Comedy" is blocked by meandering and boring documentary scenes that contain no humor, insight, and nothing really interesting. I think there are a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines in the 109-minute film. What a rip off! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars in their RV? Where's the humor to see Posehn in an arcade and in a comic bookstore? Does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny? If this film could not have shown how our comics strut their stuff, you should at least learn about life on the go. It's not even about it. Worst of all, the comics are never really fun. Oswalt admits to how boring he makes a radio interview, Posehn shyly admits how much he shit on a house visit, and Bamford improvises nervously every time the camera is pointed at her, and her humor is only sporadic /> <br / > Sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, amazingly crafted humor, a refreshing change from the mindless entertainment of mainstream comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to undergo everyday routine routines in a below-average bore of a movie whose quality can easily be surpassed by any student movie. If you find Oswalt's, Posehn's or Bamford's performances on DVD, do it anyway. Her talent should be a joy, not just a task as she is here.
