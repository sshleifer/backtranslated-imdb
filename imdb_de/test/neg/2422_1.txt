This movie is probably the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The spectacle is so wooden that a door could have done a better job. The plot is ridiculous and shallow and the actual "rugby" is far from reality. I still do not understand the "haka" as it is portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment. I'm not a kiwi, but I know the haka can only be done by someone from Maori, not a white American. I suppose this was done for the American audience. The superficiality and the "Disney end" are excusable, but there was hardly any attempt to highlight the basic rules of the game, except for the prison side, where the main character suddenly became an American Football game takes over and instead plays rugby. The only good thing about this movie was the credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes putting toothpicks in the eyeballs.
