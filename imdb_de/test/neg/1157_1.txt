The story of Ed Gein is interesting, very interesting. This movie is only interesting because it was actually made. Kane Hodder's portrayal of Ed Gein is so far away that it's not even the tiniest bit of fun. Ed Gein was not psychotic in public, he was very calm and collected and always very polite and spoke to anyone who wanted to listen. This is one of the most important things that the film has not shown the audience. The biggest flaw in the movie, however, was that Ed never killed anyone without being told so by his dead mother, whom he believed spoke to him from outside the grave. He only killed the people his dead mother had told him to do because it was God's will, and he was very remorseful about it, though that had not stopped him from experimenting with cannibalism and human flesh to wear. I officially rated this movie "1" simply because "0" was not given as an option. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to watch a movie that depicts Ed Gein in detail and does not try to put a love story between a police officer and a fictional woman that never existed in a subplot, I strongly recommend that you watch the original movie, which is unfortunately too It does not seem to be on IMDb.com, although I might be wrong, but I do not have to find it here yet. The original does not deviate from the actual events and does not try to twist the story. I can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie simply tried to change the true story itself, something that I find horrible, as if someone had made a film based on 9/11, but he gave him a turn, the Canada was behind it. Or a film from the Second World War, in which it is said that Hitler was a good guy and helped to fight the Nazis.
