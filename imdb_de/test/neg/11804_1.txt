The characters are annoying, immature and flaky ... Madison is the most annoying of all. Ooh ... a cold point! Such a terrible threat! Every ghost in this house would have fled to self-defense! In short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair fly across a room may be scary, but that's as intriguing as it gets. I once looked at it and when one of my kids wanted to see it again, I was tempted to bring a baseball bat to the TV instead of seeing it again. If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this is not the case! The only good part of the whole thing was "the roach scene", and at the end of the movie you were sorry for the roach!
