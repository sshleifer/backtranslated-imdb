My boss at the time and showed it to us at a Halloween party in our office. He is the Chris Huntley who co-wrote it. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad, and we all agree that the monster looks too much like a vagina to be a coincidence. Maybe it was from a gynecological experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> It was a very low budget and the actors were all friends. Nobody was hurt and it was a first try. There is nothing wrong with that. It made us all laugh very well and it's a great movie that you can watch with friends and make fun of him. :-)
