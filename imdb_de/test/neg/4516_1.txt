This is really terrible. I just got a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after hearing good things, and I have to say that was so unbelievably unhappy and bad that it will stun and amaze you as it was ever done <br /> I mean, what was that? Is this typical of the humor of the late 70s? I do not think that's just so bad and believe me, I do not mean "that bad is good". This is a collection of extremely listless sketches, as if you are watching cable TV. Of course, this was an HBO program, and to think that this was considered groundbreaking is scary. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty pretty girl in it, and there are some old NHL shots of the NY Islanders Hockey Team, which is fun, even though I'm a lifelong NY Rangers fanatic. But they even mess up when they try to humor the two ice hockey players shuffling on the ice as if they are "dancing," and worse, they are reversing the videotape of two hockey players fighting for it. that they look like they have sex Oh, how funny! In a little wisdom, there's an interview with a hockey player named "Chico," reminiscent of New York goalkeeper Chico Resch, but he has even worn a Rangers jersey. Well, maybe that was intentional, who knows. <br /> <br /> The end result is "Disco Beaver". It's just so horrible, so incredibly bad, that you will definitely feel cheated after seeing this and wasting almost an hour of your life. You may be wondering why the makers of this garbage might think they've found something funny here, and you're wondering why these sketches can not even come close to the worst Saturday night night run. Incredible. Just unbelievable.
