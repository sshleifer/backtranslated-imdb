... when this movie was on. <br /> <br /> What a bore. An attempt of humor, but it's really not good enough. Some good ideas were discussed, and the actors' makeup and wardrobe were fine. <br /> <br /> I had expected much more, unfortunately I could not get my way anymore, I turned off half of the video and ejected the tape, went to the rental shop to get my money back ...
