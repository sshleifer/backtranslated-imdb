On the sheer theatrical side, Last Stand was great because the reenactments and the soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better reports of this battle found elsewhere that are not so long or so conspicuous, but historically much more comprehensive <br / > Certain little details, like the misuse of the word "Hoplon" for the Greek hoplite sign and the misinformation of various names and words, have really eaten me. <br /> <br /> My guess is that since "Last Stand of the 300" aired on the eve of the movie's release of "300," the History Channel just tried to ride the coattails of the film's hype. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a presentation that's historically accurate in every way, you'll get better luck elsewhere.
