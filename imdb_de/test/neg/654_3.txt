Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it's going to be a cute comedy about a totally obsessed soap opera fanatic. She has no contact with reality outside of the soap (a kind of reversal of the main characters in "Pleasantville") and runs to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, it's a sweet movie ... but at the same time, it's also a dark, very violent movie about two hangmen who want to kill Betty for reasons that are too complex. Either the plot would have been sufficient on its own, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very shocking. I did not enjoy it very much.
