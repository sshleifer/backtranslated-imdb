Brilliant drama, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! That's what I would say to this movie if I had seen the whole movie with a bag of Diarreha on my head. Instead, I experienced a 2-hour crap-o-rama. Our "brilliant" story begins with a few billionaires who have nothing better to do than to search in volcanoes for a futile attempt to find their lucky charms. Instead, he finds a 5'4-inch man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and a few strange cavemen. In his infinite wisdom (along with his infinitely large nose) he decides to enter this volcano with a team of "special" people. To travel to this subterranean land, do you travel by plane? No. Boat? No. They use this huge soup can with a "solid metal drill" at the end where I swear I saw some shaking. In summary, this movie was a faker as ... Oh, that's right! This was the wrong movie I have ever seen! For those of you who have not seen him yet and who are thinking of sitting down with this wonderful place on a Sunday afternoon movie; I warn you! When you watch this movie, you should be prepared to cut any thread from your manhood and give you a full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The rating system allows only a minimum of 1/10, I give -10/10!
