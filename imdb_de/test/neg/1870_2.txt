I do not know why IMDb lists all Ghoulies movies as theatrical releases. They were all direct for video films. The same applies to the Puppet Master series. Why has nobody noticed that yet? Right, somehow you stumbled upon Ghoulies IV, probably from an old, abandoned video store from 1993. You looked in the discount section and found that ... Look at the front and back. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? It is not necessary to critically review this movie. It's the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because ... it was 6.50. I knew it was not a Kubrick material. And I was right. A DVD without a DVD, which contains no extras, not even a trailer, offers an unadulterated film. <br /> <br /> It actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... who really did not get many "big" roles alongside these two films. And I do not understand why ... He's not a bad actor and is pretty fun. But if you play a major role in the Ghoulies films, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiotic buddy Bobby Di Cocco, who despite his very little resemblance to Al Pacino (very small) retains nothing of his acting ability ... A complete idiot that you can only watch awkwardly. Then there is Stacie Randall - obviously a pornstar, I do not have to look up. She looks pretty sexy, although her costume, her character, and everything she does affect the credibility of the films, which is not an easy task for such a movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are the ghoulies themselves! Who also manages to let us down? Ghoulies III made them start talking, no mistake. 1, but Ghoulies IV goes one step further. Instead of being puppets, the ghoulies are actually KIDS in COSTUMES this time !!!! The filmmakers decided to cover these extra mile to offend the viewers. Besides, there are only TWO of them, and they are not the main highlight of the movie because they do not contain much of it. But sometimes they are very amusing ... And this time they are not angry either. <br /> <br /> This is really weird bad stuff, it's amazing that I could really enjoy it. I do not know why ... Part of the black humor is actually funny, although the script is usually effortless. Imagine that Satan's only threat to you is that he will kill you "slowly, painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least Full Moon did not matter this time. Do you have? Yes, a very bad and cheaply produced movie with a production value of 0, but not so bad that he is in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
