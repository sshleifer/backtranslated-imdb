OK, at first this movie was not like the book at all. I read the book at 13 and has been my favorite ever since. When I wait for another book, I choose the time. I have 3 copies for heaven's sake. Anyway, I knew that this would be nothing like the book, but come on! They could have done something better. I mean seriously, if I wanted to see an American werewolf in Paris or London, like watching those movies. They took an absolutely good story and turned it into a copy of a story that was told over and over again, and honestly, I'm tired of looking at it. Hello, the best part of the whole story is that it ends with Gabriel. He does not die. What was it about? And he is old in this movie. Gabriel is said to be only 24 and not 44. Awww And Astrid, who had the idea that Astrid Vivian's aunt was, no no no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Anyway, yeah, that was my little scream that got seriously crazy. hope that helped.
