This is the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced. not even near the first one. The plot was hard to follow - the plot was weak at best. The whole thing looked like three stories trying to tie them together and make a movie. There were a few good lines here and there-and the message was admirable, but they went from Houston through New York to Dallas. It was really hard to say what time frame the current time took. The movie lasted a little over an hour and it felt like we watched the movie all afternoon. It can be, to be honest - but a son should not do everything that Kronk thought was necessary. Do yourself a favor - see Kuzco again.
