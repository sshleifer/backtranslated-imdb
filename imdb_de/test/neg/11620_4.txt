There are only two reasons why I'm watching this show ... I've already spent time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all the alleged sci-fi fans who love the new BSG, give me a break! Read some classic sci-fi novels of true greats, or watch some of the milestone movies and TV shows of yesteryear and you'll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Her only gimmick is "who is the fifth Cylon". Bad writing and really no sense of character development. If Adama withdraws or tries to take power or cry again or discovers the inner father, he would have once more ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is as annoying as any figure ever brought aboard a spaceship. From the airlock with her. I could care less if it took six months to complete. These wannabe writers had no tricks in the first season. If you do not know that, you just can not write.
