"Ghost Son" is the best movie by Lamberto Bavia and at the same time his worst. I assume that this statement needs some clarification. It's his best because it's well-directed, ambitious, accessible, and very stylish, but its worst, because it's a boring, unoriginal movie and undoubtedly a huge disappointment to all true fans of Bava's previous efforts. Let's be honest: many fans, including me certainly, would not have been interested in this movie judging the storyline, the famous names and even the boring title. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who brought us in the past a large number of tortuous Gialli and funny Splatterfilmen. "Ghost Son" is a bit of a comeback movie, along with "The Torturer," and although the latter is definitely not a good movie, it at least lives up to its fans' expectations, with an excessive amount of blood and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and unbearably soft horror movie that even talks about mainstream ghost stories. The emphasis is on sentimentality, and this affects the already limited amount of terrible and spooky atmospheric moments. The basic requirement may be one or two potentially good ideas, but the movie is boring and overly clich√©d. John Hannah and Laura Harring play a happy couple, live on a remote ranch in South Africa and breed horses for a living. The joy and happiness could not possibly improve, so of course something tragic has to happen, and it does. Mark dies in a car accident, but the inconsolable Stacey stays at the ranch, where she keeps in touch with Mark's mind. She even becomes pregnant with her child, but shortly after Martin's birth, mysterious events begin. It seems that Mark's restless and selfish mind "possesses" the baby and uses it to make Stacy commit suicide. With all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and negotiations are underdeveloped and / or unclear, like the whole background of young girl Thandi. There is not enough action and the only real moments of terror are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (vomiting of green goo, self-moving furniture?). "Ghost Son" is a painful misfire, but it must be said, it's a beautiful and enchanting bust. The cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really imaginative and suggestive. The atmospheric score sometimes even creates a threatening atmosphere, although nothing matters on the screen. There are some beautiful pictures of South African wildlife that you can admire. If that interests you, you'd better see National Geographic. Not much to recommend. Fans of atmospheric ghost stories have much better choices to choose from, and hardcore bava fanatics are encouraged to watch "Demons," "Macabre," or "Blade in the Dark."
