I saw this movie some time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I was rejected. I tried as best I could to get the story because a movie had said that this would be a movie that would be For Rob Lowe, this pulp fiction had been for John Travolta ... Well, we can all see that he not only failed, but also fell all the way down. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It's just not even worth watching on TV for free.
