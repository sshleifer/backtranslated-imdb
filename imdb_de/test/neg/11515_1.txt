I literally ran to look at it, expecting a movie that would make me cry or touch my heart. What I found was not heartbreaking, but a lame exploitation of a strong human character. <Br /> <br /> Interwoven between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In an environment that is essentially without sound, not to mention the acting of the most common. <br /> <br /> It was not bad at all, as I saw the worst - and I left the cinema poorer by 10 $, but smarter - that a well-publicized movie is not the same as a movie thats good have been done.
