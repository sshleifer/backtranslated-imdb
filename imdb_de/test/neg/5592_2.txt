I believe that the production value is okay. Probably deserves a 4/10 or 5/10. It is traditionally filmed and shows good-looking people with model quality and some class. <br /> <br /> but the premise leaves me annoyed .. a decent woman would make such a mess? I mean, she's going to marry a man who would have sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> and even more seriously, she is also active in the behavior ... just in de Laclos's mind ... the film also has many aspects that make Eastern Europeans seem immoral <br /> after all if it's just a movie, if it's not intended to break down women in general, I'll give you one more point ... but obviously it does <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a nasty piece of crap with a little taste
