Every movie I have taken as a PPV because Leonard Maltin has praised the sky has thrown chunks! Every single one! When will I ever learn something? <br /> <br /> Evie is an avid Old Bag, who does not think she dies of breast cancer in order to prevail. Laura is an unbearable medusa filled with the Holy Spirit (and her protégé). Between these harpies is caught Medusa's stupid-as-a-rock boy, who was forced into nibble education by The Old Bag! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily lifted out of my discomfort when The Old Bag put her head in a sink, but unfortunately she did not die. I was temporarily lifted out of my discomfort when Medusa was mown down, but unfortunately she did not die. It should be a capital offense to torture an audience like this one! <br /> <br /> Without Harry Potter knocking him around, Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically stick out of his eye sockets. Julie Walters scenery (especially the scene in which she "plays" God) is even more shameless than her character. <br /> <br /> At least this Harold beats Bimbo instead of Maude. I'm really thankful for that. And if you read this maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
