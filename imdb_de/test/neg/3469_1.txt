I can not understand how this picture was taken. It is mostly, though not completely, so inaccurate that the main character does not even look like he physically looks in the story. This movie made me go online and go through my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book in which Nero is listed as one of the most evil people in the world, and the movie made me feel bad for him. I have to say, Aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding of her both physically and mentally. Although the actors have all done a good job, the movie was awful and I'm sure I will not see any others made by this sad team.
