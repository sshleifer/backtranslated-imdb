When we first look at Enterprise, as we all undoubtedly have to do with all the shows, I've been openly busy enjoying about half of Star Trek's previous efforts and disliking the other half. <br /> <br /> The company has come too short, but this episode "A Night In Sickbay" seriously challenged me as to why I disrupt the Monday night shows on Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> Masking an idea that it's one of 'A's Day In The Life' episodes that tells us how certain characters act as humanoids, the authors seemed to forget that this should be a spaceship , not the Ricardoes and the Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially one whose people had previously been insulted by the Enterprise crew (for eating in public), was no place for a dog. As an animal lover, I would never have taken one of my pets into an environment that had been tense in the past. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, constantly presenting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures, as they provide insight into American religious zealots. The aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, but the aliens were quite capable of treating the urinating dog as an insult. Strange how urinating the dog was not considered a form of worship. I wonder how that arrives at the authors of the show. <br /> <br /> From there we are subjected to a captain who has been misled by his duties. Looking at the episode, it was easy for me to forget that Bakula should be the ship's captain. <br /> <br /> He decided to sleep in the infirmary, and from then on we got more dizziness (sigh) than the We should not understand, and that causes us to brow furrow. <br /> <br /> The doctor cuts long, hairy toenails and feeds hungry caged animals. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat creature escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh, how is anyone supposed to sleep with all this? Toenail neckline for loud crying! I was waiting for something to feed on vomit. <br /> <br /> Then, inexplicably, we got the idea that Captain T'pol was in love and maybe masked those feelings with his worry about the dog. <br /> <br /> Endless garbage. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go to sex and you'll feel better." And of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to consider his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are so (all smile very sarcastic) narrow-minded! Saw images like these endlessly blaring on TNG. Oddly enough, the only thing missing in this terrible episode was that this trip person offered her smirks and downhome boyisms with the stupid dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog has survived, so go play now.
