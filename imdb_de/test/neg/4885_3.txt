I test myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to see if watching 3 bad movies in a row could lead to amnesia. I called an English version of this movie. Let me once again call the points Music Score: poor quality, but at least it suits Story: It's about a guy who goes to a city and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for compatriots from a major and he allies with Mexicans to drive them and Trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend them - The last fight scene will confuse anyone who the #### the good guys are. Conclusion: Better than I thought, but I have to go on next I'll see the movie "Universal Soldier" by Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme, who prays for my sanity
