I do not know if that kind of movie was as clich√© then as it seems. <br /> <br /> Considering how many "Bad News Bears" movies have been released since 1980, I think this kind of movie was a tired idea. A former football player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and confined to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offer him a PR job, but he wants to work out. At the same time, his underage nephew is being picked up for armed robbery. We are told that he has been arrested over a dozen times and is now facing some hard times ... which turns out to be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the child is actually a good boy who needs only a tough male role model in his life. The same applies to all children in the detention center. Yes ... including the attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what's going on, so I'll try to keep the rest of this document short. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the coach of the children's football team. He overcomes the cynicism of the delinquents and earns respect. His team is against a local high school team (yes, right!) And they are kicking their butts. He is more determined than ever to prove himself as a worthy coach and calls for a rematch. Will these underprivileged, daring children with gold hearts be able to improve enough to win the rematch? The terrible performance of the football sequences ruined any excitement in this film. "Coach Of The Year" should be punished if I've messed my brain. 1.10
