Let me put this film together for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects. I'm not a fan of special effects, but you have to understand that if you can not afford good special effects, you should not anchor your movie with special effects. Spaceships fire off colored streaks, flicker into stock explosions, and race past moons whose polygons are low enough to count with their fingers. You will not have a clue what's going on. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point you will be spoiled with a drab landscape and illogical, boring fight scenes. Nobody is speaking. Nothing interesting happens. The goals of the protagonist are unclear and unconvincing. This takes about 45 minutes. Then she creeps herself into a hostile base in a five-minute assembly, strapping herself to a rocket, trying to destroy a doomsday weapon, falling out and dying. None of that affects the final direction of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, the chick's memories are essentially transferred to her daughter, who is in stasis for a very large number of years, to learn the secrets of humanity. Then we see the first and last five-minute section of human interaction in the film. Then the new heroine has to decide if she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe breaks down, you can decide if you want to be part of the universe. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT THE MEMORIES OF HUMANITY SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we will not make the same mistakes again, right? If you like movies with characters, this is not a good movie for you. The main roles could be fulfilled by any old wrapping toy that is able to walk the sand through the sand. The entire story is told through painfully boring stories. The film tries to look deep, throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas. There are enough concepts to shoot a bunch of movies, but it looks like it's overflowing with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a montage of 45 seconds. Instead, the narrator gives a backstory story of a novella, without giving us a reason what happens to the characters. People saw movies to talk. This movie does not entertain.
