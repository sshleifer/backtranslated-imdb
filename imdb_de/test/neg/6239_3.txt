Do not look at this movie, look at something else ... I was very disappointed, I can not rate this movie better than 3. The acting was pretty good and I liked William Dafoe as a villain, but I can not understand why this movie has made it to the big screen. The story was old and has been featured in over 100 other films and 1000 TV series / films. The main problem was essentially: Nothing happened. Take a kidnap, have the villain get the kidnapper's wife to deliver the money, make the police look stupid and boring, and extend that to 95 minutes. You have received your "clearing" film. The only two reasons why I did not rate this a 1 were a) Dafoe and b) the "Plan B end". There are not many ends where you can give a hijacking movie ... 75% of this kind ends with the end A, 20% with the end B and 1% with an unpredictable. Boring, boring, boring.
