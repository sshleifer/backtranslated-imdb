What I miss most in this movie is that it leaves no room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary, but not as good as a documentary because it's not a documentary. A patchwork movie without a through story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film already tells you what to think. Too many different issues are raised, but it is not cleared up to think. I do not even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be serious, or a serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is pretty bad. The movie is pretty boring.
