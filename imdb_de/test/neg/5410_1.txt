My wife and I enjoy bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad that they are good. Mansquito was one of them. This one was bad, but it had some redeeming qualities. One wonders how an actor who respects himself has lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" Approaches. <br /> <br /> This is so bad that it is now considered the default for bad behavior. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was the student, the "Indians," who rode in a black cloak and used a SWORD to scream out loud. He shot a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh about this movie, but there were no points where it was not pitiful. We could not find any redeeming functions except one. Those were the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no character development and no sense of the movie. Someone in Hollywood needs to be fired.
