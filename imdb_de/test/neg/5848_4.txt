SPOILERS ALWAYS: <br /> <br /> Not good. The movie was completely different from the book (not that the book was a classic, but it was really good.) <br /> <br /> I think Demi Moore was fine. Actually, I do not really remember their performance in one way or another. The big disappointment, however, was not with Ms. Moore. Why did the person who made the description decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart? (I refer to him as a "millionaire" because he also had a different name than the book version in the movie - just another change.) <br /> <br /> People who did not read the book obviously won I do not know that's different, but in the BOOK version, this guy is much more ruthless and complex. He is also fascinating. The fact that the movie made such a big change changes the whole story. It was almost like watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that MANY movies are very different from books. But I also thought that Redford's character was a bit sissy. This is not the fault of Redford (he is a great actor and could have played ruthlessly well), but without those qualities, he becomes a blind man in love, and the story becomes yet another clich√© love story, the 1 Woman and 2 Men includes. That was not really the point of the book. <br /> <br /> That could have been much better. Even if I did not read the book version, I would not have liked it that way, but if I change that much, there are definitely some points.
