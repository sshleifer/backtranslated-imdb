Derek Jarman has shown us time and again that dialogue is not his strength. He is a painter and he paints. His films are almost always visually great, but as exciting to look at as dry paint. Watch his movies in the fast-forward, the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does little with the script or characters and simply uses them as a grid to hang a very long and well constructed film frame. He even goes so far as to disagree with Shakespeare's original script to achieve those discouraging slow and lifeless scenes. There's no romance, magic, trickery or urgency the script demands, little spontaneity, and especially the character of Caliban is reduced to a trembling and crazy idiot, much like Gaveston in Edward II. It's a pity that this is only the only one Movie version of The Tempest is.
