Let me say in advance that I have lived all my life in Louisville, Kentucky. I grew up about half a mile from Waverly. In the winter, we pulled our sleds down Maryman Road and crossed the Dixie Highway to sledge on Waverly Hill. Many times in the winter of 76-77 we climbed into the tunnel to warm ourselves. The place was still operated as a "geriatric center". We would drive up the hill all the way through the tunnel to knock on the door to the morgue. I have to be honest. The only feeling we felt was that we were coping with something we should not do. I have to say that this winter we went over the tunnel over 50 times. Nothing stranger than stupid teenage actor ever happened. I love the fact that it gets attention after all these years. One evening, when I was young, we looked out of our porch and it seemed that the whole hill was on fire. On the hill was an older hospital that had burned down. It burned for hours as the entire neighborhood sat outside watching. What is lost at Waverly is that many people have survived TB there. Honestly? The doctors did everything they thought was right to save the people. People needed a lot of courage to know how contagious TB was. Too much focuses on those who have suffered. In the early 70s, I came several times in the building. We would visit in a church youth group locks in the nursing home. By the way, the doors there were not prisons like steel doors with chains and padlocks, as shown in the movie. They were made of wood and open, sometimes too open. It smelled of urine and feces, and you occasionally saw an open robe in patients with dementia. It was true that it was shut down by the state in the early 1980s. Much has to do with the age of the building, or the right type has not been paid. This is after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that most scared me off was the pile of corpses into a car. If I'm not mistaken, it seems to have been Holocaust footage. This was added for a dramatic effect. I had a sour taste in the mouth for the filmmaker. I am a skeptic when it comes to "ghosts". I think that many here really find the place to be persecuted. Waverly, however, symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.
