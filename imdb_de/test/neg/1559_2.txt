Aliens lost a huge monster named Zarkorr and sent down a hologram that looks like a normal, stupid teenage girl to tell postman Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie you've ever seen him) that he wants to fight. Even if he loses the facility, fate is lost, so he sets off to fight the intruder against Zarkorr! This movie is bad, very bad. It is so bad that you need negative numbers to give it a rattan. Terribly written, badly directed, well under the Power Rangers inflated wooden game that you are only conjured to a horde of woodcutters to come out of nowhere and cut them down! And do not bring me to the end with the title song. The people who made this silent piece S $ @ # should not be around a camera or anything about movies. Zarkorr is a cool-looking monster that should have been a million times better in a movie than this one. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie, it's about 80 minutes of life. The performers who are there have never worked again. <br /> <br /> 3/10
