What can I say? This was a horrible movie to watch. Normally, I'm not very critical of gay movies in general, because most of them usually have a low budget, but that really pushed me to the wall. I mean, did that happen to gay cinema? Have gay producers and directors not learned from the films of Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee? It was like sitting in a dentist's chair and pulling out my wisdom teeth. I kept praying for moments when I would feel some connection with the characters, but that never happened. Most of the characters' performances just were not very convincing. It was like watching one of those badly produced special TV specials on a local TV station. I can not tell you how very disappointed it was to see this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spelling's other work and the directors recently working on "Latter Day Saints". The wait was definitely not worth it. In any case, I will never come back a few hours of my life and certainly will not buy it on DVD.
