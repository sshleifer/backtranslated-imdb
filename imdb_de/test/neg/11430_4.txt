Irvine Welsh's follow-up to Trainspotting appears on screen as three short stories in Edinburgh featuring Welsh brands, drug culture, depression, the working class and the Hibernian Football Club. In some places uncomfortable to see, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories have a dark comic twist, while the 2nd story is a serious (and frighteningly realistic) conspiracy. Will not appeal to most, including me, to some extent, but will undoubtedly adopt a cult following.
