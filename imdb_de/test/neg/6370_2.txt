I was in grade 6 and this movie was aired in a series called Wonderworks on PBS. I remember sitting on a couch watching the movie, and finally tears ran down my face. In the film, Jesse, the main character, makes an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless mistake one of the two dies. At that time, I found the story very powerful, for the catastrophic mistake is exactly the kind of mistake a child would make, and so it will be very easy for any child watching the movie to deal with the emotional weight of the child resulting tragedy to identify. <br /> <br /> Last year, I finally located a VHS copy of the show. I should probably have stayed with my memories. When I saw the show as an adult, I was absolutely shocked, what a horrible movie it was. My girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie, and she was also pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably have a good memory of this movie when they were kids. I strongly recommend that these people keep their memories intact and not see this movie as an adult.
