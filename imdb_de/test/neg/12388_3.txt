Oh, yawn. Not even a chick movie, where the men are all pigs and even get the women for the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that in this movie everyone is a pig or has a mind. I hated this film for the moral question of why it is right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he did not commit. Is this an immoral act as his mistreatment and cunning? This film shows the situational ethic of bad writing. I saw it in the CBC series Best of Britain. No wonder the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this film was David Tennant. He plays his character so abominably that I probably spit out the next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim but ends up as irresistible as David Tennant's character. They earn each other. <br /> <br /> In the category porridge for brains are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic Brendan. English cops are so incompetent that they can not spend their tickets. The British police union should sue the makers of this film for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the power the DVD needs to watch it.
