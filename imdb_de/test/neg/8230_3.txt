This is a strange movie. On the surface, it's no different from many other D-class Gore films, but in some ways it stands out. First, the main killer character is really funny. How the hell a guy who only gets like a chicken was fired, I do not care. What did this female board member think: "He is totally reformed and rehabilitated". He claps! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script for the women. The daughter is so miserable and seemingly stupid that I would beat her if she were mine. While trying to untie her mother, she struggles with knots and just does not seem to think, "I'll get a pair of scissors or a knife". Later, in a similar attempt to untie her mother, she wanders down the stairs and begins looking for a pair of scissors in a box of scrapbooking materials. Finally she gets a knife. By the way, after the killer has obviously left in the car and just returned. Bizarre. On the positive side, the daughter got her set for the shower scene, which was nice, if unusual again. It seems that in many of these d-grade Gore films they are happy to see throat bruised, but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the audience. It generally worked, but it was annoying and uncomfortable, though the bare breasts made up for it.
