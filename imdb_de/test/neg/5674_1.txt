This show is based on the concept that loud + obnoxious + repetition = funny. The comic writing is nonexistent, in fact I have serious implications, even comparing it to any kind of entertainment. Here is the premise. Two girls are accidentally put on the Internet with their phenomena, and after their first success it comes to serenity. They think that they should make a webcast to show their brilliance. <br /> <br /> OK, where should I start? Let's start with the laugh-track, the often used but never successful reminder that we should make the audience laugh. According to the guys, this show is the funniest in the world. We should shit all charges because the humor we have in front of us is brilliant. The laughter track is serious every few seconds. It may well be that Scooby-doo is used for the excessive use of the king of laughter. <br /> <br /> Then the in-your-face shout-to-the-top-of-the-lung-the-crazy-grouping-of-words-to-silly trick is also applied little up no success. Whoa and let's not forget to create new words to listen to a funny trick. This is web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally the acting. I can not complain. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected by good professional help. Because of the inexperience, Nick should help the actors to define their craft. Instead, the actors are put in front of the camera in the usual way and called "act". Which in most cases are the robotic recitation of lines, the missed timing and the general epic. Do not waste your time. This show is a weak point for all humanity
