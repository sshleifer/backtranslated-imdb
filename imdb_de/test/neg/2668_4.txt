This is by far the worst Halloween movie ever made. Acting is bad, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgetting her name) was fine, but overall, this movie was basically a big letdown. Nothing brought the story forward, it lacked substance and the horror that made Halloween and H20 so good. All in all, skip this movie, it's not worth the rental price.
