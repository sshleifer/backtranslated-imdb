This is the first time that I feel the need to comment on IMDb, to write some sort of review, and as so often happens, it's not a really great movie, it's a really awful one. <br /> <br /> Take the narrative style, the youngest might refer to the Max Payne video game series, a cast of virtually unconvincing (which is not a bad thing in itself), bad dialogues, some dark scenes, but not many , and make a movie of it. Do not worry about the bad acting, the length (far too long) and the lack of immersion (the main character has to be one of the most interesting ones I have not seen in a long time - no matter if he dies) or often ridiculous solutions that they find for certain problems in which the main character is located. <br /> <br /> I would not have written anything if there had not been another review that made 10 stars. I've given it four, but maybe three are closer to what I feel about it. Not only do I not want to see it again, but the mere thought brings me dangerously close to killing me. Oh, and a so-called Noir movie is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The end sounds like it's more suitable for a western movie. <br /> <br /> It's not romance, it's not action, it's not noir, it's not good. That would be my review if it did not have at least 10 lines.
