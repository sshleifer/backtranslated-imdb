POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not a terribly objective review, but I found this movie just terribly depressing. As with Russell T. Davies, <br /> <br />, more questions are asked than can be answered. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) struggles hopelessly against the adversity and perseverance even after an obvious defeat. These uplifting topics seemed strangely absent here. I think the fact that I think about it for days after watching it proves the quality of the program, but the resolution was just too dark for my liking. <br /> <br /> However, I would disagree with the reviews I read that the end feels "tackled". I think every conclusion logically follows from their premise, and the end is a solid personal belief that neatly solves the main theme of the show. Although I had never really questioned the course of events, I felt that much could be further developed. I also read that it was originally conceived as a four-part series rather than a two-part series, and it is possible that the cut has damaged the finished piece. However, these errors occur everywhere, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketchy. <br /> <br /> Davies is not afraid to capitalize, and you have to admire the sheer boldness and scope of these things project. The premise he tackles here is the stuff for movies or novels? It is a courageous and ambitious thing to do in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively hypnotic in the lead. For me he was and remains the best reason to watch. The Messiah's portrayal of humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and engaging, and a true credit to both Davies's writing and Eccleston's play. I also found the portrayal of the reaction of the modern world to the second coming right. <br /> <br /> Well, two stars, simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather rise from my fiction or at least be distracted. I have a whole big real world around me? as filtered by CNN or the newspapers - when I'm terribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons to judge this piece, but I fear my judgment in this matter will be clouded by my emotional reaction.
