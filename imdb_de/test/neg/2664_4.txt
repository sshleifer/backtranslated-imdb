James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees the grumpy boys as the new superintendent of a state reform school. Tepid genre entry where Cagney shows the whole show; He dominates the picture, but only because otherwise not much interesting. Jimmy gives just what he wants from his hard-core personality, which can be satisfying if you're looking for a quick fix. The director (of Archie Mayo, although Michael Curtiz is said to have helped) is straightforward, but without being particularly gripping, although the narrative slips off in the second half and brings the movie to a chaotic conclusion (even Cagneys Patsy gets mixed up). Restored in 1938 as "Crime School" and in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** from ****
