This is really the worst movie I have ever seen. For a while, I've been in the habit of seeing lousy films, including Battlefield Earth, Delta Force Commando, and Starship. All of these films are cinematographic jewels compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> It does not make much sense to summarize this piece of garbage; I think it's better to summarize my reaction to the movie, which reads as follows: I get mad angry and want to rip the tape out of the VCR and burn it after about 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie as 0, but IMDb does not rate a movie at less than 1. I give a 0 when I say that any movie that has a value greater than 0 is infinitely (undefinable) better than this - that's how bad it really is.
