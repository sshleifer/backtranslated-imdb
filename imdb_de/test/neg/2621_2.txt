Retro Puppet Master begins in Kolewige in 1944, when the puppet master Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his living puppets return from fleeing Germany and at an inn puppet master Toulon about his past life and the point at which he shares the secret of giving The life for dead objects was in 1902 in Paris when his younger self (Greg Sestero) directed the Theate Magique. He describes the fateful night when he met a 3000-year-old Egyptian magician named Afzel (Jack Donner) and the eventual love of his life the young and beautiful Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). He tells the story of how Afzel gave the gift of life to himself and gave birth to his own wooden puppets, which were part of the show Theater Magique. The gift of life, however, was also a curse, because the old god Sutek, who was stolen the secret of Afzel in the first place, wants it back and anyone who has learned it dead ... <br /> <br /> In I was a bit like a Puppet Master Bender because I was a big fan of the first three. I decided to see the rest of the franchise. As such, I have Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) & now Retro Puppet Master within a few weeks. Boy was having a hard time getting through them all, especially because it's the worst of the series so far. Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) with his Epoch & Puppet Master 4 & Puppet Master 5: The final chapter. Sutek tries to kill anyone associated with his stolen life secret. Again, there is not much continuity, there is no green serum seen in earlier films. Although Andre Toulon committed suicide at the start of the original Puppetmaster (1939) in 1939, he is seen alive here in 1944. Much of the story is told as a flashback, focusing on Andre Toulon, not the puppets. The film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa & he learns the secret of life. To be honest, everything is pretty boring and boring. Even at just about 80 minutes, Retro Puppet Master feels cushioned for a long time, with no real pace and no central concept, as the action never really calms down and usually bounces around a lot. Then of course there is the amazing decision to make the dolls completely new, which I found incredible. I mean, why would the creators take the one thing that made the Puppet Master films so memorable that they completely stop? The puppets are short at the beginning and at the end, but otherwise we get those plump-looking wood caricatures that are not nearly as cool as their modern reworkings. It was not even explained why these dolls were used and not all that all Puppet Master fans love, even though it is suspected that Full Moon wanted another sequel to deal with this issue. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and a complete lack of our favorite dolls were not bad enough. Full Moon opted for a PG-13 rating, which makes Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master movie that has its own movie rating systems in the US (obviously not rated "R" in other countries) & therefore gives there is not a single drop of blood in the entire movie, the puppets do not kill anyone, there is no cursing and no nudity. This is tamer as a tame stuff for children. Apart from the fact that the dolls themselves are garbage, the special effect is also the largest part of the series, there is no stop-motion animation in it, no CGI computer effects (surely CGI was cheap enough in 1999?) & All effects are stiff roddle-like effects. I mean, whenever you see a puppet "walking", the camera is always over its waiting, so the legs do not have to be shown and obviously there is a production assistant who just pushes the thing on. This is as complex and state of the art as the special effects received. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about Retro Puppet Master is that it looks pretty good. The production designs, costumes and props of that time are really impressive and it's a pretty nice movie to take a look. Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania, which is pretty nice for Paris at the turn of the century. Acting here is awful and maybe the worst of the series. Retro Puppet Master is more or less the last Puppet Master movie next. Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) basically cuts footage together the last seven movies & it's a pretty shitty way to round off the series that started off so well with three outstanding and distinctive little killer puppet films. Do not bother, just look at one of the first three and just remember the good times ... The killer dolls would return with the awesome spin-off movie Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys (2004).
