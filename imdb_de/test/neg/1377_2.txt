Carlos may not be the most original comic, but the first series was amusing, his righteous comments and observations were fresh. I've missed a few seasons, but after all the allegations of stealing material, I picked up a few episodes of Mind of Mencia at the end of July. I see a small change! Carlos is more into toilet humor and sex jokes than to race observations. In one episode, he hinted that he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I do not think so. Maybe Comedy Central will give him another season, but the consequences I saw sounded tired and equal, and more words sounded than the Osbournes. Carlos, stand back a few years, get some fresh gear and try again.
