This film begins with the presentation of a map and then explaining the radar. It takes quite a while for you to see the deadly praying mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50s, this dated piece is a bit too slow and the reward in the end is not very good. It does have moments when the guy from Perry Mason argues with an old man and when he says, "I've narrowed the possibilities," excuse me, but if you narrow it down, you have a few or more options. If you reduce it to one, you did not narrow it down, but you actually found out what it is. The Monster is a standard science fiction fair of the 50s, better than the grasshoppers at the beginning of the end. The acting is below average and the heroine is the most unattractive. In some settings she looks like a guy on the train. You see plenty of fighter planes, stock footage, and other things, but the deadly praying mantis does not look much.
