CyberTracker will play in the near future in Los Angeles, where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson)'s Sen. Robert Dilly (John Aprea) preserves an assassination of a group known as the UHR, the Union of Human Rights on Dilly are because they have led the computerized justice system, in which robots, called CyberTrackers, are sent to investigate the culprits and impose justice. Anyway, rescuing Eric Dilly who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his dodgy activities like the cold-blooded murder of a traitor. That he is the righteous guy he is is not impressed when Dilly kills a woman. he is asked to keep it quiet. Eric escapes and sets off to break down Dilly, but Dilly has many powerful friends and he uses his influence to shape Eric and track his CyberTrackers to pursue him ... <br /> <br /> Co-Produced & Directed by Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give movies a bad name, I did not like it at all. Jacobsen Hart's script is pretty predictable, it does not inspire, it steals most of his ideas and themes from other better science fiction movies, and the intoxicating mix of martial arts action and science fiction is not that good. There are a few fights, some chases and a few gunfights, but it's all pretty bland and forgetful. There is a lack of imagination in the film, considering that the film will be in the future, dealing with robots, technology, the way society operates, and especially its legal system. Speaking of that, the awesome Robocop (1987) blended violent actions and smart social commentary, but CyberTracker does not even try to make relevant social statements or portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement. The script basically uses the concept to have robots and shootouts, which Robocop did well, but also managed to add a good story. There's very little in CyberTracker that I can say was entertaining and that's what films are all about. <br /> <br /> Director Pepin is OK, but nothing stands out, everything is rather forgotten and not particularly exciting. The science fiction elements are nothing more than the robot side and overall the movie does not look so futuristic. The action scenes are fine, there are exploding cars and some shootouts, but nothing special. Technically, CyberTracker is average, for a movie that is supposed to be shot in the future, it already looks outdated and the special effects are bad. The acting was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signs checks with that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing original or exciting here and the action is instantly forgotten. Bad & that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.
