Do not waste your time. One of those cool-looking boxes that you pick up at Blockbuster with a hunch, but that's not worth it. They will NOT say, "It's so bad, it's good." Only "it is bad." The Greatest American Hero is a writer who rents a cabin on the African island, Snake Island. Some other tourists are on the boat leaving, but they do not stay on the island. They just stop there to let the writer go. Then the boat is stranded there and - in true Hollywood originality - the only radio on the island is broken. So they walk around and see a few snakes. Like hundreds of them that got really annoying and they knew the conspiracy would not go anywhere. It's not like there was ONE main line. Like a giant mutated snake or a particularly poisonous king of all snakes. Instead, there are only a few ham-and-serpent snakes of different races. Their only goal was to escape the island ... instead of having to conquer the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, they knew they could not possibly all try to kill them all, and they did not try. I saw a similar film in which a city was pursued by snakes and they led all the snakes into a cave and then blew them up. At least then you have the feeling that the good ones have killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. In Snake Island (by the way, every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island ... duhhhhhh, it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no other plan than to get gas for the stupid boat. Oh, they never get gasoline, by the way. You just "pass" another boat on the island, which is already gassed.
