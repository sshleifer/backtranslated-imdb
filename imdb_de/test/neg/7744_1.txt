Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a smurf. <br /> <br /> And the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite. If you do not believe me, look at this: "Alien from L.A." it really depends on her playing 9/10 of the entire movie! Sure, it ends in a nice red bikini top and a wrap skirt at the end, but that's too little (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls in the center of the earth to find him. On the way she falls in love with a guy named Charmin (yes, like the toilet paper - make your own jokes) and finds out how "Mad Max" rejects life. Did you know that people who live deep in the earth have Australian accents? Neither do I. <br /> <br /> It's bad (after all, it was MST) and also a Golan Globe production, but after all, Ireland is basically looking lost, as if she's trying to find where the photographers are so that she can do a photo shoot instead. <br /> <br /> And I do not blame her. <br /> <br /> A star. If you insist on seeing it, do so with the sound off - save your eardrums.
