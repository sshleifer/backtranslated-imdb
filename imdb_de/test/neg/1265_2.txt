I came across a rare copy of this early Almodovar movie with high expectations - Almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, I enjoyed his 1988 movie "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown," and I had one or two very positive reviews about the film read movie. Well, I must have completely missed the humor that the reviewers saw in this movie. I just found it incoherent, distasteful and boring. Yes, there are many allusions, people in bad and coarse sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almodovar's intention), but much of the shock has probably worsened over the years. leave a limp story. In addition, the entire film was very chaotic, none of the characters was particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - I just did not find this movie funny. I guess it's possible that there's a very select audience for a movie like this, but I'm just not part of this audience and not sure if I want it.
