I decided to watch this movie to fall asleep. It kept me awake, so it was interesting; It was pretty boring, though. <br /> <br /> The acting was good. I do not think one of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as credible as a hit man can be. The dialogue in this film does not give these actors much opportunity to unleash their full potential, but they still shine. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint for the audience. Even the weather increased the mood of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The flaws of this film lie in the evolution of its history. The plot with the mafia vs. Blackbird does not get enough attention. The story of Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI seems to work very fast here. Is there no paperwork for all these processes? Is it really that easy to dig your brother's corpse out of his grave, to burn the corpse, and to be identified as you? There are too many loops in the plot for me to give this movie anything more than a rating of 4 out of 10. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they are really bored and have smoked really good grass. Even if WoW fails due to maintenance, you should look for something better than watching this movie.
