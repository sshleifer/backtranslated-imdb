I wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just screen tests for young and emerging talents. Get a first scriptwriter, an inexperienced director, a few television actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. "When a Stranger Calls" is a little better than most of these deals lately, but is still completely literal; Interspersed with potholes and genre clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simple. The slender 87-minute runtime is heavily staffed with inadequate friends and a pointless, cheating friend. The killer even lacks the symbolic motivation of Jason or Michael or even the murderer of the original film and is therefore never particularly scary. The police behave so unbelievably ineffective and lazy that it borders on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to the process he did with Lara Croft, but his directing style is decidedly generic and has no sign of real talent or vision. The performances are routine, dark corridors replace real horror, and the horrors are of the tired cat-in-cabinet variety. <br /> <br /> However, the cinematography and production design are above average film for this species. The house is beautifully designed, all of dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Although it lacks dramatic originality, it acts as a reasonably satisfying "dark house" thriller and holds the interest longer than most of its class.
