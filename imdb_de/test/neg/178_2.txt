I do not even understand why this movie received such high marks from critics - I've seen dozens of documentaries (on TV) about the wine world that were much better if (if) you see them, please think of two annoying aspects of mondovino: First, the films are just terrible and terrible and annoying: for me, it looked as if the camera had received the material behind the camera and played with it: many zooms (for no other purpose than pressing the button in / out ) For example - - I almost stopped to see it! secondly, the interviewer (the director, I think) is not really relevant: he looks and poses questions like a scout, not like a journalist, even if the general idea and the topics were interesting, too bad a conclusion: overrated documentary, maybe only for people who do not know about wine => not recommended at all (2/10)
