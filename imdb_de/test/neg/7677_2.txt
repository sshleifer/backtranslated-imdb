All the airport movies are stinkers, but this is the biggest turkey of all. The formula was different for this one because it focused on TWO catastrophic flights and a lot of plot on the ground, while the other movies focused on just a catastrophic flight rather than the ground. The stunts with the Concorde are worth watching out for, even though the special effects are not as horrible as I would expect for a movie of this quality from 1979 is totally superfluous (and made me gag for a bit). Poor Martha Raye was forced into a role in which she broke her bowel over and over in the Concorde's bathroom. Compared to the previous films, there are no big stars in this movie, so you have one more reason not to watch this movie.
