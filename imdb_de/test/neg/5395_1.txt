I received this in The Horror Six-Pack by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This is not the worst movie ever made, but it's still shit. In fact, this movie was so hard, I do not know how to write this review, especially since 1. I took it out of the DVD player because I could not even see for another second and Ike comes and knows God How long will it take for me to go through this review? <br /> <br /> The film starts with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artifact and investigates it when this supposedly known as "Skeleton Man" Urban Legend kills him and later his wife. Then ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there really is not much else I can say about this POS, except that does not bother me. I currently use the disc as a coaster. If you see this, you may want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker needed cash ... BADLY! <br /> <br /> PS. I'll watch the movies in the boxset and maybe do a new review on Ghoulies IV.
