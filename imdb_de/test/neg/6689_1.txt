It was horrible, mean and full of the worst clichés and racist clichés I've seen in a long time. Seeing Hayden P trying to play "ghetto" was painful (hello, a trouser leg high on your sweats and a few braids that will not make you "downcast"). As long as Knowles grimaces the whole movie. Most set sequences look like they were shot in cardboard boxes ... What about the finale ??? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to make people see her "act", which she can not. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this Downs movie does not even deserve a star. Please lay this tired franchise to rest. Or at least make the next bring it on IV: Cheerleaders Vs. Freddy & Jason.
