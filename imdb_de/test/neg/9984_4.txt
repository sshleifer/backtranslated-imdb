Although the plot is from the history of ancient Rome, Caligula is not made in the style of episodes of sword and sandals like "Spartacus" or "Gladiator". (This type of filmmaking had fallen into disfavor at the end of the seventies). Rather, it is more like a cross between a softcore porn movie and a nasty video. At least the shortened 150-minute version. I have never seen the full 210-minute version, but judging from the descriptions on this page, it seems to resemble a cross between a hard porn movie and a nasty video. <br /> <br /> As one might expect from a film by the publisher of 'Penthouse', much naked meat is on display and the film lovingly catalogs Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. From the editor of a journal so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle, it may be unexpected that there is as much male flesh as female looks, and in many scenes clearly homoerotic overtones are present. The obsession with sex is offset by an equal obsession by force, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass wanted to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called "Brass" and the scriptwriter of such a bloody movie "Gore.") Characters are killed or mutilated in various sadistic ways, and there is a sexy scene of homosexual rape , <br /> <br /> The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their extravagant lifestyles, so the film's focus on sex and violence is not necessarily historically wrong. However, I wonder if such a concentration is needed to better understand this period of Roman history. Both the fall of the Roman Empire and the gladiator were set during the reign of Commodus, an equally cruel and rampant emperor as Caligula. In no case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mix of "Up Pompeii!", "Emmanuelle" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and both of these films are artistically far better than "Caligula". <Br /> <br /> The acting in the movie is not terribly bad, with some exceptions like the terribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably crazy caligula. (Fittingly, therefore, in the context of this film, the real Caligula was undoubtedly cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill.) The Great Mystery is exactly why so many respected British actors should have agreed to participate in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only lady in the British Empire with a past as a porn star) this was probably linked to her rather regrettable tendency to switch between high blood and slime, but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud believed that they did. Unlike other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always seem quite at home in the movies, but here he dignifiedly interpreted the role of Nerva, a decent and honorable old-school senator. Unfortunately, any attempt of dignity in this film is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill. <br /> <br /> Guccione has clearly made this film a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for the film is questionable). However, the film is successful on no other level, neither as an art cinema nor as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even regarded as erotic it is secondary. 4.10
