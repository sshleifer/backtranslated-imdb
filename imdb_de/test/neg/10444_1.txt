This is one of the worst movies ever. There is a scene where they should be underwater and literally go ashore and add bubbles! The shark is boring and is just that big slow, computer generated dumb thing. Antonio Sabato is terrible, I mean worse than normal. How does this guy work? The director is the worst and nothing is to save in the entire movies. I love shark movies and this just disappoints. I have seen these studios before and all they do is have some stars doing bad work. I would rather see an unknown actor interested in a good story.
