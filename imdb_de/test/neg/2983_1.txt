This was undoubtedly the BAD movie I've ever seen, but when I started it was just like the really bad roadside car crash - you can not help it, you just have to look. My eyes !!! The acting was terrible, the production was terrible, the filming was horrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I was glad that the priest was hacked, he would have liked to do it himself, because he was so poor. I mean powerful acting up to the tenth power. I would have hailed if Chris had only punished most of them before turning it on themselves. And what was WITH that damned wig from hell on his head ?! I sincerely hope that nobody was paid. I mean, if paid here, they should be paid to never try a movie project again. Everyone who was involved, never, never again. It was just a huge piece of garbage that I'm ashamed to say that I only had to watch until the end. Do not look at it, it will be about one and a half hours of your life that you will never come back, and then you need to register on this website to be able to write a comment that I am doing now Make a catharsis to the Aftershocks survive after seeing this movie (and I use the term "movie" here).
