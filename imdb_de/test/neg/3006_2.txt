If this movie had any meaning, I never discovered it. A very depressing film that is supposedly the final evacuation of residents living in a dam area on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no Northfork River in Montana. There are several northern forks, but they are branches of other rivers that divide into northern and southern forks. The opening scene of the film is a coffin teetering on the surface of the lake, but the scene is never tied to history and the viewer has to speculate about its meaning. Much is left to the speculations of the viewer in the film. Another example is when another team of dam employees responsible for evacuating the residents arrives at the dam headquarters, leaving another group of people. An almost inaudible comment is made about these people, which makes no sense whatsoever, and there are no implications in the film to explain it. <br /> <br /> The film is broken down into several stories and the movie keeps switching between the stories, which is quite disturbing. And the stories are funny. In one of them, the inhabitants of a property refuse evacuation because they live in a house built like the Noah's Ark. Another pointless story revolves around a sick orphan dying, and somehow he shares his presence with a house full of ghosts and at the same time a priest in an orphanage. If anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about, the author must have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> The landscape was stark and the sun never shines. There are snow-capped mountains in the distance. I think the purpose was to set the mood. The period is determined by the fact that the evacuators drove all Ford saloons of the era from 1946 to 1948, although the events are said to have taken place in 1955. The acting was mediocre. When I saw the billing for this movie, he said that Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she was, I did not recognize her, but I suspect she was the ghost lady.
