If you plan to rent this movie (hopefully not to buy it), think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun on his head and had to act or die. I'm just wondering if Busey got arrested for anything and was sentenced to a conviction in this movie because I just do not see the man who did so much better in this catastrophe with Keanu Reeves at Point Break. It was a feel-good movie, but there are thousands of other feel-good films that make you laugh without getting your money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could tell anyone that he could rent the movie is to watch this movie, Gary Busey is like a monkey jumping up and down. If you want a good funny movie, drop Quigley and lend Spongebob or something.
