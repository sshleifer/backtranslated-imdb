I saw this movie yesterday in a public broadcaster. They had advertised it as a horrible movie, so I was thrilled to see it, and I was not disappointed. A group of 18-19 year olds went to an excavation site at an old Viking castle in Denmark to discover the myth of the Berserk Vikings. Strange things happen: something is in the woods, and people start to disappear. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie that really bothers me is that the story should take place in Denmark, where I happen to live. There were so many places in the movie where Hollywood style overlapped Danish reality. It made the acting and the drama in my eyes really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interact with their environment. It feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark and takes the movie's credibility. If you ever hear someone speak "old Danish", it sounds just like today's Swedish. Really bad research, considering that the director is from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters of the movie used GPS and maps. Nomatter, where you are, is never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization. And if you are in a castle, you will be tourists everywhere. We see many reviews of forests in the film, and sometimes we see the North American vegetation (?). The story has not really touched me, maybe because the acting was so bad. When the characters see the moor creatures for the first time, they are not afraid. I guess their acting skills were not enough to show realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected twist, but that did not impress me, since I did not really care. <br /> <br /> The moor creatures are cheap but they have the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail because we see them well in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. There are also no really scary scenes, as the swamp creatures usually just stand around. Anyway, Conclusion: If you ignore the facts, the movie is the typical B-horror movie. I think people from other countries can enjoy it more. As long as you do not know reality, it does not matter. Just as I imagine the US as a big action movie, everyone else can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle ... and some living dead in a moor.
