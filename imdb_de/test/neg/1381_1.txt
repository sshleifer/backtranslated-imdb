Besides being a liar, this guy is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once, when I tried to look at this excuse for a TV show, I think I actually puked a bit into my mouth. I can not help feeling a little stupider every time I watch one of its horrible commercials while enjoying great comedy programs like Reno 911 and the American Body Shop. It turns out that I have to worry about the persistence of humanity. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan makes someone look like an idiot. Please start praying now that Comedy Central recognizes its mistake and ends this show as soon as possible. Did not we suffer enough?
