Don Wilson plays a starring role as Jack Cutter (a really tough name!), A vampire hunter who faces a vampire army. You see that the story is slightly different, as vampires can not be killed with silver, crosses, or sunlight, but by snapping their necks (How convenient if it limits the budget) and it's here Cutter meets a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III Fame) The action sequences of Night Hunter shake during the fight sequences for no reason, and although they should emphasize the mood, it is important makes the film only harrowing. What's worse, these combat sequences are unimaginably botched, as Wilson's martial arts is disguised by disjunctive editing. Of course, most of the interest comes from the fact that this is actually in front of Blade, but the problem is that this was done on a small budget and Don Wilson was there. It's from Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a movie that most people would NOT pay for. Unfortunately, I am a bottom feeder and look after the department of the store, which is looking for gems. In this industry, you always come across shit. With Night Hunter I might just have the stinkiest crap in the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (Awful)
