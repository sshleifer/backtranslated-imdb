I have seen "professional" reviews claiming that Julia Roberts herself was "smart and very funny". I do not think so. An actress who plays herself? And to deal with her usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird's narcissism in its utmost form. Why does not she just stand there and go, "Me, me, me. Look at me!" The director and the author should be shot because they have not thought of anything better than this could have been in a sexy sequel. And by the way, Steven, if the audience pays more attention to the weird camera angles, then history has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras, but they were so talented that they did not lose the audience in it or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a basic rule of filmmaking in the name of "Style". However, the chemistry of Pitt and Zeta Jones is pretty good, if they had focused the film more and omitted the narcissism he might have been able to do. Once again, Zeta Jones shows how she has more talent and beauty than Roberts could imagine. Unfortunately, this movie wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back.
