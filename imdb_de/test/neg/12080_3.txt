<br /> <br /> This movie was produced and released as the sequel to a terrible, if rather popular slapstick California beach comedy called Hardbodies. However, he has little or no connection to the earlier film and is better judged in his film own right. It's certainly better than Hardbodies I and is more akin to movies like Venus and Summer Lovers, which were filmed on the Greek islands during the summer. The combination of beautiful beaches of blue bays with beautiful, bare bosom provides seductive contemplation, but (apart from travelogues that are only meant to plan your next vacation), even such films require a fair plot when they catch the attention of the Viewers for more than a few minutes. Venus was underpinned by the legend of the goddess's reincarnation, and Summer Lovers had the viability of a menage a trois theme. In my opinion, these two films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very weak history and is too dependent on the simple semi-slapstick comedy. The use of slapstick quickly becomes boring and usually results in a series of very short stand-alone cameo sequences that are difficult to integrate into an ongoing storyline. Mel Brooks did a great job with Silent Movie, but few other films did it the same way, but Hardbodies II did not. There is also the problem that the slapstick sequences are not happy to interact with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the movie plays. Undoubtedly, the recent airport sequences were a fun ending to this movie, but in my opinion they are an example of the worst kind of slapstick pseudo-comedy. They are also grossly overrated, so I left the movie theater with a bad taste in my mouth. This is a movie that could be much more successful with a stronger storyline and most of its slapstick sequences are severely curtailed. As it was released, this certainly does not guarantee a viewer rating higher than 3. <br /> <br /> The acting is not memorable, but the cast does its best within the limits imposed by a meager storyline and a bad direction - In these last areas the error occurs. <br /> <br />
