Another premiere: This French film is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Maybe I'm a bit premature in saying that this is probably my last Rohmer movie, but the way in which Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never come to the point immediately rejected me. There's a scene in the movie where the characters talk about love, which I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how hard I tried, I could not understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded by Cinephiles. He seemed to me one of those obnoxiously neglectful people who are filled with hot air. If this is an example of what his films are about, I'm not interested. I do not care about French cinema (usually reflective and speculative for a mistake), so maybe I'm biased.
