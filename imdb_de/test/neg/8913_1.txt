I love seeing Steven Seagal movies, not because of the action of the big storylines, but only because I'm made to laugh. Oh, it makes me laugh so hard that this movie made absolutely no sense and is ridiculous in comparison to Pearl Harbor Rocks movie !!! and Ben Affleck do not need an acting school at all, just to give an idea of ​​how bad it is. It's only getting worse than when Steven tries to get out of jail. A helicopter first lands the security message and they lead them ashore when they suddenly flee and a security guard shoots. <br /> <br /> or when he killed this guy in the car, he can both go away and you can go away No oil on the ground behind him. Steven notes that there is oil, without even watching Treach pull down a lighter and the car explodes. <br /> <br /> and there are many more fools that Steven uses when he uses someone pointing a gun at him, he reaches for him and shoots him totally shit !!! as if some gangster ever let that happen. <br /> <br /> Acting is also much worse on the fight scene in the outskirts of the prison. You can see that Steven is clearly waiting to take action, just rewind and rewind a couple of times. You notice the bad drama. <br /> <br /> It just makes me laugh. I hope one day it will be in the Netherlands here in the cinema. Then I'll go there with as many friends as possible, just to laugh myself to death
