Oh dear, just what we need is another Essex Camney garbage effort that documents the rise of the British hooligan / rave gangster who naturally followed West 'on (East Londan / Essex style). Did not anyone tell you that they won the world cap? And then, of course, the inevitable decline into the underworld of British rave culture. Blah blah blah. I do not know why and who wants to fund a film like this, but let us pray that it comes from private donors (see former drug dealers, merchant bankers - we all know how to call them, and the rest of the mockneys). instead of publicly funded funds. Hopefully we will not see something like this with the recession. If we do that, we'll call the death knell for British movies, and of course we can all accuse Britains of the Mockney Country Gent wannabee gangster Guy Ritchie.
