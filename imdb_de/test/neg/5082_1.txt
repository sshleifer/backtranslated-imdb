Honestly, I am amazed to see that this film gets relatively good reviews. I'm completely honest and say the only reason I ever made it is Ryan Phillippe, and not for reasons that are particularly related to his ability as an actor, though I think he has been in recent years Besserer has proved very successful in showing off his first major roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As far as action / suspense movies are concerned, this movie fails in almost every way. The drama is alright, I suppose, but the script is absolutely terrible and does not make much sense. This is a fact that the filmmakers try to obscure by absurd references to the chaos theory, as if it convinced everyone that the film is really smart '- but then, as other reviews show, there were some. Do not be fooled: The script is a boring, distracted mess, and no other element of the movie makes up for it. Wesley Snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a movie, and Statham is a thoroughly boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
