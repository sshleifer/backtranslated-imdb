Thursday, June 9, 6:45 pm Broadway Performance Hall & Saturday, June 11, 1:45 pm Broadway Performance Hall <br /> <br /> Bless the Independent Filmmaker. Without them we would only see the brothers Spielberg Farrelly and films based on old sitcoms. They are the risk carriers. They reap the rewards of success and suffer the failures. Max and Grace are definitely a loser. Michael Parness deserves credit for coming out and making his first feature. He could better stay on stage if this movie is an indication of what to expect in the future. Although everyone warned me, I went to Max and Grace anyway, hoping I could discover something they did not. It's starting well, a party for Max at his parents' house, recorded in warm, subdued light, with the camera floating in interesting angles. As soon as we see Max hanging himself up, an obvious rip-off from Harold and Maude, the whole thing goes right into the tank. How could he do this unnoticed at a birthday party? How could two mentally ill and dedicated psychiatric patients decide to marry and do so with the blessing of all concerned? In the questions and answers after the film, David Krumholtz suggested that the entire story is the surrealist dream of his character Max. This story is so poorly written that the comment sounded more like an apology. The film does not look like it was made just a bit, so the more reason to be so disappointed by the results. What's meant to be funny is not obviously bad. The continuity is sloppy, the lighting is terrible and the effects are cheap and enforced. BPH is under three hundred and was surprisingly full, but I saw at least thirty or forty strikes within the first half hour. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, laments her inability to die. I thought I was thinking the same thing, as I never went out before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks that this is "one of the best screenplays", he has ever read that it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources. This is the worst independent I've seen since Bubba-Ho-tep.
