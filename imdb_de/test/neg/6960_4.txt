A subtle but overrated dramatic thriller, the film seeks to portray the out-of-control inner demons of a tortured artist. The problem is that not a single on-screen relationship is believable and the plausibility seems to have been thrown out the window. The title character is so hard to relate that it's pretty much impossible to imagine one of the characters on the screen who are emotionally invested in it. The conclusion is also quite predictable. There is certainly enough evidence from the beginning to pinpoint where the story is going. The film decides to completely suppress the belief in the situation or the relationships, and the film itself is well played (especially by the lead roles) and manages to build a nice tension throughout the story. As a metaphorical trait, there is some food for thought, and if the script had been stronger, there would certainly be potential here that could be better utilized.
