"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in strange behavioral sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds its way into Smallville, Jonathan Kent is the first to be affected. The flower causes people to reverse their behavior, and when it affects Jonathan, it becomes ephemeral and violent, but Clark manages to prevent him from doing any rash until his father finally faints. in order. So far, so good. Next is Lana. The episode was good up to this point because the flower causes her to seduce Clark. At the last moment he refuses, but the damage has already been done. This episode causes false impressions and is not suitable for people under the age of 20 due to their adult content. The first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect of the flower on Pete) was good, but the middle, which was about Lana's alternate personality, was extremely defiant, and that ruined what would have been a brilliant episode can. I give this episode two.
