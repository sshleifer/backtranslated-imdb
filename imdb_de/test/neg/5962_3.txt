This is a great example of a great movie and a great idea, but it turned out to be really bad. I was mainly tempted to get this because of the DVD cover, stupid me, but I did it anyway and was literally blown away. Essentially, this film is about El Chupacabra causing havoc in Los Angeles, and it's up to a local animal police officer and writer to save the day before two corrupt policemen and two evil scientists demolish them. The main reason why I did not enjoy this movie was that there were big continuity mistakes that were hard to notice. Aside from a bit of bad acting, good light, and nothing sinister, this film did not hit me as much as it probably should. However, compared to other Chupacabra films, this is certainly only close to the charts. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity in this movie is gone and I mean from the shoulders to the ditch. There were so many points where the characters said or did something, and then they did not do it in the next shot, or the change never took place. A typical example: The main character has a weapon, the Chupacabra attacks, he tears a sense out of nothing and distracts, and the weapon is missing. The girl runs while defending here with the mysterious flair, and she had no weapon, then the main character runs with the girl and has the gun. Where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun? The time of day is messed up. It's sunset in a minute and you can still see the sun, and the next minute it looks like midnight. There were a few storylines like in, why was the Chupacabra there, what did the scientists do, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it was still alive? These things fucking pissed me off and none of the questions were answered. <br /> <br /> Next up is acting. Boy it was wooden and bad. The main character Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems to be too quiet in some ways to find out what a few dogs have killed, and when a tragedy occurs, his emotion just was not there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty bad job. She was the author of a bestselling book about the Chupacabra and did not seem to mind her role or performance. Her acting was somehow ridiculous and poor. Even for an author, she knows too much about this thing and knows how to disable a high-security system in a hidden lab. Tony Criss was fine, but he seemed to calm down a bit for what was going on. The movie reminds me of a bad reenactment of a murder mystery show in which the actors and actresses are not so attached to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie I could not help but respond to the lighting hard. I have taken a few times out of the movie because the lighting was so badly directed. There were times when they tried to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make them more "comic bookish," but they backfired. The worst part is at night when it's black outside, but the scene is so oversaturated with light that it looks like a day. They keep changing from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes, and the lights are so bright that the actors blink. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows at night. During the sunset, when the lighting was perfect, this was the only time the light was good, otherwise it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no fear in this movie. There was only one point when I jumped, but otherwise it was not scary. There were points that might have been scary, but it was so damn bright you could see the Chupacabra approach the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. Even the creature design for the Chupacabra was bad, it looked good, but it was a small man or a child in a jump suit. They did not hide his face; They showed him without mystery or enigmatic appearance. There was a lot of blood, but it seemed unreal. This movie was just not scary, that's all. <br /> <br /> Overall, they have made a great South American legend into a bloodthirsty human eater, which is not the Chupacabra. In fact, it was afraid of humans and it only killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said to hate the smell of humans. But would the story be then? I did not enjoy this movie for any reason, but I give them credit for trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if you like indie or B movies, you should check it out. If you are easily tempted by cult classics, you would enjoy this movie. I have not seen it, I will not see it again, but in a deeply sedated way I enjoy this kind of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
