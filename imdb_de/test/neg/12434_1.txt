Larry Clark is not known for his talents as a writer or director, but he has made some indisputably important films. Children, Bully and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park all fulfill their intended purpose: shock, disgust and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in content and use their controversial character to uncover very serious problems in modern youth. Children have us the dissemination of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the adolescents. Bully touched similar problems. Ken Park was shamelessly engaged in sexual abuse and suburban boredom. Irrefutible, all these films revealed something terrible and left a bad taste in the mouth. Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from the south of Las Angeles who are arbitrarily going to Beverly Hills for skating. That's it. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has an essentially nonexistent narrative. And like kids, there's a cast of actors who are part of the movie for the first time. However, unlike kids, none of them have any talent. It's better to act in porn. This movie undoubtedly contains the most terrible performances I've ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark having to expose these young men to the film production process, but these kids are absolutely scary dignitaries, folks. I'd like to add that these gentlemen also seem to have produced the soundtrack that includes some of the most inappropriate garage punks you'll ever hear afterwards. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, it's not like they have a lot of script to work with. Every line that is uttered is a fictional, pathetically transmitted and irritating measure. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts quite well, but quite unexpectedly turns into mere absurdity. This, of course, starts with a moody sexcapade with two rich white girls, followed by a series of clich√©d encounters with National Lampoonish, characters killed for no reason, and finally a ridiculous anti-climax. The recordings take much longer than necessary. Be prepared to watch people fall off skateboards for about fifteen minutes, making extra long, long shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding on the streets. On the other hand, they need as much unusable filler as possible on nearly 32 pages with the script. Maybe Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film. <br /> <br /> I could go on like this anyway. This is the worst movie Larry Clark has done so far. For those of you who want to see a Clark movie, if only for its shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. This is by far the toughest movie he's ever done, and it's the worst. It is terrible. Like Uwe Boll terrible. In any case, the worst I have seen at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
