This film must have done well at the box office to give Gator the necessary budget. This movie had no budget, required a new script and a better ending. There are highlights in this film. The boating scene, Burt drove the mean machine and his conversation with his parents. It can be said that Burt is a Southerner and not an actor. This movie shows what Gator would be like, Burts best movie. Unfortunately, this film did not have the same funding and was made in a hurry. 4.10
