I am at a loss for words. This movie can not be described. I do not think there's a language on earth that describes a word of how awful this movie is. If you try to look at it, you are left with the "surprise ending". I only made it about three-quarters of the way through this crap before I could stand it any longer. Luckily (or unfortunately) a few of my friends stayed until the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a few weeks of therapy they could inform me what I had missed. This film has no story, no plot, terrible writing and even worse acting. If you enjoy train wrecks or car accidents, this movie is for you. I think my IQ dropped by about 30 points if you see this (please explain here).
