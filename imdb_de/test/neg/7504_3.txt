In the near future, a dark stranger enters a zombie-plagued South American city. Our stranger gets to know the harsh realities of city life with a group of friendly people. There are two groups of people; The upper class, who is safely behind the concrete walls of the city, is provided by the state police at the right price. Then there are our friendly residents. This underclass lives next to the zombies. There are only means of survival to exchange goods that they use during the day with the police in exchange for food cans. Our stranger discovers why his world is plagued by zombies. A new diet pill that suppressed the craving for carbohydrates was the foundation. Mankind's desire to lose fat caused the decline of society as we know it. These pills increased the desire for protein, d. H. After meat, even after the pet poodle. However, there was another serious side effect: after the death of humans, the craving for protein became stronger again, namely for human flesh. <br /> <br /> With what I consider an ingenious introduction, I felt that many in this film recognize some inventive material. What better way to explain the cause of the zombie race than a contemporary notion of people's desire to make sacrifices to change their bodies without the hard work of the gym? However, the fantasy of this film soon stopped after this exhibition. This film falls into the old trap of "I can not imagine what the world will look like when society collapses." If you watch this movie, do not escape into a different world than if you watch Planet of the Apes (Original), Alien, Mad Max, or Texas Chain Saw (Original). In this film, the alternative society is defined by people whose hair is orange and green. Leather jackets for facial and charity shop. In this alternative society there is no hardness over life, only healthy faces and coated zombies. Movies should allow you to escape, and do not remind that you need to clear out your wardrobe and bring your old clothes to the charity shop. Forget about the pathetic acting or the over-zombies. This film fails because it is too polished, too congenial and too predictable. I've seen such films since the early eighties. If you want to make a film of this kind, you should once again watch movies like Dawn of The Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci's Zombie to see and experience this feeling of despair in a ruined society.
