The film is rated 3 because he dared to be so different. It has a cast while you can hear their thoughts and wishes! This is really a funny movie and an experience that I will not forget. The only problem is that the experiment, while in some ways interesting, is generally rather boring and incoherent. It's amazing that a movie by Norma Shearer and Clark Gable could be so boring! The film is based on a game by Eugene O'Neill, and it does seem amazing. In fact, it would have been best to keep it as a stage production - it just was not being transferred to the big screen. <br /> <br /> So this movie is only for die-hard cinemas and those who love Gable movies so much that they only have to watch their movies!
