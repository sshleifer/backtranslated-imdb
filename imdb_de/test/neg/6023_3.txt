Promotions for "Clubbed" project a smooth-looking movie around the club scene of the 1980s. What we end up with is a film with identity problems. The negotiations are ultimately taken over by the spectators, who are believed to be the main plot. Therefore, the focus on this film focuses mainly on "clubbing" and remains in the gutter. <br /> <br /> Boxing, Depression Self-hatred, gangsters, bouncers and drug deals are all hurriedly compressed in 90 minutes. No less than four times I had to check the running time of the movie as the concern grew that this movie would disappoint. <br /> <br /> Which club scenes we see are bland and repetitive About 3 extras dance in a "club" that is hardly recognizable as a "club". The mood of the day is barely caught. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about the club scene of the 80s, it's similar to what "Human Traffic" did in the late '90s, "Clubbed".
