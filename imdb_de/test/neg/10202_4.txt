... looking for the hottest movie "It's so bad," I kept laughing at the first fifteen minutes of various films, only to be disappointed and bored in the end. Not this time!!! My eyes tore open, my stomach and cheeks hurt because I had to laugh so hard throughout the movie. Sure, Hulk Hogan is a minor actor and the storyline is completely predictable, but everyone dives into this movie that knows all this - all that everyone wants to see when renting is that Hogan has a can of Whoopass with a bunch of "YEAH BROTHER "erupts. s and "WHATCHUGONNADO" flies out of his infinitely bitchy mouth. And while the Hulkster on the screen fades somewhat in the ring compared to the Hulkster in the ring, the seekers of the ultimate cheese are certainly not surprised by this setback jewel. A laugh uprising.
