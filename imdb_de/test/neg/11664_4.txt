Everything you do in this world should make a little sense at least. Unfortunately, "Delusion" makes little sense. Jennifer Rubin is appropriate in her role as lead singer of hit song Kyle Secor. Secor, however, acts to the point of harassment. Jim Metzler, the underrated yuppie, is incredible as a freshman, revenge-seeking opponent. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she has carefully hidden, the credibility flies out the window, and the weapons that point to a final showdown between Secor and Metzler are ridiculous. Avoid "delusions," unless you are insane enough to believe the wrong reviews here. - MERK
