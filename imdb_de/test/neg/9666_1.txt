I got it for my birthday in a box called Broke Skull. After I had looked at one on the DVD and was pleasantly surprised, I threw in this jerk. It was worse than I expected and I did not expect much. This movie is basically a kinky story about a guy who dies and is brought back to life with the mob. There were some interesting ideas that were never followed up. Now everyone has said that there was a lot of gore. Can someone tell me? I saw a bad effect when a head was crushed, brain tissue (or something ...) and blood came out of the area of ​​the penis twice. I have to say that the part where the guy had his hooded man bruised me, that was the only good thing about this movie. And this gay sex scene was simply thrown in for no reason. Acting was really cruel, it blew. The Asian chick was annoying, then the annoying Mexican friend who came in just to get killed. I say that if you get that in a box, that's fine, but do not spend any money on it.
