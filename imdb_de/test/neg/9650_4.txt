This film is a shame, especially considering that Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but a professional director. However, this film does not provide everything you could expect. <br /> <br /> First of all - I am Polish, so I can tell the whole back story, because I read books. But how can you say that there is even a war in this movie - a lot of people are going back and forth, some soldiers screaming ... This is really World War II or soldiers are on vacation? <br /> <br /> Drama and Dialogues - poor, miserably poor. A.Å»mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest of the (Polish) occupation is outside the square (in particular M.Ostaszewska, one of the main characters, what an unfortunate choice) , 99% of the dialogues are not spoken, they are just there, the performers had a hard time playing something, and it's no surprise, considering what strange things they had to say Problem - you can not feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling in it. There are a lot of original World War II recordings and, you know, the material is much more powerful and dramatic than what A. Wajda did. <br /> <br /> Despite historical mistakes I can only see a positive effect (like the acronym ZSRR; it was made for purposes of propaganda after 1945 to please Polish that ZSRS was gone and now there was ZSRR, but Fortunately there was no ZSRR in 1940!) Fortunately, Katyn's killing was undoubtedly carried out by Katyn's Soviets (yes, it's a fact, not a controversial gossip). Great, two hours for 5-10 minutes scene. <br /> <br /> However, time and potential are wasted. This is a tragedy of epic proportions, the will to fight (barely shown) in 1939, not to explain to the Polish authorities the war against the Soviet Union (sic! Not shown here), shortly thereafter capture of soldiers living in the outrageous conditions (not shown here). , Hope and fear, what will come next (barely shown), and then ... annihilation. Hand in hand with Germans - The Soviets destroyed a Polish nation that targeted people who were the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, they succeed and the results are still visible today.
