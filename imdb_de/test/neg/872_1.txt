We thought that this was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to see the end. The romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made little sense; it was a failure; and the scenery was absolutely stupid, either because (in my opinion) it's like the ADAMS FAMILY GOING ON THE HOLIDAY ... just scary, gipsy and cheesy; and the OUTERBANKS does not usually look like the houses at the surf; and who would spend the night in a hurricane if it were not for her. It was not realistic either. Hurricanes give you plenty of time to contain the hatches. <br /> <br /> Even the friend was superfluous; and did not fit the story What had the civil war ever to do with the outside banks? I also have to mention the wardrobe ... did D. Lane have to wear a scarf / pashmina / scarf in every scene? It was exaggerated. She looked good enough not to hide things; without making it obvious, as in light pants. <br /> <br /> Finally, I am worried about the impact on our landfills, if everyone needs to have this stupid body, and I mean the STUPID movie !!!! Do not fall for this hype !!!!!! We made. Not even to see.
