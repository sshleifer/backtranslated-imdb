Strangeland is a horrible horror / technology thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer geek who prays in the chat rooms to young girls. His ridiculous philosophies about pain and suffering are wrong and completely unfounded. There's no connection to reality with the ideas presented in this movie, it's more like Dee Snider sitting down trying to figure out the craziest things to horror fans and maybe some of his old fans impress, but the end result is just awful. <br /> <br /> For me as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and immediately caught my interest, which was the main reason that I tricked it. I assure you that this is not a high quality horror movie. It is a disturbing but boring attempt to suggest what goes on in the minds of people who treat themselves as Carleton Hendricks did in this film. The sad part is that nobody makes this stuff for themselves. Marilyn's Freakin 'Manson does not go that far and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the movie was not meant to make fun of his kind of music (that would be a hit on Snider Himself.) It's more like Dee Snider was trying to rise from the career dead and present himself as a sick person again. Dee, it seems the time has come to let everything die ...
