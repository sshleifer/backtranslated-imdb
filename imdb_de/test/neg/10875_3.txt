Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved in this horrible movie. The drama, directing and script are all third-rate - the entire film plays an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop to hang up. The only reason it's ever done is most likely because of its connection to QT. The plot of the movie is quite thin and basically tries to survive on not so obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos of people like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each of them is listless in his performance, especially Hopper, who is in the paycheck at this point in his career. The salvation, if there is one, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to find the trademark of Tarentino, and fails only miserably, which sometimes can be quite funny and a bit scratchy at others. I would only check that if you love bad movies ... or if you really like biker movies.
