Back in the cold and spooky early 90s, a show called "Family Matters" aired and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a manual in normal family situations and their solutions, and put in some attempts to make sarcastic remarks a pretty little theft is wrong, parents are right show. That worked out well, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: to do the same show again. <br /> <br /> Here's the difference: "Family Matters" had grandchildren. Nobody has seen the guy from this "kickboxer" series "Step By Step". He says things like "Dudette" and "The Dane Master," and somehow the audience still does not want to hate him. I mean seriously "dudette"? How can you even get that over the lips? <br /> <br /> The rest of the crowd consisted mostly of white versions of the entire Winslow crowd, combined with some one- or zero-dimensional characters, such as the Fools Guy (JT Nun, Eddie), the Smart Girl (Laura) and a pretty girl who spends her days (theoretically). The character development was terrible in this show. Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. All have only milked their stereotypes, which they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> Driven by a huge laugh and jubilation that was stolen from you, this show was aired for 7 years, which was humiliating for the competition. Although 'I have to say this was the time when Family Sitcoms were pretty much all big hits. Everyone just ignored his crappyness, because it was in the 90s, another shitty show did not hurt.
