That this film has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our time after Enron, do we really need more memories of America's obsession with greed? The subject is so politically charged that many viewers are not only entertained by films of this kind, but will react with barely concealed anger. It was all I could do to move quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without taking the DVD out and smashing it into a thousand pieces. They claim that behind the glitter is a meaningful message that makes the movie worthwhile. In "Purpose" I have found no such meaningful message. What I found was a story that idolized the materialistic traps of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, who are disgusting in their glibness, do little work. Instead, they celebrate, they play golf, they stretch out their coolness, they sound "hip" with dialogue as in the MTV culture saying, "rock my world" and "go back to the party, that's an order". John is complacent, confident, shallow and smiles a lot. Robert, wearing funky glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film features two teenage garage freaks who look and sound as if they were straight out of the movie "Antitrust" (2001). Stereotypes are presented for everything they are worth. This movie also features chic-looking computer equipment and Barbie doll chicks for the occasions when our future billionaires need some relaxation after all the heavy party. And with the time-bound images and dialogues that such a story requires, can you imagine how outdated this film will be in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> About the best I can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid say it has some nice aerial shots of San Francisco. The movie would have been far more enjoyable and entertaining if they had given up those vile characters and this disgusting story and just flown us viewers in this small plane for the duration of the movie.
