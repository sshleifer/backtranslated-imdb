Usually I can tolerate twisted films, but this movie is really a sick obsessive, selfish movie! <br /> <br /> First, the author / director is a completely selfish guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all. Second, he is also a sick pervert, manipulating and poisoning the minds of children! I can not believe my ears when I heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the children! <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but fell victim to Eric Schaeffer's filthy, little-known movie! <br /> <br /> And what happened to Eric Mabius' good-looking face? I mean, he met this girl he should marry, but he was not in the wedding! In fact, there is this bald man in his place! Has time really gone so fast? <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this movie unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by a sick Eric Schaeffer!
