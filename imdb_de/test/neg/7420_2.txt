Developing films based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge to directors and scriptwriters. Above all, they have to reconcile reported testimonies, contradictory sources of information, and Hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can access. Unfortunately, none of these things seem to happen to SASQUATCH. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the typical film Noir, when a research team landed by plane somewhere in the Cascades. From there, the research team disappears, and despite attempts by law enforcement officials and local rescue teams, they remain missing for some time. While one of the passengers leaves, infrared-like images are sprayed onto the screen (a la Predator), which subtly indicates that the legendary Sasquatch is causing the fate of the passengers. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the accident victims. Knowles puts its own search and rescue team, along with the explicit mission to find its daughter and the rest of the research team, along with the invaluable technology that was lost during the crash. The team is assembled, the entire film goes through the path more unpolished Characters, dizzying cinematography and a completely unoriginal plot. I literally had to avoid falling asleep during this movie as he tried to scare me out of my mind. The only member of the cast who could assert himself was Henriksen, who can not compensate for the lack of depth of the other characters. The exaggerated sound effects were also annoying; Basically, I did not know if I saw a movie about bigfoot or grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Also the plot was not great. It was too underdeveloped, as the viewer is exposed to the typical fear music that can be found in a similar genre. Of course, you did not have to be a genius to find out who would take off all his clothes in the middle of the movie, or who would be the first unfortunate guy abused by Mr. Sasquatch. As far as there are good points, there are none, and that's why I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 points.
