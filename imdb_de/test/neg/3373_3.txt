-can contain spoilers- <br /> <br /> Who made this movie, of course, must have had many connections. I just can not help it. What really surprises me is that nobody used the name Allen Smithee, and it was all the more surprising that everyone did not use that name. Anyway, where do I start? The bad dialogue, the lousy costumes, the sad-looking film set, the unwanted comedy, the exaggerated characters and more inconsistencies than the college career of George W. Bush. I do not know what was funnier, the guy lost his arm because of a snowball or the slow-motion scene where all the babies of Jack Frosts were killed. In this film, one of the great lines of all time was voiced. "How do we know it's him?" As if there is another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camp movie, but overall a very bad movie.
