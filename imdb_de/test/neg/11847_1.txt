This film is a failed, stillborn attempt to assemble several bad movies and make a particularly bad movie. It also fails because there is far too much "conspiracy" and not nearly enough dumb puppets and ridiculous bubble. Seriously, the dolls are cute and the guys in suits are doing me pretty good. The performances are at best C-grade and lame throughout, with special props for the spec ops type that spoke a kind of bizarre East Coast / Venus dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that it really matters to you what he says, since only the curse words are different. Cinematographically, it's not offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent-off-video innards (just like the script). The fact that New Concorde used footage from the "Carnosaur" films is offensive and rather confusing. For the shame, New Concorde. To shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my most horrible favorite movies and they messed up and made it almost unsurpassable. Watch the "Carnosaur" movies if you want to see the slightest dinosaur chaos. <br /> <br /> I give him a star because I like the movies he steals from, and also because the scale does not have zero.
