After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I could not quite understand why so many people liked it. It was not "heartwarming" or "smart"; it was just an amalgam of any other "inappropriate person who came together during a vacation and learned something about each other despite their ideological differences," a film that has ever been made by blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals - and they never do anything else as what everyone expects when characters act in a movie like this. The black mother explains that it is "okay". Then, when it is mentioned that there is another black character in the church, rather than preparing for dinner (because all black people love the church), Hispanics only seem to be able to speak Spanish when others greet or make exclamations The lesbians only make cuddles and kisses (and one of them wears a scarf, because all the lesbians like Ani DiFranco dress), and the Vietnamese family owns a video library. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "What's Cooking" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of what they should call Thanksgiving dinner. The black mother wants cornbread, macaroni and cheese, the Hispanics are rolling tortillas, the Vietnamese family deep-fried spring rolls; I am surprised that there was no bottle of Manischewitz at the Jewish table. All of this is reflected in the tradition of "musical montage", where they play Surfari's "wipeout" and quickly switch the instruments of the melody to reflect their respective cultures. Is not that cute? As soon as the director is done with the determination of the diversity of all people, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, like all people of all races, religion and culture, have in common, by inventing implausible and too dramatic conflicts for the individual families , It would be a plot killer to mention what these conflicts are, but rest assured that these are actually surprises if you slept in the first half of the movie. The topic "Shame on the family" is pretty strong. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're the kind of person who enjoys these novel films that revolve around the stories of unusual characters intertwining. Well, you still will not like this movie. If you want extended food mounts to be passed around a table, you will need to put this into your Netflix queue. However, if you like clichés and clichés, be sure to ask for Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
