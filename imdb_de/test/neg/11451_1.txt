*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much to say about this early epoch movie. (I hesitate to call "Cimarron" a "movie" because I feel the word is too esoteric.) But what you can say about it mainly speaks against it. <br /> <br /> Take for example the excessive use of Indians as a bad people. In one scene, the little boy from the lead role of the Streicher - a presumptuous and too ambitious family man who wants to build a newspaper business - plays outside his father's office. An Indian kneels down in front of the child. "Hello," the boy says very politely to the Indian. The Indian gives him a pen, gets up and walks away. Yancy Cravat, Jr. runs excitedly into the office. "Mom mom!" he shouts and holds up the gift of the Indian. "See what an Indian has given me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" she snaps the boy. "You will never talk to these dirty Indians!" Yancy Yates, senior (Richard Dix), looks like a man speaking with a forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a clear plan to help his family live a better life. However, we realize early on that he is not a great achievement - let alone a completely moral man. His slave child Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is a telltale sign. On his family's first walk to a Sunday morning service-one in which Cravat is supposed to preach-Isaiah tries to come along, dressed like Cravat, long-tail suit, halter, pistol, and everything else. Cravat asks him to go home. "You do not want me to come with your church?" Isaiah says with a pout. <br /> <br /> "No!" Cravat corrects him and pats him on the shoulder. "You do not understand, I want you to stay and guard the house, and if anyone comes, shoot him!" <br /> <br /> The characters - not to mention the actors - in "Cimarron" could not move out of burlap despite obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too praiseworthy. (Admittedly, the incomparable Edna May Oliver - infamous for playing the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland, also released in 1931) - actually looks good and distinguishes her portrayal of a pompous old woman, which was also the best known for.) But other than that, well ... Yancy Yates is not popular in town from the first week he arrives, <br /> <br /> and one of the outlaws decides to shoot Cravat's white hat when he and casually passing his wife (Irene Dunne). In spite of her anger at the man who fired the ball, Cravat just goes completely off the track. <br /> <br /> Not only is this story not "realism-oriented", it's also very <br /> <br /> missing in some key areas: eg Cravats newspaper is never really seen. (Bulletins and posters, yes - but no newspaper.) <br /> <br /> Maybe weird of all: This is in a small town in Kansas. But for some reason, Yancy Cravat is embarrassed at <br /> <br /> "The Oklahoma Wig-Wam." Really good westerns have always been very few and far between - the only exceptions are the so-called "spaghetti westerns" by Clint Eastwood of the late 60s to early 70s. Cliche Westerns are about a dozen dozen. <br /> <br /> If you like Cliche Western, "Cimarron" will make you proud - but as for me, it has embarrassed me. <br /> <br />
