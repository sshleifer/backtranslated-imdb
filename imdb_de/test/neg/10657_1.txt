... without anything to go. This movie begins with scenes in China with the finding of a newborn. This is not a new concept, but I would not give up immediately. Then there is a flash forward to youth. The wife and the child of the husband are tired of the father, who neglected them. While this did not seem culturally correct and the film did not move to develop these characters or the purpose of the adoptive father's devotion, I continued. <br /> <br /> Next we're in Malibu, where we're bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low budget (fill in the space: drama / camera / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will not divulge any more of the plot since I assume that it is a summary exactly: the film is supposed to show how a Malibu girl does (although she allegedly has compassion and interest has to help others, when she asks her teacher immediately after traveling to China) is spoiled and ruthless, feels like a healer and helper of body and mind. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm admittedly a fierce critic, so maybe take away one of those LAMEs and you're under scrutiny.
