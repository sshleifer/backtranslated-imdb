I really wanted to have this movie - it had a film festival and an All-Star cast at the beginning of the year. But (and you could say it would come a "but"), it's a movie failure. The outstanding character of Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by the editing and the antics of the minor cast. Turturro's performance is lackluster, and most of the comedy is dubbed. The recurring puppet shows are useless and some scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> That means there are wonderful moments in the movie. A really touching stage moment, some of the seductions and some comic colors actually sound. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by the diffuse, incoherent writing and a bit of bad drama.
