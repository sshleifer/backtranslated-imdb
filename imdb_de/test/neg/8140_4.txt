It is a story as old as man. The jealousy of the woman and the possession of another man. There are even bids against it. <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Burr ("Perry Mason", "Ironside") is the manager of a runner plantation that yearns for the owner's wife and feels he is not treating with respect. The woman, the star Barbara Payton, who was making a comeback after a series of dirty affairs, worried about Burr, who killed her husband Paul Cavanagh. <br /> <br /> But lurking around was a strange woman, the housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek), who sees everything and the voodoo was able to avenge the perpetrators, which included another young woman (Carol Varga) Burr, to whom Burr also confessed love, is poisoned and believes or will he become a gorilla. Payton will have to mate with Kong if she ever wants her marriage done as he goes to the jungle every night. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable. But the moving question of this movie is why Payton would ever be scared. With these sharp-edged missiles sticking out of their chest, no animal could come close to doing any damage.
