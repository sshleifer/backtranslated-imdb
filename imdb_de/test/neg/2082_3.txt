The Greek locale for parts of the film was very nice and the photography got all my votes. That's about the extent of my enthusiasm for this movie. I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in American culture that were shallow and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to see, but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikely for many other reasons. As Gena Rowlands sings at a party, I wondered how this woman could see herself as a competent stage star. I was tempted to press the MUTE key until she was done singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia's character was so hot that he was downright scary. The film was too long for my taste and I could not stand it even at the head of a gun.
