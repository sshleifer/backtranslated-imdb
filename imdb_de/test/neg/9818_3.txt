Essentially an undefined B-movie that is mysteriously directed by one of the great talents of the golden era, Fritz Lang. Even with the star names Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders you have to adjust to a ridiculous plot, bad acting, obviously wrong sets and misunderstandings. For the sake of transparency, I have to admit that I am a passionate non-admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate enough to have found a niche in the MGM's dream artificial factory and somehow worked in supporting roles to Greer Garson and others support. He's a wild miscast, acting in a chipper, 30's Ray Milland's crazy comedy, in a role where his life is in danger and he's hiding. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is exaggerated, but her lacquered hair, perfect make-up and classy outfit are a fake street-side cockney slum girl. George Sanders is incapable of bad acting, but disappears when Pidgeon, after an absurd opening, somehow proceeds to shoot Adolph Hitler. The unevenness of the tone is surprising for Fritz Lang. I found the film uneasy between occasional moments of suspense thriller, surrounded by carefree comedic interplay. Hitchcock completely reversed the relationship and used the comic relief to occasionally release the tension. There is a reason why this film is unknown. It served neither the career nor the reputation of another and is forgotten because it is a surprisingly bad movie from such a pedigreed group.
