Now and then an indie comes with a great cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can not be missed, but the movie is shit. Some recently released films belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety Of Objects", and now there are "The United States Of Leland" Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the juvenile son of a famous writer (Spacey), who commits a disturbing and unpardonable crime (murdering a backward child) but does not remember it and seems to have no motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in a youth hall, trying to understand Leland (and using him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see their deteriorating relationship (because of their heroin addiction) as a flashback. Sounds like a great little drama, right? I was thinking the same thing. <br /> <br /> The fact is, this movie is just bad and badly written. The dialogue and the narrative are painfully overbearing and laden with irritating platitudes about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie clich√©s, and though Leland somehow manages to be sympathetic in some ways, it glosses over his crime. <br /> <br /> Mostly there is no problem with acting. Gosling (who was Oscar-worthy in "The Believer") is a hugely talented young actor, but as they are written, none of these characters (least of all Leland) even feel like real people, so he can not murmur much just his ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen. Even if you play a signed character in a bad movie like this one, it can break your heart at a glance. If she has good material to work with (as in "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Life of the Altar Boys"), she is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> But that's not good material. After a major overhaul, it might have been valuable, but "The United States Of Leland" is cumbersome, sluggish, and for a movie that seems to be in love with Deep, it's really flat.
