In terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst Roman movie I have ever seen. The list not only of mistakes but also of action ideas that are not possible, would take longer than the three-hour film, but only to give you an idea ... Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal democrats representing the page of the people against the nobles. That's obviously absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could be. Their interest was to consolidate power and stabilize a country that had been destroyed by a 150-year civil war. There were reformers, especially the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years ago and to some extent defended the rights of ordinary citizens. There are several scenes that are absolutely ridiculous if you know something about the period. "Cleopatra," along with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how events have evolved, fantastic as it is. Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue are different, and this movie is dangerously close to being a bad junior high school production. I laughed several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of Augustus, meets a lover. They cling passionately as she breathes, "My father ..." "Ah, your father, your father ... your father would refuse." Peter O'Toole is the worst, forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is such a fog - and the character is written as such - it is impossible to imagine him as the cunning, cunning, Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he is just a pity to say what most of the time is to do. Charlotte Rampling manages to appear dignified as a signed role as Livia, Augustus' wife. If she had been given a broader role, she might have saved that production from absurdity. <br /> <br /> There are a few beautiful photos and battle films that are supported by numerous standard CGI titles. Strangely, this was done for British television (and it seems to be a British-Italian co-production), but was rated "R". <br /> <br /> The DVD image is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, though you only notice it in the few action sequences, as the movie is mostly talkative. <br /> <br /> Almost every Roman movie, even "Cleopatra" or "The Fall of the Roman Empire," has more historicity - not to say compelling drama - than this bizarre Classics Illustrated, Jr. adaptation. This gives a new meaning to the much-used phrase "based on a true story". In that case, they could have said, "Suggested by real events."
