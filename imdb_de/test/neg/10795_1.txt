I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I enjoyed it sooner. Either way, it was not a bad movie. Certainly, it sometimes moved a bit slowly. I liked it. <br /> <br /> As far as MST3K is concerned, they only made the films for which they got the rights. Not all movies where bad movies were torn up, it was easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker, for example. <br /> <br /> Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where I was so inanimate and boring stupid that I could not help but laugh. I could not take her seriously. However, it has really created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script. A world that today is better than 95% of the garbage in the theaters. Her role was well played. Not to scream, not masculine, but just right. The camera really likes them in this movie. I would have cast her in that role after the script was done. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a bit more recognition than it gets. Please note the uncut version when you see the MST3K. It has earned so much.
