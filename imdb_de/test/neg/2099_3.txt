Looking back on 2006, one of the things I remember most is the Snakeamania on the Internet for a movie called Snakes in an Airplane. But I did not know that there was a "DVD" rip-off movie called Snakes. After seeing this, I feel best as a below-average B-movie. <br /> <br /> The plot: <br /> <br /> A husband and wife get on a train to go there to Los Angeles, to get help from the husband's uncle, who is a shaman , This is because the wife's family does not approve of her marrying him, and that's why they put a curse on them, that snakes "will" drive them to Los Angles and a group of passengers, including a former Narc policeman and some drug dealers. Will they arrive there in time before the snakes take over? <br /> <br /> Watch the movie: First the effects: I have to say that some scenes with the smaller snakes look bloody good, but the most important effect shots have to wait eighty minutes! Unfortunately they are so bad that they do not kill good memories of the movie (The movie makes 198 video games look like T2, beside it!). One of the things I noticed is that there is no script credit in the movie! and the directors make the movie so anti-climatic that it ruins the whole movie. Final view of the film: <br /> <br /> A below-average B-movie with an incredibly bad ending.
