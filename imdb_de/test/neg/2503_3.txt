Impressive. I felt I had to rinse off after looking, but maybe there were other reasons I would leave to your imagination. I felt used and abused after the shaking, I mean, watching this movie. Hairy breasts, thick mustaches and well haired, everything describes this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can not call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without hair. <br /> <br /> A horror movie that bites. But as a piece of exploitation / porn from Italy's rich film history, it definitely has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish it had the really badly synchronized English, I think it contributed to the already existing cuddly factor. The only white man put in the movie is "Mark Shannon" - he's the mustache with a hairy, broken-up part of the machismo that really tries to perform every time he "hits the bat". This was the end of an era when porn producers actually wanted something artistic. There's nothing like moving the camera from a tropical setting to a hairy man having sex with a doggie-style woman. I can not help but laugh. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that my future wife and children will never find.
