The first season of Bones is set in Finland and I can not believe how much bullshit this show brings - the characters are flat, poorly judged and awkward. Or actually CSI without a coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails because of the lack of director who could not escape the actors from the show's essence. It is really sad to see that a show throws everything away, as it would have been a relegation show with only a pinch more. From the beginning you have the feeling how awkward the acting is. Long History Short - Do not waste time with Bones.
