This movie did not do justice to Mr. Bachchan. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed in the movie and there was not much conspiracy. It is a fact that this is the first movie in which I was disappointed with him. It starts with her coming home with his daughter and he is a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden. He is a sixty-year-old man who has nothing to do but photograph this girl. The movie does not make sense. The whole movie is about her, how she chases him around and how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl in places, so she does not get bored and daughter finds out. I just did not think that movie was Bachchan's standard. He is better than this movie. I have always portrayed him as a righteous person and then I saw him in this movie and could not imagine him in this movie. The movie did not hold my interest at all. I could not wait for the movie to be over. And you will not.
