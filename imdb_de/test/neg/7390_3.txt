"The King is Alive" is a flawed and thought-out mess of a movie that looks like a self-serving apology to the author, transporting a bunch of actors into a godforsaken Namibian desert, playing Major Dogme Domo and filming his selfishly designed films It can be stupid, reworked drama with complete disregard for the real powers of human nature, the attractiveness of the market, common sense and even good art. In other words, this is a baffled movie, and if you do not believe it, you will be watched by your penance. Only for movie heads, critics, dilettantes and the like. (D)
