I saw "Gristle" mainly because of the presence of Michael Dorn when I enjoyed his Worf performance on Star Trek TNG, but never saw him out of his makeup. Dorn seems to have a nice presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. However, this movie was a small dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can actually use the word "F". <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie was made by someone who introduced himself as a striker-thinking guy with a social conscience. Yeah --- for 1965. Today the topics are so hardworking and so demanding and persistent that even Spike Lee's awful "Bamboozled" looks good in comparison. <br /> <br /> This thriller has a complicated doppelganger, triple and quadruple cross, but the plot scheme is so complicated that it breaks down in the first 30 minutes. Mostly, after that point, I just looked out of the moment and a little curiosity about how each scene would evolve. There is a great cast here - you will recognize virtually anyone as a character actor from much better movies. Why are they all there? I suppose it was 1) the work and some money, albeit modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social contacts around LA - you know, maybe they've joined to support him, as a movie buddy fighting on the third and fourth levels of the Hollywood scene. No idea ... but the movie was half finished - not really "ready". I gave him a 3, though my affection for the actors involved was not worsened by my admiration of her earlier work. Let's hope that since then, all have moved to more professional, careful and thorough projects.
