Most of the films I really like are art-house dishes and rarely appear on the top ten lists of box office. Nevertheless, I found "Northfork" completely incomprehensible. I have no idea what it was all about. Stephen Holden once wrote in the New York Times about another film and once remarked that some people seem to think they could throw everything on the canvas and make them look like fairy tales. I thought about this review several times while seeing Northfork. <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave him two.
