This is the first and, as far as I can tell, the only complete production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before he started on "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles shot test footage for a version of "Heart of Darkness" that was completely filmed in what was now to be called "POV", where we would see everything from the point of view of Charlie the main character Marlow; he would only be glimpsed in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The movie was never shot. The "POV" technique was not used too successfully in "The Lady in the Lake" in 1947, with Robert Montgomery playing the lead role as Philip Marlowe. Presumably, the coincidence of the two "Marlow (e)" figures is just that. Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was of course based on "Heart of Darkness". <br /> <br /> The short novel "Heart of Darkness" by the British writer Joseph Conrad, who was born in Poland, was first published in a British literary series. The magazine of 1899 contains one of his favorite alter egos, the ship's captain Charlie Marlow, who also wrote the Short story "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, who is temporarily unemployed, chooses a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of King Leopold II, The Cruel Congo Free State. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs with the company, and is told to take a boat up the Congo River to a remote inland station served by one of the company's most prolific agents in the colony, a German named Kurtz. is cited. The deliveries of ivory, latex (for the production of rubber) and other products from the Kurtz station have been discontinued, and Kurtz has not got word for quite some time. There are rumors that he has become "at home". Marlow is to investigate, take necessary measures and report on his return. He walks along the West African coast to the mouth of the Congo, is delayed for weeks while he has to repair his boat at the company station on the coast, and finally makes his way to Kurtz 'station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, all demand its stamina, its imagination and its mental resources. He finds Kurtz sick, half crazy and close to death. The last meeting and the death of Kurtz are almost an anticlimax, especially since Conrad is so unclear what actually happens that we have to leave it to ourselves. This is a novel in which you make the book vaguely dissatisfied with the end and yet appreciate the story because of its amazing atmospheres. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed with Guyana in Central America, which stands for West Africa. It's best that the novel is the most disadvantaged: Actually, First World city people show what a boat trip on a tropical river would look like. But the rest of the movie was forgotten. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but so much of the character's plot, characterizations, and relationships have been altered beyond recognition to make one wonder why they bothered. If the goal was to make Conrad's story for the screen, why did not they leave her alone? It is unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie. However, so many changes have been made that I had no cinematic authority for you to wonder if we're dealing only with incompetent screenwriters and cameramen. The most disappointing was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely miscast and plays the role simply. Everything about him is wrong: his appearance, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a true German, like the character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I would only recommend it if you have read the book if you want to rely on more than just your imagination to get a picture of a boat trip on Congo around 1900.
