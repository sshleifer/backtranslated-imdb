Last year, in the year 10 of Australian history, I was forced to see "Changi". Both classes looked around the classroom. All 40 students were almost asleep. All 40 heads on the table whispered to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that being only 16 years old and not counting my mind after studying World War II, I was not only embarrassed and ashamed when I saw this Australian garbage television. I was completely lost in the horrendous efforts the miniseries made with the use of film elements. The drama was bad, the script was very inaccurate and the score was awful. Please do not look at this movie, it is biased and very racist (for the Japanese).
