In the early days of human civilization, cavemen sat around making lame jokes, beating their heads with anything they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently had tails once. These cavemen lived in a geographically very different region with cockatoo, camel, monkey - but no women. This film tells of the "funny" mishaps of seven (or so) cavemen who have burned their land with the new discovery of fire. They wandered on the water to a new land, where they find this woman with the extra tag. On the way, we get such "great" moments of comedy as a fat caveman swallowing a frog that is constantly cawing in the stomach. A monkey throws stones at the head. A man swallowed a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. The obligatory "gay" caveman. The list could go on and on. This movie is the definition of cinematic filth. I was bored from the beginning, and it only got worse when the cavemen stumbled around, beating each other, making bad jokes like puns on the word perch, beating each other, and abusing poor Seta Berger, who looks like she has a job lost to a producer appear in this nonsense. She is indeed one of two points of light in this film. She's not a big actress so you have to guess why she's an asshole? The other "bright" spot is the music. As soon as I heard the score, I told myself that it sounds very familiar. I had never heard the actual music, but the music was unmistakably that of Ennio Morricone. It's a beautiful score and the best in an otherwise raw, boring, unsightly, unimaginative and ridiculous film that essentially involves a group of Moes finding a woman for the first time and wanting to eat her like an animal first, what she teaches could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I suppress a yawn as I relive the plot! At the end of the film are about 100 mostly naked women on the canvas with the erotic feeling of pulling a scab from the knee. This movie was painful to sit in and offers no real merit. The fact that it produced a sequel does not surprise me, as it offers the one thing that will arouse the interest of the audience - tail.
