"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I have ever seen! The support is not only weak, but also the characters. I'm sorry to tell you Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've ever seen in my life. I'm sorry, Edison. Her role in this movie was disappointing. Edison does not fight at all in this movie and I'm sure if Kazaf was not in the movie, the storyline would not be much different. The main feature of the film is not nearly explained enough, and the entire film focused too much on the growing relationship between Helen and Kazaf. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yes, he is the prince, right? So what! <br /> <br /> Certain scenes in this movie were just stupid. Yes, the action was great, but the whole outline was stupid. In a scene towards the end, Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... Yes, it seems now that he has grown up. Why should you wait until he's attacked? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures who persistently followed them. How can you be so na√Øve, not knowing that they are vampires? Around them, people with bite marks on their necks die; The NEWS would certainly be faster than you can say "vampires". <br /> <br /> The characters were another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is the girlfriend of Kazaf. What girl is not afraid of vampires, especially if it's your brother's job to kill her? I can bet you would not find a brave girl like Helen if you were looking all your life. Helen is annoying, bitchy and is a total drama queen in the movie. She tries too hard to be different and ends up failing. One of the craziest and most disturbing characters I've ever seen in any movie. Why bite someone on the neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that her reaction to Kazaf's confession does not scare him off. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid figure in the story. How humiliating for a young actor to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. He does not stand by himself throughout the movie and does not fight. Although I'm a fan of Edison, I do not want a man lying on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Her love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is beautiful and does not try as much as Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the movie. A conspiracy failure was the death of Reeve. The film had absolutely no substance, but it was doomed to fail by removing one of the only endearing characters. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story did not focus much on him, making the desire to get Kazaf's "Rock" irrelevant. <br /> <br /> It's very sad, because I felt compelled towards the end of the movie, because I wanted to see Kazaf fight like that. The end was so abrupt because I had been so great all the time. Kazaf, the supposed vampire prince, does not do anything for the movie and I'm sure if it were taken out, the movie would not be much different. I strongly recommend that you do NOT waste your time as much as I do. I was very disappointed. If you are looking for a great movie, check out Lord of the Rings or Pirates of the Caribbean. Lovable characters with a well written plot.
