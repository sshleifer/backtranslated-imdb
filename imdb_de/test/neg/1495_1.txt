A number of teenagers gather to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has turned up and kills everyone. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst horror movie of the 90's, Camp Blood (1999) is the only movie that could challenge it for this title, has some of the dumbest characters and situations that ever adorn a TV screen. The so-called surprise ending is as terrible as the rest of this movie. Mild entertaining at such a bad level is good. My rating: 2 out of 10.
