I can not explain what kind of garbage this movie is. How can I really not. It's just so bad. <br /> <br /> plot = Mist Acting = Mist Budget = so low it's ridiculous <br /> <br /> Jesus, it's like the only good thing in this movie the fact the main character was pretty hot. <br /> <br /> The only people I think this movie is good are the ones who participated in the movie. I am sure that they did not finance the funds because no money was invested. (HAHAhaha to a bit where the heads are shaved) <br /> <br /> This movie has already wasted too much of my life, so I will not waste any more time writing my review.
