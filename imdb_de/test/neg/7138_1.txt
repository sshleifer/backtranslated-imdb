What a horrible movie. This movie was not okay and so hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and it was just confusing. Throughout the time I looked at it, I wished it would come to an end! Save your money and do not borrow this movie. I see now why Sarah Michelle Gellar was hardly in the movie. The first movie was great, but that was just shitty. I would never recommend this movie. Save your money and watch the trailer, because it's the only thing that can be seen with this movie. This movie had no real story either. I still wonder what I saw.
