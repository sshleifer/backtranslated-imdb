That was a shame for the game FarCry. I had high expectations, but all ended in a nightmare. Apart from the bad effect of the visual effects, the plot itself was the joke of the movie an absolute flop. The movie is not worth it at all. The funniest part was when the girl came and kissed Jack to give him the key to the handcuffs. I think she has the keys to the handcuffs all the time. I hope a good director will one day make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie. And I'll invest some good money to get the visual effects right, and the right scenarios, and the right ACTING. But until then, do not waste time trying to watch this movie, because it will certainly drive you crazy, especially if you are a FarCry lover.
