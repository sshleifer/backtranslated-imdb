Two years after this short film, the last short film "Our Gang" was made. After seeing this, you wonder how long it took. The quality of "Our Gang" was struck shortly after the move from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short film is a perfect example. The gags are all very listless, and Froggy's last line of this happiest day paints a bad picture of how it feels to him during the rest of the time. A very bad example of filmmaking.
