As mentioned in other reviews, add another of the countless alien clones, this time with a great selection of The Terminator, and add a little bit of the classic SF story "Who Goes There?" Add The Andromeda Strain (seemingly flashing red lights make extinct killer droids unable to detect frightened people standing three inches from them). OK, the story: After a series of people running around in a spaceship and killing each other, we get a caption. <br /> <br /> "25 years later". <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station orbiting Mars to be relieved in 48 hours will discover a ginormous spaceship on a collision course. It's The Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. It was not a good time to take everything useful at the relay station offline to do some repairs. The approaching ship does not deviate from its course and sends a "DO NOT enter this ship under any circumstances!" Warning. After shouting at each other, the crew of the relay station mended something and just got the station out of the way just in time. But the ship changes its course and rams it in every way - it pokes one of the crew on a pointy crew thing. The satellite loses integrity. Relieve bits. Much more screaming and running, in which only two crew people are sucked backwards into space. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked back?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, Techy's wheelchair user (who's the only joke in the movie as a "wheeler") is convinced that the Siberians have to take all their strength from them and have them go on board turn off the engines. They all go on board and take off their helmets. "DO NOT enter this ship!" Apparently, going on board the ship means exposing yourself to potentially deadly infectious diseases. A team leader goes to the main computer room, where a dead, frozen guy is found who sticks to an American Express card, but turns out to be a minidisc. The other team finds some switches. Surprisingly, it turns out that the dead guy is the father of the attractive female crewmembers who are most likely to survive an encounter with a raging alien. They shut down the engines, but the ships' reactor will explode. A scary point of view shot starts killing people. In Siberia, there are some dizzinesses that have discovered a new ore, a small energy source worth millions, which means that the bolder members of the crew immediately risk themselves to get hold of it. The POV shot returns with whoosh! rushing! Sounds on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, you have the idea that the killer wears a corduroy pants and the effect is wasted. After that, everything just runs around and gets killed in the order of ugliness and theatrical abilities, until only the obvious survivors survive - along with the cute dog who managed to kill at least two crewmembers. Why space-hardened veterans in search of their pets, cats and dogs, wallowing in the claws of certain death, has long been a mystery to this type of movie. Other silly highlights are those who have forgotten to alter the sinking levels of oxygen until they are reminded by the voice of the onboard computer (not that the low oxygen levels in any way dampen the impressive fires that start these idiots). If the killer Droid is smart enough to steer the ship in a tight corner and ramming the relay station again, why does not have the option "DO NOT enter under any circumstances, this ship!" Warning signal .. I'm sure there were more people looking to kill than GO GOAY screaming! was not a good way to think about it. Musetta Vander is the only person allowed to play - all the others are constantly flicking their noses while exposing their teeth and nudging guns at each other. It's that kind of script; Full of exclamation marks - the only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the screenplay demands that she take off all her clothes or get wet if she does not wear much. Unfortunately, not one of the things wrong with this movie (besides putting more cyan on the screen than any other movie) is the fact that there was no unnecessary nudity.
