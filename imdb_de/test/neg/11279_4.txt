For a film made in Senegal, loosely based on Carmen, the book by Prosper Merimee, this film seems to have no resemblance to the story that has become famous as opera and other films. <Br /> <br /> Ms. Gai as the title's champion is very good to look at. Her fiery dance shimmers on the canvas, as is the case with her hot love scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a Karmen that should please all genders, but she is not a real Carmen! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films where her talents are better used than here.
