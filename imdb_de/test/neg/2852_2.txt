This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I gave him 2 out of 10 stars is the appearance of the gorgeous Lydie Denier in some scenes. Despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every way, her nude bathroom scene with Armand Assante is as hot as hell. <br /> <br /> In any case, about the movie, nothing really interesting to say, a neo-Nazi and a Turkish gang In Berlin, you fight in scenes where people shoot openly at daylight on the street, and in a club where There are 30-40 people with machine guns in a location no bigger than my house, and amazingly, after only three hours have thrown ten. Ten are injured LOL. <br /> <br /> While the gangs are fighting for Berlin's teri- teries, a serial killer kills young children and paints them white in various parts of the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as a Turkish detective who, though now working for the police, was a former leader of the Turkish gang and is now in the process of solving serial killer crimes. <br /> <br /> The movie is obviously a very bad rip-off of the classic M-movie. The killing of children, the involvement of the underworld, the character of the serial killer and the final scene with the serial killer's "attempt" are more than influenced by this classic film. <br /> <br /> The drama is awful, the script is just stupid, the production of the lowest standards and in general this was a big waste of time and money. <br/> <br /> Do not bother renting this one.
