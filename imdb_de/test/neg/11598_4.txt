Komodo Vs. Cobra will not set the world on fire. It is not a trademark of cinematic history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers who are trying to make another film, make another paycheck and continue to feed themselves and their families. Therefore, I give this effort much pent-up demand. I mean, it must be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. There are not many big budget films that are filmed there. BUT - they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to invest everything in the lame American monster movie that needs affordable SFX. And I get a kick when I'm always looking for the same places that appear in these films again and again. If you see it again for some reason, look at the order in which Pare and his company walk through a "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown on SciFi a week or two ago), you'll see people trample through the same spare jungle. Come to think about it, I think the helicopters in both flicks land in the same clearing. I can admire the thriftiness of these films. Every dollar really appears on the screen! Too bad that there just is not enough money ......
