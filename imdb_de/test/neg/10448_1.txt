Finally a movie that should rival "El Padrino" and "Darkness Falls" in terms of purity and utter boredom. This is the first movie I've ever assigned to IMDb for 1 in 10 people. For good reason. <br /> <br /> For one, the cast is nothing special. This is usually not a problem for me, except that the only character who is somehow interesting or unlike anything else is Harrington of Grand L. Bush. Secondly, the production has a below-average value - TV sci-fi like "Stargate" has more convincing sets, and all underwater scenes that are NOT edited by the SFX teams are filmed on dry sets of "falling particles" that are not very convincing are . This movie is literally "drained". The worst part is that this movie is boring. For the first 45 minutes, I felt like we were walking in circles: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullshit." "Not really." "Bullshit." "I do not believe that." "Bullshit." "There it is now!" "I did not see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yeah, bullshit." After that it takes about twenty minutes. Then we are in dialogue again. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that's all this movie has. Characters talk. That's not a bad thing, except that this movie is not very good at it. The dialogue is often constructed and clich√©d, and it is not very interesting to listen to it. I see no point maligning the special effects; This movie has worse qualities. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. The action is subordinate. The script - oh god, the script - is worse than a trash of sci-fi television. One wonders where the budget of this movie is or was. <br /> <br /> Another horrible, horrible addition to the "Megaloadone" series (there are about four). Bring Steve Alten, please ...
