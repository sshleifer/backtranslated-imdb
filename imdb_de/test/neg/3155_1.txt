Barney and friends ... the Dora, the discoverer of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit it. As a kid, Barney was my ultimate hero. I had my plush toy in Barney and I've seen the same Barney episodes on videotape over and over again. Maybe because it was so sugar-coated and mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> But when I turned 7, I started hating Barney. Everyone at school would visit Dis barney, and I went along (mainly because it was funny), and that's what little boys do. But a few years later, I discovered something else about Barney that I'll never forget. <br /> <br /> A person known as Angel_meiru at the IMDb made an essay for the school and explained the dangers of Barney watching She posted it on the Message Boards. Many of these dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a school day. he's supposedly educative, or so says Sheryl Leach (Barney's Creator), but really, all I can remember is that magic can solve anything that's wrong. <br /> <br /> To finish this comment, I would like to tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was a little boy who saw a certain episode of Barney. One day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him. I do not know the result (but it can be assumed that the child died), but why was it even kidnapped? because he saw the episode of Barney and his friends, entitled "A stranger is a friend you have not met yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
