I'm a fan of Slasher movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this one is just one after the other. To my astonishment: Part II is much better and you get the whole story of Part 1 summarized! So do not waste time on this part and continue with Part II. You will not regret it, because Part 2 actually has a plot and is pretty self-deprecating. First part: 1 out of 10 Second part: 4 out of 10
