Tamara Anderson and her family move again as their traveling painter father traces his next landscape. She is fifteen years old and is in a rebellious phase. Her anger is already angry at her father for her frequent relocations and exacerbated when her mother is suddenly locked up in a sanatorium for tuberculosis. Through her mother's absence, Tamara strikes at her father and seeks comfort in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who lived in her rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest to a mistake. It's strange, and even during his emotional scenes there are no tensions. The actors of the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as a sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as a dead teenager's guilty mother. But Katie Boland is too amateur as Tamara to wear the movie. The dialogue is very natural and Boland can not quite make it. She has her moments, and when she meets them, she can be good, but it's too often that she came awkward. You can see how she thinks "ok, that's my line and this is the face I should do" rather than reacting to the other actors. She is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sister Brenda also suffer from stilted replacements, but at least in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done correctly, the script could have made her an influencing film. And it has moments, but much of it is distorted with an amateur lead performance and a flat direction.
