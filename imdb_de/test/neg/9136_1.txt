YOU'RE WELCOME?! When it comes to technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, I think I missed his point. Because I felt like Reggio relied on cold war space recordings and added nothing new in the dialogue about fears of technology. Traces of 1 and 0 that designate technology and math and science - that's DONE. Who sees the matrix out there? And movement studies of people in motion? Ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses exact excerpts from Muybridge's photographs of motion studies. <br /> <br /> This movie was rejected, and Philip Glass is enough to listen to EVERYTHING he has done in the last 10 years ... avoid this movie at ALL cost !!
