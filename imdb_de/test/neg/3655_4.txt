The guy mentioned that he should sue the 1.5 hours of his life. I can not contradict that. The movie started as a kind of project-cam project and ended in a dark room. Whenever the girls were completely naked and seemed magically bright everywhere, I know I'll write the script or say something about it. But this one is like a bad remake copy of the saw with a bad ending. To think of a man who wrote this story, sick. This is really a shocking movie that can not say it's horror. It's just the brutality and violence that made me sick. It's really frustrating to watch a movie without ending up in his face. The film is ready, now you can go home. <br /> <br /> cons - camera - lighting (Althrue, which I think should have been) - beyond - sobering <br /> <br /> cons - real in your face - acting in my opinion was good - It's all shit in <br /> <br /> All in all The movie is NOT my taste for a movie, because it wanted to let us know that these things happen, and the guy wrote his own little fantasy. If you have ever seen the movies? They all had a moment of comfort to hold on to. This? Not. Maybe it's just me, that I'm too soft, but this film has made me shiver, and the story is really short, the sick man kills girls slowly. But the actors sucked you in this movie with every beat, every scream you could almost feel. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I had to judge this movie quickly, it's a terrible movie? No it is not. It is an exaggerated example of reality, this is a reality as it could get. But do not look at this movie if you expect a big secret, a real conspiracy or even a story. Man gets girls in a dark room and kills them one by one, that's it really.
