Here's a fantastic concept for a movie - a series of meteors crash into a small town, and the resulting alien infection is captured by a single camera's dash cam of a deputation as the city slowly takes over. Leave it to Albert Pyun to screw it up! Do not come within 100 feet of this strip! Holy crap, what a bomb ... it could be Pyun's worst! The crazy thing is that this is the seed of a creative idea - a whole outburst told by the POV of a dashcam. When I heard this some time ago, I imagined the car breaking into pieces, people being run over and infected guys breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. That would be cool, right? Instead, we circle around in a wooded area all the time, occasionally encountering the three infected guys standing there. The last bit is a 15-minute shot, in which nothing happens in front of the camera, only sounds are heard off the screen. Stay away!!! To my relief, I think I'm officially calling for my end of Pyun ... I just needed 20 shitty movies to realize I had better things to do.
