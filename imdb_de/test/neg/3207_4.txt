I have not seen this movie for years, the last time I did that I was really drunk after 5 pints of tenants at my local Witherspoon, but even then I thought it was pretty awful. This movie is pretty horrible compared to the other Critters movies, the first two were pretty good, 3 were pretty crap but far better. The story takes place 53 years after Critters 3, when Charlie, the bounty hunter from the previous films, was found by a crew of a Space Miner, Em, People in a gondola in space and taken on board. Once aboard the last of the critter eggs in the galaxy that Charlie brought back from Earth, we'll break up and we'll have critter aboard the spaceship, an obvious 'alien' rip-off and a lot of terrible effects on this movie Point brought. Only good if we are reintroduced (or so we believe) to UG, who is now a villain and wants to preserve the creatures instead of destroying them
