This movie starts on the wrong foot and never really gets it to work. The first scene shows a Life Flight heliport and right in front of the window you can clearly see the mountains in the background. For those of you who may never been in Houston, there is no altitude change. The city is just above sea level and a 5 foot climb is considered a big hill. To keep up with this scenario, the viewer is immediately informed of shots outside the hospital that are not in Houston. All trees lack leaves or are pines of which Houston does not have much. Even the hospital itself is amazing. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the United States and is located in the heart of the Medical District, just a few miles from downtown Houston. Even so, it looks like the hospital is in the suburbs or even out of town The landscape. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that the one responsible for the actual tropical storm was torn out of the movie because the numerous radar images are wrong. The first radar image in the movie is the Hurricane Hugo beating South Carolina. Later, we see Kris Kristofferson leave his job, and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is pulling south over Houston, but the radar image he's showing is clearly letting Alison move north from the Gulf of Mexico to Houston Alison , <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, it's not so bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder are all doing a decent job, considering that this is a direct TV movie. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a little more entertaining. My only problem with acting is the depiction of Houstoners with big, thick southern accents ... the actors all sound like from Birmingham, Alabama and not from Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The film gives its point of view and for the general public it does exactly what it should: entertainment. If you are looking for a factual report on what happened in June 2001 with the city of Houston, you will be disappointed. Before you watch this movie, keep in mind that it is based solely on the evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on Houston itself. If you're looking for a factual report on the impact of Tropical Storm Alison on the Houston Metro, I suggest watching The Weather Channel's Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of *****
