I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror movie. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably well run and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but that's about it. But with this sequel it looks like "Gone With the Wind"! <br /> <br /> I saw it on TV at the age of 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. As far as I remember, Rosemary's baby Andrew is now grown and the coven wants him to take over the world. But there are forces trying to stop it ... and Andrew has doubts about himself. <br /> <br /> I give this a two for two reasons: Gordon is in it (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually pretty good as Andrew, and in the beginning there is a scary moment when Rosemary (Patty Duke) was "kidnapped" by a bus ... stupid and unnecessary without a driver. The original did not need a sequel! Ira Levin's book succession in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Start with Duke ... and then turn off. Not worth the effort
