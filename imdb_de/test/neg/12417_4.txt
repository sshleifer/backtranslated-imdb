40 years ago, "Wild Rebels" was probably a funny second movie on a triple film. It has not aged very well, but it should never age well; it was obviously intended to be a disposable, forgettable fun right from the start. Taken at this level, this is a good example of the genre of Biker Stripe. <br /> <br /> Various elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar films released at the same time. The "hero" Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo) looks like a nondescript "Everyman" - he's not particularly brave, tough, talented or handsome (though he wins a fight with a tough biker member midway the movie, and the member the band decides to help it out at the end of the film, and the soundtrack is pretty well done, with a nice ventures-style bass / drum riff that keeps things moving, and saxophones and brass charts playing Spice things up a bit and although the script is pretty flat, all the actors live their cardboard figures convincingly and with quite a bit of energy. <br /> <br /> There are many careless technical gaffles: horrible 'day-by-night' scenes bright daylight, squealing tires in a swamp, fire sirens inadvertently stuck to the soundtrack instead of police sirens, a banknote made of duct tape on a ceiling tile, a Luger sounding like a Winchester 30-06, and a A shotgun people are 100 yards away, a detective killed a biker on a third floor and landed with a revolver with a 2-inch barrel from the ground. <br /> <br /> There's a whole bunch of stupid story elements: Linda (the girl) gang member disables a bank guard with a drug filled syringe, the last firefight takes place in a lighthouse (!), roadblocks of the Police do not block roads, police apparently have never heard of Ducking, and the police apparently never heard of planting insects or having their covert guy ring a wire. <br /> <br /> But the action chugs along, the cameraman knows what he's doing, the tempo in most scenes is pretty good, and there are some nice, nimble liners and dialogues here and there that keeps the energy level on. (My favorite: "Man, you mess around with private property!" (Dh, Linda) ") No, do not look this out or something, but if a copy of the MST version should fall into your hands, you should do so Much Enjoy watching: "Five the Hard Way" or "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three other MST-covered counterculture films).
