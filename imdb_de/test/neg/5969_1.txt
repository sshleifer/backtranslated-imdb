I think the film was one-sided, I've seen it recently and find the documentation typical of Western filmmakers without prejudice. The fact is that prostitution does not exist all over the world, not only in Tanzania and not because of this fish business, there were prostitutes before the Russian and other businessmen arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa, not to mention Tanzania, and this is not the fish fillet business. In fact, the fishing industry has helped millions of people support their families in their daily lives. This film only clouds the good image of this peace-loving country. As far as the arms trade is concerned, the film could not say whether there is indeed a critical examination of the films that question the authenticity of the filmmaker. It seems they are trying to prove their point of view with a few signs really done for everything. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country. Yes, there are prostitutes and street kids, but they are not the product of this business, it's just a common scenario in most poor countries in the world, even in the western world ... what a lot of garbage. <br /> <br /> The pilot himself talks about sending arms to Angola, more than 2000 km south of Tanzania, and the war was also miles away from Mwanza in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The director could not prove how these weapons were transported Mwanza to DRC! <br /> <br /> In short, the films lack focus and seriousness. It's pretty easy to find that character all over Africa and has nothing to do with Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet ... What a lot of garbage! <br /> <br /> The truth is that, contrary to what the film depicts, Nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake and less than 25% of all catches are exported from Lake Victoria. The rest is consumed on the spot so let's do it right.
