I was really disappointed with this movie. I've heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters. So I was very excited to see it when it came to DVD. I thought it was going to be a terrific horror movie with a lot of weird surprises, but instead it was a predictable movie with a slug. It dragged and dragged without a climax in it, and after all the difficulties these people had to go through to escape, the end was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for a reason. This is not a typical horror movie in which a central villain kills a bunch of people to death. The story makes this film unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies. Although I do not like this movie, I recommend to all horror fans to see it at least once. You may like it surprisingly. For this horror fan, I can only say that I hope there is NO sequel to this unforgettable movie.
