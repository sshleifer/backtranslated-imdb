Nothing will outshine KOMODO with pretty Jill Hennessey as shrink (!), But KvC is not quite as bad as I would have expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Make sure you see it while you are drunk or stoned or trying to go to sleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: A group of mostly unknown actors meets on an island where a government experiment on growing giant vegetables has failed. Huge creatures that came into contact with the vegetables conquered the island and ate all. Now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people living there. The acting is wonderfully cruel, especially a mustached general from the television series THE INCREDIBLE HULK, but that's typical of this kind of cable TV. The CGI creatures have TV quality, which means you see cartoon monsters. However, two of the girls in the group are very cute and it pays to run back and forth in their tight little outfits. You just want to eat it!
