It's hard to decide what to say about it. It is not totally one hundred percent bad. Although the movie-in-a-movie is unspeakably bad, it's said to be campy, but missing by a mile. I'm pretty sure this is intended. Danny Aiello is quite sufficient here and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was fine in a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the youngest friend of just over twenty. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she did very well. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, but I do not think it will reach its goals. All in all, it's probably worth passing on.
