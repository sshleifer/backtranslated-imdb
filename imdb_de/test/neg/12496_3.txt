Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an intelligence agent who prevents the assassination of a senator. On the way there he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on the tail. Incidentally, the tracker is interested in ending Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low-action action movie is, of course, Robocop, and although this film has a little imagination and real energy, this has a real kickboxing champion running away from a robot. The movie is not so terrible as it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are set up to be mowed down by the various shots. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrible in the lead role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (bad)
