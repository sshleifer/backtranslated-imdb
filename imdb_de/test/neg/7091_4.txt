In trying to keep up with the hip of a young audience as the 1970s approached, YCSF was the product of Odder and Odder selected for musicalization. Here is the regression of the past life, ESP and Hypno therapy ... pretty slimy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) is the extremely low dramatic action. Where can a movie go and what can happen if a man falls in love with a past incarnation of a girl he can not stand? It can not be new everywhere, but strangely, it can not even grow old! If this were possible, the audience would still not be interested in uniting Yves Montand (who plays a much older, arrogant French donkey) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We are never invested in them, their situations or results. Montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> It has all been given a flat 60's veneer that makes it a standout item. Despite efforts here and there by Minelli, these are respectable. It's not even adapted to a non-musical story that has been successful before ... that's easy to pass! Streisand sometimes has a weird business to offer, as if she tries not to fall asleep on her roof and improvise an energetic dance. But she relies too much on her engaging (angry) crazy Jewish girl. However, she can sing very well, both at the "soft" and the "powerful" end of the series. In the midst of a lot of musical slags, she gets three or four great songs * that are much higher than anything Fanny or Dolly had to offer. "He's not you," is a sweet little thing as grand as Lorenz Hart's "My Funny Valentine," but the movie can not detect any of it. because the lyrics do not seem to refer to anything in the movie and there is nothing to suggest that a great love is blossoming between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only cut we can see is a bad job by the Hatchet a much bigger movie. Strong research shows a longer, better explained and more decorative, but not necessarily better film: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure that there are more babs in this version, but more importantly, Minelli gives more thoughtful work. <br /> <br /> In the end, Montand sends out Babs to sing the theme song, after discovering that he is a total dick giving her a homosexual homosexual to let off her hook. And she takes the bait. So, um ... hurray for that. <br /> <br /> (* hurry up, it's nice up here, love with all the niceties, he's not you and the theme song)
