This movie is absolutely incredible. The only way a girl could perform this action on a dog is if she had serious mental health problems or had long sexual abuse or coercion. However, we are asked to believe that an otherwise "normal" healthy woman was a bit bored and "made a small mistake" and had a sexual encounter with a dog. Besides, it never had any adverse effects on her, unless she told anyone about it. Not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she could not resist - she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog. She did not take drugs or anything she just "felt." <br /> <br /> The rest of the film tries to get this action in a light of "Hey, it could be honest to anyone". , <br /> <br /> But to really be convinced, we have to believe that this is a woman who can do absolutely anything if she just feels that way. Think about it - could she have considered the rights and abuses of this action before it was carried out? If she had, she would have stayed in her tracks. Man has instinctive limits for reasons. If we now want to consider bestiality as a "cute" little aberration, what's next? Child abuse But the "heroine" is harshly portrayed by a nice girl who had a moment of aberration. If it had been forced by a perpetrator to carry out this act, the story might have made more sense and I could have accepted the act. However, there is no way anyone can perform the long-lasting activity that is referred to even once-unless there is a deep disorder that requires much psychiatric help. This is by no means a one-time event in an otherwise perfect life. <br /> <br /> I know this is just a movie, but by normalizing behavior like this through the media, society becomes desensitized and more and more terrible realities become possible. <br /> <br /> I would imagine that a culprit shows this to a child, to convince him that it is not such a big deal, and then continue with his agenda. It could also be used by a culprit to underline a child so as not to inform about the abuse - because look how people react to you when you do this. <br /> <br /> This is not about the truth. The director wants it to be truth. This is about the deterioration and how easily people (the viewing public) can be manipulated to accept the most outrageous concepts if they are packaged in the right way. The audience is manipulated, degraded and laughed at. This is a movie in which actors and audiences are very subtly humiliated and fooled by a clever but extremely disturbed film writer. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me to serve as a vehicle for the film designer to overcome the excitement of improperly playing with your mind. I do not know if she's aware of it - but it's the most classic example of Mind F *** k I've ever met. <br /> <br /> I hope nobody offends too much. But once you've seen this movie, I do not think there's anything left to be offended by anything.
