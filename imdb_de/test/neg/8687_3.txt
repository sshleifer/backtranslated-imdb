The Evil Below begins on the Strait of San Sebastian in 1683, when the 17th century treasure ship sinks El Diablo in a massive thunderstorm. Jump to the "Day of the Strait of San Sebastian", where two divers explore the beautiful underwater coral reefs, which are rich in wildlife. They encounter the sunken wreckage of El Diablo and explore it, but are attacked and killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and operates a boat rental called 'Vagrant Viking', which caters to tourists who want to fish, dive and explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who is looking for treasure as a hobby (well, we all have to do something to pass the time?), She hires Max and his sparsely clad assistant Tracy (Sheri Able), so she can try to find El Diablo and get rich. A conversation about sunken treasures arouses some of the more ruthless members of the local community. Dodging the criminals and criminals, Max & Sarah is made aware that El Diablo has a sinister past that supposedly still leaves its supernatural legacy even now ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to IMDb, with some help from Star Crawford, although the version I saw was just Dubois, I thought The Evil Below had some potential a bit different, but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from the sinking of the sea like a stone. The script of Arthur Payne starts out fine with the two divers killed by some sea creature, but NEVER NEVER be referred to this opening again, the creature will NEVER be seen again and there will be no more supernatural kills. The Evil Below then suffers from a serious and deadly case of an identity crisis, it does not seem to know what it wants to be, as it's pieces of various genres from underwater adventures, horror, action, thrillers, crime and it even has time, a little murder mystery and religious nonsense. As a result, The Evil Below feels very pithy and fragmented. Since the best scene in the entire movie is the opening sequence, I sat there and became more and more frustrated because there was no consistent horror as it went downhill fast & the fact that we were there never saw the sea creature again. The Evil Below is boring, slow, uneventful, predictable, stupid and misses any kind of charm or intelligence, in short, The Evil Below does not do anything to make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois Fails To revive things, even though he has obviously shot plenty of underwater material, because I sometimes thought I would see a National Geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, coral and wildlife in general , Forget about any blister, some blood-stained water & hemoptysis is about as bloody as it gets to me just dirty. <br /> <br /> Technically The Evil Below is very simple, apart from the beautiful underwater photography it is bland and completely forgotten by fish. This is point & shoot material and overall the production values ​​are very low, even the place where it was shot does not look very sunny or appealing. Acting is bad, but did you expect anything else? <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is a bad movie, the basic story is everywhere and can not decide what it wants to be. As a result, it is a mess. Add that to the low production values, the fact that there is no thrill here. Absolutely minimal horror content, you have a movie that is probably best avoided if you are not absolutely desperate. Even then, there are certainly better ways to spend more than 90 minutes of your life. ,
