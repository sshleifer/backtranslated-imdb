This movie breaks off any gangster / gangster movie ever made. MP Da Last Don has a relationship to every movie. Acting was by far the worst I've ever seen. Who is John Mario? His acting was by far the worst thing I've ever seen. He makes bad actors look good. As far as Master P is concerned, it is sold out faster than an N * Sync concert. I really wish I was there to tell the entire production company: WHAT THE HILL WOULD YOU LIKE IF YOU PENNIZE THE DEVICE? "Obviously, these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and really let their gangster life live. I know there was no one who wanted to expel this movie. It seems (and how predictable) that the guys from NO LIMIT had to start, NO LIMIT FILMS, I said enough! This movie is awful and does not deserve to be called a movie!
