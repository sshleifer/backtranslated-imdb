Would be promising if it were a student movie. It never seems to know where they are going next, as if they had decided on the next scene when they were making the film. As a result, many repetitions and a calming pace. There is an absolutely confusing process by which the spirits affect people in the world, including the Internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious student, withdrawn behavior, red spaces, dark spots, and suicides. Good luck in finding the connections, or if a character is still a ghost or just acts strangely. The characters are barely outlined, which might be fine, but they are completely uninteresting. It is far too long and only ends when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. Weakest Moment: When "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.
