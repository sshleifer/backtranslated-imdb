It was (foolishly) with a degree of desire that I sat down to see what a friend had promised to be the worst / best movie experience of my life, the mighty "Roller Blade 7". 2 years later I am still in therapy. Oh yes, my dear friends, it is really so bad. Obviously, they had about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use the footage endlessly and repeatedly for a brain-related effect. My only fear of the post-apocalyptic world that occurs in this turkey is that somehow an imprint of that atrocity would survive. Truly the living would envy the dead.
