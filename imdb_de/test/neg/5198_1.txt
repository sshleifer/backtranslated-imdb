Yes, stupid is the word for this actress. I know that many have mentioned their beauty, but this viewer found them with empty heads and boring looks with bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. Watch her walk away in those jeans and show a pretty big butt. Her butt extends over her shoulders. What does that tell you? The leading man, played by Mark Humphrey, was perfectly staffed. A charmer But he and Lancaster just did not fit together. She was out of place with this handsome guy. Good acting by Susan Glover as a sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and was okay. But the director of the film, Philippe Gagnon, has lost too much material to Lancaster. After a while you are tired of looking at them and watching their boring acting skills. And what a bitch she was. She sniffed her husband, was uncomfortable with him and just a simple spoiled brat. Happy to have met her with the dart pistol. I thought it might be the end of her. But unfortunately the script tells us something else. After torturing myself and looking at this loser again, I still came up with the same criticism. Lancaster is boring to look at. This time around her hair, people. Her hair in her face, which she constantly threw back, became annoying. I ask the writer, Alexandra Komisaruk's reason why a handsome, wealthy man like Philippe would even deal with a bimbo like Allison. When there were so many attractive, intelligent women who decided to teach. He chooses this nothing. Is that the case of Rochester / Jane Eyre? Well, that's all a matter of taste, I think. This Sarah Lancaster is not my thing, people.
