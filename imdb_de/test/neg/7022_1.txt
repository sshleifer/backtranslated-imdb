Lucille Ball was a huge power on television in the 1950s and 1960s, but she still shot an occasional film, notably THE LONG, LONG TRAILER and THE FACTS OF LIFE. Although her television career remained strong, her film career seemed to have come to an end in the early 1970s - but Ball was determined to shoot one last major motion picture and the project she chose was 1966's MAME musical The role seemed to be tailor-made: Based on the popular novel that produced two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a crazy, wildly unrestrained woman who "inherits" her orphaned nephew Patrick and puts him on a roll of wild tour Possibilities of life, jumping from one cartoon spree to another. The music that included songs like "Open a New Window" and "If He Walked into My Life" was one of Jerry Herman's best work. The side cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. The expectations were high; Opening night fanfare was enormous; The movie was a disaster. Critics were stunned and the audience was thrilled. <br /> <br /> No matter what a hardcore Lucy fan may say, MAME is a fiasco, so it's hard to know where to start. It's badly directed, poorly filmed, poorly performed, and there's Lucille Ball at the center, unable to dance, unable to sing and grinning like a waxwork, while unbelievably bad choreography swirls around her. But the disaster hardly makes her alone; the supporting cast tariffs are not better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell rebuild their stage roles of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; The former is step-shaped, the latter is somber. Robert Preston sings with a smile, but he is quite alone and certainly not too happy. The DVD brings the movie from widescreen VHS pan-and-scan release, but that just means it's more horrible to watch. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME; Although I would not say it's bad enough to get you to tear your eyes out, you may wish you had it. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
