There are shows and movies that I have seen on IMDb.com and then read and with which I disagreed. I was glad to accept that there was just a difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Reading Positive Reviews of this muck just remind me of an eerie conspiracy that forces TV network staff to surf the Internet. Not convincingly positive reviews are published for programs that they are responsible for themselves criticizing that this show will "surely become a phenomenon" for a full year after it has become clear that it will not be anything like that. <br /> <br /> I will not waste words describing this mess, but it will suffice Tell me, if you have fun, wives abducting their husbands, husbands abducting their sons, children facing their parents are disrespectful, and absolutely no other behavioral or subthreads to legitimize characters who are basically just non-round spit machines, and then watch this show. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I have some Seinfeld DVDs to get through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - Canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. The war at home - renewed. <br /> <br /> No justice.
