I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And so I have to get involved with the rather modest Latt / Howel version. C Thomas Howel had more heart and sympathy than Cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). It's hard to imagine until you take away everything in the Spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars. There would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no cruise. Because I doubt that everything in the David Michael Latt version costs more than a cool Grand. I compare apples to beets. I think I have to go with the beets. At least there are independent films on the market for epic sci-fi catastrophes.
