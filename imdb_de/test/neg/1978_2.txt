Nice visuals and many fights do not make a good movie. And that's exactly what happened here. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to admit, I still have to play FFVII (I plan to order it soon). However, I researched to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. However, not everyone has the luxury of researching such things, and Advent Children demands that knowledge of FFVII be required. Despite incredible pictures I can not say that there are too many things New. We saw it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and apart from some better moves, I can not say they did a lot of super-spiritual stuff with this one. <br /> <br /> The Battle Scenes - Well, they're having a bit of fun. Still, how can we ever doubt the outcome of any of them. This was a boring classic - there were three mainstream evil fights (the hero cloud is smashed, then it almost gets there and gets smashed and finally wins). The reason I say it was boring classic was that it's used a lot, but in this case it's poorly executed. I will address that later. <br /> <br /> The English dub seemed to be good to me, although I did not see it in Japanese, so I will not judge the Japanese dub, just the English. I say that - I've heard many better ones, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now the plot. Um ... what action? To be honest, this movie is nothing but a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII characters on the big screen with a nice look. As I said earlier, the fighting just seems to be without reason. The opening fight is never explained, Kadaj seems to have no desire to destroy the world itself, nor any real motivation to do something unpleasant. Cloud is moping throughout the movie, and pretty much everyone gets a compulsive cameo. Really, FFVII was an ensemble piece. Advent children is anything but. If they had managed to give everyone a significant role in the story (Star Trek: First Contact has shown that this is possible, I might add), it could have been much better. Of course, that would have changed the plot, which, frankly, was supposed to be almost better than the one we got. <br /> <br /> Characters were generally either unused or almost forgotten. The members of Avalanche (the cloud working group in FFVII, for those who do not) receive 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine and some even less). Damn, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The music ... well, I do not care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he wasted time on this big movie. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise, he could not decide if he should be epic (and orchestral) or funny (with electric guitar). As he moved from one to the other, it felt as if he'd been carrying a sledgehammer to his head. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, whether this movie was epic or fun ... he tried to be both, and failed miserably. Honestly, you can not please everyone and do everything. The movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or funny and deep, but all three are too much), but failed here as well. The last scene, reminiscent of a baptism ceremony, was thrown out for reasons that look like it. You do not have to be a Christian just to shake your head and cry there. This scene just did not belong to the movie (and also Aerith's frequent appearances - she's dead, Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastically I've heard Final Fantasy VII, this movie is not about to face a giant disappointment. Because of the beautiful look I give a 2 out of 10 points.
