Greetings; <br /> <br /> I never thought that I would see the day I would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it ... I've always been a fan of horror movies , B 'C and C included. In this case, though, it's hard to describe how a movie could not qualify for letters on this scale ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a poorly developed backstory, a mix of folklore with a sequel Taste. At the end, the performance of the actors is questionable. Horror B movies usually fall into two categories ... 1) A gem that has been under-rated and underfunded. 2) So bad is it funny, laugh or your money back. Well, this movie falls in between. I was not afraid, did not laugh ... So, if you really have to see it, you could do it, but I recommend you, not ...
