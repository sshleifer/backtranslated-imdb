Corny and terrible, I was not surprised that this short-lived show did not make it. I like to remember when Tales From the Crypt tried to use those crazy episodes as if they were really scary. Combined with bad drama and bad music, I was surprised that this grim show was ever thought of. It has never again shown, and one can only be grateful for this circumstance.
