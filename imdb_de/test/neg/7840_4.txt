"Maximum Risk" is a step aside for Van Damme and just part of the uninspired B-movie action material we expect from films with the macho-belgian martial artist. The strip has gaping storylines, a plethora of tons, a messy conglomerate, and a beautiful Henstridge who spends most of the time waiting for a cue. "Maximum Risk" does not differ in any way and probably does not have much appeal outside the usual young male audience. (C-)
