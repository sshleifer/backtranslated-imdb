I have partly seen this movie because of positive comments here on IMDb. After wishing I had those 90 minutes of my life back, I feel it my duty to move on and say myself here ... Please do not bother me watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not argue about it The actors tried hard - they did what they could, but this material is terrible. The pace was deadly - slow and meandering, and you saw it all about an hour away, and then it took forever for it to happen. The dialogue was boring, meaningless and not funny at all. The characters were all completely unsympathetic. And the cinematography was in my opinion of very low quality - the clich√© of "character uses home video machine!" was used very badly. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a cool person. Do not be distracted by wasting your time on this movie.
