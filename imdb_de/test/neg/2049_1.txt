worst. Movie. ever made. JE. I have no words to say about it ... otherwise it really had no meaning, no conspiracy, no ... anything. sheer crap !!! I do not know how everyone in the movie did not shoot them after watching the shelves .... .... .... ... I love vampire flicks and riddles and alternative movies outside the box and ... that was not from that. I mean something to the crap !!! I can not tell you what the movie was about, because I still do not know it, and I spent only an hour and a half of my life looking at it ... bottom line drugs. That's the only thing I got from this movie. Please do not look at this ... I mean for a "sultry sensual vampire movie", there was not even the expected nakedness that you would get from a vampire movie. Nevertheless, back to my point .... this film blows. set yourself on fire instead ...
