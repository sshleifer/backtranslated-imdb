Really crazy. Even if you have not seen the original George Cukor movie starring Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and a cast of a thousand other stars, you can dismiss this compulsively politically correct, depressing comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do to herself? Her face can barely move. That alone puts her far away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should sue the DP and Debra Messing, what the hell did she do here? Actresses without connection in the subconscious of the public, trying to get through for friends, absolutely unconvincing. Eva Mendes in the Joan Crawford part is an outrageous misunderstanding. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a trans-gender actress without taste and subtlety. Bizarre to think that a woman has adapted and directed these women. The only positive things I can mention are a short but very funny performance by Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as housekeeper.
