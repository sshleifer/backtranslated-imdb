In this Silly Symphony, a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city. Most of the short ones are the two mice that explore the dining table. The animation is fine, where this short suffers from humor. Maybe I have just seen this "dinner table adventure" in too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Although this came first, I just did not find it so enjoyable.
