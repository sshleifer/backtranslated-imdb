This movie is awfully bad. Kevin Spacey is a really great actor, he shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, 7, etc. But that's really nonsense, he did not come close to an almost Irish accent, maybe he should have practiced it with Kate Hudson while she had made her about Adam. For Irish people, this movie is ridiculous and worse, quite irritating for some scenes. I think the producers made this movie in the hope that the target audience (non-Europe) would never have seen or heard the general or Martin Cahill, and would be thrilled with a fascinating and entertaining story. Total shit !!
