This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Thank god I saw it for free. I would have hated to waste my money on it. <br /> <br /> First, there is no figure in the movie that is kind of sympathetic. Michael Caine comes close, but even he is pretty flawed. The rest of the "commands" consists of disgusting ex-cons. There are the two gay Arabs and three men trying to rape a Red Cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no trouble sending his men away to be killed so he can escape. <br /> <br /> The "mission" is all exciting. They should blow up a fuel dump. Sounds exciting, right? Well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and the repair of flat tires. Yes, you read that correctly. The "tension" is whether the spare tires go out. We actually WATCH that they change about 12 apartments on the way. So incredibly exciting is this movie. <br /> <br /> You come to the gas station and find out that it is a decoy. So nothing to blast. And at that point, for some very confused reason, the British army decides that they no longer need these guys, and sends their whereabouts to the Germans to kill them. <br /> <br /> So now at least we will be an exciting race to freedom? No, instead they decide to blow up another gas station to create a distraction. But when they come to the apartment, they trigger a tripwire, and the Germans come to fetch them. They call their names via a loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Really funny. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them all the way to the dump before they jumped the trap? Instead, they wait until they get to the tank farm and fix all charges. Yes. Law. That would happen. <br /> <br /> So, they blow out the dump, the leader sells all his men - except Michael Caine, as he was offered $ 2,000 to bring him back alive. <br /> <OK ... well, the men are all cheated and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. The British troops come in with tanks and decide to be rescued. Because they wear German uniforms (they carried them to blow up the garbage dump), they tie a white flag around a stick and go out into the street. <br /> <br /> A British guy goes after her and makes machine guns to death. Roll credits. <br /> <br /> Yes. The two "heroes" of the film die because of a random act of violence. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the movie had suddenly crossed the budget and decided, "This is an eye catcher. Kill her and we'll make it home." I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a graceful bomb.
