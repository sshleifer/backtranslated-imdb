Herman has made the northern drama his own with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula wavers in this silky, flat and fictitious story of two juvenile delinquents trying to get season tickets for Newcastle. Truancy, underage smoking and drinking, underage sex, teenage abortion, bullying at school, drug abuse, drug abuse, depression, child molestation, child abuse, shoplifting, home theft, car theft, violent assault and armed robbery. None of these questions are studied, they merely serve to shift history from one implausible situation to another. The film is not as keenly watched as Trainspotting, as poignant as The Full Monty or as mirroring as Wonderland (shamelessly stealing music in manipulative ways). I suspect none of the filmmakers come from Newcastle, and the social issues of film references have certainly never materialized. I'm all for the entertainment, and Herman's track record shows he's aware of the need to bring the social message in line with laughter and tears. Quite simply, he is incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice ending, but there are far too many flat, banal moments to get there. Nice shot, not played very well and ultimately fails at three crucial points: script, script, script.
