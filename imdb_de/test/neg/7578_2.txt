I do not know, but the movie was too similar to other films I've seen. The ring, the eye, the dark water, they are all the same to me. Do not get me wrong, it's beautiful, beautiful camera work, great graphics, but this story is just too commonplace. In the end it is the score that triggers the tension, you know: the screams, the rumble. The characters in the movie do not react very naturally, move very slowly and are surprised by everything they see. I know some people who love this kind of movie, and if you make a well-made movie, it probably will not hurt if you look at it. But if you saw the movie I mentioned above and did not like it, I suggest you do not bother.
