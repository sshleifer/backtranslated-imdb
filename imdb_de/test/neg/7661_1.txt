In front of the airport 79 'these films were pretty good. They had decent special effects, all-star cast and good acting. This movie has destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for it. Let's talk about the special effects WOW !!!! They are terrible, what did the director think of? I know it's not until 1979, but let's look at other very good special effects like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​the Concord and this might be the best airport movie, but they've done too much with it. How about Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) firing a torch out of the cockpit window to prevent a heat-seeking missile from reaching the match. He also does 90 degrees dives and loops. This completely far-fetched and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me, the special effects do not help this scene and are really beyond poor ... They almost look like a cartoon, and that's what the whole movie looks like In the best case, extremely bad to fair ... dubbing is a main theme in this one Film, especially George Kennedy. What I really like as an actor, but just not cut in this movie. The full blame must be the director who has made a very poor cut and has really eroded the airport franchise. Too bad that the Concord is not used today, it was a marvel of air travel ...
