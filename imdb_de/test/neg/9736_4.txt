Although he has worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is widely regarded by historians and connoisseurs of World War II as a gentleman, a soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and material he wanted in Africa, everything would have been different. And that's probably true. Rommel was indeed a military genius and a sincere, honest man under all circumstances. <br /> <br /> But this movie is trying hard to portray it as a saint nearby. He does his job and tries to win the war for Hitler, but the leader constantly intervenes and gives him ridiculous orders, which Rommel (James Mason) triggers with astonishment, but rarely asks questions and is never disobedient. Only when it is obvious that Hitler is ruining Germany does Rommel think of treason against him. This dilemma is the main theme of the movie. A good man in bad circumstances, trying to do the right thing. Mason is good as Rommel, but it's hardly a memorable performance in the sense of, say, George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this movie makes him look like a decent person, so he forgets to make him interesting. Occasionally he gets into heat when playing with his wife Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy, well-staffed), but usually Mason is called to a stiff British performance. as if the British were trying to claim Rommel for themselves (although all Nazis, with the exception of Hitler, have all set English accents). Made in a cheap way, with thumping scenes and stock movies from Southern California doubling for Tunisia, there's nothing that can recommend this movie in particular. A remake might be interesting (I would just choose Ed Harris for a slight corporeal similarity and, well, Harris can act) if it was seasoned, but this movie has mostly shown me how much more sophisticated we have become as viewers in the last fifty years; a biography that would not cut that bland anymore.
