A plane with the daughter of a rich scientist sets in thick wilderness. He puts together a group to find them and the others, but the rescue team soon suspects that something is being tracked. Then there are more backgrounds for the expedition, which only reinforce the existing tension. <br /> <br /> The film is a sensible idea, and an interpretation of the popular Sasquatch legend should sooner or later go to film. The director of the film, however, violates a basic rule of the director of horror / thriller, and that shows too early. Of course, the audience knows that something is imitating the characters, just read the title! To show what the kicker of the movie was meant to be, ruins the tension and as a direct result the fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere, and there are almost no landscape shots that show the vastness of the wilderness, but there are many monster point-of-view shots that add nothing. They beat 'Predator' pretty shamelessly. The low-budget horror movie 'Wendigo' did what this movie is trying to do a lot better. <br /> <br /> Some of the character tensions and a non-clich√© ending make it to catch up on the garbage heap. But it is still poor and very disappointing considering the premise and potential. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for some violence and obscenity, but compared to most R-Rated horror it's pretty tame.
