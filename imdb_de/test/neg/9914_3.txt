If you thought the day after tomorrow would not be plausible, wait until you see this. <br /> <br /> Okay, most disaster films are typically a $ 1 billion event that is compounded by other circumstances. In this case, the same is the connection of two giant storm systems. So far enough. Oh, stop, no, the "event" is the sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the power grid. <br /> <br /> Next, you take in many elements of human interest - in this case, a deceitful husband, a psychotic weapon - a friend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker to prove it, a senator who tries pushing an agenda, a reporter trying to stand up to "the man" and a pregnant woman getting stuck in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally add a handful of trial events to add to the excitement. <br /> <br /> If the director tried to insert more meaningless plots, there would have been no time for the real catastrophe that was given. The pitiful state of computer graphics was almost certainly the intention. <br /> <br /> Jeez, if you can not convincingly model a truck, you really should not take twisters, explode power plants, tear down Las Vegas or destroy oil stations. <br /> <br /> If you have not already grasped how horrible this movie is, let me add it all. Three baddies are killed in separate and completely inscrutable, implausible manners that stink more of moralizing good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with film students exhausting in the first month, hacking cliche-soaked scripts, but for God's sake, that does not mean anyone has to turn them into movies! <br /> <br /> It does not make the abysmally implausible 10.0 Apocalypse look so awful. Avoid both.
