The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The movie is amazingly bland and bad! When I heard that Damon would play Ripley, I knew that production was doomed to failure. But I did not expect it to be that bad. The actors walk around and look very noticeable. With the exception of Law (and even he is guilty of acting), all actors here are almost amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving your arms or hair should not be considered acting. Damon is miscast. He's way too stiff for a character who's supposed to be a chameleon. Paltrow is an unforgettable experience and Hoffman plays another, seductive, slimy character. Talk about Typecasting. <br /> <br /> What's really unforgivable about the script (written by the overrated director) is that it completely dispenses with all the subtle details of the book and applies many of its own, and none of them work! The addition of jazz music is absolutely wrong! I think Minghella's idea of ​​Italy in the late '50s, early' 60s, is clouded with images of Chet Baker roaming the Italian countryside and spreading. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The movie is bleeding so obviously. This stupid scene, as Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. Very ridiculous Yes, we get the point !!! Every point or detail goes over a mile, so much so that the movie could give viewers the false impression that they have psychic powers. For example, we know that the Blanchett character introduced at the beginning of the film later only reproduces complicated things. And the soundtrack is sometimes completely inappropriate. Whimsical, if it should not be. The movie is too long and in all sorts of senseless directions. There are too many boring characters in the landscape (many who were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Apparently, Minghella's son told his father that Roman Ripley was his favorite. Mr. Minghella went on to refer it as a kind of favor to his son. Well, the director has achieved what he set out to do: The talented Mr. Ripley with his Hitchcock aspirations is a movie designed for 12-year-olds only!
