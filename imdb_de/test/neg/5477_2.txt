This should have been a moody, gloomy film that lingers in memory as a depiction of relationships in which the dominant personality only survives because the dominant personality sees no hope for change. <br /> <br /> Cleverly the dialogue worked, but the film was irritatingly ineffective: too many distance shots that indicated lack of sharpness and not a broader image. Bad River The first 5 minutes could have been missed altogether. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this movie might have been captivating with another editing. <br /> <br /> In its current form, it is flatly shapeless and enormously disappointing.
