Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this movie - good luck for him! He may play 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie, I could not say which "role" he plays in the movie !! ?? OK ... they suck you in the first hour by diving you into dark underground tunnels. Creepy films filmed in dark underground tunnels attract most people easily for the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then you will ask yourself, "Why am I watching this?" I remember thinking how easy it is for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a movie. Just film people wandering in dark tunnels, and you instantly have "suspense." But this movie does not go on! We all wonder what's going to be uneasy at night, but in this movie, there's nothing in this movie but darkness. The story is even worse. There seems to be an underlying story to the film that I learned he saw the movie "after". However, the film uses such a bad dialouge that he never got clear during the performance. I still do not understand what the author / director wanted to say. Some children were trapped underground by a misguided sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time - just like the characters? Are they spirits? <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely terrible movie that made me write my first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
