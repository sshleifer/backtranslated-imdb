I would not recommend this movie. Although classified as G and clearly intended for children, there is quite a bit of cursing (including the dreaded words "F" and "S"). This kind of language does not offend me, but in a children's movie? Come on. <br /> <br /> There was also some implicit sexual content between one of the early male characters and every willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The drama in this genre was as good as it gets, but the plot was very cheesy and even my four year old realized it was "stupid". <br /> <br /> Despite Elizabeth Shue, this movie definitely will not be worth it if you have not seen it.
