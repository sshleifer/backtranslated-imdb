Everything about this show is terrible. His premise is even to get cheap laughs with bad writing. A "disfunctional family" theme has been used too often, especially by the Simpsons. This is a great show with great writing and a lot of laughter. In the meantime, Family Guy has about five minutes of history in each episode, with a lot of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks. Well, if that was original or funny, I would think so. But no, that's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason the episodes are so is because the easiest way is to easily wipe out the episodes after the consequences of this garbage. Much of this show is unoriginal and the original is just lame. It's also surprisingly crude and disrespectful, which in turn can be good if it's still smart. Animation is not everything, but from an artistic point of view, this show fails, proving once again that Family Guy is aiming for so many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible. People like this show and I do not really care, because people can enjoy whatever they want, no matter how much they want the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend that, especially for anyone who wants to study film or become a writer someday. This is a cheap conversation that has little purpose and success. The fact that this is so successful is saying bad things about America.
