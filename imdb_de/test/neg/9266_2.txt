My grandpa gave me this DVD. With such friends. The cover picture looked pretty scary and thought I would see it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie follows three people in a bus and what happens when they get involved with friends. <br /> <br /> The first is about a man who buys a car talks to him. The second is about a man who wakes up and finds a cassarole clone in his fridge. And the third is about a woman doing online dating, but it turns out he has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD case rated this film 18, but even a 5-year-old can see that and not scare or entertain. The film was rated bloody at 12 for mild fears and the dirty word. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is really shitty and does not go near it.
