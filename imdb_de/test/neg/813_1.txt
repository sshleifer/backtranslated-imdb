I gave myself this movie and I have to admit, I'm glad I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box makes it seem like a kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this movie is far from it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the main motive is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the other two characters. There was absolutely nothing that I found interesting at all. <br /> <br /> Even films like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (with which the box tries to compare this film) were fascinating and suspenseful because of the unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> But Jaded has none of that. She focuses on the rape and ill relationship with a friend of theirs. And tracking a videotape that can prove the victim's story is true. <br /> <br /> Although it shows that same-sex rape is possible, it's not a movie that's worth looking at. If at all possible, pass it on at any cost.
