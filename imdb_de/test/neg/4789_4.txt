I agree with the comments on the downward movement. The last views show a little better, but the authors certainly need more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, even though sometimes they dive a bit too much into the "white garbage". Subtlety and nuance are a long way from shows like "Office". I think the target audience is similar as they are both on the same night and in the same line-up. One might think that karma and the whole Eastern religious matter are a big enough topic to bring some other and interesting shows, but they just scratch the surface of the topic. In my opinion, it shows the contempt of many people in Hollywood about the degree of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more exciting content. It has been proven in many other shows.
