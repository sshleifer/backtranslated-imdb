I have seen this movie twice in the past six months (which I have to go through to make sure it is not). The first consideration brought me half crazy and babbling. The second visit at 5am on a rainy morning was a little better. Only once he screamed in pain. <br /> <br /> It seems that Pocona (The Aztec Mummy) had a certain Aztec princess who should "keep her girl". Obviously, they gave each other the business and were put to death for it (now it's hard!) But before they are the film, he tries to kill us with a screaming Aztekenzeremonie. The singing will make your ears bleed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate and a bracelet guarded by this intricate mob, Pocona. This time, Pocona looks like he's on a 2,000-year-old Bender looking for the desecrated of his grave. His groaning and moaning sounds like he's The Bad Case of Montezuma's Revenge (or he's read the script for this movie). That will stink your breath. <br /> <br /> An evil Dr. Von Krupp seems to want the Aztec treasure (possibly to finance drama lessons and script lessons for cast & crew). He is called The Bat because in the bane of the Aztec mummy he wore a bat like a cape, a hat and something like a ski mask over his face. It's better than the Laughing Fat Man. <br /> <br /> The bat in typical crazy science fashion wants to rule the world. He emphasizes this by rolling his eyes, laughing with laughter and chewing the landscape. He cobbled together an invincible robot. Looks like the bot was made from a garbage bin, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 Buick. A company even accepts recognition for making this tin can! <br /> <br /> Well, the mighty showdown between Pocona and the robot takes place in Mama's new crypt, which was previously homeless. <br /> <br /> About half of this film is from "La Aztec Momia", never released in the US in its original form, but in a hacked atrocity by Jerry Warren (see my review of "Attack Of The Maya Mummy ") and" Curse Of The Aztec "Mummy." The robot is frankly stupid like most characters, and if that does not make you laugh, it will not be. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad that he got one, but after seeing "Mayan Mummy" (which deserves a movie that deserves to be burned) and watching "Robot" again, he gets a 3rd see any expectations, then it can be naively pleasant.
