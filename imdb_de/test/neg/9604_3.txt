Alright! A sci-fi / horror / action B hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski. In the final scenes we see a cyborg with a shelled metal head that kills several people! As with any Wynorski movie, he throws away a lot of crazy ideas and subplots that usually go nowhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like a two-movie prize-for-one deal. On the one hand, we got the drama / thriller part (as such, the movie opens), in which Carol Alt killed her incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband (a conspiracy that simply does not work). On the other hand, we got the "fleeing cyborg on the rage", "Night of the Living Dead" style. Carol and the cyborg are the ones locked up in the house and a bunch of special OPs / bounty hunters playing the role of zombies trying to invade the house. Needless to say, this strip is not the biggest one up there. Especially Zach Galligan (from "Gremlins" -Fame) is painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a minor role) is completely wasted in this movie again. Wynorski even rips off one of his own films here, as I'm 99% sure that he used some footage of his previous film "976 EVIL II" (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle). Yes, it's not that good and it's so much fun. This only applies to Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them, if you did not know it yet.
