Stinker on the bottom of the barrel is so bad that it is scary. The "conspiracy" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the movie he's called "military advisor", but it's not really clear if he's in the American military or not) and the army of a Latin American land battle helps guerrillas who join the guerrillas when the government turns against him, is imprisoned and tortured. Shannon Tweed is a "sporting goods saleswoman," whom he picks up in a bar that engages in the intrigue. Because of this description, the movie actually sounds better than it is because it is actually a stinker of almost biblical proportions. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed becomes the most professional actor. If this is not just an indication of what a junk of this Twelve-turkey junk is, then there's nothing wrong with sounding a music score that sounds like it's from a Z-class horror band (" Z ") (and can be very good) To use the same material (ie armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle path) constantly for some of the least staged" action "scenes lately, this laughing sludgefest must be perceived as disbelieving , Tweed looks bored, Brown looks over, and when that thing's done - if you can last so long; I could not - you just know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and shootings, this can not be considered as an "action" image. It is boring (there is a scene in the back of a truck where everyone just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repeating (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" are killed over and over again), illogical (when a group of Rebels are caught in the open field by a government helicopter helicopter instead of bringing them under cover, they just stand there staring at them) (unsuitable (soldiers and rebels fall "dead" when no shots are heard) Firearms in a house where fighters who stand on walls are shot at with machine guns, but miraculously the walls escape undamaged) (predictable) (If the "governor" says he should offer a reward for Brown's capture because "someone "throw it off, you know exactly who that 'someone' will be and it turns out to be exactly what you thought it was) and just stupid (pretty much everything else) in the picture). Unable, brainless and stupid, unbelievable. Do not waste your time.
