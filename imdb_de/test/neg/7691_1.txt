This crap is not worth a critical meeting, so I'm writing information for those who do not know the background of this movie. First of all, it's not the first Saudi movie, they used this false information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Second, they did not deserve it, so they chose the jerkin (Hesham) that won the Star Academy (like Big Brother). This is a popular show, and the jerkin Hesham is popular but stupid, cheesy and untalented. Then the famous Kuwaiti actor was selected Mohammed Al Sairafi (also stupid & untalented), but has a popular one (count how many times I use the word "popular", then email me to get your prize, however ..) has a popular show and the Jordanian actress Corn Hamdan who appeared in the POPular comic show CBM (inglorious) she is famous * PoPular! Then they chose some Saudi actors for .. bla bla bla bla. The funniest thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I believe the identity of the film is the identity of his director) .. Wait a minute! The script was written by an Egyptian scriptwriter (very horrible!) With some help from the Lebanese critic (known as a critic, who is actually a money collector). This group of multi-racial (money-slaves) does not know about Saudi culture, it does not represent it, but knowing who is behind this trash will make all our questions easier. Waleed bin Talaal is a Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who is not interested in Saudi culture or for the Saudi Arabians he does not live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives, he will live in his own world, his World is far away from the real world (the human world), so he does not know or care about anything, except to increase his endless fortune. <br /> <br /> * Non-Saudi film (no movie) . <br /> <br /> Screw them all in. <br /> <br /> Beep of 10!
