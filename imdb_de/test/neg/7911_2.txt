Someone has opted for a "black version" of Airplane. <br /> <br /> Someone has decided to make a very bad "black version" of Airplane, really bad "black version" of Airplane, which had no humor after the first twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> Someone has decided to build a really, really bad "black version" of Airplane after the first twenty minutes they instead spent with insulting the intelligence of the audience and the performers. <br /> <br /> This film managed to violate the laws of physics by simultaneously sucking and blowing. At least it deserves to be remembered for this achievement. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. A really very bad thing. Dismantling point by point would be a waste of time. The best thing to say about the movie is that there was a purple plane in it. Do yourself a favor ... buy a picture of a purple plane and you'll get the most out of what this movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> This definitely belongs to the category "What the! ^ @@ & *! did you think ????"
