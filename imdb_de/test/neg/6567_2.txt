While Star Trek's film was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is just plain bad. In this dreadful sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they receive a distress signal from the Federation that Earth Ambassadors Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon homeworld) have been abducted by a rogue Vulcan striving for a spaceship dare in the big barrier. There he hopes to find God. With mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the Enterprise's senior officers to betray Kirk and seize the ship. They reach the inside of the Great Barrier and find a planet where they encounter a godlike alien. This is so bad that it's hard to figure out where to start. At the core is a good idea that was never really developed. The action goes nowhere where no one has gone before. It's almost as if the authors have no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes do not have the tension of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale. Now I will focus on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego becomes bigger. The focus is mainly on him, Spock and McCoy, but the other is not enough to do. While Shatner is usually drowned out in previous movies and TV commercials, he's just bad in this movie. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical joker and stupid. One of the worst scenes is that the three leaders sing the song "Row Row Row your Boat" in a round of campfires. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek series. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.
