Live-action version of Dragonball over Taiwan. <br /> <br /> The evil Lord comes down to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls ... er beads that, when brought together, make a dragon appear and fulfill your wish. A lot of action and bad comedy follows. <br /> <br /> What can I say that "the best way to watch this movie is with lots of drunken but funny friends", is not it? I dont know. This is a really bad but funny way how really bad movies can be. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen where you can see the wires. It's a live action cartoon and not far removed from what I've seen from the series, that makes me anxious to select this movie because of the big American movie version that is being shot now. If you see it sober (like me), avoid it.
