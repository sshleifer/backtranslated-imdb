I never understood this kind of parody movies. You get a serious / semi-serious movie that everyone knows and takes the seriousness out of immature fart jokes and such. We have seen it many times and it has never been funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you do not understand in my opinion. This seems to be one of the less obscure and less popular genres, though I honestly do not see anything that is much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. As the title clearly states, this film focuses on making fun of pulp fiction. This is the main reason why I decided to look at it, as I found this film to overrate Tarantino's sick mind overly yielding and powerful. I had hoped for one or two good jokes and made fun of the too violent and pointless type of film that Pulp Fiction was in every way, in my (far from it) humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is pretty much a rip-off of Tarantino's film, with a few scenes that deceive others, often better movies in the same childish and humorless way. The pace is bad, and often you sit there and can guess the outcome of every scene, predicting every joke, often thinking of a better place leaning out of your head. Acting is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes and intentionally paperless to make fun of the characters they are based on. The problem is that it does not work. It just makes the movie harder to prevail. The humor is youthful and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they have managed to find actors who look like the people they should look like. The movie is a terrible waste of the actual actors involved. Maybe something entertaining for fans of the typical parody films of the same kind. I recommend this only to people who have really detested Pulp Fiction or fans of the sugar parody films. All others: avoid. 1.10
