My question is: what was the worst part of this movie? Was it the acting? Director script ?. Maybe it was the waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and especially Ladd are capable of bringing extreme sinfulness into play. In this movie, it was hard to tell who the evil was. Granted, Ladd played a covert good, but even in his good roles he could be very frustrating. So the net result was a potentially good movie that robbed any sense of conflict.
