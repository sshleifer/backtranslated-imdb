The first word I can find to describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all, the plot is a very thin plot (Wont comments below) and a plot that follows many movies from this genre. This makes the movie so bad because you know what's going to happen. Second, the film contains many questions that will never be revealed. One of the questions (and this is not a spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE CHILDREN WHO DO IN THIS MEASURE !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sad actors. They are as bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it's a horror movie. You're supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you're not afraid, you're not terrified because you know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! I was hoping it was a very good movie, but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the movie raises many questions, and because it's not scary, the movie is best unseen.
