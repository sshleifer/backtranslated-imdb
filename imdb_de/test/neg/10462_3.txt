Construction workers disturb the Indian burial ground of a large, giant skeleton monster that disintegrates its victims through touch, breath or bone sword! Krantz (Jim Storm), the headhoncho of the resort project, orders his construction crew to keep their skeletal finds a secret, and development would be halted when the nearby Katona tribe got wind blown and disturbed. The aging Bruce Boxleitner, sympathetic as always, is Sheriff Evans, who wants to keep peace between the Katonas and Krantz's crew. The peace was tense at best, but with this skeleton monster, which makes the victims disappear without restraint, Krantz will soon get answers to the question of why members of his crew are missing. Evans also loses citizens. Evans is warned by Katona's Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) that an old demon, the Bone Eater, has been loosened and can only be stopped with a holy war-ax. The gun then threw itself into the backseat of his daughter Kellys (Clara Bryant, the close Wearing jeans and shirts to show how dad's girl has become a pretty flashy woman). Evans must defeat the demon somehow when the killing stops ... and this must happen before the Eclipse or its power becomes too strong to defeat. <br /> <br />. The CGI is not very good, although the monster with a better budget could have been threatening. A horse is riding out of dust chasing its prey for petesake! Some cameo appearances include BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evans Deputy Big Jim, Walter Koenig of STAR TREK as Coroner and HOUSE William Katt as Country Doctor taking care of the injuries of Evan's deputy. None of these camsos take more than a minute or so ... really. Adoni Maropis impresses in a signed role as brooding Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use the Bone Eater to drive the Whites out of the land of his tribe. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a tasty dish of a Katona woman whose hatred of Black Hawk lurks on the whites, and wishes Evans to follow his Indian blood when it comes to putting an end to the Bone Eating monster. It pays to get through when Boxleitner is dressed in war paint and Indian garb. To be honest, I felt for the actor when Bruce tried to make a straight face in such a horrible movie. In another overworked and boring clich√©, Bruce Sheriff has an alienated relationship with his daughter, whose 17s are getting hotter and want to date the "bad boy" .. though this is ultimately a signed subplot, the act about the killing skeleton and many of the poorly developed characters.
