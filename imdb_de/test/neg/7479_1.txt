He seems to be a control freak. I heard him commenting on "losing control of the show" and telling another guest who brought live animals he had a rule - "no snakes". He has to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I see him is that he has some great guests and bands. <br /> <br /> I've seen the Craig Ferguson show for a while, but his show is even worse. He likes to burn bulls to burn time. I do not think one of the men has a big future in late night talk shows. <br /> <br /> Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking out his tongue to lick his lips. He has to do this at least ten times a show. I like the Joe Firstman band. Carson Daily needs to lighten up before it's too late.
