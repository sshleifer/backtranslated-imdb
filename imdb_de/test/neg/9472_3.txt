The aging Roger Moore has returned as Bond, trying to figure out why Agent 009 was killed and why he faked a Faberge egg and where it came from. He lands in New Delhi, India, then in the GDR, after learning of a Russian general who wanted to detonate a nuclear bomb in a circus the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the way it sounds, this is more of a romance between Bond and Octopussy than an action movie, rather tedious, but still a bit funny. But there are far too many humor attempts in this; Sometimes it seems like it should be a comedy. Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in that respect, so there was no big difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Useless Little Things: The small plane Bond used in the Pre-Credits sequence now hangs in a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater, Florida, USA ** 1 / 2 of ****
