I have to say that this movie was not what I expected. Although I have not read the book, the fact that plants can bait and then wait until a murder happens just to have a body removed for lunch is the worst scenario anyone can imagine. With the title ruins one would think that from 3000 years would be a kind deity or an ancient animal or God the perpetrator. It's like some other movie where you got the impression that it's strange that the villagers are most scared but not a crocodile. Either way, this film was such that it tempts you to think about the ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore that lead to awakening, and the old god or humans had a different ordinance or something similar. But plants? ... well, is there nothing the producers can imagine to inspire a crowd? As far as this movie is concerned, he will reach the 'b' list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore were outstanding but could not make up for the rest of the movie. And a plant that mimics the sound of a cell phone or the voices of people is just too much to be believed. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereo fan who relies on bloody or mechanical effects. I rely on great tension and what will bring the next scene for more excitement. The thing had a better story than this. Even the ring made me jump even more, but the ruins are just that ... ruined because they used a plant to make sacrifices to kill or be killed by the villagers. The premise was in order for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and salt, but still a simple blowtorch and plenty of napalm can make the trick easy to end these annoying plants with a meat eating disorder.
