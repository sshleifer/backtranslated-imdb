Most predictable movie I've ever seen ... extremely boring, I feel like I watched a hundred films with the same action as this one. Acting is OK at best, there is really no action and there is definitely no thrill. Capable actors with horrible script I think it could have been written better by a 10th student. I felt it was a tedious job, hoping that there would be something in the film that would make it stand out from all the other garbage, but that fit into the pile. I waited the whole movie for something good to happen, but it never came. I never rate movies and never judge movies, but this movie was so bad that I had to log in here and post a review to try to save some poor souls to spend time (and / or money) on this movie waste. I robbed it and wished I had never wasted disk space. If I spent $ 10 for it, I would kill myself.
