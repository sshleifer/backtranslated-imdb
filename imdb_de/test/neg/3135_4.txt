First of all, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This movie was obviously not aimed at the masses. It's the guy critics would like to see. The hype and the advertising were pretty misleading. <br /> <br /> I had expected something very dramatic like Devdas. I understand that the story and the period require it, and I found the movie extremely slow. <br /> <br /> I am a diehard Aishwarya fan and regret that I thought she was a failure. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who could portray herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. Everyone else has shown a good performance. Tagore's depiction of the human condition encounters the celluloid and gives the film an interesting topic.
