It's the one movie I almost got out of and my friends would not have been to the cinema with me. Usually, even though I do not like a movie, I think it's worth it to endure to the end. In this way, you can really claim to have given every chance to save yourself. But with the Million Dollar Hotel it was so horrible that I wanted the experience to end as soon as possible. I think I probably would not have been so disappointed if this movie had been made by a smaller director, who usually did not like me so much. But from Wenders, it was all the more shocking to see. I know Bono from U2, a good friend of Wenders, who wrote the script for this abysmal movie, and I wonder why Wenders knows him as well as the two. "Staying at work, Bono," is a phrase that comes to my mind when you look at this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of all sorts of contemporary film stereotypes, a naive and transparent attempt to be crazy and bold, with the most irritating characters I've ever seen, especially the leaders Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich, and Mel Gibson usually does not like. The happiest ending I could wish for would have been that an atomic bomb had fallen on their collective heads to get everything over with as quickly as possible. On the positive side, the first five minutes of the movie are extremely good, with an extremely rousing soundtrack from U2. But the opening shots of the film make the rest of the film (which requires a spectacular plunge from there) all the more disappointing, as it is a promise of cinema quality that just never gets delivered, not even close.
