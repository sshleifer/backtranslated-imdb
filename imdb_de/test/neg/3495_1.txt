I had gone to the movies and expected to see a great movie based on all the word of mouth and great reviews. As soon as the opening sequence started, I knew I was in trouble. The music and the credits were trying so hard to trigger emotions that I wanted to puke. All I got from this movie was clich√©d characters, dialogues and an emotionless screenplay. Director and author Paul Haggis has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative, self-righteous writing, but it does not deceive me. some services were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is a bit overrated, but he was decent. ridiculous was also a lot in the nose. He should stay knocking. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression. I can not find anything interesting about her. Sandra Bullock is always the same in every movie, she's just okay. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching him at work. Ryan Philippe was good too. But as for the script and the bad direction, that's actually one of those movies that are so annoying that I took the time to write about it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, which is a waste of time.
