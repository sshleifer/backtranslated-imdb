The first time I saw this show, everything was fine. There were some funny moments and I laughed a few times, but this show is getting worse. The web show of Carly and Sam is NOT the smallest bit funny. They play a stupid video from the internet, yell into the camera and make some bad jokes. And then the laughter starts! A problem with the show is that none of the main characters is funny. Carly is not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's acting is lackluster at best. Her acting on this show is nothing to do with her acting by Drake And Josh. Her boyfriend Sam is very rude and rude and the show is written to look like a backwoodsman. I mean, they joke that their mother drives a rusty old truck, her mother smashes an old television set with a bat, and then there's jokes about Sam failing at school, locked up all the time, and running into cops , None of it is funny. Then there's Freddy, a computer geek. He is not too funny if his mother does not treat him like a baby. The only slightly funny full-time character of the show is Carly's brother Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things, like pretending to drive a spaceship while making spaceship sounds and knocking over a cookie-cutter biscuit table to avenge themselves for doing the same to him. Only his material is worth laughing at. Aside from the characters, the show also makes other things bad. Like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from an apartment in Seattle have been a global success, giving them a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is, like a 26-year-old single-type without a real job paying for a 2-story apartment in downtown Seattle and raising his 13-year-old sister and paying for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote-controlled projector Can a green screen and an HD camera? That sounds like it was written by a 10-year-old. The worst part is that the show contains pretty questionable content. There are a few times when Carly (remember a 13-year-old girl) appears in a bikini top on her internet web show. WTF? Then I saw an episode in which Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he "only slept in his socks the night before". I mean WTF? Then there is an episode in which Carly's rival Nevel blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to return the site for a kiss. Creepy! I have just seen an episode in which Carly meets a boy who has just moved to her apartment building. He has back injuries, takes off his shirt and Carly stands there and drooling over him. I can not believe that Nick allows them to show such things, and I can not believe that this was done by the same man responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under 12 and that is even questionable. iCarly is just another addition to the long list of awesome Nick programming.
