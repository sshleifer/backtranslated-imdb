German emigree and over-hamburger actor Paul Muni, who has never seen a scene he did not want to give up, plays "blackface" to play a modest Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and entering the world up works. If this squeaky vehicle reminds you of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultivated Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE, do not be too surprised. The characters are quite similar, and both are struck wildly when the script demands it. Hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by Muni's superior performance as this dizzying Mexican lives the American dream and the consequences are condemned. I think Benicio DelToro's grandfather was unavailable. A young, bleached blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests; She eventually goes crazy because of her love for Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute shout, Davis is the only reason to watch this racist attack. In the end, it's absolutely crazy when Muni asks the wife of his dreams to marry him - a white breeding animal with one of those stilted, stage-like 1930s accents that Hollywood loved so much - and she calls him a wild and an animal of " another tribe ". Muni immediately turns into Mr. Hyde and chases her prematurely to death. In the final scene, a penitent Muni tells his sober priest that he is returning to his own people. End of the movie Finis. That's all you wrote. Muni allegedly hired a Mexican Geno oo-ine as a chauffeur to study the language pattern and physical habits of this exotic creature. Yowza!
