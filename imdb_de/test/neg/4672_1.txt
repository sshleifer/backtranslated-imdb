I like action movies. I have a soft spot for "B" flicks with bad dialogue and playing wood. So I crushed my brain to imagine one of my guilty pleasures worse than this blockbuster. I can not. It would be hard for you to put together a bigger piece of Cr * p than Bruce Willis' vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of "super-drills" flying away to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the earth Realistic? Not really It's an action movie, I'm not exaggerating the premise. <br /> <br /> Minor Spoiler: <br /> <br /> The film opens with a few scenes introducing the menace and the characters Bruce Willis is the team's toughest leader and spends his first time chasing Ben Affleck with a rifle to find the unforgivable act of sleeping with his daughter, which for some reason did not make me laugh everything enforced in this movie. <br /> <br /> The team is called because it's the only people in the whole world that can drill the asteroid, okay, I'm ready to accept that premise if it's us brings to action - the supposed meat of Fi lms. More humor attempts, where every character makes something crazy, crazy thing before it starts. Again lame. Finally they move out. Here, the movie really impressed me. They arrive on the rock and get to work. If you believe it, nothing works and everything has an exciting countdown! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... One - Oh, surprise, we saved the day again !! <br /> <br /> And do not even catch me with the jerky camera work. When I saw it in the theater, I thought I was going to get sick. I can only assume that they tried to cover up the huge holes created by the threadbare performances by cutting them off every few seconds for another shot (and by someone who grew up on MTV - Mr. Short Attention span itself) Just when I thought it could not get any worse ... Wait - there's a ready tearjerker ending that was pegged up so the rest of the movie became a virtual citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Summary: The jokes were not funny. The plot - well, I said I would let go of one. The acting was bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob could not get over the script, which was worse. Camerawork - bad again. (I did not even mention the stupidest love scene in the history of moving pictures - think of Animal Cracker). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10 (I give half a point for Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times when I could see the lovable Liv Tyler and tried to ignore her acting performance? This is by far the worst movie I've seen in the theater ... ever.
