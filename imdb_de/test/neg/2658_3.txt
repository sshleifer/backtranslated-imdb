So much great chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story gained momentum about their relationship, the script cut it off and handled some irrelevant negotiation that did not advance the story. In fact, the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all. They were like commercial breaks in which you saw a trailer for another movie. <br /> <br /> The writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously did not trust to write convincingly about relationships and the inner workings of their characters. They seemed uncomfortable, unless they proposed gun battles and bar fights. Or they did not trust the audience to look for a story about a man and a woman who wanted to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. <br /> <br /> Had the relationship between Kay and Dutch been more developed and allowed to play out, the authors would have known how to end the story. This film is a disappointment because he did not do more with his wonderful actors, who performed well, but could have done more with a better script.
