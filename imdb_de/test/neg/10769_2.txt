By now I've read almost all the books and seen the music production in two different languages. I absolutely admired everything I knew before. But lately I've run out of resources to keep my imagination alive. I still have a few books left, but they are either in transit or are the sequels that I'm in no hurry to read. So an idea came to me - sink me! There are films that I have not seen! So I have to see her immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of this series were ... acceptable. In fact, I really enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, whatever it seemed. From there everything went downhill. Chauvelin was too fiddly? And I think, too old for this role. Not nearly that dark and dashing figure with its terrible either-or. (And what about that random bed scene that showed him? It was too scary - was not his only love the Madame Guillotine and his only interest - his job and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... Prettiest woman in France? The smartest woman in Europe? I do not think so. Whatever forced them to break into the study of Sir Percy, I have not the slightest idea. And what did my Lord Tony do to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the League promised his life to Sir Percy, but he would never have endangered any of them or run away like a coward when his dear friend is in mortal danger. And if he had to mourn his companion in any case, he would have done that, grieving, not further, as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His portrayal was extremely terrible. He was neither a lazy guy nor a brave and elusive hero who is a master of transformation. He was not particularly interested in him either (his pronunciation of this word alone blew my ears). He had never killed anyone with his own hands. So, what if he happened to be running around slaughtering people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were just too flashy during this period. This is the postrevolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in such clothes easily stand out in a crowd. It was just ... gah! <br /> <br /> Although, I have to admit, after looking at other parts, my opinion has changed a bit. It was bearable, as a separate work, regardless of the Scarlet Pimpernel series. Only your other average hero in the mask. But for what they tried to do, it is still miserable.
