Seriously, I could not find anything that made up a rational human thought in this movie. For some reason, the author decided to have a number of actors in random places, grunting, crawling and roaring like cro-magnon bipeds. I understand that it was gymnastics, but seriously, what about all the roaring and human bleating? I have also seen at least five actors with Overactive Terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has real human acrobatics, I have to say that it's surprising that you can make a movie like this without understanding anything about the shape of human speech patterns. This is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking, as there was no conscious decision to make the characters express more than a contemporary Urrrrr! or rfff! Volume. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable.
