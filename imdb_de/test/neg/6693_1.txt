Of all the rave reviews we could not wait to see this show. We love shaky humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I agree that this may not be a fair report as we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we could not endure any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever seen on TV - it felt like it was 15 hours. The songs may be (mildly) interesting for themselves, but being inserted in the middle of a story scene during an endless 3-minute scene just does not work. <br /> <br /> We are now trying to clear the memory. If you want a wonderful down-under humor in a sexy and engaging movie, read "The Dish" instead.
