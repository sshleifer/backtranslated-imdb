Wow, there's a lot of poison for this movie, and a lot of it is deserved, but it's not the worst movie ever. (That's probably "Zoolander".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk or just in the mood for a "B-minus-minus" movie, make fun of it That may be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others said, the first part of the movie makes you think that you are watching an update to the Bram Stoker novel. Two of the main characters are called Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is the Demeter and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. Later, you find out that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original and that he happened to be on a ship with Dracula in the 30th century. Suuuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh, and to add originality, this movie "Spooky Ghost Ship" has another character named Ash. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There is a paper-thin character development and anachronisms like the above-mentioned manual wheelchair and Coolio and Tom Lister who speak the black slang of the 20th century. But what makes the movie really ridiculous is the end. If that's what happens to the characters, the last two hours have been a waste. <br /> <br /> Like I said, you want to play "Mystery Science Theater" with a stupid movie, and your thoughts are about the same mode used to display the Great Vegetable Rebellion episode of LOST IN SPACE is required, then you may find that this distracts. Otherwise, put a stake in it, it's done.
