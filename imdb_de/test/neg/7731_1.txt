I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, I'm sorry to say, and it was one of the few films I ever wanted to go out of. I had no problem with the drug content and I could see how this caution story could be powerful. The problem was that the filmmaker, who worked with James Woods and Sean Young, drew two of the least lovable characters I've ever seen in the movie. I hated this couple and could not mind if it had dropped straight to the inevitable bottom. They were no surprise in this movie. Every turn was so painful that I could have written the script myself; Although I like to think I would have done a better job. As a result, I heard nightmarish stories about the incidents between Sean Young and James Woods on set along a kind of stalking event. I wondered if the terrible action came from bad feelings and malfunctions. Anyway, I call The Boost the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
