"Scientists in a remote lab continue to experiment (use a scaly creature here) to create monsters that are out of control, and in the meantime, a cracked military team / daughter of the scientist / bank robber find their way to the remote location and become huge One after another is eaten, all during an "exciting" race so as not to be blown up by the forces that initially created the monsters ... "The sad thing is that after about a dozen films sounds that have appeared on the sci-fi channel. I have to wonder what's going on. Sure ... I like it when Bimbos and Hollywood hunk wannabes are eaten by CGI animals as well as the next person ... but where is the storyline or originality? Granted, there are times when the sci-fi channel is lit. Battlestar Galactica can be very good, if a little dark. Writers have continued to pump life into the various Stargate offerings, and Doctor Who's latest BBC import is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various "giant animal" movies on Sci-Fi, the animation seems to be getting better and better. Compare the Kommodo in this movie with the somewhat awkward version of the first huge Kommodo movie on sci-fi. <br /> <br /> But God ... how about another plot? Maybe another, huge creature? On a whim, I started searching the internet. Under the litter I found some interesting stories that could appeal to SF fans and unemployed Russian CGI animators alike. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with the suggestion that they turn to the author for the rights to the story. (The story contains violent images that are generally comparable to those of various sci-fi channel offerings.) The story contains subplots, ethical and moral comments on the nature of humanity and does not end in one of them terrible "did they really kill all the monsters? ?? " Moments, but lets you guess completely and in a completely different way of thinking. <br /> <br /> Which is what science fiction should do in general, no?
