OK, about 11 years ago, the fantastic, funny movie "The Mask" came out and everyone thought it was great and now, 11 years later, the mask gets fixed in this fantastic movie, right? NOT CORRECT!!!!!!!!!! This movie was the stupidest movie I have ever seen !! I mean, when I rented it, I thought I was laughing so hard that I almost pissed my pants from the first. but after seeing this "sequal", I even made a giggle. I mean, not an insult to the director or the cast of this film, but what a waste of time and money. So the story of the whole story was about this little baby who had a part of the mask in it, and that bad guy is looking for something, because that's all I really got. So it would be higher than 2 of 10 stars.
