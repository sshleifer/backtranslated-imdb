When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it was not long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show appeared to exploit the hustle and bustle. We had seen a similar incident the year before, when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with this hero's great movie debut. Businesses take the opportunity to drive the financial carriages of a hot brand. <br /> <br /> The fact that this image never appeared on the shelves of Wal-Mart while the heroes owned the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I think everyone would prefer to forget it. To be honest, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me put it another way. It's not as uninteresting as all his negative reviews suggest. <br /> <br /> The veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you can not remember any of his roles) performs as Reed Richards, the brilliant, way scientist who, together with his crew after a space accident bizarre forces acquires. He has the ability to stretch and cripple. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), may suddenly become invisible, while her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can now ignite at will. Then there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the lovable approach whose body turns into a mass of rugged, orange rocks. <br /> <br /> Just as the friends get used to all this, they are called to save the world from some chaos. It seems Reed's old colleague Victor of Doom (Joseph Culp) lives up to his name, and this vicious jeweler (Ian Trigger) does not help old ladies crossing the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course you can; Like in any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when. <br /> <br /> What is striking about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in almost every aspect. The dialogue is so lame and tired that it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. The acting is so unpolished that a third-rate afternoon soap opera looks like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good given the tiny budget, but there are still positive embarrassing moments. For example, when The Human Torch completely ignites his body, the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon. I can just hear this production meeting. "Oh, nobody will notice, you will be too fascinated by the action!" I really mean a cartoon? At least give me a mannequin, which is held by a string! Before that, the scene in which the fours come to Earth after the crash of their spaceships is just a teenage age. The crew simply found a field and lit a vague spaceship-like object. That's the only remnant of such a disaster. <br /> <br /> Of course there was not much work in the script. There is a fairly coherent story, but everything is so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they just come by the House of Storms and ask if they want to join them. Is it really that simple? Does this kind of thing, oh I do not know, require years of education and expertise? Not in the world of these writers who seem to have been inspired by the underrated genius shown in FULL HOUSE. As bad as that may be, nothing can be said with the painful clich√© of Dr. Ing. Doom be compared. He was drawn straight out of those terrible superhero cartoons of the 1960s, to the point of bad laughter, banging his fist on the table to underline his remarks. No comic book, least of all Fantastic Four, has ever shown a villain so obscenely one-dimensional. Ultimately, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from a complete turkey because it's so damned innocent. You can tell the people involved as little talent or experience as they have actually tried. They did not know that the end result would be so embarrassing. They had the impression that this was their big break, that people would pour into the theaters. It's a repetition that they had almost no money to work with (and I'm sure half of it was eaten up by the cool thing-thing). All in all, they worked well, and for the many mistakes, the finished product is a lot of fun for comic fans.
