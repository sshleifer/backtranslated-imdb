After Kenneth Opel's sweeping story of animation had brought me back to the joy of reading in elementary school, I had high hopes for this series. The story of a subterranean bat traveling across the country to unite with its colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imagination. When I heard this series, I started browsing the Bardel Animation website and liked what I saw. The character design looked impressive and the fast action seemed to extend over a thirteen episode arc. Much was my disappointment when I decided to watch a rerun in the early morning. <br /> <br /> The opening episode features our hero, Shade Silverwing, following a tiger butterfly in the dead of night. An echoing song is suppressed, and we see a skilful, coarse CGI effect illuminating the moth, and the hunt takes a frenetic turn, while the tiny insect makes numerous illusory copies of itself that deceive its pursuer. As a lover of biology, I had a decent understanding of the principles (tiger moths can sense the sounds their predators use for echolocation, and make their own sound cover), but without such an explanation, I would certainly have been lost. A small mistake, I thought. Surely they will fill us out shortly. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> As soon as our protagonist is down with some of his colleagues, we are confronted with the most boring conversations I've ever seen on TV. Chinook, the rival of Shade's childhood, mocks the smallest hero with the stupidest lines I've ever seen on a show. I can understand the authors who do not produce Shakespeare, but you'd think they had social contact in their lives - certainly enough to make communication seem natural. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> The voice was not disgusting, but hardly a shining example of human achievement. "Oh shadow, you broke the law!" Shade's mother sighs empty. "You have to come with me, boy." croaks Frieda, the damned elder of the column of Silverwings. The actors try, but it does not matter much at this point, as the story gets less and less exhausting by the minute, minute by minute. <br /> <br /> While each episode deals with a problem of the week, as is common in most television series, cross-story arcs pervade the saga, for the better and worse. While the main point of Shade's story is reunion with his family, later episodes pick up other narrative artefacts, including Cannibalistic Bats from the Southern Jungle and a brewing war between birds and beasts. The authors try to do too much at once and are struggling to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hope that they will grab the public's interest to continue the bloody show. Unfortunately, these attempts are futile to anyone except the eight- to ten-year-olds to whom this show is directed. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see the Canadian media being immortalized, but it would be sweeter if the enjoyment of The Series was not limited to the immediate family of animators or foaming fans of Kenneth Oppel's books , There are worse things that your children might see than Silverwing, but there are also far better programs. Pass the mediocrity and read the books instead.
