* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an amazing movie, unlike anything else. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. Not only did he violate the rules, but he also broke a whole new set of rules. <br /> <br /> Here is the spoiler: There is absolutely nothing new, new or original about this film. Gus Van Sant is not only a tribute to Hitch, he tears off every idea and does so in a less original, conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and thought that My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question that burns in my mind when it comes to the remake of Psycho is, "Why did you do it, Gus?" <br /> <br /> In my eyes, there are only two reasons to do a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie was bad. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone was thinking of a new, new approach to the material. None of these factors are ever present in the Gus Van Sant version of Psycho. Apart from the fact that it is in color and there is a scene in which there is a montage of disturbing images relating to the possible inner dialogue of the title character (which I considered unnecessary), there is nothing new here /> Also, the casting left something to be desired. Anne Heche did well as a Marion, but lacked a certain vulnerability that Janet Leigh represented in the original. I did not like her character so much because the choices she faced as a woman were much less limited in today's society than in the decisions she made as a single woman in the early 1960s. Vince Vaughn laughed a bit at portraying an incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I think Anthony Perkins timing and his nervous, haunted look were far more effective. The only performance I enjoyed better than the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. As usual she was excellent and brought the character a new strength and intelligence. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some nice camera works, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" where Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to make the murder in vivid nuances of purple demonstrate. And yet throughout the movie I had that irritating feeling of Deju Vu. Have not I seen this somewhere? Oh wait, I've seen that somewhere! Almost every scene seems to have been filmed for the original. One almost has the feeling that the director has made this film as a school project. "See, I can do a Hitchcock movie too!" <br /> <br /> If you are not there yet, have a look at the original. It is kept over the years and certainly surpasses this piece of mediocrity. You will not be disappointed.
