That's pretty tame for a Norris movie. It's pretty boring for an action movie, and as far as predictability goes, my friend and I had nailed almost all the film's spins. It was nice that the killer's individual features were not telegraphed by the clich√©s of the '80s action movies, but only come, the only unpredictable step overriding the action and arrangement of the cut. Mainly it is said that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few known actors) only kills women. YET, he suddenly stops his M.O. and kill men, right? I suspect it can somehow be constructed and rationalized, but why is the film being edited to kill women? <br /> <br /> I'm sure there's a reason (eg building suspense), but why spend time when many other suspense movies are outstanding? <br /> <br /> Fans of "Renegade" may enjoy the little cameo of Branscombe Richmond as Victor, but his brief appearance can not save the movie, and even a voice of 4 is generous. <br /> <br />
