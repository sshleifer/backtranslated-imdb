I saw this movie when it first hit the cinemas in 1988, and although I knew it was not an award-winning caliber ... I kinda liked it. It tells the story of 5 former Boy Scouts, who come together again to take over the only task they never had to complete as children - climbing the mountain. Whitehead Of course, the Boy Scouts have grown up and developed their personality in different ways, but also as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still a kind of Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the group's surfer type. Of course, the top star is Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in everything Cub Scout is all about. He still lives in the same house with his mother, still goes through the Cub Scout manual every day, is brave, awesome and clean and is the one who unites the others into another great scouting adventure. Their task, however, consists of the wells Grunski, which were drummed by the above two bullies from the Cub Scouts. By chance, they come into their old cave and decide to bother them a little, if harmless. Not so safe are three escaped prisoners who believe that Pack 7 comes from the FBI and intends to wipe it out. All in all, the movie still has a lot of charm. Watch Richard Lewis trying to be comfortable in a folding bed, for example, and you have a really funny piece for you. Upon further discussion, the entire movie needed more of this kind of observational humor. It does not hold up well after all these years, but still remains a guilty pleasure.
