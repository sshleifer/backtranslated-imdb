Sometimes, when a film is dubbed by the critics, you just have to see it to see if it's really as bad as the claim. Well, in this case it was the case. I think it should be a sex comedy, but it was neither sexy nor funny. I think I once laughed when Johnny Vegas did not overhang a roadside fence and that was it. <br /> <br /> The film follows the life of four men who provide potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sexual life. Dave has left his wife looking for an old flame that invited him to a threesome a few years ago. Ferris lives with his mother-in-law, who treats him as a sex object. Tolly has an obsession with incorporating strawberry jam into his encounters, and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship, but is actually following a poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of jokes varies from tasteless to "I do not think anyone could write that", an example of the latter being when they tell a young child that his father died in a car crash is, and then after the punch line, when the boy asks how his mother is, that she is in a coma. The fault lies nationally at the feet of the authors. The actors obviously made a bad decision to be in this movie, but I do not think their acting was so bad ... not that it was all so good. Surprisingly, there is no nudity for a pretty dirty movie about sex and sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing this for any reason other than the curious curiosity, although this seems to be judging from other reviews be it a movie or I hate film, I suspect it would be better if you drink a few beers and with your friends.
