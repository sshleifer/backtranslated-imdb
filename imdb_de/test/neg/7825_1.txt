The trailer is so misleading ... I thought that was a good movie ... What was the point of getting the women in Hong Kong killed? They could have done it in Paris. And the first half hour: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> -No me not! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No me not! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No me not! Repeat this 100 times ... then ... Well, I do not love you ... so I'll shoot you! : D So here's the reason why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine, I even gave money for this torture! I'm sorry for the time I did not see it anymore ... the filmmakers should pay me for the inconvenience ... Worst movie I've ever seen
