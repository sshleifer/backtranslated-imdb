What we know of Caravaggio points to a jaunty brawler with a healthy claim to quality who lived among whores, thieves and convicts and put them on the canvas. His works dealt with sex, death and salvation, especially the finding of the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time when homosexuality was condemned to death and political intrigue usually involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim "strangling the boy for the purity of his cry." You can not blame Derek for Jarman's cinematography, nor for his replicas of Caravaggio's paintings, and you certainly can not blame the man for evading homosexuality. But honestly, Jarman never goes beyond the '80s cartoon. The Italian patronage becomes the London art scene of the 80s with pretty waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy piece of the northern rough oiling his bike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of Mills and Boons ("Why, Miss Lena, without this gypsy scarf, you are beautiful ..."). Jarman gives Caravaggio a particularly banal motive for the murder that exiled him. <br /> <br /> This could be a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent, but who nevertheless attracted attention. The lives of ordinary people in the status of renaissance masterpieces, of Considered emperors and kings. Instead, you get Pierre and Gilles do Italy. The beautiful bodies of boys are shown perfectly, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to satirize the London art scene and show it flat and overbearing. To use Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy, it is important to use a silk exchange for a pig's ear. To be fair, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the images it describes.
