This movie is little more than a substitute for Verhoeven. The shooting should be tele-realistic, but are simply pathological. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes and is replaced by a story that seems to take itself seriously. The Brechtian breaks for non-existent advertising brakes are boring and even painful. No doubt there was no intention to make this film Brechtian, it was just a coincidence that happened. If you want to see a parody of reality TV, check out Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funnier, funnier and, most of all, shorter. I've rarely seen so much pain during a movie. To avoid like a rabid rabbit.
