I liked this movie somehow, not a good but not the worst one ever made. Everyone says it's one of the worst movies ever made. I thought it was okay. There are many immature jokes. It sometimes wants to be funny, but fails. <br /> <br /> The story is fine. For the younger crowd, though, it can be a bit hard to follow. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is mostly a terrible actor. Sometimes it's even ridiculous. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. He is weird if he should, but some of his lines are terrible. Oh, and the most important thing about this movie I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he's obsessed with the mask. The voice is terrible. In addition, the scenes in which he finds himself are so unsteady that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have kicked him out, and that would not affect the movie at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can live without seeing it. It's a nice movie if you can not see anything else. You could definitely have renounced the sequel, but it's a decent effort. 4.10
