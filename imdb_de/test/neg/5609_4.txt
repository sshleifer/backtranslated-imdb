Romantic comedy films are definitely the most fertile genre for films that appear "below average" and are a source of frustration for viewers. This is a perfect example of this and has a place in my "Top Ten Worst Movies". <br /> <br /> History is anything but creative and jokes are weak. I found no reason to laugh throughout the movie! Characters are easy and the performance of the actors and just good. The story is developing slowly, is boring and predictable. The end is also predictable and covered in sugar. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you see on a rainy Saturday afternoon when, in my humble opinion, you have nothing better to see.
