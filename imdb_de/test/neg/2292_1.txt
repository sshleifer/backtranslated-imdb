This strip is terrible! It's about having disgust and making you laugh, but it fails terribly. The director obviously has no sense of slapstick gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing I've ever seen - lacking in both acting talent and a sense of comedy. Even their attempt at the English language is really sad, and indeed the peculiar Swedish accent, in which the incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the funniest and funniest thing about this film. Even the blood is terrible and unconvincing. If you're looking for gore-comedy, I'd suggest that you turn to classic dishes like evil dead or even brain-dead if you have to. We all enjoy a damn good laugh, but that's ridiculous!
