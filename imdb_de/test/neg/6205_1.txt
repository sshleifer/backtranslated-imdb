Soon after this film was released, Salman Khan was handed a 6-year prison sentence. (Read on to find out why I mention this.) <br /> <br /> And I sighed with relief. Not that I was happy that he was in jail for being a celebrity, but I was happy because it was no longer Salman Khan movies, not his histrionics and no more exaggerated acting (see Overacting). <br /> <br /> This movie made no sense at all. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the child, who belongs to a family, makes a rocket, which was activated with the voice. According to the script, it would track everyone. But in the end it only finds Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well, that's exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> The Rocked gets activated in another stupid way and you have to have an IQ of 0.001 to believe it. Then he hunts Salman Khan, who was on his water scooter, and the hunt goes on, unless he's done with all the possible stunts he could show a stupid audience. (In my opinion, all those people who have given this movie 5 and up, unless they are paid for it.) Another breathtaking, incredible scene came to an end when all the arrangements about The Marriage is Closed and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise arrives and holds the marriage to another of these most unwanted songs. Later, even though everything is ready, and makes a mere confession of Govinda and Katrina Kaif to Katrina's father and bingo. Everything is alright and Govinda marries Kartina .... <br /> <br /> That made me wonder if convincing was so easy, why they did not and tortured us for so many hours and mine Wasting money <br /> This movie has to be avoided and has not thought that there is a scene that is worth to be seen. The plot is far too disconnected as the characters jump out of nowhere and eventually disappear. For Choota Don ... What a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this movie I made a promise that I would not watch Salman Khan films for the rest of my life, unless it wins an Oscar ... (hahahah ... which means that I would never watch)
