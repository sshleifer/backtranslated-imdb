This movie is terrible for a variety of reasons. Other posters have listed some historical mistakes of this movie. Well, I have a lay knowledge of Roman history, and even the inaccuracies were terrible. I usually forgive mistakes in historical films because I understand that the purpose is to entertain, not educate. To reduce a long saga to two hours requires a historical license. But this movie goes far beyond laps. <br /> <br /> There are worse ones. To tell a story from a distant time, the film uses flashbacks that only make the story more confusing. If the viewer has no prior knowledge of the period, they are quickly lost. In addition, the film was obviously shot simultaneously in Italian and English, with different actors were later synchronized. Sometimes the actors seem to be in completely different films, which were then worked together. In fact, that's not far wrong. The actors were obviously stuck on a cheesy, computer-generated ancient Rome. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give stars to this boring chaos is that I always find Peter O'Toole entertaining. But that's no reason to rent it. If you are curious about Roman history, there are much better movies.
