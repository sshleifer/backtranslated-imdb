I barely managed to see the entire movie ... It was not until about 85 minutes of the 110-minute film sequence that the journey to Mars began, and then there were 5 minutes left to close it. Those 85 long minutes were VERY boring and did not contribute to the movie. When we finally reached Mars, it was not much better to plan the plot. Everything could fit in a much shorter duration and nothing would have been overlooked. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand is the triviality that says the newborn babies were called "Aelita" because of the movie. ... Why would someone want to name his / her baby after a villain who, although he only has one eyebrow, apparently has 3 breasts? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here are the sets and costumes the Mars scenes. They are an interesting experiment in Constructivism, just as "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" was for Expressionism five years ago. <br /> <br /> I give 4/10 for the great-looking design ...
