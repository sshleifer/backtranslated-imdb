This may be the worst in the Cockney gangster genre that has plagued the British film industry since Mockney unleashed Guy Ritchie Lock shares and two poorly traded barrels. This "True Life" story by Carlton Leach (who?) Has anything that's wrong with this genre, a really horrible script that's made up of people like the "cant", "driving cant" and "I kill you, you." fahcking cant "" ad nauseum "The drama is equally terrible, with the two most recognizable actors being two former soap stars visible from their depths, for some reason the film assumes that we've heard of these people, and I can assure you that this is not the case north of Essex, and that we should be interested in a story with little life.Why this is not Goodfellas, although the DVD cover is a bit unclear.The story revolves around a football hooligan who has turned a bouncer into a gangster whose friends are shot dead in the end ... Boo-Hoo The fact that these people are totally disliked is the only small benefit for this one In all the action scenes, it seems like the camera is tied to a piece of string and whirled around as people pretended to fight, and the story of someone most people have never heard of, and nothing really Interesting is a waste of time. People talk about how violent the movie is, as if it were a sign of a great movie. Although many great films contain violence, this is just an excuse for the FX man to show what he can do. Overall, this movie is a reminder of why the British film industry is not working anymore and the sooner we stop funding those pathetic abortions, the better.
