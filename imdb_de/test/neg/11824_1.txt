This movie is embarrassing. Nothing works on any level. The direction, scenario, acting and editing work together to turn your eyes away from the screen. Everything is inappropriate and incoherent. First you can sit there and moan, wince and laugh about it, but very soon all the effort of watching is just too cumbersome.
