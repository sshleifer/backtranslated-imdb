It's hard to distinguish actors from non-actors. Poor American films can be detected by all teenagers, each line of dialogue with "Do you know what?" Poor Canadian films can be detected by all teenagers who say "Eh?" Break up. Have we learned nothing in a century of filmmaking? Can not millions of wannabe descendants of Hollywood scripts and roles in Hollywood save us from these dreadful, bespoke television movies?
