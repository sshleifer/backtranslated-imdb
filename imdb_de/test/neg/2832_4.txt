As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the films he was involved with, I've probably put up with Progeny. I did not do it, although in a sense it has moments. However, if you expect anything from the Society or Beyond ReAnimator caliber, you might be in for a shock. In a way, that's similar to Society, it's a story of a seemingly ordinary world with a terrible supernatural abdomen ... but it ends here. <br /> <br /> I'm not responsible for Yuzna when I say that. The mistake is not really with him, because bad direction is bad direction, but the direction is healthy. What triggers the movie is both script and drama. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written a smart script that does not really work with Yuzna's directional style. He leaves him with actors who are having a long dialogue, if he really wants to spin the camera and get over his bad condition himself. This affair makes the movie as impractical as it is, but there is worse. <br /> <br /> If the movie had been made with great actors, the movie would probably have stayed. Unfortunately, this is very far from the case. The drama is wooden, shocking even for a low-budget B feature. The inexplicably successful and renowned Arnold Vosloo destroys every damned line with near-precision precision and delivers one of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. The man manages to turn each line of a well-thought-out dialogue into a kind of ham line that you throw drunk on your colleagues the next time you're in the pub. 'Hey Bob! Good God, I go mad! What is ... come on me! NOOOO! 'In fact, I can try it myself next weekend. The addition of genre veteran Brad Dourif's last-minute (and personal favorite) Brad Dourif seems to be almost non-enriching as it should, and seems to be taking Dourif's final step to keep Vosloo from hammering. Waiting for the next attack on bad behavior next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn of him can not revive the movie. <br /> <br /> If the acting was better, this movie would have been fine. Hell, it may have been quite enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the movie soulless and makes the horror element appear seemingly and tasteless rather than an organic part of the movie. I already found the alien torture / rape scenes a bit hard to bear, but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them both uninvolved and unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant taste in their mouths if you really like Sci-Fi and No problem with bad acting, pedestrian tripping and a really flashy, nasty rape scene, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea. But since then I will probably never see it again. Once was enough. On the bright side, this is the only science fiction movie Yuzna has ever done, so obviously he was not so happy with it.
