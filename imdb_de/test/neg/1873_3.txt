This is not a good movie for a standard. It's very poorly written and the acting is just a bit above average (some performances are well below average, but Swayze and Gray do a very good job and have little work on it). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were very well choreographed and, as already mentioned, Swayze and Gray were highlights. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> The script. The "bad" guys were just too evil to be credible. The best villains are those who are not so obviously evil. These people (the nephew of the owner, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do NOTHING, what lets me leave to believe that they could be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I do not want a movie about it <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first in which Gray and Swayze meet when the resort's employees "dance." Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to enjoy themselves, the next time they do Swayze is hostile to her, why? What happened in between to refuse him if they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of those lines mean COME ON (in the end, I swung myself as Swayze the line muttered, "No one uses baby." "The corner." How did he do that with a straight face?) <br/> <br/> Another thing is wrong, the attitude of the 1960s dressed like in the 80s! Who was responsible for the costumes and hairstyles? <br / > <br /> The music (original music for the movie) was ridiculous (except for "I had the time of my life," which was a good song). <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but definitely the overrated one
