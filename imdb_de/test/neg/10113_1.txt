I do not even understand what they wanted to achieve with this movie, I really mean. You let this guy run out of a bunch of cats because he's dead, but to be really dead, does this girl have to shoot her? And they leave a corpse, although ordinary people can not see them because they are dead? The script already has a hole the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character, played by Susan Paterno, who roars her lines with a monotonous, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face that she would have played just as well female terminator robot. It is absolutely terrible and I do not even understand how I saw it until the end of the film. The end is just as stupid as the entire movie, and it's absolutely no reward for the viewer. You might as well call this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo".
