I remember the bad press that got this movie because the producer had filed a lawsuit against Clayton Moore called "Lone Ranger" or during personal appearances with his black mask. Regardless of the quality of the film, this was the absolute height of the shortsighted arrogance and stupidity of the producers and their lawyers. And I suspect that the lesson learned after this film was well-received as a sort of karma for the stingers responsible for the order against Moore. The custom of reviving a legendary movie or television project is the original star or inviting the original stars to cameo performances, and rightly so. Show respect, you idiots! And even if they sniff at the prospect that has happened, at least the offer was made. This proves that movie producers, studio managers, and entertainment lawyers are not overly stupid and arrogant to be lectured by examples.
