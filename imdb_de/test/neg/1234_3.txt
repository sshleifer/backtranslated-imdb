The photography is good, the costumes are good, but the workmanship is bad. The different scenes are interrupted or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are boring and boring. This slowness continues the entire show. It's a very lengthy show. , , , I think more scenes should be added, but that would make a longer show. It is very slow. The authors should have made it ONLY a 1-night show, and not prolong our agony night after night. There is nothing else, otherwise I would change the channel (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of that time and I'm mad at the whites because they did what they did to the Indians, but that's our story.
