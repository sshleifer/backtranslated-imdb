John Carradine is one of the most terrifying horror actors who acts more as a Nazi scientist, transforming humans into zombies to serve the Empire. Brain-wrenching brain that can only obey the simplest of commands ... a bit like McDonald's. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name because America was not at war at the time. They were filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for! <br /> <br /> There are two types of zombies in the film, the traditional voodoo type that was popular in the old black and white films of the 1930s and 40s. With empty eyes and just follow the orders of another as they stumble along. And then there's the guy we know from later films like The Night of the Living Dead and The Bad Dead. Still struggling, but only with the intention of killing and eating the flesh and brains of their victims. Both have their moments in different films over the years. <br /> <br /> 'Revenge' shows the former zombie-type, though they look particularly stupid and look like geeks at home in old-time geeks, biting chicken heads. A black zombie named Lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young Don King. <br /> <br /> As for the conspiracy, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie with the others and he makes his mistake there. Even though he lets her become the living dead, she is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> It all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears The moral of the story must be, never, never, turn your wife into a zombie, it's just a problem ... <br /> <br / > The movie is interesting enough and it is quickly coming to an end. but it never rises above the origin of poverty. No patch for real zombie classics, but still fun.
