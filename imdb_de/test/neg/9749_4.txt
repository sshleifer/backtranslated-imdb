This is probably the only movie I've seen where the IMDb ratings on both sides of the spectrum are 100%. "The Stupids" is a cruel, idiotic film that has no artistic value and is an aversion to a director like John Landis. And that makes it great. <br /> <br /> To commemorate "The Stupids", one has to remember a little-known but very true maxim of director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to watch bad movies, they are so often "For a movie to work, the film has to establish and follow its own logic. If done convincingly and sincerely, the movie can actually work. For example, if you see "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional comedy, this is a complete trash. If you look at it with the understanding that it's really a neo-surrealistic comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Jaws" had not accepted the reality he had created, the explosion of the air tank would not have worked. But many people think that "Jaws" is greatly overrated for this reason, and they are not wrong. But it has strengths, right? The point is, a movie like this makes sense, if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people like me get it right away, while others will never, no matter how many times it is explained. Jim Jarmusch once made a convincing defense of "showgirls", and even then I still can not get him out of his P.O.V. see. That does not mean he's wrong. If you have the right attitude when watching this movie (and NO, I AM NOT STONING, I'm going to put it to bed now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the stupid, cheap, pointless slapstick. 80's / early 90's farce that's it. <br /> <br /> The defenders and haters of this movie are right: it's STUPID and that's the point. The film accepts the stupidity of the characters in the same way that "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because that's what it takes and works with, the film focuses solely on passing the plot and defining the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and not use that logic properly. bad movies are bad because they catch up, while movies like "The Stupids" know where to go, what it does, and why it's from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can not defend the film from an artistic point of view, which is why I rate it that low. Acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial and the quality of the live action probably ruins what would have worked as a comic. But I can not deny that it is entertaining in its own way, so I defend it. I understand it immediately, and I feel sorry for those who do not. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo. "Worth the rental even if I hated this movie), but was amazed to find that apart from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored and never disappointed They were stupid, but they were funny, and the film does not pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters, and instead of itself It's fun for him to apologize for. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly why it works.
