This movie is so bad that it is funny. I halfway saw Hell Ride thinking that it was a comedy, though I could not quite figure out if they were actually taking the p * ss or if this was really a serious attempt to do something decent. I realize that this is not a comedy, so you have to be serious! It basically seems like a group of retirees driving around on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the weirdest dialogue you can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two characters, smashing bottles over each other's heads and then showing themselves "out of prison free cards" they made! Also, look at the accent of Vinnie Jones, where is he supposed to come from?!? Oh, and there are also a lot of naked girls in there who, for some inexplicable reason, want nothing more than having sex with these leather studs! The man who wrote and directed it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000 beard and an orange tanning bed - has for some reason starred in the lead, maybe this is part of the joke, I do not know. The more I think about it, the more I'm sure that this movie is a P * ss. It was produced by Quentin Tarantino, and it is possible that he has published this as a laugh in humor. It's a total rip-off of Tarantino's style, but it was really bad. However, it's very amusing, and I think both ways could become a cult classic, either because of an amusing parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style or something that is very unintentionally funny. Must be seen to be believed.
