I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. A character totally annoys with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a blackboard. There is a completely unnecessary train / roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that are frightening to the little kids this movie was made for. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. These scenes or characters did not have any warmth or charm. Normally, it does not work to turn a short children's book into a feature film. This movie really gets on my nerves.
