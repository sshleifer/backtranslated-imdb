This movie has changed my life! Hogan's performance was incredible and I still have not recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. And as brilliant as the Hulkster is in this movie, you can not ignore the brilliant writing and direction that brings this masterpiece to the highest levels of performance in the film. If you have not seen this movie yet, drop it and get a copy. I guarantee that it will blow you away. And if you do not like it, then I have only one question for you ... Watcha will do it when the 24-inch pythons and Hulkamania run wild on you !!!!
