The only thing it has to offer are the interesting contrasts of Tru and Jack, their choices and perspectives, and the philosophical questions it poses. Tru thinks she helps people who should not die, and Jack thinks they should die, and she does not play with the plan of fate or the plan of the universe or anything like that. <br /> <br /> But she's obviously capable of changing things, so there's obviously no fate in the series metaphysics. Jack has no foundation to believe that. And Tru never asks him the right questions. Nobody does. Which obviously proves that the creators of the series have no answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no action! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave it bleak for the series to be able to continue with the boring girlie stuff that is only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack running against unknown targets ... < br /> <br /> It turns out that there is none of it. A teen pop series pretending to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time is better spent sleeping.
