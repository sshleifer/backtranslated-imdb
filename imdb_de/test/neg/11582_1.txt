Boa vs Python was probably the worst creature feature that was a million times better than this one or not. Bad spectacle, bad effects and guess what the DVD is with 3 hours preview before the main menu. probably the most sinister movie of all time, no blood or violence, people are stupid and use guns if they do not affect these animals. The only cool part was the radioactive leeches, which were pretty cool. The name of the island is just a rip off Jurassic Park is boring and not even worth watching, but I suspect the stupidity of the characters is pretty funny, so it would be a good comedy movie, but definitely not a thriller
