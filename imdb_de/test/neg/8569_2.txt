I did not buy it, I did not rent it, it was in the PPV and someone burned a copy of it and lent me it, so at least I wasted no money on it. For someone who made Darkness, Nameless, Devil's Backbone, this is a pretty lame movie. It seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls who were in a convent at the time, and now they are all grown up and are being persecuted and killed by a nun coming out of the sink. the toilet and even manages to overcome the revolving doors in a hotel. And what makes this nun so mean and evil (and wet?) I do not know, that was so boring that at some point in the middle of the interim, I just stopped it, put it away and watched something else. Was not interested in finding out. Oh, sure, there are some pretty young ladies, but hey, are two lesbians? I guess there's a picture from the bedroom of a young lady on the bedside table, and which devil-less horror movie would not be complete without a lesbian couple these days? Yes, anyway. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie, try "Desecration", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and that's the one with Adrienne Barbeau, not the one with John Malkovich, by the way).
