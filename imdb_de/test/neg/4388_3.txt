Take a look at the positive user comments from this movie and see how often each user posts comments. You post once. It appears that companies are likely to pay for services posting junk pro-movie comments on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was awful. The conspiracy was stupid. The acting was bad. The jokes were not even funny. The film contained a slight nudity of what looked like porn actresses, but none of the other characters. <br /> <br /> For the first 15 minutes it was clear that the movie was not funny. Here and there there was a slapstick, but most of the humor was supposed to be derived from the characters who spoke behind the other's back and spread rumors. This is not even done well. Every joke is obvious and you see how it comes. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth a quick rush or better yet not seen. <br /> <br /> I regret to have seen this movie and if I could calculate the studio and distributor for 1.5 hours they stole me, I would.
