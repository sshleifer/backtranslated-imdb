Would I have expected something other than idleness from Carrot Top? This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "Chairman of the Board" added no humor to my attitude, but made me angry. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I got mad that this guy is making movies.
