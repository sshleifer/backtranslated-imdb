The filmmakers clearly had drugs. That's the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this travesty of a Jane Austen adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this movie was made as if it were a gothic novel. The bizarre music and dream sequences point to drug-induced hallucinations and not to a naive, innocent girl with overactive imagination, since Catherine's novel ... The actress who played Catherine, is only standing around all the time with her eyes. Peter Firth looks at least ten years old to play Henry, and he seemed a bit gay to me. I do not see the attraction between him and Catherine. John Thorpe's account was pretty weird, but Isabella was not that bad. But nothing could save this PIECE OF CRAP movie! One more thing - This film invents a character not included in the book, a French friend of General Tilney: "The Marchioness". Why exactly you added them is a mystery to me. Must have been the drugs. It looks eerily sinister, with white foundations, red lips, and black lines that are painted randomly on her face (dimples?) It's of good quality, but unfortunately not. It's just bad.
