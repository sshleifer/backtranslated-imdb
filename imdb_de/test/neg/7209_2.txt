SPOILERS: The Original Road House is one of those movies that I know are clich√©s and unoriginal, but it's so well done, I'm ashamed to admit that I really like it. It turns out that many of my friends, whose film impressions I respect, think the same way. So if they're trying to make a sequel, and it's like being written by some high school kids who have been given the rights to continue, it's just bad; really, really bad. Oddly enough, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the authors and I can only hope that his WGA membership will be revoked. The writing was just bad and all the authors of this film should retire because they lacked originality and the worst dialogue in this millennium. Schaech already seems to be the king of the direct DVD (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2), and after watching this and 8mm 2, I think his acting skills do not exist. He was terrible, just terrible. <br /> <br /> And it's not the horrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. Each combat scene is a slow blow (with the wiff still sounding in the air), which is then blocked by the opponent who returns a blow that sends the first man to the ground. This is repeated throughout the movie, worse than any bad police show of the 70s. Or the fact that, for some reason, many of the people involved in the fighting seem to have a mouthful of Kirschkool remedies. And we're supposed to believe that Will Patton is a fighting machine. His fight scenes look so incredibly baffled that I was genuinely embarrassed by the reputation. <br /> <br /> It's the complete hole of logic in this ridiculous movie that makes it terrible. For example: Johnathon Schaech is in town for a day and already tells a girl that he hardly knows who he does not know which side he's on: "I'm with the Feds, but do not tell anyone." However, the villain who fights the good girl in a fight scene with acrobatic struggles that can compete with any superhero is easily held down by Will Patton, an "old man," in another scene by simply holding both hands while doing something makes ridiculous line ("make me once, be ashamed of you, twice twice on me, will not happen" phew, that's bad) and then the butt she. Jake Busey's villain shoots at the government while he's in the middle of a drug deal, but no DEA agent or anyone else just goes to him and picks him up. He is simply let go because "this is the sheriff's territory." Busey wants the bar because it's "in a great location" for drug dealing, but his own house seems to be just as good, apparently offering all the benefits the bar should have. The character of Johnathon Schaech should be in the original son of Patrick Swayze, but the last name of Swayze is Dalton and Schaech not (not even the supposed brother of Swayze). And Johnathon Schaech looks about 50 in this movie. I've checked out, he's 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks awful. <br /> <br /> But my absolutely stupid favorite scene in this movie was the most audited fighting scene that ended in movies: the villain is popped through a movie window on a second floor and as they fall down, I think "Please do not tell me that he has impaled something ... "and indeed my worst fears have come true. <br /> <br /> Actually, I could talk for half an hour about the things I hated about this movie. Suffice to say, we're putting an end to these ridiculous DVD episodes of feature films, at least those by Johnathon Schaech.
