I liked Half-Life. I'm still a fan. It was terrifying, intelligent and challenging. I'm not telling you anything new, it's one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm too hardcore half-life fan, but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: is this the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the Creator Vave thinks that way, but I do not. Where are the smart enemies? Where is the frightening atmosphere? Nowhere. I think they wanted to make Half-Life a bit different (instead of another research station story), but they did not just make a very different story, but something that has to do with Half-Life, like Quake's downfall, for example. The whole game is so unattractive and unreal that it's almost deserted. <br /> <br /> Although the physics are really great and there were a few good levels to play, the idea of ​​creating a revolutionary, physical-driven gameplay has failed completely. If you have the Gravity Cannon that can move objects, you can expect rights to use them as a weapon - that would turn the schematic FPS gameplay upside down. The truth is that you can not use Gravity-Gun as a real weapon. Why? The best you can do is to throw boxes and barrels that do not do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you, it can fall out of about 3 shots. If you want to throw your opponent an exploding barrel, it can explode in your own "hand". The gravity cannon does not work as a weapon. The best use is solving some physics puzzles. I ask Valve: why? The truth is that you have to use your boring, schematic FPS weapons to the end (except the last level). Weapons are not what made Original Half-Life a classic. If Gravity-Gun was always on the last rung - a real weapon - I'd admire what Valve did. But not that. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want half-life, look in the wrong place. Maybe you'll enjoy it, but I'll say it again: it's all, but not a half-life and not a faithful continuation of it. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. Valve has shown that they can also make horrible games. They did that.
