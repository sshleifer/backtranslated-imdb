Well, I love bad skifee movies as much as most people do. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie. The thing has no actors and just an attractive woman who kills them two minutes after swimming. There are literally no redeeming qualities in this bunch of wasted celluloids. The only thing that was not wasted was paper ... the script can not have been longer than four pages. Certainly no one has actually led WROTE dialogue so meaninglessly. I'm always amazed that such films were ever made, let alone published. I'm just glad I did not pay for this waste of time. It's 75 minutes of my life, I'll never come back.
