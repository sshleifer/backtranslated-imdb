I think I would rather cut my bunch with a rusty clipper than endure another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact, I can not even go into detail! Not sure how they managed to bring the needles into the wooden actors to heal them! Better for those involved if they had just indicted the island after they discovered the virus. That would have taken as long as the commercial breakthrough, and we could have continued our lives. And something else was this garbage commissioned by the God Channel? All they seemed to do was praise the bleeding Lord most of the time. Avoid like the plague! Actually, I would prefer it!
