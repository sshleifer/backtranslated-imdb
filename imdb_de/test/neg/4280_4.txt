As an avid Disney fan, I was not totally impressed with this movie, certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the cinemas. However, I am so glad that I caught it on DVD and looked at the peculiarities. <br /> <br /> You MUST go through the "Moose Commentary": The entire movie can be viewed with comments by Rutt and Tuke, the comic relief moose of the story voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous Second City comedy troupe ad-lib - in character - for an hour and a half over a movie they love clearly. I laughed the whole time. The joy of this comment completely compensated for the lukewarm reaction to the movie. Do yourself a favor and listen!
