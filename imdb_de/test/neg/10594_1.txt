The film was slow, the dialogue between actors / actresses felt "flat" and essentially there was no development of the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps has a crazy expression all along, pouting and basically upset with everyone. Danes has no magic on the screen, and Ribisi's character is a goober nobody would accept, even if he was paid for it. <br /> <br /> Throw the comic scene where Epps must dance an old man, and you may have the worst movie in cinematic history. <br /> <br /> I saw him on satellite (thankfully I did not pay for it) and wished I had not. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and sort out your underwear and sock drawer if you have something to do, but are tempted to watch this movie if / when it appears on your TV. Terrible movie if you ask me, and I generally have something good to say about every movie out there.
