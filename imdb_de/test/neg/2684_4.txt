Scott's collection of 1980s icons can not save this teenage catastrophe. But I suppose that's why it was just a TV movie and not a big movie. William A. Schwartz (writer) gets a little closer to "stewardess school", except that this movie is boring. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and totally unreal. The only reason could be to see Tina Yothers after Family Ties in a current role. After this movie and stupid Class Cruise, I think Mr. Scott decided to run sit-coms, which was his best move so far. 4 out of 10
