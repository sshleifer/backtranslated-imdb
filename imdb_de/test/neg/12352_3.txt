Rabbit fever is one of those movie curiosities. It's a pleasant 90-minute time, low on the viewer and delivering so much, and on every terrestrial television channel, even in prime time, I think Rabbit Fever is more well received. That's why I'm wondering why the movie was pushed into the cinemas. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have an addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film focuses primarily on investigating an allegedly addictive feature of the famous sex help product. The narrative is 100% crazy. <br /> <br /> The story is strong, an introduction to some well-rounded and likeable characters, some entertaining background stories, peripheral characters and situations evolve into a gripping story of gratifying conclusions. Unfortunately, nothing feels smart or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Fever has some sharp moments, a couple of counters that point out the abilities of the writers, and all the best for them is that it's not just 90 minutes of gags and allusions that I'm likely to watch could my mother. But there's laziness in some of the scenes that hold it back, the moments were ready for you, if you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a bunch of sit-com. <br /> <br /> I chuckled, I left the theater with empathy for the characters, but I also started with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90-minute role for television, light entertainment and trying to bring them to the national cinema. <br /> <br /> I think Rabbit Fever achieves some of its goals. It's a bizarre theme, a well-rounded plot, a well-presented cast and a good distraction for 90 minutes. However, there is nothing that could justify the extravagance of a movie theater environment. On the contrary - a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer the chance to get a breath of life that seems to lack the rabbit fever.
