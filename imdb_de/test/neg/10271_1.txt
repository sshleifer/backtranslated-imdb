Impressive. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love her. I do the works. I want to participate. I spend time watching the thing. I saw the Emmys on TV last night. How was the TV movie Empire Falls (Distinguished Name) in the infinite world for any awards? It really had a wonderful talent. Of course. And they have admirably tried. But how can ANYONE pretend it's an OK (television for goodness sake) script? OK direction? You know, I wish you all the best. Really. But I thought it would be totally amazing that Hollywood is making this very bad movie for so many awards. Awards For me it was a kind of wake-up call that Hollywood is such a small island community. Being cynical is not really my cup of tea. But wow! --xptyngi
