It is too slow and too complex for children and too easy and boring for adults. None of our family (6 weeks to 66 years) could look around all the time. <br /> <br /> Are there any jokes? I could not really say it. There were certainly some unnecessarily adult allusions. There was probably some kind of gossip, but I was not engaged enough to handle it. <br /> <br /> The live talent just stumbles and overcomes it. I have to wonder if they were actually paid or whether it was a form of community service or a bargain. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I would not bother.
