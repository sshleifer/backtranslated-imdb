The two main roles, an Englishman and an Aussie, who film a story of the American Civil War in Romania, have not the slightest spark between them, are absolutely incredible as lovers and completely blameless. There is no history, no characterization, virtually nothing to separate the eyelids during this endless long-term festival. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly miscast, practically chews the fence posts, but at least when she embarrasses herself, she looks weird. Nicole Kidman is a decade old for the role and has no idea what's going on. The idiot role of Jude Law could have been played by all Romanian extras alike. The only requirement is to roam the woods and look stupid, while a parade of guest stars steals the show. That did not matter, because all guest stars were completely superfluous, because they did not increase the so-called plot by one iota. And as if that were not enough, the author considered it necessary to throw a few spinning, whirling kung fu jumps of horses. What was it about?
