Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring in general (loved the sweet chin music in the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst matches I've ever seen, predictable as hell. 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE game. Liked it when JBL hit the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship-Pretty ok, more a defeat of Tripe H than a match, but I was glad I saw it after seeing crap. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, liked the Brand Showdown, the Hassan thing and the end. 7/10 Overall, crap. Why is someone looking at the rumbling ???
