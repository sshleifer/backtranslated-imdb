Low budget drummer Herschell Gordon Lewis reaches a new low with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "movie" (Kicherer) that has all its technical hallmarks: poorly recorded sound, poor lighting and OTT gore. That would be bearable, even a bit charming, if the movie had at least one interesting plot ("Blood Feast" in all its ridiculous splendor is a good example), but "Girls" is an absolute snooze. Completely unlikely pompous private investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who is killing out-of-shape strippers (they'll stop worrying who the perpetrator is long before they finish the case) , Still, the incentive is not the act, but the creative methods of bloodshed (including the fanny of a girl made tender with a mallet) and the occasional flash of skin, which is then risky ... but that's not enough To raise the material about boredom.
