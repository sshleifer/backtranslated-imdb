I just can not understand how a Who fanatic or just anyone can even find this horrible, lazy, badly written abomination funny even remotely. It is so embarrassingly below average that it is considered a true tragedy. The potential was enormous, it could have been great. What a shame that all the acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved were so pathetically wasted through a script that it had to be burned and quality control here. Like those pounding Hollywood movies (mad mad world, casino royale) where the stars attack each other and have "a great time," which basically means not looking for a check that could have made me write a better one in the sleep sends. In fact I have, though awake. I did it in 10th grade in high school and did it with a group of classmates. It was better, I'm looking at it now and the jokes are funnier. Steven Moffat YOU ARE NOT A TALENT BUM! What a waste, what a wasted opportunity. Makes me cry ....
