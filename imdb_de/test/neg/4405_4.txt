I really wanted to like this movie for all sorts of reasons - the subject is inherently interesting and is probably the main theme the world is facing today, and has created fascinating work (eg Linda Grants, as I do in the modern day) A guy I like told me he thought it was the best movie he had seen all year, so with such a recommendation ... <br /> <br /> HOWEVER I actually found myself nodding at certain points! Granted, I was tired and the cinema seats comfortable, but I found it too hard to identify with the characters. Once I got the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with them, but that made it disappointing, like a sketch show and not like a movie. I liked the concept of a restrained, almost silent scene in these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the Muslim ninja fighter. But personally I think the movie was overdone. I do not say narrative and action is everything (it's definitely not), but a little more dialogue would have helped.
