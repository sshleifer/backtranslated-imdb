This continuation of the above - and the last entry in the "Kharis" series - is a bit more fun, but also more inventive (hell, we even get a singing barmaid / hostess!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests we saw in the course of these films and Martin Kosleck as his stooge did not seem to be interested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch is therefore saddled with a ridiculous accent, as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated Princess Ananka: The latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later a much-used character actress), receives her most essential "role" and indeed the episode of her resurrection from the marshes is not only a highlight of this movie, but the entire series. Unfortunately, Chaney has hardly anything to do here either, because, as I said, the focus is on Ananka. His mummy (to which he most frequently returned to Universal - of course, apart from his unmistakable role as The Wolfman!) - remains undoubtedly his least memorable monster for the studio.
