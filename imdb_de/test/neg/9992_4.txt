Some describe CALIGULIA as "the most controversial film of its time. This is controversial, but certainly one of the most embarrassing: Virtually every big name in the film tried to distance itself from it. Author Gore Vidal sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the movie, their reactions varied from loud disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was that it went away. <br /> <br /> For a while, it looked like it could be. CALIGULA was a major box office and a critical flop (Producer Guccione had to rent a theater to be shown at all), and although the film was released on the domestic market via VHS, so many censorship issues were raised, the edited version was the only one that has been prevalent for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, both in edited "R" and in "Unrated" versions. And no doubt, John Gielgud is glad he did not experience it live. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say that it is something like DEEP THROAT that meets David Lynch's DUNE about Fellini. Rest Day Vidal's screenplay fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to fund the project and lure the big-name stars - and then cast most of Vidal's screenplay and brought soft-porn director Tinto Brass. When Guccione felt that Brass was not explicit enough, he photographed hardcore material with Giancarlo Lui. <br /> <br /> Spectators looking at the edited version may wonder what the uproar is all about, but the viewer will soon realize that the original cut does not leave anything to fantasy. There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there's explicit gay, lesbian and heterosexual sex, kinky sex and a great orgy with Roman watchmen for a good measure , The movie is also incredibly violent and bloody. Rape, torture and mutilation are commonplace. In a particularly troubling scene, a man is stabbed slowly, a woman urinates on his body, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. In a documentary accompanying the DVD release, Guccione says he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the target. We know very little about Caligula - and what we know is questionable at best. Besides, orgies and occasional sex were not commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was a crime punishable by death. And certainly, ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, somewhat oriental-looking sets and costumes offered by the designers. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, these sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although cinematography is commonplace, at least they are just; The score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who as Empress Caesonia perceives our interests and sympathies; Gielgud and O'Toole are also in pretty good shape. The same can not be said for McDowell, but he does not have much to do with justice. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark fascination, but in the end it's a curiosity, more interesting to him for design and crude craziness than for the content. Some of the exhibited bodies (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography ... but on the other hand, some of them are so uncomfortable that they may drive you to abstinence and bloodyness and the grotesque character of the movie undermines his eroticism. If you plan it, it's worth it to see it, but it's probably enough. <br/> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
