My friend and I rented it a few nights ago. and I have to say this is the best movie I have ever seen. I mean, woah! "Buddy, we'll get some beer before this connection closes" and "buddy, Linda is not wearing a bra anymore." What a poetry! woah! and it is also such a wonderful original film. I mean, you usually do not find a Slasher movie where every murder is exactly the same. I mean exactly! that is originality. and almost all transitions between the scenes are these great close-ups of the psycho in the ER scrubs. how cool! the spectacle is so wonderful. The father was just awesome. must have studied REAL DADS before the shoot. and how many movies do you find that just do not make sense? not many. but that's one of those gems. I mean, how cool is it that a guy outside waited six hours to play a joke while his friends were both inside? that is really cool. Overall, I would say that this is the biggest movie in the genre, no, in the world! *****
