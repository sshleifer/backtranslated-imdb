I ordered this movie on the internet because it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about my friends and practically everyone in Turkey about the TV series that I expected a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Me and my husband (who admires all movies with Turkish scenery and Turkish dialogues) just looked him over because we paid $ 20 for DVD. Well, that was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes over-current, while other times were undervalued. Not only was the plot confusing, but adding a gay man who walked the beach with his dog and used some toilet humor in the script to make "Hollywood" did not work for me either. American characters were almost too stereotypical, so It was neither funny nor realistic, and as another user mentioned, Turkish customs and the Turkish lifestyle were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The camera movements had no meaning. A few dervishes (never seen before in Kapadokya) and broken plates in Greek style only made the movie even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of this movie and the noise that the press has made about it. There are certainly worthy films by Turkish directors who deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 out of 10 points.
