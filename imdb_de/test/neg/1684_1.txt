This is probably the most irritating show I've ever seen in my entire life. It's indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I've ever seen. Everything about it is just bad. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Every week, there is another situation where parents deal with their children. <br /> <br /> I could not understand what an idiot would give up this mess in the first place, not to mention several squadrons. The script is bad, very bad? It contains both dairy and unethical joke that you normally see in R or NC-17 films. Especially for the boy character, in which he only enjoys himself, is called the family show humor? The casting is awful too, because all you see is really a really BAD actor, period. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: This show is a real torture !! This show gives an idea of ​​how irresponsible parents can be (with power rather than understanding). It is tens of millions away from reality. Listen to Kenny G would be a god, compare that to. If you spin the washing machine, it would not hurt your eyes much like this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Note: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: The show is so bad That even the cast's mother pulls her daughter out of the show.
