First, the premise stinks ... the little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old. You have seen them in a dozen 50s & 60s movies. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people signed up just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, someone would tell Shirley that she made her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it ... if there are no repetitions of Andy Griffith.
