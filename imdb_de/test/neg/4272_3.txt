I always try not to be harsh and to criticize something that I did not like, but after watching this miniseries, I was so disappointed that I could not help my irritation. On the one hand it is true that the series remained true to the novel, and of course I thought that was very nice, but on the other hand terrible cast, bad acting, especially of key figures? Like Funny Price, the impression of a stage play, I mean that theatrical style of acting irritates you from beginning to end. I'm sure that with this budget, even if it was low, something much better and worthwhile could be done. It's up to you to watch this series, but I do not advise you to spend your time with this disappointing ecranisation.
