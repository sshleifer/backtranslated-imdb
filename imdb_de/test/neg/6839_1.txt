Laugh terrible. You might think that all the big actors involved in this movie would at least make it credible, but they do not - this is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Characters either run around for no good reason to know where they are going, or they stand around making mutilated faces when they should run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your higher brain functions at the door if you want to watch this movie. Or get some of your brightest friends together and give them the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. I did that in the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And please do not confuse this with the excellent movie "The Day of the Jackal", a far superior thriller from 30 years ago.
