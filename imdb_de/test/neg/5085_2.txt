I think it was hard, if not impossible, to watch, and not because of the horrors it represents, but because of the way they were portrayed. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this true horror story. What I disagree with is the idea that the need to denounce what I subscribe to is sufficient. What if you show it to us with the power of a strong cinema? I have the feeling that the zeal of the filmmaker, perhaps even justified anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. Or, if that was a cinematic point of view, I mean, a decision I did not like at all. The way the movie was shot disturbed me more than the movie itself. Well meant, I'm sure, but that's not enough.
