Fans of the horror comedy will like these. Others will quickly get angry and switch off. It's kind of a buddy movie, with exaggerated violence and blood, deliberately stereotypical characters and a lot of craziness. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been made with a budget of about $ 100 by a bunch of guys after a big beer keg party. There is a leader who is a frustrated nerd, and his friend who makes a joke that scoffs at him about 30 times a second. There's a cool monster truck that hunts hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. Whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver show up, it's a great scene. There's a mysterious girl who happens to be in the backseat, and a lot of big boys in coveralls hanging in red neck bars. The nerd's friend never closes his jap, and brings them one after the other in a mess. Their altercation got on my nerves, but other aspects of the movie make up for it. <br /> <br /> Sight gags that make fun of multiple "psycho-torture and trying to torture someone" movies are everywhere. Pick the one that gets the most ripple: Hills Have Eyes, Saw, and Jeepers Creepers were some I've recognized. <br /> <br /> It's great if you're in the right mood. Sensually dull brewskies with your friends can make watching this game more fun. It's a good bet that this is the condition of the filmmakers when they put this thing together.
