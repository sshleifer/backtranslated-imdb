Esther Williams plays a romantically disconnected waterskiing secretary, who longs to "walk on the water" and be the wife of a man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are their potential choices for a husband. This romantic comedy is horribly old-fashioned despite the fine water sequences filmed at Cypress Gardens in Florida. As director of director Charles Walters, everything here is purposely harmless, which does not give the picture much endurance. Even Esther's great moments in the water are not quite up to the hypnotic jumps of her other floating vehicles, though they are preferable to the mating runs of the men, who are both colorless. Carroll Baker is the liveliest of the group in her film debut as Martin's grudging ex-girlfriend. Weak things, indeed. * 1/2 of ****
