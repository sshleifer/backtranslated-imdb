This is a rip off of Cellular. <br /> <br /> Bad casting ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list Go on ... <br /> <br /> Well, there was no direction, as story, scenes and settings were taken directly from another movie. <br /> <br /> Battle sequences are also copied. One with the mace from Kill Bill and another with a fire hose was either from a movie by Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can not remember the name of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Stay Away From this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing ... <br /> <br /> Can not expect anything original from any Bhatts !!!
