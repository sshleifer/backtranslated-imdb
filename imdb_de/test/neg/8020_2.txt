This is a weak coincidence of just about everything: refugees, relations between Croatia and Slovenia, globalization, sexual orientation queen of the household and its future, symbolized by listening to music in clubs and as a lesbian without having children. <br /> <br /> It plays on a pretty young Slovenian legend with a virgin and a "forest king" takes the form of a goat (the pictures of Zlatorog Beer are also based on this legend), but unfortunately the treatment is Weiss seems to think that the purpose justifies the means: it can use all kinds of "dreamlike" sequences and then choose which ones are true and which ones are imaginary How can the jeep ride with the "forest king" for all three Girls be real, but the scene outside the tent is real only in the reality of Simona? The end is always back and forth (I can not believe that the running time of the film is only 98 minutes, I have the cut of one Director, without him knowing?), Where the three girls have to look at the camera for about 10 seconds anxious and happy at the same time (so obviously). <br /> <br /> I never thought that I was in one Film, whose language I do not understand, can make a bad show, but it did not take long for "Simona" to play excessively most of the time, as if she were playing in a silent movie. <br /> <br /> It was not that bad when I thought the director was just starting and wanted to stick to what she wanted. I thought her generation was spinning a half-experimental movie until I found out the director 37 years old when he made the film and that her work is probably "serious".
