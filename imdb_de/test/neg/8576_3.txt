The surprise screening this week at GV turned out to be a horror movie The Nun (La Monja) out. Seriously, I think horror movies should try to develop more imaginative titles, even if the story is about the character described in the title. Who knows, soon there will be spin-offs like The Monk, The Priest and others belonging to different religious sects. The basic requirement is that a ghoul dressed in a nun robe (that is, claiming the title) simply goes around killing former monastic girls. It seemed to be some kind of conspiracy when the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by the eye-candy Icelander Anita Briem), with the help of some good friends, further discovered, like a rip off I know what you did last summer have (by the way also mentioned). So as the number of bodies increases, it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred heroine (not always?) Reveal the truth and save the day. The film examined the sins of the mothers and did the unthinkable, with a dream sequence as an introduction. I hate dream sequences, as this is a pretty cheap technique if it is not done correctly, and there are a few of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> At times, the movie was sometimes replayed many dark-water references like Ju-On, and they could have renamed this unholy water for the circumstances and plot points in the movie. However, there are many storylines, so do not look too deeply into the storyline. One would expect the standard textbook phrases to turn towards the end of the sadistic nun, and sets that look as if they could compete with the recent Thai horror film Dorm. <br /> <br /> perfectly accented English. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story has to be woven into a love scene in the midst of a witch hunt. What gives? Hello, have Hantu, still have mood ah? On the other hand, the ghoul is a rather cheap animated SFX that has a built-in AI that sometimes pops up in different ways just to make screams in front of a shy audience. The characters also break any unwritten rule in the do-nots in the horror story, so you know and expect that they are just desserts. <br /> <br /> Can you enjoy this movie? Sure you can. Just make sure you see it in a full house (should be easy, because the locals are sucking for something terrible in the distance), and laugh about those who are so nervous that they're going to be on everyone's mind. " terrifying "scene screaming. It's a lot of fun and adds to the atmosphere, apart from what's going on on the screen. The surround sound does not even come close. <br /> <br /> Think of it as an episode of Scooby Doo without the jokes, and it is a pity that the bloody moments in the movie had to be censored for a PG rating. These were perhaps the best pieces that were rotting on the censors floor plate.
