I really could not get into this movie. The plot is that an old woman tortured someone for so long that he was deformed. She dies and he stays in the cellar to starve. Months have to pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Well, this guy in the basement, who should have been dead for a long time, is still there. He eats a cat and is now superhuman. He wants to eat people and have sex now. And when a hooker dies, the father gets the blame. I do not like movies where somebody else is blamed for the murders, because you always have the typical lines "I did not do it", "I could never do that", blah blah blah. And the family history could be a lifelong movie story.
