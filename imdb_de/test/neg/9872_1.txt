Admittedly, when I saw this terribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They were not low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into possession of the rights to produce the Marvel cartoon characters in the late '80s or early' 90s and gave them to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work was mainly on Campy TV series such as "Hercules" and "Hercules". took place 'Viper'. With an alleged $ 1.5 million budget, it was produced, filmed and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of the forgotten film. It should have stayed there. Like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, however, this "Fantastic Four" sits in the air and waits to inflict a fall on the rare people who are unhappy and foolish enough. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these comic characters, you know what to expect. The people who did that were very faithful to the source material, and that's the only thing they deserve this fiasco for. This represents the origins of the heroic group that develops superhuman powers when the shielding of their experimental spacecraft does not protect them from cosmic rays. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes' Mr. Fantastic'. His girlfriend Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) may become invisible, and her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously fire from his body. Ben Grimm ("credited to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio") gains superhuman strength when his skin mutates into a stone-like Hyde and is then called "The Thing." There is a prologue to a former classmate of Reed, Victor of Doom (Joseph Culp), to his enemy, Dr. Ing. Doom, who organizes the sacking of Fantastic Four's spaceflight as an act of revenge for injuries he owes Reed. There is the lineup, then the discovery of the forces, the revelation of the villain, and finally a high-level battle. The poorly written script contains more details, but these are negligible. <br /> <br /> This is a film made simply because the makers (I use that in the technical sense of the word, there was a lot of creative imagination at work here) had the legal rights to do so. The conspiracy will undoubtedly be reflected in the expected release of the big budget to be staged in 2005 by Tim Story. However, a massive special effects project like this without tackling a comparable budget or qualified actors is considered filmic madness. What special effects exist are mostly hand-drawn or simple camera ticks that existed since the days of the original "The Great Train Robbery". When half the climax of the fight returns to a full-fledged animation, you're almost relieved to see a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned in that project. Also in this mess there is very little style. Most scenes are shot either flat in available light or in wild primary colors, and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci-fi parts. Although there is camera work, most of the characters stay centered on the screen and only a small amount of information is passed on to the audience. Editing involves leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (in one place, there is even a transition that uses the middle of a number 4). Edit spins are even used to supplement the bad special effects when The Thing is transformed. The one scene using morphing technology was shocking just because of such a positive quality leap. <br /> <br /> Limited camerawork is not unforgivable. Clerks use only the most basic camera movements and there is almost no style. It worked for this movie because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach go beyond him. "The Blair Witch Project" caused some viewers to suffer from motion sickness due to the jerky handset that compiled this pseudo documentation. All in all, it was effective work on the terror of getting lost and being hit by a terrifying situation. There is no sense of story or topic, either spoken or visual. With this "Fantastic Four", you'll never get more than a casual laugh about the fact that the filmmakers and performers are actually trying to compete with other comic films with this poorly budgeted entry. <br /> <br /> Every film requires a lot of time and work. It's just so sad that so much of both was put into a project like this one. If you're one of the people involved, it's most likely to be a springboard for a (hopefully improved) movie career. Everyone knows how to take jobs to seize the opportunity. For those who are curious to watch this movie, I recommend doing this only with a group of friends (so you can all point out that you also watched the movie) that were warned about the experience (so no one before the shock) and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to relieve the pain between the random laughs. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points
