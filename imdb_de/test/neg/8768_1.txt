The other reviewer was completely right in this regard. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the topic was terrible. The actors looked like they were not really into the movie, as if they should have been almost there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really important to the story (or what a story was), and they were not very well produced. <br /> <br /> I suppose they were trying to hone the success of the other eschatologically influenced films (Omega Code, Left Behind) (can I say that?). And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when producing this kind of movies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially non-Christians.
