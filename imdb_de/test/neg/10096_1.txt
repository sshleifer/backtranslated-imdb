The worst movie I've ever seen. Worst. I can not imagine a movie worse. Nothing to see. No acting at all. Hey (actors) should look for another job. I can not understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough ... I can not imagine how HUUUGE must be mortgaged to justify the job! /> As for the leading man ... what a lead! He should stay on a leash and stay there! I can see that he is more successful at barking than acting. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: Do not rent ... DO NOT BUY!
