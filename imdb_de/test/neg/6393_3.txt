Yes, I know that the girls are hot and the scenery is lovely, but for someone who knows the place, it's funny. It starts with the flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio aboard a 747. This will never happen on the 400 km long flight. Smaller aircraft such as the 737 or A-320 take passengers between the two cities every half hour. The ride from the airport home, when displayed on a map, would show a complicated zigzag up and down. Maybe the producers have tried to simulate one of the very well known taxi driver routes when they face the tourists. Not that it was a local habit, as I was attacked even in very serious places like Switzerland. The girls, yes. Everything topless An outsider will never understand. Brazilian chicks will be happy to have uncovered 100% of their incredible bodies at the Samba Schools parades and to wear almost nonexistent bikinis on the beach, but never topless. A handful of beaches across the country will allow. Everything carefully isolated and outside the city. Oh, the interior decoration. the amazing wallpaper ... maybe in Disneyworld ... Besides, it's very entertaining and yes, Demi Moore is absolutely great.
