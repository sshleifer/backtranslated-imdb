It is currently playing on SHOWTIME, but will be released as a movie titled THREE or released in 2006. Mess-ups include an alleged naked body coming out of the waves and wearing their underpants. You can have fun finding the others. It was a decently stranded, hungry, cold, crazy video, but that's about it. And what would a movie be without sex? The lady has a nice body and the men are pretty, but the story is the same as Swept Away or A Savage is Loose with some blood. I wonder if the movie studios know that they made a big booboo and have already released this show and will now appear as THREE. Billy Zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely. Juan Di Pace is great and there are some good sex scenes. There is a voodoo woman who loves the character Di Pace plays and in real life she is also Di Pace. No connection, but probably relatives or married.
