I thought of this movie when I saw pluto nash ... why ... because both movies were playing a belated robot, this movie was shot years ago but was probably written by a scriptwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something , ..Whoa ... AVOID ALL THE COST Even appreciating the ambitious Andy Kaufman is hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch taxi reruns on lantern television ... his latka gravas character is like this much more lovable ... TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
