This movie is so bad. But it's so bad that I laughed at my ass. For people who like movies, do not look at this. For people who like good and bad movies, I recommend them. The story is shaky, the script is terrible, acting is mediocre for the average. The soundtrack throughout the movie was crazy, but I loved it. The cool buzzwords were a plus. ha ha. "If it can bleed, it can die". The fight scenes have pulled me together. It seemed to me that they spent more time on these parts than anybody else, as most of the battle scenes were pretty clean. I almost feel that this movie would have been good if it had not been for the F / X ... No, it would still be a Mieshacker. the eye thing was crazy. and how the chick ate the guy in the kitchen's stomach, they could have done something where they actually ate something or at least put more fake blood on her face. and the lighthouse explosion disappointed me. I thought they got real fire instead of crappy, computer-synthesized things. and the end was so predictable, which surprised me when they actually did what I thought. in total. I say, this is a classic, as far as shit movies go. it is in my lower 5.
