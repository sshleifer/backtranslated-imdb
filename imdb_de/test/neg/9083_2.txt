Once again, Bronson's talent has been wasted on the shock of the thriller of 1984, which is far more disturbing than most that are still there today. The fact that "The evil that men do" (in verbal and visual depictions of torture) is very disturbing is not the problem. It is the shameless gratification in which it is presented. Interestingly enough, this film seems to symbolize the last part of Bronson's career by torturing many of his fans with the same uncannily foreseeable and uncreative plans. It is hoped that this good actor will be resurrected.
