Bad dialogue, slow story, scenes that drag on and are completely pointless. I can not believe that so much money was invested in such a badly written film. The director and acting could not save this bomb either. <br /> <br /> 50% through the movie and you are still waiting for it to begin. They lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up NOTHING. You look at 40 minutes of film that is absolutely directionless to try to do what, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Many of these films resemble a really bad French movie in which nothing happens and the characters are just a kind of boring, lifeless and self-centered person who lives without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends this will disappoint you and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.
