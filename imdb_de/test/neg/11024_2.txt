The ineffective, confused, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart has a bad marriage with Carole Lombard. After a hard time, he experiences a humiliating job, a flawed, passive-aggressive, overwhelmed living mother desperately needing an epic smooch and an endlessly crying baby. The film smoothes in case of failure and misery to no apparent end. Want to argue a couple with his mother for ninety minutes? Many scenes show a screaming baby. The movie can not explain why we want to endure the mother from hell or why Jimmy Stewart can not become a couple. Who wanted to see that? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or charm? <br /> <br /> It is absolutely depressing and unbearable.
