I've always loved horror movies. From some of the most famous ones like "The Exorcist" to some of the rather underrated "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who are people who joke and even call this trash a B-movie? It's just on the floor of the Z class. Acting is the worst thing ever in the movie. Really, I've seen better in an episode of "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Watch out when the woman tells them about the legend of Jack-o. She sometimes pauses for a few seconds, as if someone were flashing her queues and she's struggling to read her lines. A REBELLION! <br /> <br /> Oh, and aside from the bad acting, absolutely no Gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a pumpkin lit with plastic. Check out Linnea Quigley's "Night of the Demons" or "Silent Night, Deadly Night," far superior films.
