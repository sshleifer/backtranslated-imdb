This film begins as every movie should begin, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm roaming around in their underwear and / or topless. A few of them take a shower. I like it so far! Unfortunately we meet then or main characters. They are just not very nice. In these films, the actresses do not usually play, they give very "natural" performances and they are very personable, funny and sympathetic. Not here. They do not have much personality and I did not care much about them. <br /> <br /> Some of the girls go on a camping trip to school. On the way they stop at a Hinterwald gas station and meet a bikers gang. The biker gang should have been excluded from the movie - before it was cheesy, but now it's just stupid. The headbiker looks like a middle-aged man dressed as John Bon Jovi on Halloween. The girls go into the forest and later the biker gang follows them. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what happens next. There is a lot of stuff about the end of the world because it is the end of the millennium. Then some of the bikers are killed by a mysterious Indian guy who is constantly disappearing. Someone is being eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness monster thing as he swims across a lake. A guy in dumb makeup is apparently a druid and he has to sacrifice some girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe the end of the world, I'm afraid I did not pay much attention. First, he dresses the girls in animal skin lingerie. <br /> <br /> It could have been a really fun, cheesy movie, but the bicycling group destroyed the atmosphere and the conspiracy was so distracted that it did not even seem like it. Live my beat Z-Schlock expectations , They should have eliminated half of the action and focused on just one or two things. Instead it is everywhere. All in all, if you're looking for a late 80s racquet, I can imagine you could make it worse. If you really tried. There's a lot of nudity in the beginning, but the characters are kind of grumpy and the plot is too nonsensical to be of little satisfaction.
