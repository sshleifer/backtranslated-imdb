Many good things could have been done with this film, using essentially the same sets, plotter, and act. For example, why not plant a seed of Erica's abilities before the assassination of her lover? Why do not you develop Erica and the cop's relationship slowly and convincingly? Perhaps Erics contrasts Metamorphis by incorporating another facet, relationship, etc. into their lives after the event she is now refusing? Why should not she hurt an innocent bystander to underline the incorrectness in Eric's actions. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO takes advantage of the revenge fantasy to its maximum level and gives lip service to doing "not at home". Messages are only displayed for the movie to qualify as legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Jodie Foster fan. After starring in films such as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, NELL, and one in which she plays the prodigal mother of a child prodigy, Foster has slipped into a series of roles in which she plays the same hard-bitten, strangled heroine, the evil alone defeated. That's okay once or twice, but I'm getting used to their close-up "fight against flight." TBO would have a younger actress or one who found it more convincing to be a woman in her forties (instead of 40 Foster playing a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a movie with significant actors, funding and music resources that manage to get to garbage.
