This movie is so terribly awful! Everything about it was garbage. you can not say good things about this movie, the acting, the script, the direction, the effects are all just as bad as each other. Even ed wood could have done better. I urge you to stay away from this movie unless you want to waste about 100 minutes of your life or how long the movie has been. I forget. This is the first time I've written a commentary on a movie on IMDb, but this movie was just on TV and I had to let the world of movie lovers know that this movie sucked balls !!!!!!!!!! !! So, if you still have decency in you. Borrow a much better bad movie, z. B. animals. 3
