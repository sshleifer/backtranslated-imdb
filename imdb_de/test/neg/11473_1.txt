I had heard that this movie was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It has been a while since I saw him (and hopefully I do not think all my memories are wrong and I wrongly condemn this film), but I remember the filmmakers trying to portray Leopold and Loeb as victims an anti-gay society, and that somehow caused her horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view and think that this is unfair to both homosexuals and Bobby Franks, the true victim of the story. I can not imagine why anyone wants to claim these two as martyrs. I also thought that L & L was presented a little more sophisticated than they actually were - after all, it was teenagers who lived at home. The film puts her in a kind of fantasy world, which Morrissey apparently should assess. <br /> <br /> I've just read an interview with one of the filmmakers who implicated the film's anachronisms, such as the push-button phones that used tokens were meant to "increase Brecht's distance." You certainly do, but I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> Apparently some people found this movie interesting, but I would have liked a less "stylish" and more realistic investigation of the part homosexuality may have played in the case of Leopold & Loeb.
