I was attracted to the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it is an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two dark songs and a botched rip-off. I did not care about the characters, and the plot never even tried to pretend it could be realistic. I can not believe this is the screen. I liked watching this movie because it felt so good when it was over.
