I read the book after watching the movie and was not interested in it, I found it a bit garbage; but trashy books often make good movies, and you could have it. The story of a juvenile girl examining her attraction over the boys, whom she regards as irresistibly stimulating, is undoubtedly controllable, and she has an even stronger grip on her than a normal girl because she is concerned by her waswolfry. - This story would have an obvious incentive for the young audience for whom movies are being made: one incentive for girls and another for boys: and I do not understand how the filmmakers might be oblivious to the story in one with little appeal. <br /> <br /> First take the title (which is best of the book): it refers to a Hesse quote that is also used as an inscription. A person who runs in fear and has blood and chocolate in his mouth Mouth tastes, one tastes just as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the state of the heroine: torn between her human and wolf sides, enjoying each, but equally afraid of both. The film dispenses with the inscription and instead introduces the figure who works in her aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the title of the book might have suggested to the filmmakers the erotically charged chocolates of "Like Water for Chocolate" and made them associate the same symbol with werewolves. But they did not do it. Why is it in the movie? In the book, the characters are in high school - or in and out, like the Five, a youthful gang that prefers black jeans and t-shirts, and somewhere between the Nemeses of the heroine and her favorite players. In the film, they have become decadent club visitors. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, only to find out how her sexuality affects the boy she wants, and herself; She is the one who initiates the contact, then resigns, is reinitiated, and so on. In the film, she's not a girl anymore, she's a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the edge of campus life, but a lawless refugee (and a cartoonist), he's coming up for her, in a way that is as unattractive as her cousin's. She pushes him off first, but then gives in, and he's confident she'll do it: Hey, you know you want it. I would have thought that a female director would have taken the opportunity to show a female protagonist in a relentless, proactive role; but no. <br /> <br /> In the book, the heroine's clan is expelled from her home because of the delinquent behavior of the five; In the movie, it's because she made a run (!). She's a great runner and tends to run away from walls, and both she and her clan colleagues scale buildings in an instant. very much like heroes of martial arts films and unlike wolves or anything that resembles them. In the book they do not become real wolves, but larger things than wolves; In the movie, these are just ordinary wolves. In the book, they turn into "Howling" style with crunching of spikes; This is one of the things that makes the heroine aware of the pain her body brings, as well as pleasure. In the film, the werewolves have become magical acrobats performing large swarm dives and transforming themselves in the air, gleaming yellow like Tinker-Bell; It looks cool, it means nothing. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan is a white-trashy family who moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest, but all speak with different accents, not Romanian. In the book, almost the entire pack wants to live a normal life, agreeing that it is a necessity to keep their true nature secret from humans - indeed, to survive. And so the characters in the film say again and again; Still, the clan boss is a kind of underground boss - but obviously not a criminal boss, since he scorns criminals - and has a stand contract with the police, which provides him with "meat" for the pack. This seems to be a great exception to the rule that keeps people from knowing; But maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. At the end of the book, the heroine learns she can not be something if she does not live in her effort. In a shared life, she remains stuck between the human and the animal state, unable to be one or the other. Your friend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack can not risk it, and they have to part. In the film, she rescues him like Lassie and they go to Paris (why Paris?), At one end that is ridiculous, but not really happy, as the conflicts between their natures - between their natures - remain unsolved But the difference in The movie that hinders the enjoyment the most is that the book characters behave conventionally in the field of young adult novels, which for some reason were as annoying as possible in the movie. Any other line is a threat or other kind of encouragement: you will regret it; you do not belong here you will not get rid of me; I gave you your chance. etc. I prefer to stay away from people who act like that. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. If this book had stuck to the book, it could have been the first one. <br /> <br /> But no.
