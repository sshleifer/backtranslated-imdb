This movie has too many things going on. Another reviewer comments on the disconnected, episodic nature of the film as the director's memories - that's fine if he's written and performed that way. What we get instead is a straightforward narrative - sometimes - that jumps back and forth, in some cases makes us dangle, interrupts the river with unnecessary digressions in other cases, and simply does not work. <br /> <br /> There are also some details that just do not work. For example, why draw a body to a beach in an urban area in bright daylight, as opposed to nighttime? Why are you leaving your flat sheet on the body? Why would an artist who knew the Joe character for a short time decide to let him have "everything" (even if it was not much)? This negotiation was poorly developed for this point to work. Why is the man an invalider or an artist at all except to deliver the money and unpaid act scenes? He might as well have been a photographer or an opera composer? How do you judge an apartment in an opera house - especially without a clear connection to the opera? The coincidences are also too obvious and too unclear and inexplicable. Why do the boys take everything into the warehouse and "disappear". If Tim was a ten-year-old schoolmate in a small town like Bangor, how could Joe lose sight of him for eight years, especially if they knew each other well enough so that one would recommend the other for a job. <br /> <br /> Some of the other negotiations (like the mother and her boyfriend (s)) and the sister who wanted to escape felt like padding on interesting shorts. When completed, this film made little sense and offers even less.
