The film opens in Mexico, where a girl was cursed, she spits snakes through green jelly, and her friend tries all those crazy spells to lift the curse. He does nothing but a horrible vocal language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border, get on the train to get to LA to see his uncle to pick up the curse. Comic Merriment follows. This movie has the same snakes again and again! It has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes, which makes no sense. The whole movie has some funny lines, some faint effects, but most of all a great ending that leaves you like WAM BAM WHAT THE TAIL ONLY HAPPENS !!!!! The whole movie is about a 1, but the end is a 10, so it gets to my crazy math a 3. If blockbuster has nothing else what you want, then get this for mindless entertainment!
