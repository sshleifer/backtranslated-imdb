File in the "How are films made like this?" Pillar. An indie version of Macbeth from the Seventies that adapted quite faithfully (but meaninglessly) to a conventionally unconventional black comic style. The cast gives the one try, with Christopher Walken, who calls in the eccentricity as McDuff, and with Maura Tierney as Pat McBeth. The other actors are just as wasted as the time of the audience. Fans of this weird way may like it. 4 out of 10.
