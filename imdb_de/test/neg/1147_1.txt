Why, oh why, they had to try to make a sequel to one of the biggest Christmas movies of all time. The film is a train accident on every level and should never have been done. Randy Quaid's portrayal of cousin Eddie is a towering caricature of his earlier outings as cousin Eddie. The Eddie character is also not interesting enough to transport a whole movie. Even "Eye Candy" Sung Hi Lee could not redeem this heap of holiday crap. Please do not waste time for this move, just look at the original again.
