I got this movie from my uncle, who got it for free with a DVD magazine. It's easy to see why he loved it so much. Now I understand that this is a B-movie and that it does not have the same budget as bigger movies, but surely they could have spent their money better than doing this trash. There are some pretty good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (eg Assassin Droid). This movie also contains the worst fight scene I've ever seen. The amount of nudity in the movie sometimes made him more like a porno movie than a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Finally - Awful movie
