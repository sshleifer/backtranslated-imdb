The movie Heaven's Gate was a good sight, though it was still boring for over 4 hours. But the film took on a big license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" were actually married. Her main contribution to the Johnson County War was to begin him by hanging. Well, I'll start with that, I mean, it was at the beginning and not at the end. Here is the true scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married, as each family could be given a homestead. By signing up as an individual, you could get two homesteads. They chose Homsites on Crazy Woman Creek, who actually control the waters over the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, but they refused. Although in actual life it is the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate) and a prostitute (and also in film), there is no real proof that it is true. It is known that she bought many heads of sick cattle, nursed them again and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the livestock for "indecent acts". In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly not true. So much for this part of the myth of the "American West," which is a myth that spans a period of about a hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life, you and Jim Averill were one day surprised by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand and immediately hung up. Those who committed the injustice were never brought to justice. But this was the first link that led to the murder of the Nate champion. and the beginning of the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Quite different from the Hollywood version that shows their shot in the end. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the main problem with The Movie was the editor, which was able to make the action faster through more skilful editing.
