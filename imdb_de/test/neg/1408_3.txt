Combining serious drama with appropriate comedy is vulnerable in the best of times. In search of comedy in the Muslim world, it was possible thanks to a topical theme and a fantastic script. not to mention Albert Brooks' brilliant, brutal character portrayal. But MAN OF THE YEAR can not come close by comparison. It has a messy message with forced jokes and a twisted love story that's absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> The premise was very promising at first. Use a Jon Stewart-style comedy news anchor for the President of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful television personality pressured by his audience. Included are his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK) and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Tom Dobbs seems to have a chance of a successful run and wins the election amazingly. <br /> <br /> But does he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE EXORCIST OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer geek of the company that has developed the new electronic voting software in polling stations. She finds a malfunction in the system that is quickly being swept under the carpet by the company's owner and his dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). When it comes to losing billions of dollars, the company's evil men should choose to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure they never tell anyone. But Eleanor is able to reach President Dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the incredible love story begins to blossom). Dobbs goes on Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, thereby deregistering himself as the newly elected president and ending the career of computer companies. Oh, and he saves Ms. Green's life. <br /> <br /> Does anything sound funny? The comedy is forcibly trapped in history and often awkward. Robin Williams is on fire for a few moments during a debate, but is quickly doused as the severity of his presidency breaks in on him. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is also interesting and controversial: this particular interest has presidential candidates. I'm sure this is an essential truth, and if you wanted to make a movie about it, you could. If you wanted to make a comedy about you, you could. But the man of the year is not.
