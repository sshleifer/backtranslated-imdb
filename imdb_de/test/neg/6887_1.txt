I think when people say that this is filmed beautifully, they talk about the close-ups of frogs and cooking meals. It certainly does not refer to the set, which apparently consists of about 3 rooms and has no exterior shots. In addition, everything is filmed too close. <br /> <br /> I was tired of having the little boy who keeps fuming Miu or infusing ants with hot wax? A bit disgusting, at least as that movie is - a close-up would have been more than a dozen or more. <br /> <br /> Then comes the second part ... a chick movie for Vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who plays the piano all day (he is cultivated). The pretty girl steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit. Deep. <br /> <br /> Apart from some nice close-ups, this movie is a breeze. It's a kind of soap opera without dialogue. It is covered. How is it nice? The set looks completely fake. <br /> <br /> No, do not make the mistake and rent it because someone recommended it. I was expecting beautiful shots of the coastal areas of Vietnam or something when I heard it was a visual gem. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I like foreign films, which they even prefer. But this movie is stupid and boring. It will irritate you that such a thing has won a lot of prizes.
