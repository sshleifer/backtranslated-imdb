It is reassuring to see that other IMDb critics had the good sense to wave this disappointing film, with the danger of blaspheming the great Vadim, Malle, and Fellini. These directors may be talented and artistic in their own right; Trying to abandon this mixture of attempted eroticism and '60s chic as * in any way * related to Edgar Allen Poe's stories, they exposed themselves as a fraud. Either (A) they did not bother to read the Poe stories, or (B) they read them, but were so tied up by their own selfish agenda that they did not bother Poe. <br /> <br /> Imagine When Metallica hooked up their guitars, he turned the amps to 11 and mapped out 3 chords claiming it was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. That's the feeling you get after this movie. If you are a Vadim / Malle / Fellini fan (Metallica), you will find it. If you are a fan of Beethoven (Poe), you will puke. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a bizarre porno version of Poe. OK, "porno" is a bit of haha, but at least it has to be called a Barbarella version (undoubtedly some of Jane's outfits coming straight from the set of this scifi trumpet). Vadim falls into old stereotypes of him: The girl lying on a bed is pleased by a man while we see from the pillow the apathy in her eyes; the general languor and boredom of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Sweet stuff, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place for it. Aside from the Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic motifs, Jane Fafa's awful American accent and unconvincing performance as European countess made the worst cast since Julia Roberts in this lousy version of Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM Wilson ... <br /> <br /> Here's a great Poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he's not in the world anymore is unique. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, check out the Star Trek episode # 27, "The Alternative Factor." But here Malle glazes about this central theme and instead focuses on ... all guesses ...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum. Brigitte Bardot's role is a complete invention to achieve that goal, and again the director distorts a classic Poe story into an masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual problems. Do it for your free time, Malle. I thought we were here at Poe's Dime. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The absolute worst of the three, and possibly the worst, movie I have been "staying alive". At least Fellini showed a little discretion in changing the title, but his departure from the original storyline, the theme, and the humor of the story is so great that I was wondering if he'd just stamped that role out of his private collection of home videos "Edgar Allen" selected Poe Story "and submitted it to this collection, and I tried hard to find some thread of Poe's works, but there was absolutely none. <br /> <br /> The original Poe story ( "Never Bet the Devil Your Head") is a short and amusing dark fable A man who keeps shouting, "I bet the devil bangs my head ..." On a misty morning the devil picks up his offer the sickest and dumbest thing you've ever read, this was Poe the comedian, the finest (yes, Poe wrote a lot of comedies.) Also check out "A Predicament" and "Devil in the Belfry" for a taste of his funny, satirical Want to have works). <br /> <br /> This Fellini version? It's boring, soulless and not funny at all (unless you think it's funny to see a drunk stumble over you for 45 minutes). This is Fellini's egoistic shouting about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretension and mediocrity of cinema. Most of it takes place at an awards ceremony where Fellini beats us with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic "sour grape" attitude that we find in all Fellini movies about cinema. Note the sarcastic jabs on "The Critics," a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who was above the critics, Fellini certainly spent a lot of time talking about her. In any case, I feel that Fellini has taken only a few outtakes of 8 1/2, put them together and sold them as a Poe story. Worst "adjustment" of all time. <br /> <br /> I think I took more trouble writing this review than any of the three directors did a Poe movie.
