When I taught Mrs. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun, funny teen comedy that would thrill me for the term. Despite a pretty good first half hour, the movie quickly becomes a boring, clich√©d jumble that's about as entertaining as pulling the eyelashes with pliers. In addition a rusty pliers. Crying author Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this film, proving that Scream may have been a coincidence. Most elements of this film have been seen millions of times in other films. and though it was alright to steal elements from other films in Scream because it's meant to be a Slasher tribute; Here it just looks like he runs out of ideas. The plot follows the smartest girl in the school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating with two of her friends; The three of them decide to take the teacher who took them hostage in their own home. This is not just any teacher. It's Mrs. Tingle, the meanest slut in the school. She also does not lie down at the bed as she begins to play mind games to play off her conquerors against each other. and a whole series of earlier films. It's actually not a bad idea for a movie and if Williamson could populate the movie with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. The character of Mrs. Tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she is massively one-dimensional and like all the other characters in the movie; it's just a cartoon. The acting is with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role largely diabolical. She is appropriately angry in the role, and although she does not have much to do to get her teeth; she obviously enjoys playing the central character. The teenage cast is not worth mentioning, only Katie Holmes stands out; and that's really because of her star profile, not her acting talents. Williamson has draped almost every scene into boring soft-rock music, which would be really annoying if the movie were not terribly horrible anyway. Honestly, this movie has some good moments. But basically, if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy - this is not the movie you want to watch.
