I suspect this board will soon be full of comments from over-emotional people praising "Dear John" as a "pearl" and "roller coaster ride" and all the other empty words the movie's target audience normally uses. <br /> <br I am definitely not the target audience of this movie, but I also do not like romantic dramas as long as they are well done, so here's my intention to take the movie. <br /> <br /> That's not the case. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie either. But the plot snakes, the development stagnates where it should have moved forward (just around the middle, to be exact), and as for the end ... it almost felt like they had no more ideas, So they suddenly said, "Hey, let's just film a final scene, put some sentimental string sound over it and end it." Even Amanda Seyfried's beauty could not save that. Channing Tatum also performed well, but you can only do so much with a faulty script. <br /> <br /> When talking about music, it is unbearably predictable and daring. From the smoky, irritatingly tall female folk singer Schtick (who is sure to appeal to the majority of college girls seen in this film) and the overused "flicker of strings and piano," it only annoys those who pay more Attention to the movie as a whole and not to its own "feelings". The film has a good start and the big conflict that brings us into the second act was all promising. Such was part of the second act itself as the story unfolded. Then the movie dropped the ball. In addition, I would have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it does not work the way it should. If you want to see a really moving movie about the long-awaited love reunion, check out "Notebook," which was really great.
