This movie was one of those movies in which I was completely misled because I thought it was a cheesy slasher movie from the 80s based on the cover, but that was not it. It was probably one of the worst Slasher movies I have ever seen. The image on the cover did not match a part or scene in the movie. In fact, it was not a chainsaw. Not even the tagline fits in the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads escaping to a lonely hut in the cold forest for a weekend getaway. Things get especially cold when they are killed by an unknown murderer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is chasing a dangerous killer. I will list the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The acting. Boy it was cheap and terribly bad. It felt unnatural and it seemed like it was a script. None of the actors seemed to be pretending to act with good intentions. They seemed stupid and tired. All the characters in the movie had bad acting, so I do not want to point out anybody, but I'd like to say that the Stoner did a terrible job, as did the police and the cheerleaders, which is no surprise. <br /> 2. The plot. This story had created a perfect story for the good old fashion Slasher movie, but instead it was peppered with holes in the plot, unnecessary and unnecessary scenes, and an overall stupid backstory about the murderer's intentions. There were big storylines, among other things, how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and was still in the group of girls when it happened? The ex-con had virtually no purpose in the movie except that it was a useless plotter. It was a random and unnecessary sex and nudity, even for a B-movie or for my taste it was a bit too much. As for the murderer's intentions, let's just say it was stupid and it makes no sense why he / she kills young girls. There were also some very predictable killings that I saw about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was fine, it was certainly not the worse lighting I've seen in a movie, but there were spots where it should be dark, but it looked more like afternoon. The house seemed darker with the lights on and then without lights. The camera work was average, there were no good shots or amazing pans or zooms. She thought she had done the job, was more exciting with the image design. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is in The sense of conspiracy, character development and performance was a big disappointment and a waste of my time. What I thought would be a great slasher movie turned out to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting was really bad and wooden, there was little sense in the plot and there were no emotions in this movie. The technical aspect of this film has saved me, however, because if the camera works or the lighting is bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and something else faded in. I would recommend this film to those who really like cheesy B-movies as well as those who follow cult classics, because this movie is for sure. I would recommend this movie partially for those who love 80s Slasher Flicks. But for me, this movie was pathetic and extremely horrible.
