Normally I try to be constructive and objective for movie reviews, but there is only one word for it, um, "movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! The dialogues, the acting, the special effects, the plot, the set and the characters all seem to consist of my potted plants. Do not see that to do all that is good and right in this world! :)
