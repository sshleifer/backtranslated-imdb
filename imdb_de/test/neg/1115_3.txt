I saw Wicked Little Things as part of the "8 Film To Die For" horror festival, and this was the only movie that disappointed me. That is, a mother, her little girl, and her teenage daughter settle in an abandoned house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. Every night, the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run around and slaughter anyone they find. <br /> <br /> I suppose the director has relied on his viewers to be deterred from children being capable of pimple-killing and the eating of human flesh (of which there are extravagant close-ups, as a beautiful one) Homage to George Romero), because otherwise the film is not scary. Simply put, there are far too many pictures of evil children jogging to their next murder site. If someone gets it in the barn, there will be an attitude of the children arriving in the barn (oh the tension) and then going to the kill. <br /> <br /> Come to think about why the kids are suddenly going so slowly when they cornered their prey? And not that I have experience with it, but I think a shotgun will throw a kid a lot more than this movie suggests ...? It also does not help that the mother is one of the worst parents I've ever seen in a movie. "The lock on the front door is broken"? You have an EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER in the WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! KEEP IT, MORON !!! In addition, mom and her eldest daughter are getting too close to age - even a teenage pregnancy - and there's a pretty incredible death in which you sneak up on someone trying to push a car out of the mud with his butt , <br /> <br /> I give this a 3 because it has tried. As a splatter movie, that's not bad. But for good fear, go somewhere else.
