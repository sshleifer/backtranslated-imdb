Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore calls "humor." That this film and Moore's other allegations actually attract admirers proves that unfortunately it is always possible to deceive some people. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can attract foreigners. Let's see if we can praise outdated factories. Let's see if we can contribute to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can isolate Charles Lindbergh. The only thing Moore lacks compared to Lindbergh is a coin by Goering. <br /> <br /> Granted, Moore had some self-esteem in his role in this movie. In this film, Moore Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors, mocks as a reserved, thoughtless elitist. Moore could do that in 1989, but now that Moore has indulged in elitist, unobtrusive elitism, this characteristic of Roger Smith has an ironic shimmer. Who would not rather be Roger's buddy than Michael Moore's?
