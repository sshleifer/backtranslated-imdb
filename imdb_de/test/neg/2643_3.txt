Without the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn in the lead role, I would have turned off "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. As eye-friendly as she is, she's not enough to save this movie, and that's far from the case. Milo starts with a group of young girls who accompany a "supposed boy" a yellow slicker to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in glasses. Apparently the deal was that old Milo, if he showed them the glasses, could take a gynecologist exam for any consideration. One of the volunteers, Milos "first patient" leads them behind closed doors. Moments later, blood streams out from under the door and we are led into the present. Step into pretty Jostyn, who plays one of the girls who are all grown up today. As a substitute teacher with shallow confidence, whose closest friend seems to be a goldfish, she receives an invitation to come home for a friend's wedding. Yes! You guessed it. Return to Miloville. Milo, who supposedly drowned years ago, seems to have a dilemma that remains dead and begins to terrorize and murder the girls he did not "investigate" years ago. Milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants in Cronenberg's "The Brood". He could have been scary, but how scary can a villain wearing a yellow raincoat be? The plot confuses itself and the conclusion left me with my 90 minutes. I'm sending Milo, an inappropriate Slasher movie, into the corner!
