I had no idea what this movie was about, jumping from plot line to line and connecting unpredictable ideas. it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> the chopped timeline does not help either. We start today, looking back on the past and then returning to the future to return to the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is also filled with awful juicy lines and clich√© themes like princess and the arge, "you can not even have me in my death", "you do not love me enough". Cliche to the utmost! <br /> <br /> The fight scene was terribly hackneyed, the lighting was constantly being shifted, which compensated for the CG with the actors (which means some of the backgrounds were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the company in di moon was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend his person, if possible avoid it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> If you found this comment difficult to follow, the movie would be just as bad.
