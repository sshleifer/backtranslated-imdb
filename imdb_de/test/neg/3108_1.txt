Crazy Director ... Yeah, you have to be crazy to make a movie in the area. Rob Lowe was bad at his character, Ice-t is always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. Crazy Six is ​​an unknown movie with some well-known actors ... that's pretty weird. A bad movie with some good actors. It looks like the bad movie had an impact on their performance ... It did! Crazy people ..... I give it * and a half out *****
