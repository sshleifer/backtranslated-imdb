Lahm is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a really bad script, uninteresting dialogues and characters, and essentially everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters and the problem is that you do not care about any of them. What the film lacks is a good and clear lead character. Instead, the film now has something of everything, he has a bit of hero, he has a bit of love interest and he has a bit of villainy. I wish it had a little less ghoulies, but in this movie they are usually very annoying. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies are said to be devilish creatures that kill for pleasure. In this film, they only want to drink beer and see naked students. Also, someone had the "ingenious" idea of ​​having the ghouls speak this time. This works really bad and annoying. The Ghoulie dolls have definitely been upgraded for this movie and they look more detailed and can do more, but at the same time they are much more fake than the previous Ghoulies movies. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that the goal of this movie was more comedy than horror this time around. The film is like a modest high school comedy of the 80s (though this movie was released in 1991). It really is the worst and lame part of the entire movie. It's so unbelievably annoying and just not funny. <br /> <br /> The story goes nowhere with its story and the movie is basically just a mess that never seems to end. The ghoulies plot line basically seems to have nothing to do with the other plot lines of the movie involving the human characters. The movie is in no way about the Ghoulies terrorizing a college. People try to hunt them and stop their raid. No wonder Brent Olson is only a movie so far. He just does not have any talent for it and I think he also discovered this and went to college by himself. <br /> <br /> Also compared to the previous Ghoulies films; This movie is just awful! <br /> <br /> 2/10
