This is an example of why most action movies are the same. Generic and boring, here is really worth nothing to see. A complete waste of the then barely developed talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who have proven each time that they are capable of acting and acting well. Do not worry, visit New Jack City, Ricochet or check out New York Undercover for Ice-T or Boyz n Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-Ts's dreadful clich√©d dialogues make this movie grate on its teeth, and I still wonder what the hell Bill Paxton did in this movie? And why does he always play the same character? From Aliens, every movie I saw with Bill Paxton played the same confusing character, and at least in aliens his character died, which made him a little bit satisfying ... <br /> <br /> All in all, secondary Special waste. There are countless better movies to see, and if you really want to see them, watch the Judgment Night, which is practically a carbon copy, but has better drama and a better script. The only thing that made it worth seeing was a decent camera action - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which almost makes up for the horrible movie itself - but not quite. 10.4.
