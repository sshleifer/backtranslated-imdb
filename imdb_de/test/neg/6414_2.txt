Apparently, a massive head injury is the cure for murderous tendencies that turn a murderous sociopath into a lovable and eager dog catcher. Also, (for the ladies) it seems that the gateway to a psychiatric clinic is an overlooked hotspot to meet potential partners. These are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities we should adopt for this movie to have meaning. I love movies and I believed how many Americans believe (forgive me if I'm wrong) that Hollywood is the best product. I came to see how sad naive and brainwashed I was and 2) how much more sophisticated European / Asian cinema is compared to its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I watched this supposedly disturbing psychological "thriller" night after seeing a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. When the camera faded from Walter Sparrow's happy little family, who enjoyed some nice hours at a prison visiting table (not to mention the patronizing voice that praised the virtue of "doing right"), I suddenly had an epiphany. I had just watched a movie in which I felt like I had just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was satisfied, but it was invariably expedient. The premise was mildly interesting, but the story itself with its innumerable "coincidences" (how do we explain to her that she found the book? We'll just say something "... or did the book find her?" I buy that. ), gaping storylines (why did they take the skeleton?), predictability and compulsory happy ending were just another Hollywood hack job. Besides, the casting of Jim Carrey was just wrong. Every moment I had the feeling that he was capable of doing something with one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed hardened cop who loves bondage and rough sex? You did not buy it for a second. <br /> <br /> You want to disturb? Deeply disturbing? Watch Suicide Club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 schoolgirls. The movie begins with a group of giggling high school students pondering on a subway platform. We then see with horror how they stand up, hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving commuter train. It is needless to say that much chaos arises. So far, I'm going to start with the story because I encourage the reader to see the movie. Actually, I am not sure if I could sketch the plot, even if I wanted to. What begins as an uncomplicated puzzle quickly descends into a madhouse with grotesque images. Did I understand the movie? No, not at first - how many of the foreign films my girlfriend introduced me to. So of course I thought it was "bad". But I remembered that. I went to bed and thought about the movie, woke up the next morning and looked at IMDb. I read some audience comments and was amazed at 1) the insights that others had gained from the film, and 2) the fact that I had missed the whole point of the film so thoroughly. I realized that I was so used to spoon feeding the "news" from Hollywood. If I was confronted with a movie that actually forces the viewer to join in, to really think for themselves, I was completely unkempt. It is as if I have been conditioned to "check my brain at the door" of the theater. <br /> <br /> Should I say that Suicide Club is the best movie ever made? Of course not. It has its errors, many of which have been reported sent by the IMDb reviewers. Do I say that all American films are bad and all foreign films are good? Not again, of course. My point is that there is a whole world of filmmaking outside of Hollywood - a collection of works that take the viewer; Forcing them to think and question movies that do not spin with the Telegraph, follow a strict linear sequence, and above all, do not insult the intelligence of the observing person. I look forward to broadening my thoughts as I explore this new world of film that "does not think for me".
