Let me say at the beginning that I do not even remember this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist, Solo (Giovanni Ribisi), shows himself to be a selfish, weak and neurotic loser who is utterly incapable of tackling the tiniest tasks, such as balancing a checkbook, keeping the word or coherent thinking. I suppose we should be attracted to his fragile vulnerability and encourage him through the process of breaking out of deep depression. I think we should sympathize as he stumbles through a series of mishaps that appear to have been triggered by the purchase of a dog, but in reality triggered by his own contemptible nature. At no time did I ever get the slightest indication that Solo ever had a redemptive character, which became disconcerting when he did not feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or a glimmer of conscience gave me the hope that he would ever realize that his life is so miserable because he is a self-pitying, self-pitying life. I have not developed any connection to this character. He did not seem to care, nor me. I actually wanted him to break his kneecaps at some point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the movie. It was simply a prop that could be used on a whim, neglected, despised, abused, desired and disposed of. So be warned. Although "dog" is in the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. Scott Caan's role is amusing and believable as the overreached best friend / kad. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I want to see more and more of him on the screen. Mena Suvari was wonderfully repellent. Lynn Collin's role as a "stripper with a heart" was well played, but the character was both absurd and clich√©d, not to mention that there was zero chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Barely. Comedy? If you say so.
