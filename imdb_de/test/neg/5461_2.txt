This looks like one of those Australian films made by "talented" students and funded by the government. It is full of intelligent color and shape recordings and verbal excursions into Freudian psychology that are valued by art students and teachers alike, but in general it is perceived as a silly ridicule about good cinema, good storytelling and generally good taste. That happens when art students are so compulsively indulgent. "Pink Flamingoes" is miles ahead of the same topics. Some porn movies from the 70s are much worth seeing and inspiring. The book of Revelation is not without merit, but as a total experience is well below the average B content.
