Anne is too old. Wentworth looks younger than she and he should not. Louisa is far too young and too happy. Oh, Sister Mary is way too pretty. She should be average, not pretty. If this actress complains about Mary, she should just be too pretty to complain. Lady Russell is too old. That's crazy. If you read the novel, she is Anne's older friend, maybe the same age as Anne's mother, who would be about 18 to 20 years older than Anne - about 50 NOT 70! It's crazy, it does not fit. How is it that Anne is so happy in the beginning? She smiles as she says, "Oh the worst is over, I've seen him, now the worst is over." OK, if anyone has seen the Roger Michell version of 1995, then you can not compare these two. That's right. This is far away. Read the novel and you know what I mean.
