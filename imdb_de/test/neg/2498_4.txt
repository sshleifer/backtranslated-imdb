Now that it's porno holocaust and staged by Joe D'Amato, I went into that movie and expected Sleaze ... and although I got it somehow, porn holocaust was a huge disappointment because it's just so damn boring. The title suggests that the movie will contain porn, and that's not wrong. Porn Holocaust is actually just porn, and most of it is the same stuff again and again. I quickly moved forward before the end. The first sex scene is between two women and she has raised my hopes, but after that she only degenerates to normal porn and the rest of the movie (for the first hour!) Consists of conversations and you can imagine how much fun that is sit through! The storyline focuses on a deserted island where, strange believe it or not, something strange happens. Of course, it does not take long for a group of people - consisting of a few men and scientists who happen to be sexy women - to land on the island. They have sex a few times and some strange things happen, then an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature that has an eye for the ladies ... <br /> <br /> It must be like a good one It was an idea for an original porno - a zombie who likes it, but it's no surprise that it does not work well at all. The film only expires ten minutes to two hours, which is far too long for such a movie. I have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is; If they had cut out of every sex scene for just a minute, the movie would have been under ninety minutes, and that would have made it a lot more bearable! It looks like the zombie takes forever (it's a long time before there's a sex break that's long enough to actually travel to the island), and when it finally appears, it's a big disappointment! I find out that this is a cheap B-movie garbage, but D'Amato could have put a little more effort into it and come up with something better! I will not even mention the acting, the atmosphere, etc., it makes no sense. Porn Holocaust is basically just your average, boring porn movie with a bit of a scare, and I can not recommend it!
