Let's see ... a few dozen Gary Larson gags, as well as his illustration style, a possibly legally difficult appropriation of an Aardman character, a more than generous cast of art movement from various Pixar films in what is an elephant cemetery in the middle of the farmland Oh, and a stinking Riverdance joke ten years after every possible relevance. The kids (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a big deal for daddy. Just another weak attempt by Nickelodean Films to participate in the animation explosion. I really wish they had spent a little more money designing characters, rendering, writing or directing.
