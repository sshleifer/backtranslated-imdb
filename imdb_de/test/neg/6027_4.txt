In fact, I liked parts of it very much. It had some interesting twists. But it just took me along, seeing that feeling after all the SAW movies. Granted, the end was different from a typical saw, but let's be honest ... a group of men unknown to each other (or they believe so) who were thrown together in an abandoned chemical plant ... <br /> < br /> But then it loses something. There is no intensity, there is a bad group dynamic, there is no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Finally, a few nice twists and definitely worth watching if there's nothing on your plate, but it just left me empty. .. time passed, but it did not satisfy.
