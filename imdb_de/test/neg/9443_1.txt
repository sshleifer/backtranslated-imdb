Maybe James P. Lay knows what to do in the sound department when a director oversees him. <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)', however, he can not achieve anything as a writer or director /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character formation, no events, no atmosphere, no action, no Twists, not a drama worthy of the name. <br /> <br /> In each of these departments, this movie is billions of light years behind every short film that contains some thought, even a minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with David Lynch's works! /> <br /> I think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Only recommend it to your worst enemies!
