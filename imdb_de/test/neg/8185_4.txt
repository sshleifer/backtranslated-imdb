On the opening night of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was quite excited to see films that are historical and not commonplace. The guest speaker who opened this film created a hype about the unknownness and how this film is underestimated. The science-fiction part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but I'm not sure if it's because it was shown right after the brilliant movie "The Wind" of 1928 or if it seemed like Russian filmmakers would do this after what Russian novels are famous for (hundreds of characters, intricate plans), but I know with certainty that the dramatic parts, as in the parts of the earth, make absolutely no sense, were boring and me lost in about twenty minutes. Maybe it was acting, but I was convinced why this film is "unknown and underrated": it's boring, there is no plot or basic story, and acting is terrible. This is certainly not a "Battleship Potemkin", but I would like to say that Russian films do not really make good efforts to find out what life in Russia looks like.
