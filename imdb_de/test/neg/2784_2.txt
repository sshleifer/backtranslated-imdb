Direct to the video and for a good reason. It's like neighborhood kids playing a game in the backyard, but worse. A young man (Don Digiulio) inherits a generations-old farm in West Virginia. He decides to bring some friends to check the property. On this farmland, even during the Great Depression, good crops were grown. The secret was that the owner murdered people and watered the fields with their blood. Then hang up their bodies as scarecrows. The special effects are pretty lame and the dreadful dialogue is full of noisy lineups and the banter, so ridiculous that the sound can be turned off better. Cheaper gore and a glimpse of a horror movie. Together with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
