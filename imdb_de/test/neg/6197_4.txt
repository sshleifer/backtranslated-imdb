A boring walk through the banalities of the Mormon prostate. Absolutely uncomfortable. Evidence for the widespread theory that the humor of the bathroom must necessarily be vulgar; It also supports the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. More propaganda as a movie, do not worry about delicate social issues that appear after this here at the dining table. The salvation of this film is the exact representation of young Mormon women as particularly attractive. Well, it's your $ 7.50.
