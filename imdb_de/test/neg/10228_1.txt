HOW MANY FILMS ARE THAT A RAGTAG TEAM GIVES THE GREAT GUESTS WITH THE MONEY? There is nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg had such a good CV ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, oh WHY, did he have to shoot those kind of movies in the 1990s and beyond ?! So, avoid this movie. There are a lot of good movies out there so there is no reason to waste time and money on this garbage. Obviously, the "green" in her head was money, because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever films with Pixar.
