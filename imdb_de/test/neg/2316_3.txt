"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"! If IMDb allows one-word ratings, this would be mine. This movie was originally intended for children only and it seems very difficult for adults or older kids to watch the movie. The song, the story, everything is boring and washed out - just like this public print. Like other comedy team films with roots in traditional children's stories (like the terrible SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this film has a limited appeal and does not age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many kids would even enjoy this movie today! My advice is NOT to watch this movie. If you MUST need a movie by Abbott and Costello, almost every other one of her films (with the exception of A & C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
