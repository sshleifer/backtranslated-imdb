This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The cast is an international, Australian pretender-to-be-Brit, American stage and a character with an English name, wearing an unrecognizable "European" accent. Which passable efforts of this colorful crew in the play area are completely undermined by a conspiracy and a script of special enthusiasm. So scarce were the costs of the budget of this film and the total production values ​​were so low that it would be no problem for him to win a competition in the cinema. For the last twenty years, we have seen horror films and stalking slash thrillers of exceptional (though not necessarily "high") quality that were made on a budget. Recent examples include the bad-witted but totally sinister "Blair Witch Project" and of course the recent winner, the low-budget winner SAW, who has virtually unknown leads (Gary Elwes is just someone you do not remember, even if you have seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS it's shocking to find a well-known character actor, Dominique Pinon, and Jeff Fahey of Hollywood, who bravely tries to save the movie. It's embarrassing when the formerly handsome leader (Fahey) in bizarre condition bizarrely expresses bad lines. I would have rated this movie with 0 out of 10, if that had been possible!
