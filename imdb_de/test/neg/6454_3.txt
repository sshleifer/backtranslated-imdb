Ugly, heartless Hollywood crap, expecting nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from his audience. The scenes WITHOUT Spacey show how horrible the movie really is. But the scenes with Spacey are just so entertaining that you stay until the end. Yes, he could play that role in his sleep, but he does it so well, it's a great pleasure to see her, so credible and wonderfully outrageous. Enjoy it for its performance, but do not expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great movie about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's The Player. This sad little potboiler is not in the same league.
