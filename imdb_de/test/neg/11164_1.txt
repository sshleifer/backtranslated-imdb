I do not know what was worse, the viewer made Dope or the stars in this movie, who look like dope. Should I believe that this woman raised the child for seven years and never noticed that the child was a bit dark? Should I believe her mother, father and husband that the child looks a bit dark? Should I believe, when the mother's courts ordered her to see the adopted parents' records that Lisa Hartman had that wow look on her face when she said to her mother that Christopher was half black! What! Was that really so, do you believe that? Not only did the grandmother and the grandfather look stupid and stupid when they mentioned that, but I think we should look surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg he's half black! A totally stupid movie, almost embarrassing when you see that!
