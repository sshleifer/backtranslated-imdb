I saw this movie in the cinema. I attended classes in Second City, Chicago, and of course I was very interested in this movie. It's a Woodward movie about one of the sons of Second City. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew John's story. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that tradition did not make him particularly friendly to women in improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. The man led his life and was deeply loved by the people who lived in his world, and tradition also says that he treated all his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea that poor Michael Chilklis (who is a really great actor) is in a really amazingly bad movie and is really just condemned to make a man's impersonator. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they could not Get the rights to Belushi's works ... and all the SNL scenes she portrayed in the film never happened. <br /> <br /> The notion that half of the historical information in the movie does not even follow Bob Woodward's work. A bit says "Okay ... we're going to line up with Belushi ... now we can follow Woodward too ..." They also decided to follow the premise "It's a wonderful life" in "It's a terrible life on crack "to transform. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian angel or the devil? Is the pinball machine the devil's electronic device ... how many different ends can you shoot with a movie? It's one of those movies after it's over ... you look at the person you're with and in stunned unbelief you go "What the hell was that ?!" In some circles, this film has become a cult classic. But for a good reason. <br /> <br /> As a good cult classic, sit on the screen and make fun of the screen (or cast snappy deposits). A cult movie is never good. And most people would never see them in a serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to see classic, bad 80s? Rent wired. If you want to learn more about John Belushi, you'll get more information on the walls of Second City Chicago than in this movie.
