A young doctor and his wife suddenly expect a child. Both were disturbed on the night of conception for about two hours. Interesting turn to a wacky story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter is superb in a cast with Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings the extraordinary to normal. Kudos to director Brian Yuzna.
