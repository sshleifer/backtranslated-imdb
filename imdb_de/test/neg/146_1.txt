An exceptionally stupid Braindead actioner leads the way in a story that would fit Spiderman's fill-in edition. The action sequences never flow as they should and leave a few cool pieces in a sea of ​​sound and rage that mean nothing. I really wonder how they will publish that in the West. Sam Lee, like the crazy newcomer Edison Chan, does not seem like acting talent yet. The robot is clunky and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (though performed by US Sfx people) are ridiculous, destroying any remaining suspension of unbelief. I'm NOT looking forward to Gen-Z Cops ...
