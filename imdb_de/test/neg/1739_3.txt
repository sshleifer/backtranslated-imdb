OK, let me start by saying that this is not a terrible movie. It's just not good. I remember a poster saying that acting was not camping but only nuanced. I have seen nuanced Japanese and Asian plays. Sorry, you're wrong. This is a warehouse. <br /> <br /> The characters are totally disliked, the deaths are random and absolutely meaningless. The writing is bad. I am alright with the lifting of unbelief, I'm fine if not everything was handed over to me in conspiracy. But this movie has no plot. A reviewer said, "This movie is set in a small town where people are crazy about whirls and spirals." This is not blurb, that's the whole crazy movie. Congratulations, I've saved you for almost an hour and a half. There is nothing left. No character development, no plot development, no explanations, no resolution. And not even the "acceptance in the realm of J-horror" lack of resolution. Only nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the score is made by someone who obviously has not seen the movie at the time because it happens to be enough to cause lash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and well done, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems the score is designed to fit a different movie. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give is as if the Japanese are redoing Evil Dead without the skilful parts or good acting. It just falls flat. It's J horror without the horror.
