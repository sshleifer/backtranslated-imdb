It does not take balls to make fun of people left behind. Listening to Mencia, who insists he is brave enough to make "delayed" jokes, is unbearable. It also takes no balls to bite off the Chapelle show. The race game shows, the race Olympics, it seems like many of the skits are just reworked Chapelle show skits that are just less funny. <br /> <br /> But the most annoying thing on the show is his urge to march to the beat of his own drum when he actually marches to the beat of many reworked drums that has been drummed many times before. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that it presents itself as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, stick with it. But personally, I think it's a bad show.
