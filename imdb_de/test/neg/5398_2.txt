This may include *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Where do I start at this empty wasteland? Well, it would have been nice if they had actually had a conspiracy. Acting talent, decent dialogue, excitement, humor, hey, even self-earned sex would have helped this film. Unfortunately, there was just a lot of gore (even that was not well done), automatic weapons shooting and missing. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no reason to describe the basic premise that an American Indian was damned to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, being tracked down by a special-ops federal team wearing civilian clothes (?). Most of the time was to violate one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie and break away from the group so they can be selected individually. You'd think this team would know better, especially because it's actually the third team being sent to investigate. The other two teams disappear without a trace. When they finally realize that they are being picked up, they build one of several stalls and fire their weapons to hit the trees a lot. The scene with tree photos repeats endlessly in this movie to save money. <br /> <br /> If they do not shoot at trees, they are pursuing that ghost that leaves no mark (who knows how they haunt him) and splashes a lot of macho BS. By the way, did I mention that most of this team is women? It's interesting to hear them speak hard. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, you'll find better movies at Kmart at Kmart.
