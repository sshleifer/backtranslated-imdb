BLACK EYE (2 of 5 stars) An uninspired 70's action movie that looks like it was made for television ... just occasional swear words and a subplot about lesbianism point out that the movie was actually meant for theater is. Fred Williamson plays a tough ex-cop who becomes a hard private eye. He encounters a few murders and attempts murders associated with a mysterious stick. There are some fist fights, a Bullit-inspired chase, a rather original elevator scene and even time for Williamson to confront his girlfriend's rich lesbian lover (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene where Williamson mobs a poor old man by picking up some valuable old signed photos in his memorial shop. Yeah, keep it up, tough guy ... maybe you'll find a cripple later that you can beat up? Obviously intended for the success of "Shaft" (this and about six thousand other films), this film does not have enough edge or originality to make an impression.
