Compared to other "sand and sandal" dishes, the Egyptian man leaves much to be desired. The film is very loosely based on Mika Waltari's researched novel, which focuses on the adventures of the Egyptian doctor Sinhue at the court of Akhnaton and his travels through Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral rigors of the times, much of the story of Sinhue (which is marked by romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the cutting edge, and instead the audience is played with reels and reels by Victor Mature made of wood. Even Gene Tierney? a leading actress of the time? I can not manage to do her best in this movie or play her, and she does give a rather somnambulistic performance that can only be justified by the fact that the actress had serious psychiatric problems at that time. There are many rhetorical and theological machinations about the idea of ​​monotheism. Polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as exhausting as the revolutionary Akhnaton that one certainly encourages someone who sends him back before the second part and restores the old religion. My tip: Buy the book at E-Bay, rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and name it one night!
