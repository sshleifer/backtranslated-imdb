Abysmal Indonesia's action movie from the legendary Arizal triumphantly designs a template for the future Cinemax pap such as "China O'Brien" and "Do or Die" with Erik Estrada, while also featuring up-and-coming action star Pat O'Brien with a sneaky backyard script and three Cans buried by hair-styling gel for his impressive 1984 mullet. This guy's physical ability is more like a Femme Mark Gregory, and his next loan would be secondary to Chris Mitchum's "Tom Selick." Powerful At least the action is thoughtless and uninterrupted. Some brave Asian stuntmen risk their lives for a poorly constructed film of teenagers and / or meth addicts without a reality concept. A poor extra is gorno-torn by an electric hedge trimmer, and many more are killed by being hit in the head by strange objects such as a motorcycle or a cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless, and a quotable dialogue like "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with such exuberance and zeal by the third-rate polizioteschi speakers. Random highlight: a crazy guy who eats live lizards. Film also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2.10
