I saw "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was there after I enjoyed him in the "Poirot" series. And Joss Ackland is always worth a visit, so I went into the movie expecting it to be a potentially worthwhile movie. Unfortunately, it should not be. <br /> <br /> I will not criticize the performances, the tempo, the cinematography or other structural aspects of the film. Others have already commented on these elements. The only thing I want to talk about is the message of the film, as the intro announces that it is based on a true story, and the film's supposed importance hangs over the impoverished black African named Kingsley, who wants to move to the US because he thinks he can make money there. No more and no less - his motivation is completely selfish. (Of course some people will say they are doing it for his family, but in fact he decided to have children for the income he could earn in Ghana, so he really just created his own problem.) For this purpose, Kingsley decides to stow on a Russian freighter to New York. He stands under harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But this is where the film makes me uncomfortable. Why should the public be expected to be interested in Kingsley? Just because he has a goal? Targets are not so rare that they should take precedence over the ship's captain or the woman he left home with his newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It is also illegal because it is stolen by the Russian shipping company. If he makes it to the US, it would mean leaving a system he has not invested in. And if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I doubt very much that each of the stowaways cares about what the chosen approach costs for each other; They are clearly only for their own profit. He could have spent the $ 1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for a legal passage to the US and applied for a residence permit and a work permit. Instead, he goes the illegal (and dangerous) way. <br /> <br /> So, since Kingsley's journey is illegal, selfish and not ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges go beyond the challenge of the Russian shipping company coming to New York without Stowaways? Because he is black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be that Danny Glover (the executive producer of the film) and others want us to choose Kingsley as if he were a hero on some sort of noble journey. But once you admit that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission are not noble, you can not really take care of him. <br /> <br /> Before someone plays the racing card, I assure you that I would do that. I felt the same, no matter what ethnic background / nationality the parties involved. Imagine, a British person would decide to stow in one go to Bhutan, sneak across the border and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiquities to bring them to Britain to sell there. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced confront? I would bet very little. Why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he is black? Because he is poor by American standards? The filmmakers insist that we share their views, that the ends justify the funds, and that a shipping company is fined $ 45,000, compared to the possibility that an unskilled worker in the US earns a little more, when he could have stayed in his homeland. I did not buy it for a minute.
