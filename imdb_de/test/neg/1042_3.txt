Rented it by mistake, as if it was another movie with the same title, and realized that I had leased it some time ago. <br /> <br /> Fast Plot Line. A couple, consisting of an artist and a photographer, rent a studio apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez and still curse the fact that his brother Martin Sheen is actually ACT! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is followed by a vicious-looking serial killer from the 1930s and his last victim. Their spirits inhabit the couple by first improving their sex life but then becoming more and more threatening. <br /> <br /> What follows are cheap R-rated sex scenes, cheaper experiences and a sort of waste of time.
