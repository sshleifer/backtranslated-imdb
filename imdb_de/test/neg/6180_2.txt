What's good about "The Slaughter Rule:" - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse offer great performances. GÃ¤nschen is pretty good as always. The venues are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Here's the worst thing about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Everything Else. The script is terribly messed up. And although I certainly appreciate a movie that does not feel comfortable, this movie is just boring. Great performances can not interpret a movie with a stupid premise and a script filled with throw-away lines that often make no sense. It was obligatory only to get through the first hour. <br /> <br /> I stayed with Gosling, but eventually I did myself a favor and changed channels. Spoiler forwarded here to me. I did not miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good gosling movie, check out The Believer. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
