The only reason I give a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good rendering of the story. I enjoy watching some fictional characters color a known story. But the second half was terrible !!! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the authors of this film have decided to include only violence and forget the good things God has done for the Israelites. Towards the end of the movie, Scott looked like he was getting news of the big, huge head instead of talking and hearing from God. This rendering had some HUGE problems with the font deviation. And big surprise there are no favorable deviations! Her portrayal of Moses as this screaming naked madman doing all this against his will is completely wrong. It showed a Moses who had to scream for God to talk to him. WRONG Scripture says that God spoke to Moses the whole time, not just after a tantrum. They had understood the complaints of the people correctly, but they did not show that God in Sinai spoke to Moses in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe (Chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud that led them day and night. <br /> <br /> What was the whole Joshua thing? The righteous peace-loving Jew who would not fight until Moses threatened him? WRONG (He was known as a great warrior) What about the great speech Moses gave to the army, telling them that God had helped them enough, and now they were alone? FALSE (They won only by God's help, as shown in their own scenes, when Moses raised his staff.) And what was that sad Ark of the Covenant? Instead of overlaying it with gold, this movie had a tight budget and attached small gold chips to it! Oh yes, it was a "melted calf", not a straw with small chips. Someone forgot that he came with a huge gold tribute from the Egyptians from Egypt. They would not know about this sad looking bunch. By the way, the part about them that killed the Israelites after the golden calf fall says "men" and does not mention women and children who call the movie pleased to show the onlookers. Oh yes - manna was not the only thing sent from heaven - do not forget the birds for meat. The Bible also mentions that Jethro Moses brought his wife and children and then says that Jethro has returned to his own land. It does not say that Moses gave up his family. <br /> <br /> If you do not know the story, read Exodus itself. If you know the true story, you will hate this version.
