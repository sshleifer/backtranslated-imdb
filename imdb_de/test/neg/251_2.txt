This movie should be billed as three movie summaries that are linked to a full-length feature film (including many shots of people walking slowly through dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec movies, as told by the main character. The actual movie does not start until the thing is almost over. I have to say, the exaggeration of the bat is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought that a robot is a mechanical device that resembles a human or not. The "robot" of the bat consists of a radioactively revived corpse, which is surrounded by a leading robot body. Tom Servo said, "He's not that impressive, he does not even have knees!" That, and the robot takes about an hour to rumble across the room. But as soon as he got you, WATCH OUT! He will dissolve you with a touch (powered by Radium? Pluh-ease!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the bots. Otherwise you are just a bunch of abuse.
