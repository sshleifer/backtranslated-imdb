I began to critique this adaptation within the first few minutes, but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan, I held to the end. However, this is not a program I would recommend to someone unfamiliar with their work. I do not think it will do the book justice, and it does not make TV very entertaining. This adaptation had some credibility - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look, and I sometimes found the acting poor. There is no doubt that the actors all looked very good, but this did not provide enough variety to create truly diverse, memorable characters. It was far too static to just sit in the same spot and miss Fanny's return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured Edmund's health very well, and the Crawfords were also effectively cast. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but that role did not suit her and was much better played by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version, which in general provided a much more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen adjustments always offer a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately this is one of the worst I've ever seen.
