I do not think this can legally be called a "movie". The plot was so weak, the dialogue was so flat and the lines so horrible that I could not believe that someone had actually written down the lines, and said, "Holy crap, this is a masterpiece," and actually makes it a manufacturer , I am still perplexed and will remember this film forever, as a sign of the degeneration of intelligence in America - that and of course "Crossroads".
