This is really a movie of two halves. The first describes in detail the life and friendship of two boys (one of the privileged Pashtuns and the other a troubled Hazara) in Afghanistan in the late 1970s, before the invasion of the USSR works extremely well. The young actors show compelling performances and see Afghanistan as it once was, throwing the current situation into a deep relief. <br /> <br /> The real problem arises as we enter the later stages of history in which we join Pashtun as a man living in America. Old debts to his young friend meant that he returned to his homeland. At this point, everything collapses. The central adult character is clearly sympathetic, but in fact acts like a blink of an eye and smoldering in self-pity. It's hard to really care about him, and you can not help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we can not see - that of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> As soon as he returns the narrative to Afghanistan sinks into a series of highly invented coincidences. It is noteworthy that, after all these years, he almost immediately encounters his childhood enemy (although he does not seek it), despite the chaos that has now consumed the country. This allows him to counter earlier demons in ways that are simply too practical to be credible. The narrative's dissolution will also go through with a terrible, Mawkian sentimentality that undermines any truly serious issues that the film may attempt. <br /> <br /> Although it's possible to see characters and their abuses Live as a symbol of a state torn apart by world politics, it's hard to really see this movie as a movie that resonates with every political Discussion deals. Instead, the narrative is reduced to a person's emotional journey to self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so boring and self-contained that it is difficult to really engage with its history while ways to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.
