In essence, this is a fairly typical Western revenge that's heavy on spaghetti, and if you persecute it as such, the protagonist gets away by successfully defeating the main villain. However, there is so much going on that it does not affect the story that you have to wonder what the filmmakers are thinking about. I'm referring to things like Miss Rosie's singing number coming out of nowhere and boxing in the middle of the city. OK, they loosely relate to the influence of the villain Mash Flanagan, but why does he suddenly come up with an alias - Mr. Donovan quite innovative, like the camera that shows off the wounded gelding from someone with a bullet in his shoulder could have been filmed. And was not it great how Donovan's girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little frisky? Do not let me forget the great stunt work of the gravel pit villains when Wallach crushes them as part of the final. Even so, there was one thing that was not cleared up throughout the movie. What happened to the hood trio Flanagan / Donovan engages just before the start of the picture? You know, the guy Martel, who wanted to hire a funeral home for his skills as a weapon, the devil Mitchell's henchman with the rifle and the knife thrower Lincoln Tate. Each had a bounty of five thousand dollars and they were to protect Donovan from the guy who survived the massacre of the opening scene. They were never heard again! I like to believe that Donovan might have killed her and kept 15K to herself.
