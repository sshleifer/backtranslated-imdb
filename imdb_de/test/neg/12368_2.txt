The movie was pretty bad. It's not so much a script problem. It's just that the movie is really boring. The film seems to be slow and torturous. The story in San Franpsycho says that there's an open-air serial killer who kills morally corrupt people (maybe I've read too much, but hey, that's my nature) after The San Franpsycho killed a couple under the Golden Gate has Bridge We will meet one of the main characters of the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a policeman from Billmulkerei named Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer (seriously he has no name, he's just the killer), and he's trying to force a local news reporter called Rita to help him with his investigation. Bill is the stereotypical edged policeman and he threatens Rita to throw her in jail for obstructing justice. Nevertheless, a few scenes come by and suddenly Rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (He is a cold-blooded psychopath!), And she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and helps them with the investigation. <Br /> <br /> The film tries to be a tense murder mystery, but somehow fails. It's similar to the movie The Black Dahlia, which tries to be tense, but it's just unbelievable. The movie tries to be serious through and through, but there are scenes like The Killer masturbating (obviously a fan of gore porn with lines like "ooh blood on them" or something like that) and Joe Estevez, who's on the table, " He's a cold-blooded murderer! "I admit to laughing in the movie more than once, though I'm sure it should be a deadly serious movie. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive things the movie has is the fact that I did not pay for it (huzzah netflix). And it's sad because I saw some good movies in their films after seeing The Damned. Sure, the movie had a lot of bugs, but it was fun. Unfortunately, San Franpsycho has nothing to offer. Granted, it has an okay script, it's nothing too grand, but it might be interesting. Instead, you get a murder thriller that is not enthusiastic or has only a vaguely happy death. The other reviews claim that the film has "a great twist that is shocking". Apparently, I saw another movie because after about an hour, I figured out what would happen. The end did not shock me in the least. I would continue to insult this wreck of a movie, but I do not think I'll do that. Short Short: This movie is a boring, uninspired thriller (I'll use that term loosely) that does not have the "Hitchcockian thrill" that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, bland deaths that feel like a wooden plank act, and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will try to defend it against the usual: it was a low budget movie, he did the best he could with such a small budget, which he could do other nonsense. But if you think about it, there was very little that they could have spent on this budget, there were very few special effects, the soundtrack sounds like it was recycled by Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned, and it is the same damn crew from these two movies. This movie really reminds me of another low-budget movie that was not good, and it's called Mr. Jingles, they're about the same quality, they're not delivering anything that pleases, and should be quickly forgotten.
