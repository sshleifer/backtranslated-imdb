OK, from the point of view of an American I suspect he does not know much about rugby. This would be an amazing movie for her. First of all, he has a good heart and a good morale, the typical good coach who tries to change the bad boy. HOWEVER, where I come from rugby is the number one sport, it's a lifestyle, it's just the bravest, and the winners are celebrated like heroes, as if the Americans were doing their baseball / basketball stars. I'm not really sure if it was the cheap budget or maybe the director or the actors knew very little about rugby and was a rugby fan all my life when some of the actors did not even know rugby existed, before they played in this movie. In summary, this movie was terrible for me. If you see it and thought it was great, take the time to go online and maybe Google "All Blacks". This is the New Zealand national team and those who made the haka famous. Believe me, they will make the Highlands boys look like schoolgirls.
