A group of adventurers travels to the Dark Continent to find a lost heir named Diana, who disappeared years ago in a plane crash, and who is believed to live with a wild tribe that she considers her goddess. <br /> <br /> Once again, my search for slippery, European cannibal movies has taken me deep into Jess Franco's territory - a seemingly endless, wild movie set that's overflowing with sub-par script writing, crawling imagery, and countless things Acting (Franco-director Lina Romay this time took the prize for her miserable performance as a sick, elderly woman). Here, in this hellish place, I finally stumbled upon Diamonds of Kilimanjaro, a vicious jungle-based exploiter so amazingly bad that I needed three consecutive nights to finish it off. <br /> <br /> Tawdry and relentlessly boring, even by Franco's standards, this tedious garbage fails on almost every level: The story is a dreadfully boring derivative of Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan, albeit with a feminine note; The film seems to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens, even though grainy footage is poorly integrated into the film to convince viewers that the action is actually taking place in Africa. and the death scenes are practically bloodless (Splatter can usually be counted on Franco, but despite initial appearances, this is not a cannibal film and it is not so bloody). <br /> <br /> Where the director manages, however, in his casting with the sexy young Katja Bienert as jungle jail bait Diana. She ran and jumped through the undergrowth in nothing but a slender loincloth, and her sweeping body was very impressive given that she was only sixteen at the time. Franco also casts some more nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions) and Aline Mess as a topless warlike wife Noba, giving her another 1/10 rating from me can hardly avoid (although I am sure he will get much more in the future? I still have many of his films to watch).
