This documentary is a comedy but never quite there for me. Warehouse? Ehn maybe. The more fitting word that everyone will agree upon - and can hardly avoid in any review - is kitsch. It dripped kitsch. It was as if the filmmakers feared their viewers would take the film too seriously, and they leaned backwards to add kitsch and say, "We're kidding! See?" <br /> <br / In short, I felt it was too hard. For example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (for me) annoying when I was sure they should be amusing - or at least (um) kit eyes. <br /> <br /> However, avoid this movie due to my discomfort. Just be prepared to enjoy kitsch instead of rushing ahead of you. If you are interested in light-hearted food, you can be far worse. At least the facts about the rise and fall of the bakers make this interesting and worth seeing. The best way to scream and scream like-minded Kitschliebhaber throughout the film on selected pieces.
