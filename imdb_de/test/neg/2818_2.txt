Could have been better. In fact, perhaps so much that the filmmaker, if he had not tried as hard as he would have been, would have been better. <br /> <br /> A good hint. The lighting was reasonably okay. But everything was missing. Shaky camera work. (Yeah, yes, I know that's the style now.) Badly recorded audio. And the editing looked like someone had seen too many Ulli Lommel films (these are some of the worst-edited films.) In conclusion, the film seemed to be a rationalization for the director / writer / lead actor to nude young women get them into fake bondage and tap them while saying "threatening" things.
