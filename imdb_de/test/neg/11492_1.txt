The movie is a disaster. I do not know who writes scripts for movies like this, but I would definitely like to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. Maybe scriptwriters really do not know about the situation in other countries of the present or the past? or they just do not care and write anything that they find interesting. <br /> <br /> A great and eternal formula with crazy dictator + a lonely hero (of course an American) may be a good idea, but come on ?! We had such a tyrant in Serbia (Milosevic) who did a lot of bad things to his people, but I just can not imagine him screaming with such a barbarous passion as in the Middle Ages. Maybe they wanted to show how bad he was, but it was a stupid idea. A much better impression would have been if he only made it cold-blooded, like the real monsters. <br /> <br /> The list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: no matter how many national television stations there are in Russia, Russian President Watch American SNN (CNN) News? OMFG! <br /> <br /> give me a break! <br /> <br /> burn this piece of trash please! <br /> <br /> WONDER!
