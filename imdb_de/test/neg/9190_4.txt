Essentially, this film attempts to portray the heroism of the firefighters by turning the entire film around an American father with a good heart, who puts others before himself. Now I know that they are trying to prove Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father who is a firefighter, but there is nothing interesting about him at all. So when the movie reaches its climax, there is little to no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a fireman exciting, but it's just as boring as any other job unless you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but everyone could have played his part, and like the rest of the movie, he's a boring character. What a good movie could have been is that the firefighters become heroes because they are firefighters and make the whole scenario an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
