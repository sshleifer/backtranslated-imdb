I stopped this movie after 48 minutes and change ... I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm not Swedish ... or French (the Cannes commentator) ... or any of these other sleepy places, The previous reviewers ... were born and raised in New York. lived a quarter of a century near san francisco. and now Holland. I love a good independent movie as well as the next movie lover ... but in a word that's not funny. see? THAT is funny ... that you think I made a mistake. I said, "in a word," but then said, "is not funny" ... no. no mistake. If this is your kind of humor, I would say that you did not really have much of a life ... consider your appreciation for this movie as a symptom ... and PLEASE NEVER write another review ... I have one Tendency to believe them if they are unanimous. even if it was only about 3 reviews before mine ... I thought maybe I could spare someone boredom ... the anticipation of a laugh that never manifests itself ... I smiled once or twice, though .. when I started the film ... and when I stopped it. that should be 10 lines.
