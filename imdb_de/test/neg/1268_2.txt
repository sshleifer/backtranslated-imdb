There are many so-called anti-war / anti-government forces. Political films now starting with a Mea Culpa and ending with "Our poor boys are going to hell, so let the world sympathize with them, that's not their fault" - something like that. I was half afraid that this would be another in this style, even if it dealt with a different topic / aspect of the same topic. I almost did not see it. I almost did not write this review. What did we get here? An Egyptian is taken to a secret offshore torture center on US orders, but it's another Egyptian who has to execute the torture, not an American: "Look, we Americans have clean hands," and the Egyptians are bad a lot anyway, So let them hurt themselves. Oh, and the Goody had to be an American with a conscience: in fact, many Americans have them, but here the concept was wrong. Yes, we all know it's an extraordinary rendition and it started in Clinton's time and it's now being used for reasons that are far beyond our control. Otherwise, it was very choppy and nervous to really condemn the US for being a party for torture. as if the creators were afraid to go all the way, for fear of being cheated out as unpatriotic or whatever (look at the message board!) who apologizes gets a face full of heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether you are guilty or not; In the 18th century, Frederick II, King of Prussia, dismissed it for convicted murderers - though I have to say, lifelong imprisonment for a child molester is far less than I would like to see. Okay, what about torture? This movie has not produced enough of its horror and hopelessness. If you are under torture (now the capitals come to stress, I do not scream), SAY IT EVEN IF IT IS NOT TRUE, IF YOU HAVE NOT MADE THAT YOU WANT IF YOU WANT IT, AT WHAT TIME they peddle, it stops. IT DOES NOT, BUT YOU NEVER LEARN AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT WHAT YOU SAY, YOU SAID THEM THAT YOU DO NOT. Another thing that the movie did not do enough was that TORTURE IS OUTSTANDING, INCREDIBLY UNBELIEVABLE, and that you feel comfortable with yourself. It somehow changes the people inside. How do I know all this? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: two things: The Arabic used in the film was not the Egyptian dialect. It's kind of worse than putting on a movie in New Zealand with locals as characters and American accents. The terrible little preacher, who called his ignorant audience to violence, also told them things that were unknown to this religion and that should have been brought out. It has not been stated anywhere that any Nincompoop can become a mullah / imam; he does not need special qualifications, and this is a break that needs to be corrected: many are acceptable on the basis of their fundamentalist views, and the United States' big ally, Saudi Arabia, is funding so many of them. Thank you for this place.
