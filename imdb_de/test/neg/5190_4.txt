The movie starts with his smartest joke and goes down from there (pun intended). After that there is a lot of potty humor and sexual situations. The beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Punish puns are not meant to be a joke, but they're trying. The fight between the two groups in the city (rich and poor) is an old and established setup. So how could things go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "rich," and there is no reason to pit the poor so that we can forget about the central conspiracy. The situational humor is purely for the toilet or sexuality and is aimed at adolescents, but only a giggle, not a real belly laugh. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the comedy of this movie is the character of humor with the blind some prepared but seldom used setups, and the owner of the black bar provided for the formal "street" or "hood "- humor. <br /> <br /> OK, forget the jokes, there must be some cool snowboarding, as this was a commercial venture. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of background music that could be inspiring. The rest were all tricks of the class "B" or worse. The big moment when the main character "riding the goat", a man killer ski slope, offered a chance where a small avalanche eats the stuntman. This was the best of boarding in this movie. Any serious snowboard fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. <br /> <br /> As far as the technical aspects of the film are concerned, the soundtrack was average, which is surprising as this documentation for snowboards is regularly filled with quality music pieces. There are many mistakes in editing, and although recorded on a ski mountain, most of the "landscape shots" did not give a sense of true size. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's POSSIBLE to watch if you've completely turned off your brain and like silicon breasts. Even then you do not remember anything two days later. <br /> <br /> Snowboarding is still waiting for the final comedy. Be sure to check out a snowboard documentation.
