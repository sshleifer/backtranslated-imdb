This movie is really strange. There are clearly certain * events * that identify the lead actor as the Dublin criminal known as The General, but almost everything else is simply wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of the old story, but about a complete distortion of irrefutable, documented facts. The question is why? The Garda is shown as Keystone Cops on the last day, his gang as non-threatening, and the man himself as ... well, Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction, why should one try to give a semblance of realism? After all, it's a bad exercise no matter how you look at it. Not worth a second.
