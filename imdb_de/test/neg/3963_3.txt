The movie could have been much better if the animal - in this case a small dog - is the best actor on the screen! The acting in this film is so bad, so amateur, that the dog was embarrassed to see it. He ("Rusty", our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the people here. <br /> <br /> This is almost a trivial story now: Child finds animal, pet is neither liked nor desired by one of the parents, but the "pet" rescues the children and is now a hero and an official member of Family. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember that this movie was a great success, but was never seen on VHS until the mid-90s. I was shocked how bad it was. Why so much excitement about a movie? Is that why it was because there was so much in the early 70's that a nice family movie appeared in the crowd? Possibly. There was not much healthy entertainment in the '70s, and many people are idiot for cute animal stories. Who could resist this cute little dog? Not me. But the movie I can resist is a level B story with terrible actors. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for pet lovers with small dogs and I mean "lovers", because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this movie during this time.
