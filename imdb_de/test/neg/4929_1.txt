"Shuttle" is / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour, it ended in the worst conceivable way imaginable. This movie has lost its history, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All next scenes are completely disproportionate. The driver is a kind of superman, because he survives every attack with a pistol knife and so on. Even after stabbing his leg, he could put it in the box. But what a coincidence that there was a box in this garage. When the movie came to an end, I really felt sick and misled. It could have been so great if the story were much better. In my opinion, even a child would make a better story. And why the girl is sent with water and food. I stopped counting the action holes in about halfway. And when the movie reached its almost admirably stark final vote, I had completely given up (better said "handover"). The worst thing about Shuttle is that it can not be any worse. Maybe writer / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and offer us a decent thriller next time. Think the better he changes to another genre. I keep my fingers crossed. From now on, I will read the commentary on his future films First, before looking, wasting time.
