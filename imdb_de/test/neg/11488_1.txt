I want to say something different about this movie. I have seen comments on how beautiful Russia is and the views from Russia have been great. Hey guys, that's not Russia, but Bulgaria is the capital Sofia. So that's not Russia, it's my country. About the film - well in Bulgaria, with the possible exception of the Gray Zone - all films of American directors in one word are terrible like this, of course. It is a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play in such cheap films. Most actors are Bulgarians, but in reality this film has no plot, it has no energy, what can I say? Hey guys, it's not Russia in reality, it's Bulgaria.
