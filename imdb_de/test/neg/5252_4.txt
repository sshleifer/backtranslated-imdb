The future of fantasy has never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert fights the evil demon Grendel in this grim, trashy fantasy epic. "Epic," I said? Um ... there's only one place, so it's not really an epic adventure, is it? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5-inch castle. How did you manage to stuff all the actors? Oh, I understand, they were special effects. A miniature Silly me. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons why you might or may not want to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert does his sword swinging tricks over and over again as he did in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and costumes are amazingly cool (if you're a 12 year old). <br /> <br /> - Rhona Mitra has a luscious knocker couple She likes to show it throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> - ... er, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start fighting, that's all over the top techno soundtrack. Why are these medieval hunters fighting while they should dance? <br /> <br /> - You have no electricity in this lock, but they have speakers that seem to work well. So where is the amplifier? I think they borrowed it from the techno DJ who provided the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Check out the final culmination featuring an incredible demonic CGI creature straight out of any Playstation 2 survival horror game. <br /> <br /> If all this interests you, take a look (at your own risk), but do not tell anyone I told you about. I strongly suspect that Pinhead visits the set during the filming because this movie has no soul. If you want to see the beautiful Rohna Mitra really show skin, then take a look at Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.
