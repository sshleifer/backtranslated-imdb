Andy Milligan, the independent filmmaker from New York, directs this little "treat" as his version of the Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney cuts the throat of customers in his hair salon and his colleague Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. I was grateful that I was well informed about the conspiracy before seeing this movie travesty. Milligan must indeed have the lead of the worst directors of all time for my money. Ed Wood looks different from Orson Welles. This movie is so bad in many ways. Let's take Milligan's direction for a start. The film quality is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look like Milligan uses a camcorder to shoot. The credits say "Photographed and directed by Andy Milligan". He wants to acknowledge the cover after a death? How about the cruel music selected for the movie? The film cuts with a bad transition after another. Little logic is used in creating the plot. The story has little to do with the legend of Todd. The murder scenes are plentiful but in no way terrifying. Hands, legs and other attachments are cut with the skill used to do the work: hack! And let's take the breast in the pie scene. Yes, it is in there. The pie maker did not know that a whole breast with nipple filled a whole pie crust? Later, we hear from our characters that they "did not get caught" for the over 200 murders they committed. Obviously, there are a few breasts that are unable to keep up to date (sorry, it was too tempting). The actors are not terribly bad, to be honest. Some even have talents and all seem to be real English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are enforced throughout. Milligan apparently has some issues with sex. Plot strands are not tied. The end is hard to beat due to insufficient camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like the movie? Not much to be honest. I have a high acceptance for movies of this kind in terms of low budgets and low talent, but this movie has no real purpose.
