I remember when I saw a kid on HBO watching a movie from that movie, and the scared shit ran out of me. When I found it, I saw it. I wish I had not done it. The movie was not scary. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around an old woman who runs the castle. She feeds this terribly disfigured person in the basement of a 12th-century castle. She beats the poor uninterruptedly every day and feeds him. Well, she dies that day. A few months later, a family moves in. A father, a mother and her blind daughter. The father was involved in a terrible car accident that killed his son and blinded the daughter. Later, the daughter hears sounds, shattering things, etc., and everyone is not worried about anything at all. Until some people turn up dead. Apparently, the creature has freed itself in the cellar and kills people. How this thing has survived the last months without food or water is impossible! Every time I saw the creature, it gave me goosebumps. The creature makes a bloody murder, and the police charge the father for death. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars out of 10 Scary, not scary!
