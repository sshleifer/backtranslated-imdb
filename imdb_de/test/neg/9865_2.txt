Yes! This movie was in every way bad in terms of cast, effects, boredom, excitement and, of course, fantastic. We all know that the four heroes in this movie were a bit more colorful than the new ones, but it still has to be. A fantastic hole like this was really just stupid rubbish, which I knew would not please anyone when I saw it. I mean, about three or four good films could have been made with this budget, but no. I'm just glad that the new version this year showed everyone how to make the fantastic four with a good story. A great cast like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses, otherwise she would have been completely forgotten, but luckily not. The new one was excellent when I saw it with my buddies in the cinema, but that old awesome hole has to go.
