I think that this program is a lot of garbage. All they do is fight and slap their faces, and they call acting ?! These people get a lot of money for it and most of them can not even act to save their lives. Also, the storylines are awful and after looking at them for a few minutes, I get bored. I like the way Harry Hill takes out Mickey on his television show TV Burp. the weak joke "The princess and the pea is not exactly Shakespeare, is it?" Sonia and Naomi had it in sutures. I do not see how funny that is. I think that's a waste of everyone's money on his TV license, so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. Is there nothing better than that?
