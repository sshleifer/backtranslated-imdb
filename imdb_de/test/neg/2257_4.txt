A very un-Tom and Jerry Short. Jerry tells this story about Tom, the cat who falls in love and loses her to his rival Butch. Tom is best friends with Jerry, which annoyed me a bit. The cartoon is also shown in Cinemascope. All in all, I found this cartoon of Tom and Jerry sad and depressing. That would have just put "Puss gets the boot" on the DVD and I would have been happy. This experimental animated short film sequence is on Disc 2 of the Warner Brother 2-DVD Spotlight Collection Set. It's the last on set and I hope Warner Brothers will release a second volume soon. <br /> <br /> My degree: C-
