Ah, another movie with motorcycles, the angels of hell and Steve A-Lame-o as not so cool motorists. This film is not based on a story, but drinking a lot, smoking and many idiotic acts. Steve's interpretation of a dying cat during his serenade "I love what I know" has left me vomiting for hours. Bicycle chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats has played best since he only grunts and makes noises. I also dare to try to figure out what Banjo says. "They mess up with private property." These are screenwriters. <br /> <br /> I liked the end. What would be the best place for a highlight as a lighthouse! You have to see this to detest it. <br /> <br /> THE JETS, THE !!!
