Well, this was my first IMAX experience, so I was pretty excited about it. In retrospect, however, I can not wish that this is another (less monochrome) film. <br /> <br /> Magnificent Desolation had the "Program for Schools" very much in the way it did to all astronauts and as a result it felt like reading the National Geographic Magazine in 3D. Strangely, it actually had a very two-dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality, and it felt like a lot of time, as if it were a PowerPoint presentation. There was a moment in the movie when an unnoticed abyss opens; It seems I have a bit of a WOW factor, but to be honest, maybe it had more to do with being an IMAX maiden. <br /> <br /> The comment I provided by Tom Hanks Very well found (what is a nice way to express it?) "flag waving nationalist", which was not as well received in central London as was heard by remarks when we left. <br /> <br /> All in all I loved the IMAX experience, but wished very much that there had been another movie that day. The moon is not a particularly colorful subject. To be honest, many 3D effects were lost in the monochrome scenery. Everything would have been fine, if not the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with American schoolchildren who would have spoiled it a bit
