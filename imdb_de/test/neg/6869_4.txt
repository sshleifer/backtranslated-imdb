Visitor is a tough, hard movie that you can enjoy. It's so slow and lead-free in tempo that I sometimes drifted off during the movie. This was around 11am on a hot, sunny day, not midnight on a cold winter night, so you get an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. <br /> <br /> Strange thing is, it is not long. At 100 minutes, it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to the video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf I'd liked to see the day before. It attracts a lot, enough to lose interest. <br /> <br /> If you do not confuse the S-L-O-O-W development with the atmosphere, the visitor is good enough to make it almost excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying to top off Radha Mitchell's boater, the ghosts / aliens / whatever are pretty scary and effective, especially when their suicidal mother shows up at night and starts moaning. Full score to not embellish makeup everywhere in the shop. The single person boat is a scary place, and sometimes the movie uses all the power of the place and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you. <br /> <br /> Still I find it hard to recommend Visitors I just felt like I had just watched a 4-hour movie, not a 100-minute movie, but I also felt Being cheated somehow and offering lots of explanations about the haunting areas (mind games? Real Ghosts? Space Aliens?) visitors definitely do not choose one. All watching Radha Mitchell talking to her cat and burning Dominic Purcell for no apparent reason because of some unexplained, terrible event in the past. Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he'll tell you what happened, no matter how crazy / stupid you think. If you do not watch a lot of these films, your fresh perspective is likely to make things a little better, but I thought that was slow, boring and highly differentiated. If you want to be stupid, there are much better places, if you want a clever thriller, there are many who are smarter.
