When I saw this in the cinema, I remembered focussing on the bad acting scene for a minute or two in the first scene, and then immediately said, "No, that must get better." It has not done The performances are fairly uniform in teak and pine and no, there is NO sexual chemistry in this film, just the awkward attitudes of a somewhat graceful, discreetly talentless actress born to grace the cover of "Interviú" , and not much else. If the scriptwriter decided to make Mérimée a character, it would be an amazingly original creative effort, should he come out more. And if Aranda had been more concerned about the matter, he would have realized that Carmen's story only broke out because of a thoughtful, iconoclastic, parodic deconstruction, not because of this legacy of replacement passion and comic book dialogue. This is contemporary Spanish cinema in its worst form. <br /> <br />
