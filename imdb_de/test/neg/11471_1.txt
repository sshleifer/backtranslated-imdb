Swoon focuses on the homosexual relationship between Leopold and Loeb - a facet of the case that has been largely ignored since its trial (unjustifiably), even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even in its handling of this swoon it does by far. Worse, it twists, combines and changes directly the details of the case, which will irritate anyone who knows much about it and at the same time confuse those who do not know it. While it's an interesting movie, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 - terrible.
