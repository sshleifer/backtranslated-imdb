I wish I knew what I should do with a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts - action sequences and personal dramas on land. It follows Ashton Kutsher through the Survival Swimmer School, led by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska, where some spectacular rescues take place, with the latter leading to death. I have to say that the scenes on the beach seemed so stereotypical to me in many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. A typical bar room fight between Navy boys and Coast Guardsmen ("Puddle pirates"). The experienced old-timer Costner, who, as an old bartender says, tells him, "is married to the Coast Guard". The elder chief who "keeps trying to prove he is still nineteen". The neglected ex-wife ashore, to the Kostner makes a farewell visit. The trainers' seemingly sadistic demands on the swimmers, all in search of a higher goal. The gifted young man hobbled through a troubled past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we have seen everything before. If this is Kevin Costner, it is Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro. And the climate scene contains elements that shamelessly come from "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm". None of this is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations is treated with originality. <br /> <br /> It works best as a kind of documentary, what happens in the swimmer's school and what could happen after that. It's a bit weak, too, because we do not get much lessons. It is mainly personal conflict, romance and tension when washing out. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the US Coast Guard is a noble outfit whose official mission is "the safety of life and property at sea." In times of war it is handed over to the naval department and serves in combat roles. During the Second World War, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in their ranks. <br /> <br /> But we do not learn much about that either. We do not really learn much about anything. The film is a series of visual representations and not too much else. A disappointment.
