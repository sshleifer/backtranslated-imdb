All we have left is a lot of reality TV shows with people who fool themselves for some reason, be it too fat or can not sing or cook, which is a damned value, as I know Hollywood emanating the original ideas. I can not remember any time when something original or intelligent appeared on television in the last 15 years. What's our obsession with how fools make a fool of themselves? I would have thought that this kind of program would have closed the circle, but every year they have something new, stranger than the previous one. OK, so people have to lose weight in this case ... most Americans need to lose weight. I just believe that we all enjoy to a certain degree the humiliation of people. Maybe we feel better when we see someone who looks like an idiot. I do not know, but I only wish something intelligent would come out that did not offend your intelligence.
