But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock headlining. This is false advertising - it can be seen on the screen for almost 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this film - the dialogue was dreadful, the editing seemed to have been completed By someone who focused on Quaaludes, the director was ... well, we say just that my 14-year-old daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such a faint praise from me. It is possible that the family cat could have done better. <br /> Sandra makes a good movie for a first movie, in the short time she's on the screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this movie. Stupid story, poorly written and transmitted as a film class of the 7th grade in the film. This should be able. <br /> <br /> In short, that's filth.
