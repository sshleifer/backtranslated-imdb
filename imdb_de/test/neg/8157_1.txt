Although I'm a fan of Heather Thomas and have some of her old bikini posters around here, I can honestly say that if the only movie I've ever seen was "Cyclone," I could never understand Why she had made it as far as she had in show business. Directed by Fred Olen Ray (about as much as an omen circling like a buzzard in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) Who needs to protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as " B "movie as he gets (or in Fred Olen's case" B-minus "). <br/> <br/> The cast itself should tell you something. Not every movie combines Thomas with actors like Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you are lucky, only a few films do. And although they seem to be having fun, should not some of the fun be passed on to the audience? I agree, apparently they voted no. <br /> <br /> If you ever want Heather to deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the "F" word and connect to the battery cables. I probably looked for this. I myself am satisfied with old "Fall Guy" reunions. <br /> <br /> A star given in the hope that when another "cyclone" enters the city, Heather seeks protection. I know that I will.
