First and foremost, the whole idea of ​​reshaping a classic like Psycho is nothing short of ridiculous. A lot of time and effort was wasted here. I am sure that they are smart enough to know that they could not improve the original. You must have put a tribute in Alfred Hitchcock's head. The idea, which began as a well-intentioned homage, however, causes the horror master a slap in the face. This film is badly produced, badly played and unnecessary The original classic is still good after 40 years. The event of Hitch returning from the grave and following the person responsible for the garbage is unlikely, but if I were her, I would sleep with him, keeping an eye open just in case. Do not waste time.
