It was badly shot. Looks like a hurry job, last-minute casting is obvious. Writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not for the movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not had good roles lately. This role was not for him. Maybe glad it was picked up yet. The film is supposed to stay on the festival circuit.
