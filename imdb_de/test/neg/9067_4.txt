Is there anything else on Earth that is more tempting than experiencing what awaits our weak body after death? The Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a soul mate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) gives a brief answer to our curiosity and invites us on an exciting journey into the world of prep tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human guts and confused minds. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I do not know which facets of the film - aside from its notorious reputation - may have given it a sufficiently high rating. <br /> <br /> Storywise is pretty simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or perhaps an assistant pathologist or whoever he is) who is sick and tired of his routine solves his psychological tension in a non-traditional way, right at his workplace. I am amazed at what specific message the authors attempted to deliver with this one-note presentation. I suppose it's somehow inspired by Udo Kier's character in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It's hard to judge the performance of the actors who do not press a single word. Her emotions are hidden behind the medical masks. There is not enough room for great camera work either - basically the whole action unfolds within four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity - effects and make-up are impressive and the setup seems very plausible, but only a handful of medical / forensic experts can judge how truly and anatomically correct the dissection is performed (if anyone is interested). Honestly, I always thought that the autopsy would be done to examine the condition of certain organs and determine the cause of death. Now I know that corpses are being severed, raped and humiliated, the gut is torn apart, the brain is taken off its head, stuffed into the abdomen and mixed with guts. Then the body is sewn together again and washed - nothing personal. And what should these poor boys write about in their fraudulent autopsy reports? <br /> <br /> Shock and disgust - it is very unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would realize to his horror that the CD he intended was destined to be seen alongside his wife and children next to a Christmas tree It turns out to be a graphic video manual for vivisection. This obscure object is rarely available, is sought by people who are well-versed in the subject and are not easily offended. Therefore, it would be pointless to warn someone to sabotage this movie. They know exactly what they see and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is a genuinely gifted and stylish director, as evidenced by at least two other parts of his "trilogy" - previously "The Awakening, an amazing black and white short film and a 30-minute Genesis, a visually stunning and moody piece with an unusual and interesting concept, and I'm pretty sure that someday he'll conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new, more mainstream-oriented material, sooner or later "Aftermath" would become the meticulous collector of his " However, in the meantime, I am afraid that this can be strictly recommended for medical students or specialists who are investigating mental disorders and sexual abnormalities.
