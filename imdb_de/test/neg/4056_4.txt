There's nothing wrong with softcore, but this one is pretty clinical - lots of nudity, but everything is wrong (of course it's always wrong - it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it is all coincidental nudity and bad behavior of "lust" and sex with each other. <br /> <br /> Part of it is of course your personal preference. These women obviously have some body problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicone - not to mention that they look too plastic and leathery. If that's your thing - great, you can see it all here. I do not think anyone's expectations are very high when you look at a movie title like this, but for a lot of people that would be pretty much like cyborg fembots. .. they look almost real, but it's really scary.
