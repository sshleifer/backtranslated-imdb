I found the movie in my local video library and was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard of the explicit sex scenes, the cruel violence and the notorious debauchery. I sat and looked and started to laugh! The decorations and the art direction were cheap and unreal. The nakedness was sardonic and unbelievably unsexy; The story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his peacefully beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can not be taken seriously ... it's not even shocking or disgusting! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were apparently held hostage during the filming of this film, luckily they died in the first thirty minutes of the film. The cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! The book Markus not less. If you seek appreciation, this movie will disappoint you. If you're looking for a cult cult site, you'll be even more disappointed. I know I was. I have seen shocking and these are two hours in your life that you will never have again.
