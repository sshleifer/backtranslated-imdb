Rozema's adaptation of Mansfield Park in 1999 is far superior to this seemingly more faithful film. The 1999 film is abused by many Austen purists, but I admire the work Rozema has done to make Mansfield Park its own. It's not necessarily Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully shot and well traded by a superior cast. I do not see Austen purists being happier again with this 2007 release of ITV (and on Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The script is simply glued together and pumped together, the production values ​​are lackluster, and the performers (aside from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are largely to blame for the bad acting. I can not imagine a worst failure as Bill Piper as Fanny Price. Her eyes were completely wrong (bleached hair and dark brows) and her talent just did not fit into the material. Sir Thomas looked upset all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot, as were the actors portraying the Crawfords (when I think how superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I just shake my head). <br /> <br /> I have not seen the 1983 version, so I can not comment on that, but I would advise anyone who is curious to give the 1999 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and decide for yourself.
