I absolutely hated this movie! I was nine when I saw it. It's the only movie I ever went to the theater from. My mother, father and I all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. This movie has stolen about 45 minutes of my life. Everything about it was ridiculous. The whole premise was too distorted. At 9, I was always easy to talk to. This movie proved that I could not submit to anything and was still entertained.
