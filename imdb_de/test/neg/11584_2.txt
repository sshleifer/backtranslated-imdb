When moviegoers hear that two popular villains / characters are fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the fight will end. There is Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And more similar is Godzilla vs. (Insert name here). But the generic Komodo vs. Python is just a terrible title and an even worse condition. Obviously, the film is a D-List image, but, at least with a more convincing name, maybe something that can tempt the unsuspecting viewer to look at it. With a name like this you know what you are getting into. <br /> <br /> A group of military men / women, including a 20-year-old sexy scientist, is considered dead by the military, an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. As long as they make it from the island to the boat, they'll be fine, but ... no ... there's a giant python guarding the ocean and the road ahead. Let's hope all these guys manage to get away from the island, and that Python and Komodo are not trying in some kind of horrible special effect combat. Really, this movie is in almost every bad way. Acting is pretty bad, or maybe the special effects are so cheesy that acting is unbelievable because no one believes these people are in danger when creatures look like they were made on a computer in the early '90s. Still, this movie is actually pretty funny. The creatures look so chunky, and the actors really give everything as if they were in danger. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this movie is a steaming bunch of sh * squawk! * ... but I can not This PG-13 rated movie actually spits out. Every time a curse word comes, a Parrot sound is heard. Even words that can be said on network television. How cheap that they bleed words, and not less with a parrot. These parrot sounds finally came to my mind and I laughed at the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad, from the stupid beginning to the ridiculous ending of the Night of Living Dead, but it's also so funny in a way. As a horror movie, it fails miserably, as an action movie, it fails a little less, but still pretty bad, and as a comedy he shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out of ****. 95 min. PG-13 for some violence and Squawked cursing.
