This movie begins like a comedy. It almost looks as if the actors read off the playing cards, especially in the order of the airport. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe," a hunter who is rather twisted and confused. Smith always seems to play villains, as in "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "The Frisco Kid" (1979), to name just a few, though in this film the villainous role seems ridiculous. This is one of those movies in which pointless things only serve to fill the screen time, such as the girl-hunting sequence at the beginning and the long stupid motorcycle race. I give this movie 1/10. I would have liked to see this movie about "Mystery Science Theater", it would have been funny.
