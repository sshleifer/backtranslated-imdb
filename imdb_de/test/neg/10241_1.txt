If ever there was a movie that could be considered a missed opportunity, then this movie is Galaxina. What could be wrong with starting a sci-fi movie about a sexy statuesque female android? Surely such a movie could never be a complete waste of time? Well, unfortunately this movie is pretty useless. There are a number of mistakes in this production, but there are two fundamental problems that completely destroy the entire operation. On the one hand, it is a comedy without funny parts or at least a film in which the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly uncomplicated way. Second, the title character is painfully not used. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but if so, that was a terrible decision because she's still the best thing about the movie. I do not think she really had to be a great Thespian to play the role of a sexy Android, to be honest. By the way, what remains is a lot of insane comedy help, often made up of the hopeless balancing gimmicks of the great science fiction hits of the time such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It's badly written and not funny at all, and it does not even have a plan to push things forward. Essentially, the story is about a police space cruiser being sent to get a stone. That's it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-quality movie is a movie whose plot line can be described in one sentence. What he did not define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than one sentence - meaningless, perhaps? <br /> <br /> This seemed like a sure winner, but he failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to fool Star Wars and combine it with adult situations. All it actually achieves is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it was not nearly what it should have been. A Barbarella for the 80s is not. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this movie was finished, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in horrible and cruel ways. That's why Galaxina has gained a considerable part of her cult interest. I'm just sorry that Dorothy did not have a better movie to immortalize.
