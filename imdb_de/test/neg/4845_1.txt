I wish I had read more reviews and opinions about this movie before I rented it. Waste of money. Waste of time. Very little dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in every way. The plot and action were both weak. The only thing that was really nice was the cinematography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time, you will spend so much time figuring things out with the missing dialogue, so you can rewind the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie. It was a mess and you will feel like a mess. <br /> <br /> You'll say, what the hell was that when the movie ends?
