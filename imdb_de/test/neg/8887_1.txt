The Chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysterious creature that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in Latin America and Mexico for years. You've crossed the border into southern Texas, and a sweet, intrepid crypto-zoologist (no, I did not think up that word) goes to an isolated ranch to find one. Her uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature and grainy video material of the <br /> monster exists. She takes a black guy with a gun and two <br /> <br /> cameramen (for easy-to-edit coverage), and they search for Chupacabras. After ten minutes you will find the movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film lets the team of documentary films be attacked by the bloodthirsty monster and stilted with a dialogue. At one point, the team meets some hot witches who lead them <br /> <br /> to the Chupacabra's nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew how cheap Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informants. Whole <br /> <br /> decades of mythical animal reports could be clarified with a <br /> <br /> blank check. <br /> <br /> In the end after the bloody death of characters No <br /> <br /> goat dab, a chupacabra is captured, killed and <br /> <br /> autopsied. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the make-up department's efforts in such a cheap movie. The film is still recorded on video like "BWP" The cameraman characters never load their tapes or recharge their camera batteries. The leading actress here is terrible. The beauty of the <br /> <br /> average "BWP" was the use of improvisations during production. <br /> <br /> Here all lines are written and delivered as a bad result. > <br /> Christmas parade. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is also characterized by racism. The only African American here is a loud gunmother. At one point, as the crew breaks into an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who funnyly ask them if they come from the INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit and nothing else. For <br /> <br /> such a clumsy and awkward beast, he is able to quietly <br /> <br /> creep up the cast, whether they've locked himself idiot <br /> <br /> in a huge cage as bait, or does not seem to start their <br /> single vehicle. <br /> <br /> The Gore is cruel, but when he is surrounded by this kind of <br /> <br /> stupidity it loses all its effectiveness. I do not know if this movie was shot before or after "BWP", but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie ever made in South Texas about a mythical animal. Pray <br /> <br /> there are no sequels, I will launch a letter campaign to <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> This is (R) for strong physical performance violence, violent violence, strong gore and obscenity. <br /> <br />
