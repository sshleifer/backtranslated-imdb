The one-line summary is actually the punchline of a very old joke that starts "What is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> Although this movie had interesting moments, it moved much too slowly and did not do enough to explain exactly what's going on for those of us who are unfamiliar with orthodox Jewish custom was and why? How many of the people who met this movie would know that the bathtub washing female characters is actually called "Mikveh," a ritual bath used to cleanse mental impurity? The same question could be asked as to why the bride had dizzyly walked around the groom while her face was covered just before the marriage vows. These two examples are just two of a large number of such moments that remained completely inexplicable to the uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This film has its touching moments, together with the expression of great love and emotions. The characters are presented in a very authentic way, including the number of garments an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man must wear, as well as the religious rituals he must perform after waking in the morning to start his day. The attitude of Orthodox Judaism towards women in general and their wives in particular is both fascinating and sometimes crazy. This is another reason why further explanations are needed if this story is to be understood in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to people who are familiar with Orthodox Jewish traditions and rituals, as well as those interested. A brief glimpse into the lives of the people who practice this way of life. The story of two sisters who rebel against the "system" in their own way is of moderate interest.
