NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic for "Ten Commandments" and "The Greatest Story Ever", and instead they opted for a half-hearted cartoon that was more "Waterworld" than anything else. I can not remember a biblical passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the Ark. Nor can I remember one in which Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, and I can not remember that Noah was some crazy old idiot who suddenly looks like he's commanding a naval fleet Run around yelling nautical terms like "hoist the mainstay!" This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, the majority of people who saw this would be Jewish and Christian parents with their children. Why on earth should the film be so offensive to these people? If they deliberately tried to insult you, why not advertise them and at least turn to the right audience? I hope they eventually make a REAL Noah movie, one that is made serious and thoughtful, that appeals to people and earns money. Do not waste your time with this garbage.
