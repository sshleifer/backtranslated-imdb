"Cover Girl" is a dull WWII musical with absolutely nothing to remember, apart from his signature song "Long Ago and Far Away". This movie was released before Gene Kelly really took his artistic step, and although there are signs of his burgeoning talent here, he usually plays with Rita Hayworth. And there is the problem. Rita Hayworth is great, no doubt about that. But she's just not a compelling screen presence. I always wanted to like her more than I actually did, and this movie is no exception. She's just not a very good actress and she's not even a very good dancer. Looks good as she is, there's something vapid about her, and the movie suffers. <br /> <br /> degrees: C-
