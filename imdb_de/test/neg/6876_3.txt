Yes, the title line actually appears in this movie. Why? I'm not sure. When the line was actually said, did not somebody in the crew laugh at some point? I would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie, mainly because I think they are more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Filmed by director Jim Gillespie ("I know what you did last summer", ") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to think we have never seen a teen slasher movie, of course you can not blame it all on.There are also three authors based on a video game that is still in production The title of this game is "Backwater", but in search of information about it I found absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And so we start with the movie ... I want to say, before I continue I did not expect to win an Oscar, if I'm in the right setting, I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time, and I think there's a chance for an effective, original and intelligent Slasher movie. "Venom "is not that this movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development. It's good. They do not expect much. Instead of a well-staffed cast of a few, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie cliché characters. <br /> <br /> 1. The last girl: She just broke up for her boyfriend. This means that they will eventually decide in the film when they are in danger of coming back together. Which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last survivor of the movie. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I would like to add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Friend: He's just around to co-exist with The Final Girl until his death. Sure, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Normally, horror movies feel only one of them, but here we have two. They steal, they steal, they could show their breasts (not in this case) or they could be alcoholics. A staple of the genre. They also walk in dimly lit areas that are all lonely and usually say things like, "Hello, is there anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", appropriately named, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Sure, he looks pretty, but he's the idiot in the movie, which was just inserted as an idiot. He says stupid things, does stupid things, has obviously never seen a horror movie and is one of the pleasing killings that you see something like. "Sean" is by D.J. played. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The Girlfriend: She loves the donkey, although pretty much no one else is doing anything, and she is usually the one who is still alive, so she can scream and cry until she stumbles and remains. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The creepy caretaker: In this case, the creepy gas station overseer. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get the picture. The other characters are not as common as they are equally killing. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky"), who was definitely robbed in terms of screen time, and "The One Who Know What Going On". Of course, that does not matter, because first everyone thinks that someone is crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a few other characters, namely a proxy played by Method Man, but he and others are killed fairly quickly and get even less character development than the following clichés. <br /> <br /> So you probably think, "Why does this movie require such a deep analysis? It's just a summer horror movie to scream out loud!" Does she deliver the goods based on this question? Yes and no. Acting is not very convincing, even when it comes to talent. Bijou Phillips was welcomed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully, and Agnes Bruckner has been an up and coming talent for some time. There are some thats really true. Many of the juiciest pieces are bells and whistles. A scene where someone's face and a sandblaster were used to remove paints from cars. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting scenes for the filmmaker. I liked the piece where a part of a house was literally demolished so that the unstoppable villain could get to the figures The same stupid mistakes that literally made hundreds of horror movie characters in front of them might have led to a more enjoyable experience. All the most interesting characters will be killed in the first third of the movie and then it will be a not very interesting countdown until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I think I need to be a bit jaded, but as a horror movie fan I wonder why I should have bothered to write a better script myself. I will not even mention the numerous cases of horrible CGI.
