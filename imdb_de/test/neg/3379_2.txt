This episode had potential. The basic requirement of a woman who lives next door in an empty apartment (but a telephone that rings constantly) is something interesting. And when she explores the sound, there is real tension and fear. But stupid script writing ruins every promise that the episode had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that drive most of us the other way (eg "It's funny that the door slammed shut, even though there's no wind ; "" This door has severe damage that was not there a minute ago; "" The door opened without me touching it; "etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena and the fact that a woman in the room committed suicide, would not she exercise some caution before entering? Maybe she could investigate during the day. Or maybe she could examine the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she could turn on the lights !!! While she is in the haunted house, she decides to make numerous calls to the central office, gets into a fight over who can disconnect the phone, and then begins to discuss the details of the suicide. Just unplug the phone! The telephone company does not have to be involved. Go to the phone and unplug the phone. Case closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was funny to show the phone scamper across the floor as if it were alive. If the director wanted the woman strangled by the calling card, he could have done it in a way that did not look like a caricature. Brave little toaster?
