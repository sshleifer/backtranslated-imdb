Sometimes Full Moon makes entertaining movies. This is not one of them. Full moon is like an unremarkable troma. Their films are not so violent or off the wall, but they are usually just as talentless. The acting in this film is not terrible, but the script is pretty bad, and overall it's pretty boring and it does not even contain nudity (like many Full Moon movies) to redeem it. Skip this one and rent "Head of the Family".
