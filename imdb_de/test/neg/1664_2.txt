Linda Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) enjoy a romantic tryst when their dad Charles Inslee is going for a walk; Angrily, he chases Mr. Solter out of the house. Unimpressed, he goes to her balcony and asks her to flee. Ms. Arvidson is satisfied and is packing. Then burglar George Gebhardt comes to rob the place. Although he does not have much loot in the way, stealing Gebhardt manages to use Arvidson's suitcase to escape the police. <br /> <br /> A contrived comedy. Note that Solter leaves the camera during the balcony scene, so that burglar Gebhardt can enter the house undetected. And Arvidson is very light on the road, as there seems to be nothing in her heavy suitcase. Maybe she just wanted to buff Beau Solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras. <br /> <br /> ** A Calamitous Elopement (08.08.08) D.W. Griffith - George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
