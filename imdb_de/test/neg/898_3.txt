I did not quite understand Barnens O? It's one of the weirdest things I've seen. The soundtrack was also quite unusual? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - the movie gets stranger than it was. I have to admit that I almost change it and look at another one instead. or confusing. There are some sexual cues in this movie? through them are somehow confused. Probably the only sentence I'll remember is, "If you're alone, can you control things"? and "I'll show you" - or something like that. The boy in this movie was obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up? "Last summer as a child," he once thought? and he certainly lived it. So if you have a few hours, can you watch this movie? but you will not miss much if you do not.
