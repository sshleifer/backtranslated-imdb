As parents of two girls (14 and 11), I have big doubts about this show and all shows aimed at tweens. Firstly, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hannah, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. make most of the houses seem small and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living spaces that are less than half the size of their home. Nobody leaves work at these exhibitions. When boarding and disembarking (and the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on televisions), crackling jokes (most of which involve lies and witty results) are cracked. I think that children who see them have unrealistic expectations of how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Second, there is never an intact family, always a mother or a father, but never both, who always go to sexless dates, but never have the disadvantage of divorce (support, support, arguments). Again, children may feel that if mom / dad divorces, the fun is fun (in fact, mom or dad are often not around if that helps the plot). It is needless to say that spirituality is not mentioned (forget specific religion). Finally there is a topic that bothers me. There are "nerds" who are good at school, "jocks" good at sports, "goody two shoes". The protagonists are not good at school, at sports or in charitable organizations, but wisely do about those who are. The message is not good in everything, just one of the "Nothings" that mix in cracking jokes. Needless to say, I give all those shows a zero and turn them off all the time and ban them in my house.
