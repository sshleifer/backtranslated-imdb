Oh yes, I have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. The drama in this four-hour feature film is uniquely bad, so bad that I can not believe it possible that one of the actors in that production could possibly make a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Everyone delivers their lines without having any involvement or an emotional investment with a different character. No one seems to have a real relationship with another, family or other relationship. The direction is also terrible and every action scene is ridiculous and unconvincing. Were the film editors asleep? <br /> <br /> The costumes look authentic for the Regency period, but the fabrics look like the twentieth century and the colors (especially the blue colors!) are staggering and I do not think they're in the early 19th. The century century fabric was available except perhaps in silk. <br /> <br /> Also the hair: The men have obvious haircuts of the 1970s and the women have "big hair" - especially the woman who plays Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All female characters, young and old, are pretty nice, but that does not make up for the lack of acting skills. The actress, who plays "Anne", looks like she is in her forties, while Anne Elliot should be 27 years old. I mean, where were the make-up and lighting teams if we believed the woman Anne played was believable? She spends much of her time looking thoughtfully at her eyes at the height of the horizon, whether inside or out. I still wonder what that should convey. Do you regret it? Yes, this production is regrettable! <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Louisa was really horrible. She screams, screams, chuckles and hops around like a sullen twelve-year-old (I apologize to anyone who's twelve years old when I read this), waiting for the moment when she'll kick herself out. How to assume this behavior in order to attract a grown man is unclear to me. Most would retreat when she first opened her mouth to giggle and scream. The actor portraying Captain Wentworth portrays someone so colorless and colorless, wondering why a woman could tie him for eight years. <Br /> <br /> The reunion of the couple at the end is not performed convincingly or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that's for sure. No, it has to be more and is not explained in the movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this production as two stars: one because it's Austen's work, and the other because some of the outdoor shots were lovely. The only reason I could see all the production is because I got flu and got it from the library. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, you will see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would also recommend this movie if you have not read the book.
