First, I should point out that I loved Winnie The Pooh as a child and really enjoyed The Tigger Movie, even though I'm in my 20s. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad that I felt ashamed of it. I was a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, I know this is a movie for kids and not for people like me, but these are my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage in this movie is the Heffalump itself, it must be the most annoying character I've ever seen in a children's movie (possibly even more annoying than the little kid in Monsters Inc). It has the most annoying voice and prides itself on singing stupid things and making even stupider comments. I know that Pooh movies are not exactly a high brow, but this was offensive even to the intelligence of a 2-year-old - where was the story? There have been at least one point in history on previous Pooh excursions - yes, I see it was about taking people who are different from you into your heart - but it really ended, and I felt I had a five-minute walk Cartoon on Kids TV br /> <br /> I do not have kids of my own, but when I do, I intend to show them high-quality children's films like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story, and Finding Nemo (though for me these days too) childish I can see how they are of great interest to small children, not so in this horrible attempt at a movie Oh and one more thing - NOT ENOUGH Eeyore! He should have his own movie!
