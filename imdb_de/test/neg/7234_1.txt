Greetings, moviegoers! While watching Octopus II, I think about the inherent lameness of the genre Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror. Many moviegoers may blame the bad drama, nonsensical screenplay or poorly constructed plot as the cause for the OCD movie to go up in flames. These reasons may indeed be flickering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is the core of lameness. <br /> <br /> You see, the technology does not exist yet to get a realistic effect. Life-size OCDs and the CGI technology currently used by studios do not provide a way to blend seamlessly with real environments and characters. Even with a clever camera, one can only film the half-dark depths of the sea / half-dark forest / half-dark cave / half-dark corridor as often as possible before the sci-fi aficionado becomes completely bored with the genre (OCD subgenre, that is). <br /> <br /> What can you do, you ask? I would not suggest that the cheese dairy genre is going down, but another way must be explored. We can not really go back to the days of the "fade-to-black" cue that someone was killed. Or can we If we can not achieve the goal of realism, we must compensate it in other ways, such as actions, allusions, and ingenuity. <br /> <br /> It will be cured by ingenious and alternative methods of lameness, which is so common for the OCD subgenre.
