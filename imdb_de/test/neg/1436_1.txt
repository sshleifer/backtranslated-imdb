Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movies need torture to scare people. If so, then there is a sad future for horror movies. Dee Snyder tries to make you anxious and scared, this movie does just that, but not in a good way. Now there are some moments in the movie where there is a chance Snyder will save this movie from falling into a hole, but let's face it, this movie did not fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Synder does Do not try to free yourself from it. When you've finished watching this movie, you're sick, depressed, dirty, and crazy. I have the feeling that the intention of this film was. What is less than dirt?
