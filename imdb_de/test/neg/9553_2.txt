Boston Blackie movies have some strengths - mostly because the pace is fast and the hero is happily unimpressed even in the worst of circumstances. But the conspiracy is often cruel, and the relentless comic bits often kill the tempo (if the shift is unusually good) or are just inglorious and inappropriate asylum (Steve Cochran in a really bad performance), focusing on the beautiful Nina Foch (who introduces a nice, rather subtle acting job). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie has become murderous (he has at least some evidence), and tries incompetently to jail him while Blackie searches for the right killer. The plot has its potential, but every time a real suspense starts, we get a not-so-funny comedy routine. It does not seem like anyone in Columbia understood that in a movie about the persecution of a truly dangerous madman, cute little comedy scenes about hiding an uncomfortable body from the inspector disturb any willing suspension of unbelief. (Just conclude our clever hero is an idiot - deadly for a movie like this.) <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time. For a well-plotted episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
