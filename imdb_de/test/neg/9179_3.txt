Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top stars of the Blaxploitation. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three American top action stars. Imagine a movie with these two for the first time! Now imagine the THE WORST movie, which could possibly be filmed for the first time together with these two. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both beyond their best time, but that does not mean they did not have the makings - they just needed the help of good writing and directing. You do not have any here. Rothrock can throw a few kicks in the end, but this movie is so cruel that you probably will not be awake to see it. (*)
