I would have rated this movie a star if I did not laugh. Some of the dialogues were just so lame that they make you laugh !! How could anyone actually talk like that? Not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 like a pro, and Michael Pares' team of whimpers digged a ditch full of gasoline and blew up a huge boulder in time. Has anyone noticed the lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with the guy who said "Boss, the plane !!" to Michael Pare, just as the 747 comes into view. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the sweet girls and the even sweeter female hijackers. Not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death he had made as a joker !! Imagine that you could not be tied up just to be shot by a "crossbow". Hello. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died on the plane while everyone ate steak and ate rum !! Just to laugh, they should do a sequel to show us how they all sleep in the middle of a Category 3 hurricane on Neptune Atoll. Did I hear that Michael Pare called it "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific"? That would make an interesting movie !!
