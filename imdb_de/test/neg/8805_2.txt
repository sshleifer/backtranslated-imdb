Usually I'm a glutton for poor movies, but this thing stinks. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor, what makes this film important? No horror of which one could speak, and no acting of which one can speak. <br /> <br /> I was only able to make 45 minutes of this rat who dropped a movie, and that's seldom positive for me to say this drivel? The cover was okay, I'm pretty sure that the movie has an end, even though I did not make it. The rats were disorganized and constantly blew into their ranks, they had no intensity and seemed easy to go for their paychecks. The actors were worse.
