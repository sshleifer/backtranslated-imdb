"Thunderbolt" is probably the worst movie of Jackie Chan since "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know that nobody watches his films for their stories, but the plot of this film is unusually lame, even by its standards and during the Combat choreography IS up to its standards, the fight scenes (the whole two of them) are, as others have already mentioned, ruined by the frenetic, distracting camera work. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans should not bother with this offensively random, stunt-and-plugged trash. Anita Yuen's sweet and cheeky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues. For a good "serious Jackie" movie I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
