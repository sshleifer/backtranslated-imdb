I do not tend to complain, and my expectations were low at first, but how did that seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors and talent madness does not mean you should go out and make a movie. This would have to be the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, d. H. It should never have seen the light of day. Somehow, however, this trash found a distributor who helped him escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cabin. It's getting worse. Speaking of low budget, a torture scene consists of a man who is thrown a cup of coffee over him while he is tied to a chair. Obviously this is very painful because the big baby screams in pain ... maybe he ordered it! Acting is worse than out of wood (I could possibly watch a tree for 30 seconds before I get bored, if you can watch this trash for so long you're a better man than me!) And the fight scenes would be at home Kindergarten playground. Do not touch this film unless you are in pain (in which case you should try to pour lukewarm coffee over yourself). I would say that it is so bad that it is good, but that is really terrible.
