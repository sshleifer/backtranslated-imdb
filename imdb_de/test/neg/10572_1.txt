I was with some friends and one of my friends, Mom, that this would be a good way to start the spring break, but the movie got horrible. We all agree that it should not have been PG-13. Rather like R-material. Many sexual dialogues, curses and references to boys and girls (below the waist). Not worth the time or the money. Urge not to go or rent it when it comes out. If you end up, do not take smaller children with you. Not the kind of movie you can see with your family! If you're interested in the content, read the recommendations section of the Superhero movie page in IMDb. Most of the content that was supposed to be funny was extremely crude. Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
