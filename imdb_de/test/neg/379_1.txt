If you're ever in the mood for a really horrible movie, finding something that even compares to it is difficult. I've spent a lot of time watching a lot of horrible movies just because I enjoy it so much, and that's one of the worst. This movie was so bad that I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. That was not so bad, which is amazing because it went straight to the video. This is one of those films that is hard to understand how it was made at all. I mean, someone actually had to read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several designs) and said, "Yeah, that's it, here's some money." Actually, they probably just wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, and then went to what they had. Ack, terrible. So, if you're a fan of really bad movies, look at them. It's a true classic and the movie does not get much worse. And if so, please let me know.
