TDY is probably the worst piece of garbage ever included in the video selection. They take a scene from The Order with Jean Claude Van Damme and that annoys me because Van Damme is a personal favorite for the B-movie comedy. Segal has done some good work in the past, but he has dropped very low in my books and will probably never again draw a death penalty if he does not sit down and have a very good brainstorming session with himself , <br /> <br /> It also annoys me that he did not do as many of his own stunts as in previous films. If at the end of a movie you are ready to see a movie suitable for a trash can or woodcutter, then you are ransoming your death today.
