As a native of New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this film, from the gruesome dialect of N'Awlins to the highly creative "manipulation" of the geography of Crescent City, is terrible. This is one of the Big Hollywood movies that decide to stereotype New Orleans as follows: 1. A city full of idiots sounding in France. 2. A city full of people that sound like they're coming back from Blanche Dubois Summerhouse 3 A drunkard's city where carnival is every day 4. A city of deep secrets where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo (I admit we may be a drunkard town;) "The Big Easy" is one of the worst films about New Orleans, I would not recommend it to anyone.
