I blame The Comebacks for those who like Date Movie and Epic Movie. They've encouraged Fox Studio to produce desperate parody movies, and now we're facing what may be the laziest and most desperate of all. The comebacks hardly qualify as a parody. Heck, it hardly qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved in the mess, could have possibly been misled, as if they thought they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has done something really miserable here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can even call it that, revolves around a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). When I heard his name in the first seconds of the movie, I knew I was going to watch a long movie. Funny names are rarely funny and the less funny the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), has given him another chance to train a collapsed high school football team called The Comebacks. Not only does Lambeau have to lead the team to victory, but he also has to teach inspirational sports film clich√©s. He expects his children to have bad grades and problems with alcohol and ridicule them if they do not. If the team seems to have the chance to play in the big Championship Bowl game (did the 10-year-old write this script?), Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is the coach of the big rival. Teams is his team wants to play against It turned out that Freddie Lambeau had only encouraged to accept the coaching job because he wanted the comebacks to be lost. <br /> <br /> The comebacks are such a forced and pathetic movie that I almost could not believe what I was watching. Spoof films have recently become a game of spot the movie reference, and this tradition continues. It tries to squeeze as many references to other sports movies as possible, but either it does absolutely nothing to them, it is expected that we only show on the screen and laugh out of familiarity, or it tries to be funny and falls flat face. Films referenced include Field of Dreams, Bend It Like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Gridiron Gear, Invincible and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. But wait, was not Dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies? In other words, we are watching a parody of a parody of inspiring sports movies. If that makes sense to you, you're just the audience that this movie is looking for. Some of these films are referenced in the storyline, and some (like the Rocky movie) are simply thrown in for no reason because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many movies as possible. There are some who even feel the need to explain us in their dialogue, just in case we missed the obvious reference. You know a film is in trouble when it comes to writing its own jokes. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the screenplay of TV veterans and first screenwriters, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, does not work. They do not even know the first and most important rule of the parody - you just have to play it. The actors must pretend that they are not involved in the joke. The reason why the classic Zucker Brothers films such as Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are so lovingly remembered is that they have serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before he turned into a comedy ) and Robert Stack and then threw them into ridiculous situations. What made it funny was that they behaved as if they were not in a comedy and gave the crazy environment a stony face. These films would not have worked if they had played their roles extensively. The comebacks prove that, because all the actors are forced to play their roles as stupid as if they were making us laugh. David Koechner keeps punching his arms, bends his eyes and screams so loud that he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a dead comedy, and he just tries to pretend he's having a good time. Nor does the film understand the art of celebrity cameos (also an important factor in parody films). What kind of cameos do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. By the time the movie released a seemingly nonsensical lineup number on Journey's "Do not Stop Believing" for no reason at all, I was about to leave the theater door. I was the only person in my performance, and the idea that this film will turn into a completely empty house in a merciless way appealed to me. I overcooked the rest of the comebacks and was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox is not done yet to kill the spoof genre. They have a parody of 300, which will come out next year with the title "Meet the Spartans". I could say that it can not be much worse, but I have seen the trailer and I do not want to hope that he hopes.
