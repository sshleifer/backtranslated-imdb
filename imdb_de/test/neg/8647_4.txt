Fedoras' four LA cops driving around in a big black convertible look slightly absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the group's stupidest man, is responsible. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie amongst the crew members, and the director fails to relieve the articulation of Mannberg Nolte. Foprget interviews everyone. Nolte's character lights a cigarette, gets angry and beats the respondents to mush. His methods do not take him anywhere until at some point he moves from thrown residency to haunted residency with his mouth open and his brain closed. He shatters an FBI squad and throws two servicemen out of the plane, only with vague rage at headquarters and no punishment. At the end of the film he is just as boneless and muscular as at the beginning. How he's made a gorgeous whore fall in love with him is a mystery, as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal that his unemployed wife expresses. Two interesting shots in the picture: one atomic explosion, the other a gigantic crater, allegedly caused by a bomb. It's almost as broken and swollen as Nolte's face.
