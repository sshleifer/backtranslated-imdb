The short existence of The Sex Pistols and the emergence of this film after the controversial, groundbreaking punk band of English punk band took place both before my birth. However, I heard their only album in 2003, "Never Mind the B * &% @ # & s, Here's the Sex Pistols" when I was a teenager, and quickly became a big fan. I have "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle "Not seen until 2006, but I've seen it a few times this year and thought it was pretty good (certainly not great, but pretty good), though I could only remember pieces of it and did not see how everything was connected. When I saw it a third time, almost three years after the second, I did not care about it at all. I'm not even sure what I liked most (I can not remember it now). <br /> <br /> This film is a mockumentary in which Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells his video page of the band's history and its members; Guitarist Steve Jones, referred to here as "The Crook"; Drummer Paul Cook, referred to as "The Tea Maker"; Bassist Sid Vicious, referred to as "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) is referred to as "The Collaborator". McLaren claims he created the band (and even the punk rock genre) as a scam to earn money. He tells Helen Wellington-Lloyd (also Helen of Troy) much of the story in different places where they go together. It's basically a mix of McLaren conversations, Pistols songs, live band footage, fictional scenes (often stupid, weird), several animated films, etc., all grouped together in a movie to the Pistols Manager page to tell in a bizarre way! <br /> <br /> It's well proven that McLaren is a liar. I know that many have already pointed that out, including the band members themselves. He was NOT the band's driving force, he did not create them (he did not invent punk rock either, and The Sex Pistols were not even the first punk band although they were unique). It was the band members who made the band what it was. "The Filth and the Fury," a much more credible film about Julien Temple's band that made this film, is told from the point of view of the band members who disagree with McLaren's claims. However, the dishonesty of The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle is not my biggest problem. If it were indeed entertaining (which I used to think was a degree), I might overlook that, as I obviously did. On my third visit, it was quite boring, apart from Sex Pistols songs, some live footage and at least a slightly amusing animated sequence! I found the song "Who Killed Bambi" a bit amusing at the beginning, but it quickly became exhausting. <br /> <br /> Is this mockumentarium worth it for Sex Pistols fans? It would seem that a large number of fans would say that it's not about learning the true story of the short-lived but groundbreaking punk band of the '70s, just for entertainment. That was my opinion on "The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle". After the first time I saw it, I could not remember anything McLaren had said, and when I saw it the second time, I knew what the Pistols manager implied in this film, but he could barely remember it I heard him say! Of course, other aspects of the movie were impressive as well. After my third visit, I can definitely remember some of the things that McLaren says, but it still was not 100% clear. Like most of the film, I think his words are not so memorable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you're a Pistols fan, it would not hurt to try "Swindle," but for me it's usually just an incoherent, boring mess that tries to be funny, but fails.
