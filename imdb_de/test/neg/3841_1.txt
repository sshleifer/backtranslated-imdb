First of all, I'd like to say that I would not see this movie again if they were distributing popcorn in solid gold and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was awful. I can not really rate it honestly because there are no negative stars. The spectacle is absolutely terrible. This movie is a travesty based on the classic "The Dangerous Game". If you really want to torment yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least, J-Lo provides a better backdrop, Ben should reassure the ladies who look at it. I'm not upset about the $ 7 I paid to see the move, I would like to have the 90 minutes of my life back. Samuel L. Jackson, lane change
