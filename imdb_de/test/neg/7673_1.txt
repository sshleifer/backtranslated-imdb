The last continuation of the "Airport". This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in all the airport films) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a news person for the death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as president of the airlines; Charo in a terrible "weird" bit; John Davidson as newsreader (love that his hair stays in position even after the plane overturns!); poor Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who flies a heart to her dying son (stop rolling his eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinetist (what did I say about that I'm not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach (OK, you can laugh about that); Bibi Andresson as hooker and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Only pathetic. Full of stupid conspiracies and conversations that will make you rush - watch for Davidson, who "gets married" on the plane just before the end! The Concorde brings all these people to Russia. They are attacked with rockets, flee, land safely in France and take the next day away! Do not you think the flight was canceled or something? Most acting is terrible - McCambridge is a sight that is seen in a red horror wig and a terrible false accent. The only good show is by Kennedy and Delon (looks awesome), which offer a very responsive performance. Still, that's not enough to put you through this jerk. Too long and lousy special effects. This was a megabomb and kept Universal (gratefully) from doing more.
