I think that this film lacks so much substance that it's not even worth discussing. <br /> <br /> In the first case, the package is really disgusting. Especially the stereotype film and take pictures. Sure, Joe Dante's cinematic style was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers", I mean the inventive and visual story of a Spielberg prodigy (I really loved those movies), but in "Homecoming" it was a complete failure , Attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures are simply not like zombie invasions (dead, stinky, lazy beings trying to kill the living - for no logical reason just because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie flicks are typical of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to see in Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, a cruel exploitation of the "older brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and bad action. By the way, "Homecoming" is neither scary nor bloody - and even less entertaining. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Zombie movies in the decade of their birth - it was the late 60s / early 70s - were once revolutionary and provocative (especially through their atrocities) (explicit content) and subtle social critic. THE ORIGINAL Zombie was actually a midnight movie called "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). This was a low-budget film that dealt with so many controversial issues that it's hard to name them all: a visual style by Hitchcock / Raimi, the 1970s American lifestyle, political detachment, the imminent breakthrough of human rights Blacks and the emerging racism as a result of conservative Americans (remember the shooting of the black protagonist at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies To learn more about the most important ones, I recommend "Midnight Movies: From Margin to Mainstream". <br /> <br /> So avoid "Homecoming" and even Romero's "Land of." Dead".
