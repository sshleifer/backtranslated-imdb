I can only imagine how this film came about: <br /> <br /> "How else can we mess up our career?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's make a movie that was absolutely successful, and make it a sequel! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We get B-class actors who have half the broadcast and only want 10% of Carrey's original salary. We're going to save millions and make a huge profit, no matter that nobody wants to see a second episode without one of the original actors that made it popular! We as executives still honestly believe that a movie was popular because of its name and history, not the actors who made it! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's set a huge budget and find the cheapest actors we can find! "<br /> <br /> And that's the way to describe Son Of The Mask, just a simple B-Grade movie that tries to suck the life out of the original classic. <br /> <br /> However, if the film did not contain the words "mask" or anything with the mask, this would be a beautiful children's movie. "It's a huge mistake for all." This horrible drama will appeal to children. "It's a good-natured movie that really" like me! "just want to scream, but only the eight and younger will really enjoy it." Jamie Kennedy is the only one worth mentioning in this film: He's clearly trying to get the footage to work, the desperate father, but the script is so bad, the only thing that comes out is my drink after seeing that Mention as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to watch this movie when this movie is wasted , would have I really enjoyed seeing the character adopt the true mask. Instead, we end up having to confine ourselves to jokes and toilet humor. <br /> <br /> The plot is so much of the books that I do not want to mention it here. It's so obvious that even a Disney exec would be envious. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this DVD has been cleaned up in three months. Too bad for the studios that they once again smeared a decent movie with a horrible sequel. Did not they teach something stupid and stupid?
