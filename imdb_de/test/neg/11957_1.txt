This is an extremely horrible movie. And if you think you've seen another terrible movie, just like before, you probably did. You've probably seen Scarecrow 2 from 2003. Yes, as I said, Brian (the director) stole the movie idea. And not only did he steal it, he might have made it even worse. I'll bet the actors were even scared to tell people that they were actually in the movie. I must also mention that the director has tried to balance the cheese factory by showing as many tits as possible. The kissing scenes were put together like a porno movie. In fact, that's probably all the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie that will never work.
