Assault on Precinct 13 is the stupidest movie I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good condition to work with. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ......................................... .................... I know that this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo, but did the authors of this movie actually see Rio Bravo? In addition to the fact that Rio Bravo is a Western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) should prevent a murder-prone prisoner from being released from his brother and gang. Nobody wants to free someone in Assault on Precinct 13. They want EVERYONE dead. My first question would be, why not burn the whole place from the beginning? Why "attack" the place at all? I know the fictitious reversal of action was smart and shocking, but it made no sense and / or was properly presented. If the experienced cop was there from the beginning, then why this whole movie? If the veteran police officer suddenly made a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he even get it? As soon as he showed up at the door, he would have been shot and they would have their entry point. It's all just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> In what part of a city can a total war take place in a police station (complete with helicopters and huge explosions), but nobody notices? Once a fire burns, they must "go before the fire department shows up" ?????? How did you intend to cover up the chaos outside? Police expose bullets in the walls, bullet covers, footprints, equipment usage, and the fact that there would not be any bodies of "bishop-men"? How about these police snipers? How could they miss so much so often? I like the fact that when the two prisoners tried to run, the snipers were thwarted by two tiny snow hills. As if it was not possible to shoot a high-performance riff through a pile of snow. <br /> <br /> The setup was interesting, though it was ridiculous, but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill this particular character with a bullet in the head, for absolutely NO REASONS. I know that the creators of the film have been shocked, but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and anger of the audience. Do not you think that the reason why this thing is bombarded at the box office is the fact that word of mouth leads everyone to ask his friends and family to stay away from this? This particular scene must be a big part of that word-of-mouth (that and the fact that every breather is stupider than dirt). The conclusion is always stupid, as the villain takes a break to deliver an Austin powers accusation instead of killing the helpless humans he has finally captured. I know that several people mentioned the final scenes that take place in the woods of the city of Detroit ('giggle'), but why did Ethan's character even move into the forest? He does not even check if the SUV gets away with the secretary and his friend? They just cut him off as he slowly rubs his pistols around in the woods. GACK I could go on, but not. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at any cost.
