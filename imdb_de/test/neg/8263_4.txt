I agree with most critics. I was even more shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple. Why? because she - the director, producers? - had no compulsion whatsoever to present the various heterosexual couples in the most passionate hugs, including nudity and super-close-ups of French kissing and all sorts of naked dislocations in bed, completely unnecessary in their length and in history, when the moment came to To show the same experiences with the homosexual couple, they dare only to a painful hug, almost between scholar laughter, with two very nervous actors. In fact, the creators of this film found homosexuality as UNNATURAL, as one of the characters in a scene says. What a difference to the Spanish cinema !! I remember being in the projection of an Almodovar movie in an Italian cinema in Rome and completely surprised at how little reaction the Italian audience reacted to. They were afraid to have a reaction !! In Spain, people fell off their seats and laughed at the daring situations and the fabulous Almodovar joke and flair. Obviously, there are dark forces in his history in Italy that hinder the free manifestation of some normal and natural emotions. Pity. I must add that I was quite surprised that this comment was censored by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous if we are not allowed by the narrowness of others to express our opinion on certain things. Where is freedom of speech? I do not know if that censorship will endorse the changes I had to make in this comment, and I hope he does not get the same treatment from another narrow-minded judge. Pity again.
