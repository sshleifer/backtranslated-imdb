A klutzy young man returns to the West after being educated about Boston in the hospitality industry. He quickly learns that his friends in Spanish-colonized Old California are filling his late father's shoes - a romantic thief known for having kissed his female victims after he robbed them. The colorful but stupid M-G-M production has a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera, but it never stands out. That could have been fun, second string for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead role. The combination of rough comedy and musical interludes is hampered by the poor staging (Sinatra is photographed singing at a point in the mirror, but one does not focus on his performance, but notices how strangely the star appears reflected in this way!). Kathryn Grayson is the daughter of the governor, who falls in love with Frank, and her high-pitched soprano trill turns her singing scenes into self-parody. Apart from Robert Surtees' cinematography and decent art direction, this "bandit" remains kisses. * from ****
