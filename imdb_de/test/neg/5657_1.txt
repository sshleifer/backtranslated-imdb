First and foremost, I want to say that I'm a teenager, so this is all marketed for me, and I can say for sure that I can only program very badly and the fact that it is accepted by both sexes amazes me. It contains some of the worst comedy I have ever done with mediocre action. The supposed humor in the series is based on someone having a bad sarcasm, a bad sarcasm, bad lines and one, so you get a picture. I should also mention that I still look Spongebob, for which I know that I get a negative backlash, but that's quality programming with honestly funny moments, less so we forget something iCarly lacks. JOKE. The show is about a young girl, Carly, who is hosting a web show with her friends. I can say that it is undoubtedly a nicer version of the internet. That's fine, but the show is just ... well, not funny at all, as I said. If this is today's program for kids, parents will show them something that is really funny. Spongebob or Rocco's Modern Life would work. <br /> <br /> Compared to his brotherly show, Drake & Josh, it's terrible what was implied. Seriously, please look at something valuable. Even for a children's show it is bad.
