If you are a fan of Slap-Stick, who has terrible writing, terrible drama and stereotype cliche, this one is here for you. <br /> <br /> There is far too much for the reasons why this movie is shitty. In a nutshell, people traveling to New Mexico with an IQ of 100 went to a race for $ 200 million. And yes, they are all seemingly superheroes because they can do many things, such as: For example, you can jump on trains at a speed of more than 80 km / h, survive numerous car accidents, and endless cases of downright caricature Roadrunner and Coyote antics. > If you're a teenager or do not want to think for a movie, this one is here for you. No actor outside Lovitz is credible at all. Lovitz rescues the movie with the Hitler-Bit of a 1. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save the 2 hours of pain and $ 4)
