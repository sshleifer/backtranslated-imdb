The first movie I saw of these people was "Children of the Grave," and when I heard it was coming, I thought it would be good to look mainly because Waverly is a real place to say so he will be persecuted. This documentary / movie was WUNDER! There were too many false comments from producers, directors, cameramen ... they had to keep their faces away from this movie. It is said that Waverly was persecuted for a long time, but if anyone doubted watching this film, he will undoubtedly believe that any story about the place is as fake as this documentary. The paranormal evidence was terrible and almost nonexistent. I've heard better EPPs from students using tape recorders in the bathroom! They tried too hard to make things scary and in the end there was nothing scary. Not the stories, not the blurry to dark videos, not the pictures, not the tapes! Children of the Grave was also bad, but at least it had some substance and a bit of creep. The only reason I forget this with 3 is because the historical part of the show was very good and informative. To find out how the hospital came to be, how daily life ended there, and how it ended up, was the only thing worth doing in this 2-hour bitch.
