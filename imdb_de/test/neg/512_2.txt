I think vampire movies are (usually) evil. Although the movie itself is not that good, I still like it because it has vampires. But that stinks. It really gives vampire movies a bad name. <br /> <br /> First of all, the cheapness shows. Usually, I did not care so much about low-budget movies. One of my favorite films is El Mariachi, which only cost $ 7,000 - but I hate that. The actions are a lot of crap and fall back on a "stylish" wiggling camera that causes you a headache. <br /> <br /> There's not much else to do than to do that. I bought it for Â£ 1.50 as it was an ex-rent and I feel cheated on my money even for this low price.
