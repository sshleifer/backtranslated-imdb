I urge you to watch this movie and to deny the above statement. IF you can stop looking at her virtually flawless face. She fights a bit and shoots a bit, but not nearly as much as I had hoped. The film moves extremely slowly and has a low budget, although at least it was trying to find an excuse for the understaffed spaceship; Almost the entire crew is in "suspended animation", and the ship is on autopilot! And the heroine does not save any of them or bring something useful home with them. It seems that only the only part of their mission was to drag that evil lady into space, the rockets that blow up the ship in the end were not easier to reach. There are also some long but rather tame soft-core scenes and a few "alien" rip-off monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 of 4.
