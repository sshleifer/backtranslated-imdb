This was more of a love story than one about an angel coming to earth, though both angles of this story make a good contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> If I take this movie to heart, As someone who knows the Bible and believes, I would have canned it fairly quickly, but I do not think the general atmosphere was either mean or blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. I mean, John Travolta as a grubby angel? Smoke? Scratch his groin? Quote The Beatles? A "fighting angel" who knows nothing about the sky? An angel flirting with all women? Yes, that's absurd and certainly biblically wrong. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all this, but I do not know how many people, no matter what beliefs they have, could endure a boring movie that showed in the second half of the movie. It begins to pull when the romance between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell begins. Some of the dialogues during this romance are so stupid that they offend any discriminating viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another film directed by Nora Ephron. Man, I can not believe how many incredibly silly movies this woman either wrote or directed. At least it is consistent.
