How could they take such a beautifully animated gemstone as Don Bluth's All Dogs go to heaven and bastard it with a charming, cheesy, uninspired sequel. The haunting music and the adorable characters have disappeared and are now replaced by hard animations and an unimaginative storyline. <br /> <br /> Pros: Charlie Sheen sometimes enjoys Charlie, but he lacks the charming, harsh attitude that led him to the life of Burt Reynolds. I especially liked the songs "I'll always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here". <br /> <br /> The disadvantages: There seems to be no connection between the original and the original. In the beginning, Charlie is a friend of Carface, but wait a minute. Is not that the same character who was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I think that everything in heaven changes, but why is not Anne-Marie even mentioned? If Itchy makes it to the sky, would Flo and Killer fail? What about Annabelle, Whippet's voice? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a vinous, bitchy parrot. The new characters are not that great (except Sasha). And the animation is better than a general Saturday morning cartoon. The constant caricature of "humor" is flat and unsteady, and the "heart" just does not work when compared to the original, which had such a moving, inconspicuous touch that makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All Dogs go to Heaven is one of my favorite movies of all time. As Don Bluth allowed the continuation of this sequel, I do not lie. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM: Not all sequels go to heaven.
