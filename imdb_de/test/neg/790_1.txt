Well, this movie is the worst I've ever seen !! It's just a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie. I wasted my time looking at that cheap crap. I can not believe that anyone would cause such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. Nothing you can learn from this movie, it's just a sick, bad movie. I do not think they could make it worse. This movie has just earned its title as king of the lowest crap. Acting is a catastrophe, the meaning ... well, there is no point, just a painful pain and suffering, which the suffering child has brought in at the end of the film, and the killing of the woman, which in turn is a stupid blow to this one Movie was. Do yourself a favor, if you actually have self esteem, stay away from this awfulness !!!
