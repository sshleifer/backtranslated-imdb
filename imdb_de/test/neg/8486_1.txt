This film is a real shame, not only for the plot, the empty portrayal of the characters, but also for the lack of creativity of the director and the entire crew. This may be one of the worst movies ever, and it's hard to believe it's the continuation of one of the most famous movies of the '90s. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of The Mask. When I visited this movie, I expected a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with an acceptable plot, instead I saw a really bad copy of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons. The movie was not funny even for my 7-year-old sister, so I wonder: what was the New Line Cinema? Was it an attempt to repeat the success of the first film, or was it trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings ??? If they did, they were completely out of their thoughts.
