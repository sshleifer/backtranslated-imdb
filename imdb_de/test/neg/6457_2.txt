Talk about false advertising! What did that do in the comedy section of my video library? I think there may have been a ridiculous part of the movie. I can appreciate black comedy, but this only had blackness without comedy. The movie was generally disturbing and uncomfortable. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as a buddy and the rest of the cast was good too, but in general the movie falls apart because Guy (Whaley) sees no good reason to lose his mind so much. The end was also disappointing. What would be Buddy's motivation to leave Guy with what he did? That's not really ALL explained. Why should Buddy opt for such a plan? Would not it be like Buddy screwing Guy up by handing him over to the police? The end did not seem to make much sense to me no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> In general I did not like the movie despite the good acting. Spacey chews the scenery for most of the movie, but in the end he gives Buddy the necessary humanity. The story was just not as good as the cast.
