Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs, watermelons, humans, etc. This can be an admirable feature as ants carry the movie Phase IV. This is not because they want it, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a narrator who cryptically declares that a cosmic event has come on earth and that a scientist has worked at the university. This disorder has an impact on the ant populations. The film is divided into segments. The first part after the cosmic event is Phase I and so on until the end of the movie. This is Phase IV. What is Phase IV? Who knows? We can not see this part; It probably has something to do with the fact that one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl living in the area got together. The girl, who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is mad at the ants for killing her horse, but apart from a furious outburst, it goes blank ("unaware"?) To the Biodome / > <br /> These ants are pretty smart; or the scientists are pretty stupid. I will do an honor to the ants. Why? Anything that would normally ruin my picnics, then build reflective towers, blow up trucks and be easily poisoned, is my opinion, at least in this movie, to be the smarter species. Sterno. <br /> <br /> Sterno says pestle on this anthill. <br /> <br />
