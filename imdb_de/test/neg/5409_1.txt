If you'd like to get some glimpses into some attractive women, this movie may take one or two seconds to enjoy. If you like to see poorly designed and executed "action" scenes, there are many. If you are both blind and deaf, I advise you not to shoot this movie in your presence. It's certainly the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And it seems that some money was spent on it. Talk about throwing away money! As a publisher, I would hope that the "publisher" of this "film" will never again be allowed to edit a movie, a book, or even a sticky note. As a writer, I would hope that the author may never again be near a broken pen. You would think that I do not recommend watching this movie. Not so. Stick it on (so you can stop your pain if you have to) and find out how bad a movie can be.
