Meltdown begins with a scene in which scientists prepare to conduct an important test of a missile system designed to distract asteroids if they are on a collision course with Earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some concerns, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then the asteroid breaks apart and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with the earth. Fortunately, the huge rock jumps off the outer atmosphere of the earth and bounces off into space. Unfortunately, the impact is only enough to change Earth's orbit, and the planet starts to turn closer to the Sun. While all this is over their heads, the Los Angeles police Tom (Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are in a spin-off. They are supposed to collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they watch quickly turns into a shooting contest. After that, Tom needs a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter, who also happens to be his girlfriend Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). At a nearby hospital where Mick is being treated for a minor injury, Tom has a brief conversation with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), a nurse. He tells her that he is worried that her 17-year-old daughter Kimberly (Amanda Crew) is dating a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). After Tom explains that he has discovered that CJ is a criminal record, she worries herself a bit. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for everyone to worry. The temperature is increasing rapidly worldwide. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to know what's really going on. Nathan, who is her brother, calls her to say that maybe he has a chance to survive. Carly calls Tom; Of course, he immediately contacted Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short time the colorful group is on the way. However, before they can reach their ultimate goal, they must navigate their way through prey ribbons, deal with a catastrophic water shortage, and manage to travel at temperatures high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien looks good, and I really enjoyed him in Starship Troopers. That may be because he is good at action scenes. Maybe because he did not talk much in this movie. In Meltdown, unfortunately, he has just given enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to show his quite average acting skills. Amanda Crew is okay too, and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are both pretty good, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately on a par with Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a movie is the story and the script. While the story is alright here and actually has real potential, the script is just awful. The science part of science fiction is non-existent, starting with the asteroid displacing Earth from orbit and escalating with the notion that the "gravitational balance of the solar system" will "retract Earth" into its usual orbit over time. could. "When the temperature in LA reaches 120 degrees, cars explode. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's worse than the bad science? The poor continuity. Okay, really hot. Why do not people just wear the movie? Long-sleeved shirts, but also jackets, why do people go after bottled water instead of turning the taps on their homes? Why are the streets completely empty, but the highways full? And why are the highways full of explosions? It is almost superfluous Notice that the sets, costumes, and production values ​​were good, especially if I had to say that the edits were not made. <br /> <br /> So you're basically taking a pretty good story idea, combining it with mostly mediocre drama, terrible script, low-end special effects, totally irrational plot twists and bad edits, and what do you have? a movie that is even less than the sum of its unimportant Eutenden parts. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend Meltdown: Days of Destruction to anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: It is mentioned here that Congress eventually loosened the purse strings enough to fund the tests that begin the test. Film Roles While the tests here were completely irresponsible (an asteroid with targeting a nuclear weapon and not knowing the composition of the Great Rock is indeed far more than irresponsible and approaching the insane), the fact that such scenarios pose a very real threat to the planet. Unfortunately, we have not traced near any near-Earth asteroids that might one day be orbiting in orbit. and our ability to discover something on a collision course is limited at best. <br /> <br /> Once we find out we are being hit, we literally do not have a system to deal with it. There are no nuclear missiles that we can fire. The space shuttle is completely unable to go beyond Earth's orbit, and if that were the case, we could not start enough or start fast enough so it does not matter. I'm not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I think protecting the planet from destruction coming from space could be interpreted as a defense of the country, is not it? Family-friendliness: Meltdown: Days of Destruction is rated R as "a bit of violence". Honestly, I did not find the violence outside of a fairly typical T-rated video game. If your teens want to see Meltdown and you can not talk them out, the R rating should not stop you from showing them. However, it is not a good idea to let the younger children in the room with their older siblings. While the shootings are not too graphic in the main, some of the bodies are there.
