BOOOOOOOORRRRRNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. Keep falling asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe running around in a furry Speedo, definitely rent this movie. If not, please do not bother .... Was this in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age or the time of reason settled? What was the reason for the black nylon wig on the guy dressed as Genghis Khan? Was that really Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so much advanced technology and science, why did we have to wait another 1000 years for Leonardo? It is never clear where Ator comes from or whether he should be a superior being. You're wondering if everything was explained in the first movie, but after watching this movie, you know you never care.
