Was unhappy enough to see this on a trip by bus through Africa. It was by far the worst movie I have ever met. Deserves to be the worst number 1 ever ;-) No acting, no conspiracy, little talking. Lots of monkey grunts in this hopelessly unlikely movie. An ignorant self-satire - you'll either laugh or cry about it.
