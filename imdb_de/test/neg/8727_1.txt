This miniseries / movie was so horrible at times that I almost collapsed and shut it down. I'm a big fan of the novel, but this film suffers from a variety of problems. The costumes are bad and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are bubble. The deviations from the novel are poorly chosen, significant nuances are overlooked or rewritten. <br /> <br />
