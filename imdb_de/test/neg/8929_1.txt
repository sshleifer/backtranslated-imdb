It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal has really made a terrible movie after a terrible movie. Every time every movie gets worse, it's really unbelievable! I do not really know what to say about TYD, firstly it's a bit of a crap, history makes no sense at all, secondly it uses stunt men in all its fight scenes and last but not least, a lot of footage is taken from other films! It's amazing how this guy continues to find work, he's late for the set and leaves early, which is why his films are full of plots and stuntmen. Why are we still buying his films, why do we still hope he will make a great movie?
