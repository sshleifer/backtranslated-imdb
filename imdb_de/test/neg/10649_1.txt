The Joe Cooler Report - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> Performers: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: This follows a timeline of the Merchant bloodline line that began with Phillip L'Merchant, who created the door opening box to hell , Beginning with the 18th century to the present, when Pinhead Merchant meets for the first time and tries to cut through the bloodline How to finally send Pinhead to Hell? <br /> <br /> Opener: This is a movie that is so hated by the people who made it that the fictional director Alan Smithee is the recognized director. They only pull Smithee out of the woods if they really think they made a horrible movie, like classics like The Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I did not invent that. How I like it You read this, so I'm sure you want to know that. <br /> <br /> The Good: This movie is not as bad as you think. Oh, I will not gloss over it. This movie was filled with so much potential and was a disaster, but it has some positive aspects. Cool Cenobites this time for beginners, like the twins and the demon Angelique. Pinhead still plays a main role and still has good lines ("pain has a face, allow me to show you") and it's always entertaining. Gorehounds will love the movie because of its endless offerings. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, though you have to look hard to see it. The Chatterer Dog is great. <br /> <br /> The Bad: But for a story about hell against the cursed merchant's bloodline that could close the gate forever, it was really complicated and was held together with tape. Nothing was really explored to its full potential and there were some really stupid things involved. Pinhead kidnaps a child and considers it a ransom! Random deaths, just to show more blood (not always a bad thing, but not for the story). Pinhead is the worst here, he scolds and scolds and screams, even if he dies soon! For the very intelligent demon he used to be, he was at best reduced to a Bond villain. If Hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was put back into a cameo-like role, that's it. Bloodline ruined it for us all. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin tears, drilling, pecking hooks, beheadings and more treats. The Chatterer Dog stinks fantastic, but stinks of bad special effects during the chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This movie had the potential for something big, even for Hellbound greats. But that was all wasted. Who knows exactly what this crap matters, but Alan Smithee can only be accused. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: This movie is the worst of the Hellraiser series. Only for completeists. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
