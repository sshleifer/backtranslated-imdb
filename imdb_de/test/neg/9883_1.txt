There were only two redeeming features to this film; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture and the way they represented the transformation from a human form to a wolf form. Forget the storyline or action from the book - they are completely missing in this movie. The only thing that has been transferred from the book is actually the names of the main actors. Even then you will hardly recognize the characterizations. If the filmmakers made a good movie, even though I had nothing to do with the book, I would not have been so disappointed. Unfortunately not. The storyline and plot are typical of low budget horror films, the acting is wooden and the directorial work is banal. Oh yes, the way Loup Garou bows to her leader is pure Hoke. I assume that a nod of appreciation for the pet owners is due. The wolves were beautiful animals and well run in their roles.
