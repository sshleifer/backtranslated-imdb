One of the worst movies ever made ... If you can go through these movies without falling asleep, then you'll do well considering how hard you turn up the volume, you can not hear what the "actors" (?) are proverbs and if you can actually see what's going on out of the horrible movie (I mean hell, if you can not find anything that works better ... use a home theater camara ...) MAYBE CAN YOU KNOW WHAT?) /> <br /> It's beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks and watch video ... and beyond .. how can they People who do that, do not know how horrible it is ... good god ... (!) <br /> <br /> After what I just told you ... If you're waiting for that I give you a summary of this garbage film, there is nothing to say. .. a group of campers on motorcycles gets lost in the woods and some people terrorize them ... or something ... what's more of an action movie than a horror ... this "movie" (?) is of no interest .. If someone really likes this, I feel lewd for you .... <br /> <br /> Absolute Trash ... not even one of those cheap, funny stripes you need to look at. 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' and have a ball
