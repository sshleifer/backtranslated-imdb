If you record the films Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you have a pretty good idea of ​​what the movie is about. The only problem is that the movie either lacks the production values ​​and is mainly a cheap copy of the first two. Although the movie has a lot of action, it encourages the viewer to stop believing. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine weapon by holding it - missing everything, nor can you miss a group of people with an automatic weapon and the whole bunch. There is also a problem with the bad editing. When the school bus tips over, it's easy enough to see the gun that did the work. And the lady who drove through the truck is superfluous, as she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in careless action and violence, the movie is easy to see. Do not expect anything with Thunderdome or even with the somewhat cheap and crisp Steel Dawn.
