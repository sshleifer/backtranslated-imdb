As you can read, the only good commentary on this film is made by someone who actually looks at it in his church. Anyway, the movie had a good B-movie sci-fi beginning, everything was there to make a good entertaining, easy-to-see movie, then everything felt in this religious Jesus Will -Save Any Brain Wash mode. <br /> <br /> The story starts with 2 main characters, 2 reporters, but it quickly gives the Jesus freak who is about to save the soul of everyone with this coming attitude the first role. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this movie will be entertaining and brainwashing in about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Waste of time, waste of money ... AVOID IT
