What a great cast and what a pitiful attempt in a movie. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, incoherent ... absolutely ridiculous. One of the most talented / beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is here without a memorable line. Worse, she's probably halfway through the movie, but it's obvious she wears only a cheap black wig she's bought in a drag queen costume store. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment house where the lead actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is badly photographed. She looks like an overweight novice who has dug up too many all-you-can-eat student cafeteria buffets. I was so looking forward to this movie. I wanted it to be, but I think I'd rather watch Nastassja read the phone book with her own hair.
