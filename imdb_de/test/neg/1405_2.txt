============ BIG SPOILER ================================= ============== horrible movie without sympathetic characters. So many clichés and pointless scenes. It needs a good editor, but then maybe there is no movie left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother wanted to stop his brother from killing himself. The description was "moments of dark comedy." Maybe I missed them when I blinked. The terrible characters start with the funeral right away. The funeral visitors laugh and complain about the food during the funeral of a very young man who committed suicide? Then the father digs the only son left? Right at the funeral? How come that neighbor next door, whose husband cheated on her of Sigourney Weaver's character, is the villain because he told the man? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone around him seems to know that he is a great pianist. The film tries to put every dramatic cliché into a movie: father overwhelms an athletic son to success, a dysfunctional family loses a chosen son in the suicide, the son feels lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, a child through Affair, but incest incest, homosexual tendencies, bullying, possible deadly diseases etc etc etc are not wasting as son of the husband.
