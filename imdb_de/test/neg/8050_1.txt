"Son, you have to finish the experiments I started !!" Too bad that no one has said who lit this project green !! I was almost literally drawn to a movie by a friend of mine for a midnight show when we were in high school. Well, a midnight movie in high school on a Friday night, does not expect much, but come on !! And when I see it again years later, I stand by my original opinion. Great special effects but so what! Maybe one of the worst movies ever made. Unless you enjoy blood and guts and see how some Hollywood veterinarians (Steiger & Hunter) fool themselves for a living. YUCK !!!
