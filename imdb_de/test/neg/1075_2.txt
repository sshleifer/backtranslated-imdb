This movie was good at the box office and the producers of the mess said the stars had such good chemistry that they would play them in the much darker screwball farce The Gazebo. Honestly, I'm shocked to see all the positive comments on this ridiculously drawn, merry comedy. Both main characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. A veteran supporting the cast including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan, and Eva Gabor provides excellent support. And the beautiful cinematography makes the rich landscape of Spain lush. And there are four or five really funny scenes with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unpleasant jumble. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it.
