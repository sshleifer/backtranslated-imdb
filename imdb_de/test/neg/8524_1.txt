I'm sorry, but I can not agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked visually good, but it's the story that drives the movie, and I have to say that the story was great. Like anything else in the world, they managed to get past some of these plot gaps on the critics. Better story and I would have gotten a higher voice, but I was not able to do that and still could live with myself. I've always been a fan of scary movies and the thumbnails really made a fool of me. All scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why did the family that was killed haunt the house? Why did the father come back? Why did he decide to kill? Why were the children the only ones who first saw the spirits? Too many questions, not enough answers. If I could have given it a zero, I would have.
