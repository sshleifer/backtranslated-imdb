How sad it is when such a wonderful movie as "Jurassic Park" dips slowly into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. Jurassic Park III, the newest successor, has not been thinking about characters, a story, or any script, and instead focuses on non-stop dinosaur action that's neither exciting nor interesting. The dinosaurs seemed unbelievably fake compared to the technology of 1993. After 7 years of CGI progress, all you get is the feeling that the movie was pumped out for the summer just because of its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Take another look at "Shrek". <br /> <br />
