I guess the filmmaker is not to blame. The film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision of Clayton Moore (who played the role in the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger we grew up with old folks) to say he could not wear the mask in public. Well, mind you, the poor guy did not make that much money with it, and it was not like he was taking anything away from this movie, but the whole thing seemed ... unfounded. <br /> <The other thing the movie suffered from (except for a leading man whose voice was so horrible that they had to exaggerate it) was that Western 1981 was not so hip. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decades-long liberal debt trip about how the West was built by genocide against the Native Americans. (That and Blazing Saddles sent the whole genre up! The campfire scene, that's enough!) Hollywood shied away from Western, as science fiction was COOL drunk President Grant (and seriously, I'd have left Grant with the bad guys Land would have been better off!) Grant asks Tonto what his reward should be: "Honor your contracts with my people." Yes, right, as if that would happen!
