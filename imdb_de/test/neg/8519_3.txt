This movie is exclusively for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I get mad at TCM because he has shown this mess more often than Bachelor Mother, the adorable original. I get even more angry that some Hollywood boobs thought it would be a good idea to recreate Bachelor Mother and fill her with lame songs that only serve to break the flow of a cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood would have needed to spend the time, money, energy, and talent for this terrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother (the original) with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew that seethes with sexuality. It's a wink of the thirties at the Hays Office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is all milk and cookies. It's a 1950's handshake with Eisenhower. Which cast would you rather see - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, each member of the cast in the original version is far better than his counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original is a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers at its peak. David Niven is perfect as a spoiled, refined yet confused scion of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love seeing Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he is invaluable as a desperate grandpa wannabe. In Joy of Bundle Debbie Reynolds is her usual self-confident self. She's fine in that role, though her performance (along with Fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He completely lacks the screen "Presence". Here he is way too healthy for this story. His acting is completely bland and unaware. Likewise, his singing is so mild and unobtrusive that he has been forgotten by the world as a whole. The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 - where he does not sing, by the way. Here alone, Fisher's lame performance is enough to ruin this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a popular character actor, delivers a competent performance, but none of his best. He is bubbling as orders. He and Fisher do not convince as father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical for the music and the story is just a coincidence? Or are you watching a musical for a story that uses (hopefully) good music for seasoning? If the former likes, this lame remake may please. Otherwise, it's much better to see the non-musical original by Ginger Rogers, Bachelor Mother.
