I'm sorry, but this movie is just too flat for me. In it, Perez is a taxi dancer with friend Keitel, who tries to make it as an actress. First of all, what is a taxi dancer? Even after I've eaten it, I still do not know. Oh yes, Perez also inspired DeLorenzo to follow her like a lovesick puppy. There is no reason for love, it just happens somehow. There are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heart, but it rarely works. The only character you really feel for or with is Keitel's character, and that's just because he does so well with it. Every other actor and character would have been just like the others. <br /> <br /> The script is basically an uninspired reflection on how hard it is to make it as an actor / actor. It has already been made and said the language and the dialogue sound as if they were written by a street pennant. The end is ... well, I do not want to ruin it. Let's just say it feels unsatisfactory. I would be more annoyed if the story was good from the start. The director is on average without anything really wonderful, but also nothing that is really painful. To repeat the play, Keitel is the only one who does something valuable. I could have lived on without seeing him wearing tiger-print bikini underwear. Oh yes, Eddie Bunker appears. As arbitrary as this mention is, so coincidentally is it in the movie. And Tarantino does his director a favor by appearing for about 20 seconds.
