Jesus Christ, what the hell happened here? This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. How is it possible that you messed up such a nice idea for a movie? To be honest, I was so hopeless for that, I thought it was like Blair Witch, but with real alien creatures chasing the cameraman. Damn it, I've limited myself to spooling that bunch fast, and I never do that while watching movies. The high rating here on IMDb makes me believe that real aliens will give 10 for this bitch. <br /> <br /> The invasion is about an invasion. The movie starts with all you see being real, Blahblahblah. Then they tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if I had to believe their bullshit to enjoy this movie. Next, I see the most boring motoring ever filmed at night in a forest. Is this a movie or Disney theme park ride? The first 20 minutes are all boring dialogues between the cops, while you see grass and a straight street with a flashlight. Where the hell were the aliens ?! Of course you slept! Then we learn that bad drama is not just reduced to high school games when the policeman gets out of his car behind the camera to find a missing man who was "night fishing" and found a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him. Out of nowhere we see the "night fishing" that goes like a zombie. The cop is apparently too stupid to realize that something is wrong with this man. Apparently, he was actually stupid when the zombie / alien guy injected a kind of alien parasite into the policeman's ear and turned him into an alien. Then the policeman / alien goes back in his car, looks for a young couple who had sex in the woods some time ago, goes to them, turns the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the policeman's car and flees. If this short plot introduction was not put into the head that this movie was bad, the next 40 minutes will be the case. The reputation of this film is as painful as repeatedly stabbing yourself with a plastic fork. The script, though it may sound interesting on the back of the DVD box, is ill-judged and sad, we have another boring direct DVD attack. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me awake was constant flashing and loud sound effects (regrettable). If the same forest path does not last for 63 minutes, we'll have to endure flashing flashing techniques to "scare" the viewer and the constant lamentation of a nasty actress who is getting old and annoying. <br /> <br /> If you think I need you to hire this, I'll tell you why? There are better sci-fi / horror movies. Even the dreaded remake of the Body Snatchers invasion is more entertaining. For the love of all good things, do not bother about his crap. My eyes were bleeding and I wanted suicide for the first time. A 1/10, avoid this as a disease.
