Director Godfrey Reggio has to be a very charming and convincing man so that this terribly botched project has seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and understandable in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly confused. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughing heads etc mingle without purpose. The parade of banal images is mostly a generic stock of Getty Images and others, and the harsh digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst possible way. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, Executive Producer?) Would have pointed out that applying a solarization filter to almost any image was a very bad idea? The rough grinding, overlaying and warping of images is reminiscent of a freshman Photoshop class. Worse still, computer animation sequences are more unconventional than a 1980s Wall Street pie chart. This is not to say that improved aesthetics alone would have saved this film, but a few meager efforts in this direction could have made it bearable as a visual lining for the accompanying music. I feel compelled to point out that the score of Philip Glass will certainly satisfy his fans. Not a radical farewell, but an improvement on what Glass does best with beautiful Yo Yo Ma violin contributions. If you choose this movie, you should focus on the short opening sequence. Although you're already familiar with Detroit's once majestic but long-abandoned Michigan Central Railroad Station 89 minutes later, you'll remember that picture of 20th century decay, the critical point at which you should have gone to the EXIT mark , etc. They were warned.
