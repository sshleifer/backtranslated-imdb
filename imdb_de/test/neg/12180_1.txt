Charles Bronson has given the spectators many great moments on the screen. But this movie is missing everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really shitty. And if the action scenes fail, does the story save the movie? Not at all, my answer is. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very straightforward and boring, and although I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I do not know how they came to such a failure. A low budget maybe? Regardless, it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all. If that happens, the result is really bad.
