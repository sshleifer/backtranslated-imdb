A total and complete travesty of a movie. "Dark Power" is the kind of movie that would even embarrass Troma. The script, directing, acting and action sequences are so horrible that it's almost painful to watch and think that it's only 75 minutes of running time could have been better used. The above reviewer must be related to the director, as this is the only reason I can see for his / her assessment of this garbage. Some call it B-Movie fun or "so bad it's good" just to apologize for it, but if the lead actor (and the most experienced actor) can not convince his lines convincingly, you know you have one have a very, very bad movie. Avoid it at all costs.
