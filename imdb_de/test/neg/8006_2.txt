<br /> <br /> I was intrigued to read the opinions on 'Circus', 'awesome, stunning, brilliant' and most things between 'Golden Turkey'. I am in the last camp. <br /> <br /> The producers obviously believed that if they mixed plenty of violence with a surplus of four-letter attacks, they would have another "lock, stick and two" smoker barrels on their hands. Too bad they forgot humor, style, charm and flair. It was definitely a mistake to visit Welles' classic 'The Lady from Shanghai' to remind us how much better cinema can be. John Hannah takes off his shirt at every opportunity A giant American drives around in a mini-minor, while Circus strives pathetically for cult status, and even beautiful Amanda Donohoe can not add class to the process. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British movie Try out the sublime wonderland
