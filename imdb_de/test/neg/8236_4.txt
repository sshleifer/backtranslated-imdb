It is not necessarily a good thing to visit old films that you thought were average. They get worse sometimes. LUTHER THE GEEK was described by the Fangoria Camp (in Gorezone as "the scariest movie since Texas CHAINSAW"? Er, no) and inexplicably developed a cult episode as an "intense" horror image. Actually, it's just an average stalk and a chop, uh, bite-film, which stands out from the pack by identifying a killer screaming like a chicken. Yes, like a chicken. To the thanks of the filmmaker, the killer sounded at least not like a duck like the New York Ripper. That would be just stupid. <br /> <br /> The narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying that Slasher movies are reasonably prudent, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers fled. Luther has actually been released from a long scene in which people argue that he is reformed, even though he rattles like a chicken and has a razor (which he obviously designed in prison). It's the kind of movie where a couple in the door sees a blow, and the girl dismisses it with the words, "Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys, she forgets many things since my father died." The kind of film in which the hysterical mother meets a police officer who looks for Luther and tells him: "The murderer is in my house!" So what does he do? He grabs her and literally hauls her back to the house and says, "Just show me where he is and I'll do the rest." Why not call back? <br /> <br /> It's too bad that the movie is so awful because the Luther character is actually very interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a dead ringer for Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, who gives the chugging Luther a real threat. In the hands of a real director, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on a par with SONY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a real cinematic curiosity. But Albright is not the director and only puts the fascinating character of Luther into boring slasher traps.
