I have to admit, I chose this film only for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi, and Prochnow were great performers as usual, the rest of the movie was so disappointed. It feels like it has been put together by a team of teenagers with low-level scripts, ie scripts without depth, horrible photography and editing, and unbelievably funny results! I can not believe that I could see this seemingly long movie to the end. The sad thing is that in view of the interesting conspiracy, it could have been a great political thriller. All the potential was there to make a hit out of it; That said, there are two main ingredients: a great history of national conspiracies and a great cast (though many other actors are as good as soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it is still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.
