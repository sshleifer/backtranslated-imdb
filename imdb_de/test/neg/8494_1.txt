What is this film about? Well, if I did not know that "Son of the Mask" is classified as a comedy, I would never have a clue! A comedy? A tragedy, that's the right genre for this so-called sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, I saw "Dumb and Dumber". Yes, you see "Son of the Mask" and you think ... 5 minutes - stupid ... 10 minutes - stupid ... 15 - minutes stupid ... And then, after 16 minutes, there is only one thing left to say : / I'm out ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, my comedy candidate Crap of the Year 2005.
