First, only a few colleges can prove their parents' mistress to the students. Second, only a few female professors sleep with cooks in the dorm. Third, few students have a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourth, as soon as a SECOND member of a college small group project team experiences a violent death, the college PRESIDENT will dissolve the entire class and NOT turn a blind eye, as the professor cheerfully steers the rest of the group to cruel deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the profane content of this film to really appreciate how much this movie really is shit!
