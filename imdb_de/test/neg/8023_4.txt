"Guardian of the Frontier," a half-mystical thriller and half the broken fantasies of a fragile mind, is an enthralling journey that soon derails. Strong images and a convincing premise are soon overwhelmed by incoherent conspiracy, botched dialogues, amateurish drama and the most unusual and exaggerated phallic images of recent times (here a fish is definitely not a fish!) Obviously, this is the first Slovenian feature film by a woman Ms. Weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as rude and as explicit as any other man.
