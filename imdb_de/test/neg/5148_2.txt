***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I suppose you should not expect much from a movie made for TV, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea but done badly, the acting was not very good. And the end of the movie was just awful. The main character was completely normal throughout the movie, and when we found out she was the killer, she suddenly became a mentally handicapped psychopath. It is completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to really watch this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, although we have not all seen her in a bathing suit before? Do not bother looking at this waste of time when you're looking for a movie about the beauty pageant, then look at Drop Dead Gorgeous instead, it's just infinitely many times better.
