I was looking forward to this movie, unfortunately I should have heard the advice of my daughters. This should have been a parody, but it took on a realism for which the corporations had a lot to answer for. Jim Carrey, after all the work he has done, is still Jim Carrey and his comedy does not get any better, his co-star could not support him. Her son in the movie was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of the crime was a blink of an eye, and that was the missing link in the movie. The film showed two or three robberies and they were richer than before where it was lost to me. <br /> <br /> I have laughed in some parts, but by the end not good enough weight for the movie. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this movie a smart and tight film.
