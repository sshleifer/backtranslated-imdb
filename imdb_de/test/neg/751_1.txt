Can you give a 0 out of 10 points? Because he deserves it. Although I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I prevailed with two women. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad this movie is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with charisma in the whole thing, although he exaggerates it as he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But that was not enough to save that stinker from total devotion. It is often difficult to distinguish the girl's dream sequences from what "really" is, and there are still so many holes in the story that you can barely find out what's going on. Too many loose ends and the end feels like a "next voting start next week". The lead actress is too stupid and strange to be a heroine, the captain is too stupid and too feminine to be a persuasive hero, and the music sounds like some kind of cheap New Age pet project by director Hippy's daughter I my saxophone, mixed with some sort of transfiguring, female crying?). So I suggest that you break the budget and order a DVD as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.
