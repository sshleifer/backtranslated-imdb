This movie is a mediocre, cheap movie. I've seen much worse on MST3K, I can assure you, but this is still a pretty crappy movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clonus, a top-secret government agency that uses clones to send politicians to politicians. Actually, it's an almost Orwellian society: almost (but not quite) effective. <br /> <br /> The film begins to roll down when the head clone (Tim Connely of Emergency) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who starred in this and a maximum of four other films (and this was not her first After you find a beer can in the nearby river, the property begins to unravel, and the clone is not given by the chief scientist (Dick Sargent of "Bewitched") or the "confessional," a computer He allegedly knows everything, answers.He breaks into the Clonus main building and (in a scene that amuses Mike and the theater, destroying bots) finds out the truth (including a clone video showing the same method with the dolly was cloned five years ago ... and this movie was made over twenty years ago ...) about Clonus, who frees himself and is being followed by two guards, he has a damned time trying to secure the two meter high fences Although it is much harder for him to climb some boulders. From there it slips on. In addition, Peter Graves will appear as a presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once upon a time in the West") and Lurleen Tuttle ("Ma Barker's Killer Brood", "Psycho") as the older couple, the Clony his escape helps. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the movie, 10 for the MST3K version.
