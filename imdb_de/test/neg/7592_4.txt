"House of the Damned" (aka "Specter") is one of your cheap haunted house horror films filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. It's about a family inheriting an old Irish mansion, and after they move in, they experience strange phenomena and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered in the basement of the villa and buried in a wall. The couple's young daughter is kidnapped into another dimension and seeks help from a group of paranormal investigators. <br /> <br /> The ideas that this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film "Poltergeist" are obvious. I'll say this movie has some weird sequences, but sometimes it's very boring. Acting here is nothing special, the mood is fine, the score (mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was a bit annoying and the CGI special effects are really awful. I mean, it was 1996, you'd think they could have done better than they did. The end to which the house burned was the worst special effect I've ever seen, very cheap. But hey, that was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> The translucent monster wolf thing that sees her daughter looks awfully fake. And what was it for the movie anyway? What the hell does a wolf monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects here have really ruined the movie. The acting was also pretty bad. I usually enjoy a lot of low budget horror movies, but not this one. "House of the Damned" is nothing special. Consider it only if you have nothing better to do. But you will probably want to pass it on. 10.4.
