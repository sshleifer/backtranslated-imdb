(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich can travel back in time and hunt a living dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that puts people in the past. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken over this technology and opened a company called Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team along with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel record states that they must stay on the sidewalk and not disturb the land or anything around it. Unfortunately for humanity, a hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act has a significant impact on the Earth's climate and creates new species of animals. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent and man becomes extinct. <br /> <br /> (Commentary) The movie was a bit slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a bit over the top. The death of a single butterfly that causes the tremendous changes in the atmosphere and evolution of the world is simply ridiculous. They have changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future look stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD.
