This is a painfully boring, slow movie. We can feel some sympathy for the socially and sexually inexperienced and awkward Tomek, but Magda's motives are pretty hard to spot and the end was, at least to me, unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about how we all need love, but I'd get more out of a good Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I was told that comments must be at least ten. I add that in the background are some interesting views of the relationship between Polish citizens and government employees and institutions. I wonder if it should be portrayed before or after the overthrow of the communist government. <br /> <br /> Finally, you should pay attention to the clever way in which the men of the gas company investigate if Magda's gas leak is present.
