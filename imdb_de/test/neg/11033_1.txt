Avoid this movie if you are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> There are many wannabes trying to be something they are not, and Emraan is just wasted in the role of a travel guide who falls in love with a new companion who needs acting school go. Seriously, where do you get these people from? Just because you are pretty does not mean that you can act or be an actress. <br /> <br /> Asmit Patel has to send everyone an apology letter, which accidentally finds himself ridiculing this poor apology for a movie. He plays a bland wannabe gangster who drugs girls, forces them to fall in love with him, and sells them to the highest bidder.
