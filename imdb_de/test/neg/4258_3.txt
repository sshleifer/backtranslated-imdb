Nishabd means wordless. This must be the condition of the script before filming began, and therefore, this movie is crying for content. What you expect is an unusual love affair between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl, and what you get are very common, very common events that neither inspire nor surprise. What we still have left are the picturesque places of Kerala, brilliantly shot by cinematographer Amit Roy and the camera-friendly histrionics of the newly discovered Jiah Khan. This does not cover the lack of a concrete script. The producer and director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good film history, has to pull up his socks. As for Mr Bachchan, I do not want to discuss him in the context of this film. <br /> <br /> At the meeting I feel a loss of words. I am speechless and rather wordless! <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: This film can be compared to an equally bad movie that was released as BLACK some time ago. I see no difference between the histrionics of the main characters in both films. What did you just say ... It was a world-class cinema, and I have no taste. Well, go for a walk. No, I do not mean literally, but really one in the cinemas showing this movie. In this case, this movie could be an Oscar-level material.
