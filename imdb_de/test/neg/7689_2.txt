I'm a big MD fan. But I call it the way I see it. This movie hobbled with. The conspiracy was absurd. Access to heads of state is easier in this film than access to the local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has the feel of a wooden plank. Loosen! The editing is choppy. The actors, and I use the term loosely, sound like they're reading their lines on Valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that only scream "stinkers". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good Dudikoff movie, I'd like to suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you have never seen one of his films, he will not introduce you to his work. They go into the mouth with a bad taste and think that all his projects are so bad.
