Well, this movie is really "PADDED" HAHA. This is somehow the attitude of this film. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction, okay, that's acceptable, but to make this piece when "PLUMP" (haha)! is really incredible. The plot is so pitiful and the whole thing has just collected a few laughs. It tried to make some jokes from various other films, and most of the time it failed. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but that's not the way to laugh. Most supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. The movie is quite short with a total of about 75 minutes. They could have been much more fun, they seemed to have made fun of a blockbuster movie, they were gambling and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> In PLUMP Fiction in total is "PLUMPABLE" but you will not collect much at all! , actually it is more than enough! <br /> <br /> So worth the rent? Ummm .. Like I said, it's "PLUMPABLE", but you'll only get a few "PLUMPS" of it! <br /> <br /> Total of 10 points: a 4 out of 10!
