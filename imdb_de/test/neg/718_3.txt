This film was recommended to me by some scientists. Because of her comments, I had pretty high expectations. But this movie was just disappointing. The goal of the director is obvious - to use the interweaving of speeches / poems as an argument against the Bush doctrine. The director fails miserably. I also seriously doubt the director's choice of lead actor. It's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard. The rise of the power of the company, so what? Most importantly, this film has a poor score in its persuasive power. It is clearly meant for those who have already formed an opinion. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is quite pleasing. But pretty much everything else in the movie is just shit.
