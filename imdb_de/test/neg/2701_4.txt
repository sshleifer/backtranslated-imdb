So far, I have not liked every single Jean Rollin movie I've seen, and that has always bothered me, because it's a recognized Euro Trash monument and is hugely popular with many regular reviewers on this beautiful website. People whose opinions I always appreciate and usually agree with. Apparently, everyone always seems to find a kind of sombre and stylistic hallmark in his work that is completely lost to me. Rollin's films are unimaginably boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in different settings), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the wonderful gothic environment is always under-exploited and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I had already given up Rollin's repertoire (especially after having to endure "The Iron Rose") until I heard about "Night of the Hunted". Allegedly, this film does not contain lame lesbian vampires and is a real horror movie with cruel murders and macabre conspiracies. And the verdict is? Yes and no! On the one hand, this is undoubtedly the most compelling and imaginative Rollin movie I've ever seen (and also the only one I watch without falling asleep ??). On the other hand, it is still a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to make up for the stupidity. Jean Rollin tries hard to create an atmosphere of secrecy and tension, mostly due to lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but hardly manages to hide that he has no story to tell at all. The incredibly beautiful actress Brigitte Lahaie and the wonderfully threatening musical guidance are the only elements that captivate you on screen. During a night drive home to Paris, a young man abruptly stops for a confused and barely dressed girl who comes running out of the forest. Her name is Elisabeth, but she does not remember anything and who or whom she ran away from. Her case of amnesia is so bad that she even constantly forgets who picked her up. The next day, she is again abducted by an old man and taken to an eerie apartment complex where several people are held captive in the same bizarre state of mind. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she senses that she has to flee here. Of course I will not reveal the solution, but I can assure you that it's pretty stupid, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently, Rollin has recognized this, because the explanation is kept very short and fast. There are a variety of excessively funny and pointless sequences, the sex footage is filthy and filmed without passion, the evil makeup effects are cheap and are randomly thrown for no real purpose. As I said, the score is intriguing and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is addictive to glaze.
