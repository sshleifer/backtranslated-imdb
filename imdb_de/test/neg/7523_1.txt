It is a time machine. It runs in "real time" for 96 minutes, but it felt like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were absolutely superfluous. Massive amounts of "dead" time. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently, the film had a tight budget. I note for your edification: The Morlochs: It's not about saving money by reusing the sets and costumes from Lord of the Rings, Part I. The "scary guy" who was in charge of controlling the Morlochs ... The scariest thing these guys could think of was someone who wore Gene Simmons: (from the band Kiss) old costumes ??? Little known fact: Freaks of the future have perfectly neat nails. <br /> <br /> Save money, save time. Pass this on.
