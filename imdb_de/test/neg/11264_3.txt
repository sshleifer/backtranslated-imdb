I saw this movie last week during the Berlin Film Festival and had medium expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier, and I was familiar with some of his previous work in French cinema. I actually enjoyed some of his previous films. - The cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard and Mary Steenburgen ... I was looking forward to seeing all this talent on screen. - I was not familiar with the book it's based on, and I had not read anything about the movie before, but was told that it was a deep South exploration film (we've seen many of them in the past, maybe this one will be as good as the others here ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later the final titles will be released: THANKS GOD AS IT WAS BECAUSE !!!! - The plot is incomprehensible. If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many minor characters and there were many useless action sheets. We did not understand anything! - the accents My God! Tommy Lee Jones' accent is decent, but I still have nightmares about Mary Steenburgens Cajun French vocals ... - In my opinion, bad casting. I can not believe that old Tommy Lee Jones can beat the crap out of a linebacker-built idiot ... And I'm not scared of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We barely understand who these characters are and what they do. There is a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - The comedic attempts were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably the "action" and "suspense" scenes. They were terrible. No thrill. Bad Acting (Can Tommy Lee Jones make other faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there's the sci-fi stuff. No spoilers, but it gets ridiculous and annoyingly funny. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments on IMDb, but I thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But that's just me ...
