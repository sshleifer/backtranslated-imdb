Do not get me wrong, I love independent movies, but COME ON! I could hardly stand it without wanting to kill myself. The director had absolutely no talent and he transformed something that could have been a damned nightmare. I'm a punk fan myself and even the music is bad. Acting was crap. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a bleeding heart for these low budget movies, but this one did not even try. Please do not waste your precious time and money. I'm so sorry to be so hard, but come on! it dragged on and on and on. Do you remember when the kids came to this party with the weird cupcakes and watermelon martinis? How did they mix? It made me feel frustrated that they could just go where they wanted, get into trouble and have sex and have a "meaningful conversation" with who they wanted. I know that I'm stupid, but my mind is buzzing with everything I hated about this movie.
