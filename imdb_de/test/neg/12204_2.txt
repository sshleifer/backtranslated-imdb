Has anyone found the plot anywhere in the movie? Maybe that's what's missing in this presumptuous exercise of the cinema about the cinema. It's quite surprising that Gordon says, "A movie without action is nothing" ... It's possible that the characters say more than their own Wim Wenders. Was this sentence in the original storyline or did the actor decide to send a message to the director?
