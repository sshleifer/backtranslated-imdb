I can not believe how bad this "movie" is. The film first deals with the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising outlook. This is unfortunately as interesting as it gets. This looks like a direct DVD release ... or I guess. This is basically a production-less affair with probably the worst cut (with a constant "fading to black" between each scene !!!) that I've seen in my life and acting that will surely scare you. Why Lance Henriksen found out is completely unfathomable. The movie features footage from almost every other genre film, from "Blair Witch Project" (The Video Scene) and "Predator" to "Alive." This is supposedly based on true events, but the only truth that can be found here is how bad this movie is. I'm not a strict critic usually and believe me, I tried to enjoy this trash, but NOT at some point. Do yourself a favor and distract yourself from this DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to put it mildly: this movie is pure rubbish and it made me take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER for a refund !!! > <br /> And Lance, be ashamed! 1 * of 10 *
