This movie proves that you can not just go to a red box to read descriptions of movies, pick one and try it out. <br /> <br /> I give them a lot of credit for having made a movie with reasonably decent special effects on such a low budget and at least halfway decent script and action line ... unfortunately it was just that: halfway decent Everything packs neatly, and it does not matter low-budget effects, you might like this movie. Honestly, it was not really my cup of tea. I should have gone to bed rather than spending my time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better sci-fi movie, produced at a lower budget (!), check out "Primer."
