I can not believe how many people refer to the main characters as "young cows" !! Something like that does not exist !!!! There are cows and bulls, and all cattle are cattle and have no udders !!!! There was even a real bull, but it was like it was a completely different animal! My God, it's like drawing human ears on a cat, breasts on a superman or a mickey mouse with blond Shirley temple curls - even in animation that just does not work! Giving the animals human qualities is nothing new or unexpected, but the transformation of their actual bodies into a transsexual figure is bizarre to a family cartoon - like many people - editors, writers, producers, animators - saw this and did not know any better or Nothing is said - it is absolutely amazing! I'm not a snob and I love animation Simpsons, Beavis & Butthead, South Park, even Ice Age and all the other new ones out there - over the hedge was great - but that's crazy - totally crazy - I could not accept that many people so ignorant & I've always hoped for a reason for the udders in the movie - an explanation - no came - and in the end, if they hold this little newborn calf and half their bellies are udders, and they say it's a a boy 'I almost choked on myself !!!! Please, writer / creator, let us join in the joke!
