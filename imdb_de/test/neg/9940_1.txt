Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg in the far north of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark in winter and the cities are in front of it. Young people move to the more densely populated areas of southern Norway where the climate is warmer and there are more options. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this film are the people themselves. The people in the choir, who are between 30 and 95 years old, all have a unique, colorful life and are very enjoyable beings. They are characterized by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the lifestyle. Throughout the film we hear about many people in the choir and follow them through songs, some events in a church and at the harbor, and finally a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> The outdoor environment recorded in the film is very beautiful and influenced by the Norwegian nature. The scenography is also natural and comes directly from the choir and from the lives of the people we meet. Your living room, the bathroom, the kettle in the oven; There is nothing artificial about this film, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. Everything is as real as possible. <br /> <br /> But everything loses when it comes to telling a story. It is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it due to nature? Or is it just a story about Berlevåg Mens-Choir to see about her life and some of her travels. The message, if any, is that this small society cope with social events like the chorus of life. The choir has kept people together for many years. <br /> <br /> It's all very well, but as popular as it was, seen from almost 200,000 in Norway, something is wrong. There is no beginning and no end. No one wins or loses, no one discloses any message or tries to convince the audience that this is good or that life up there is great. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a nice movie about good people, but compared to an average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian movie - it does not deserve 9 out of 10. He's closer to 4 out of 10, and I'll give him that. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a theater, you should expect an average age of about 55-60 years. It has been reported to be consistently high in all theaters. Maybe that's why it got so much praise in the news and good grades also in the IMDB: It's a movie about elders, for elders. It's a movie about "I have no regrets in my life" and a story that says life in a small town like Berlevåg can be a nice life as well.
