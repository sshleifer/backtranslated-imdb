As one of the founding fathers of my monkey movie club in my region (including monkeys / chimpanzees and orangutans), I explore this movie from the perspective of a monkey movie. All in all, it's a whole summer of monkeys, more than 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best, causing harm, shenanigans, hyjinx, solving human problems, and teaching us about ourselves. The story is simple enough. In short, the poor boy needs money for things he wants. Fortunately, there are a few monkeys (chimpanzees) who have a bounty on their heads that would make the blood of Boba Fett or Dog (Duane Chapman) flow. When the boy tries to catch the monkeys, he learns of himself, his family, his grandfather, the local spinner, flirts with a girl who is twice his age and learns that an animal must deal with bullying, if someone is pointing a shotgun at them. <br /> That's the problem. The boy concentrates so much that the chimpanzees do not get the time they deserve. The chimpanzees are not as talented as the chimpanzees who play Jack from the M_P trilogy, or the legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So do not look at this movie and expect the next big thing in the chimp genre. The chimpanzees made some cute flips that the movie needed more. There is an epic scene where the chimpanzees invade the house of the poor families and destroy all that they have been working so hard for. Serious monkey film enthusiasts will want to rent the movie for this scene alone. <br /> <br /> So in the end, this movie is not for serious monkey film enthusiasts. I would not recommend this movie to families as it encourages a rebellion of the children against their parents. I can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkey-loving adults and well-cared-for children.
