Dreadful! A friend of mine (who obviously thought I had a vile sense of humor) recommended this. <br /> <br /> They are coils. I almost turned it off. It was only my anal desire not to leave things untouched, which prevented me from doing so. <br /> <br /> This was obviously a British attempt to make a movie with a number of television actors, including TV actors, who used a lame script in their shop by their partner. I can hardly imagine thinking of something that approaches the lack of this film. Less funny than global warming. <br /> <br /> Normally, I am not so vehement, but I looked at it a good ten years ago and thought that I wasted an hour of my life with it. It's destructive /> <br /> Puerile, plott less, useless tosh. <br /> <br /> I'd rather eat my feet than look at them again.
