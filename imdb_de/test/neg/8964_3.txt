As already mentioned, it is very difficult to make a fake documentation. It requires tremendous skill, speed, patience, directing distance, a plausible premise, a narrative flow and REALLY believable drama (also BIG drama). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It shows its wrong hand over the 20-minute mark (60 minutes before watching), and the viewer realizes that he or she is being recorded. From there it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen just reached his climax too fast. But to be honest with Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explained in the extras, he wanted to make a REAL document, could not get funding and opted for a cheaper way to make his film The Premise - People Who leading a secret life by posting themselves on a porn site - was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 when the movie was filmed. Eriksen does a lot of tricky things - a pushy "host", "handheld cameras", zooms, grainy blacks and whites - all to create a sense of authenticity, but it just does not work. The film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately weakens it is the credibility of the actors and the rather terrible dialogue.
