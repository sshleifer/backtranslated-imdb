Wow - this movie was really bad! You speak of a formal, typical film plot? Watching the movie was like repeatedly hitting a wall against my head. The transitions always tried to be cool, but failed. The storyline revolves in the end, where we find out who the villain is, was unexpected, but only makes sense after his monologue. Even then ... The amount of blood in this film does not help either. Are all these pictures necessary? My last complaint concerns the plausibility of the chunks of the film. Would the PD really send a single officer to an unlit warehouse, a subway tunnel, or some other location to find a body if the location of the perpetrator is unknown? And why does romanticism suddenly happen in the end? It's as if the author were trying to fit into any Hollywood clich√© he could. Do not waste your time trying to see this piece ... something.
