THE GOVERNESS is an atmospheric piece, the moving story of a Jewish woman who went to Scotland after the death of her father in 1830 and pretended to be gentile to get work to feed her family in London /> Rosina - or Mary, as she calls herself in a not too subtle symbolic writing - is a rudderless child, a celebrity with dreams of being an actress. She enters into an alliance with her employer and accidentally solves a crucial problem in his photography research. Dizzy from success, they begin a hesitant and uncomfortable affair, while the eldest son of their preference falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with them. <br /> <br /> And as a child, she understands the consequences of not acting - in the end the scams that deceived her in order to make herself a life for herself. Many say this is a feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Whether intended or not, this film only resonates with me when I see it as a warning fairytale. In the end, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth - that she lied, went on a path to help a man who wanted to be her father and lover, and in the end contributed nothing but destruction. So, the end of the movie gives me the impression that nothing she did did not make her happy - and that's exactly how it should be. <br /> <br /> Have I needed a movie for a long time and langouristic to teach me this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, if it had not been for excellent cinematography, unique film music, and my hope that it would succeed, I would not have stuck to it until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Fans of Minnie Driver are likely to be disappointed by their unequal performance but still want to see it; I doubt that young female fans of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers will be able to stay awake for the expected payoff, and I can not help thinking that this does not include enough cultural detail to interest even photographers. The 3 points I attribute to the film are based solely on its visual style and score. Because of their other work, I assume that the performances of the actors are so disappointing due to a bad script and worse directing, but in the end they are unremarkable.
