I mean, come on! Now my compatriots have started to make Western! Is not it enough that our cinema is already annoying? Now you have to catch English-language films with Polish acting and make no sense. Please stay away from this movie, do not waste your eyes on it. A 5-year-old baby could make a movie that makes more sense. I am from Poland and ashamed that this title is actually viewed by you. Please, I implore you, DO NOT watch this movie, and if you do so, you DO NOT judge Polish people and Polish movies by what you see there. We had some good movies in our story and we had some bad ones, but this one is nothing worse than I've ever seen in my life. Stay away!!!
