A pile of garbage that only Full Moon Studios could make has a group of college kids who are housed for free in an old hospital without anyone knowing, as a demonic creature with two faces (covering the entire movie because of the movie) incomprehensible lighting makes barely visible) going through walls kills every member that has a particular piece of paper with old markings. Someone among them (it will not be hard to prove that, but a slight twist is revealed so uninspired that one is only mocking) is the mastermind behind the one who kills the beast, and must be revealed before it kills all / > <br /> Cheap, badly traded mess has a "That's it ?!" a kind of weak ending that annoys you, why you've just wasted your time. Tanya Dempsey, who could not break through a wet paper sack, has the heroine duties as the youngest member of the college group called Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound the animal makes before it attacks the next victim.
