Scarlet Dawn bets Douglas Fairbanks jr. As a Russian Baron roughly driven out by the forces of the Russian Revolution, he has to settle in a world that is not particularly hospitable to former aristocrats. He is also not suitable for any kind of work. <br /> <br /> Doug might have been caught by the Reds just because his former servant Nancy Carroll had not revealed him. Nancy has a crush on Doug, and they marry when they arrive in exile in Istanbul, which is referred to throughout the film as the former Christian name Constantinople. They marry and settle with Doug, who now limits himself to washing dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' former lover Lilyan Tashman, who always plays nasty girls on movie spots and offers to go back in style. He was used to being part of a swindle against the American and paternal ones Tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> Good that this film has the incredibly short running time of just 57 minutes. Usually these were given to B westerns because they are both boring and melodramatic. The end is pretty incredible. Doug knew he was in a Thanksgiving special and really outsmarted to cover up the flaws of an incredible story. What I did not understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why not just become a mercenary after leaving the new Soviet Union? That did not make any sense to me at all. <br /> <br /> I would only see that if I am a fan of the main actors.
