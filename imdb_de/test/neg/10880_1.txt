Do not look at this movie in any case. It's terrible for several reasons: <br /> <br /> No action No structure No direction No action to speak of no visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <BR /> <br /> The best thing about the box and the fact that it ends sometime. Who would have thought 85 minutes could feel that long? <br /> <br /> Again, do not look at this movie. It is terrible. <br /> <br /> No action No structure No direction No action to speak No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In one word - no. <br /> <br /> The best part is the box and the fact that it ends sometime.
