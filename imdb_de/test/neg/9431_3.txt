"Shadows and Fog" is certainly one of Woody Allen's weakest films, right up there with "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (although Allen did nothing, the horror of "Anything Else") is "All's Shadows and Fog" Homage to the German expressionist style of filmmaking, all strong and stylized light and shadow and ... you guessed it ... a lot of fog. But one can say that Allen caught up with the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that would not be of any interest to him. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
