Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with actions. I thought "Stoner Comedy" was just a way to describe a comedy in which a lot of weeds are smoked and the people watching it are more likely to enjoy it. However, "Grandma's Boy" has decided that this is a full blown niche and that Stoner is a piece of the comedy pie that needs to be achieved. Obviously, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison gang were right, but that does not make "Granny Boy" boring and listless. They may be completely stoned - but the characters are mostly half finished. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, longtime support player for Adam Sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has driven her out. He might be looking for a new apartment, but then we do not have a movie. After trying a few friends, he lives with good old grandma Lilly (Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond). She wakes him up at 6 in the morning and has him do the chores, and soon he falls asleep at work, and so the new video game sequel may not be completed within a specified time. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex acts with his frustration and boredom playing video games or getting high or both. His friends do the same. Most of them are virgins who live next to loving video games at home. They are all clumsy and all but Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only intermittently) their characters are not funny. Funny, if you're pale ... sure, I suppose, but I can not say it from experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe we all like losers, going out high, playing video games and clumsily meeting women with certain features attention on their chest, but still, it should not be the driving force behind a whole movie. Old women should not accidentally have an accident (saw that one is coming) or sex jokes - but that's what happens when a movie is not about anything. In the last 20 minutes there are no conflicts outside the easy problems of getting out of the pot. Alex tries to get the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) to like him and the guys who want to end their levels for the video game deadline. <Br /> <br /> Characters may be the salvation of these meandering stoner flicks, but apart from the lovable Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson is the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and Joel Moore's ability To make robot sounds There is little ingenuity. Covert is an ordinary protagonist without comedic dimensions, his dealer friend Dante is an unfit actor and a waste of time, and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far into the periphery that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about nothing and look at them in a state of mind and body that enhances that nothing, "Omas Boy" is probably just what you're looking for. Those who need a bit more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy stay untouched. The best I can say for "Grandma's Boy" is that, despite its senselessness, it is observable. It does not feel like a total waste of time, but you wish you to use drugs so that you could have used at least one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> Visit my website at www.moviemusereviews.com
