The video box for "Joyride" says "with second-generation superstars," and you can not help being sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith has gone on to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? Since this was the pathetic eye-catcher on the box, I was stupid enough to buy the movie for a dollar because I thought I was in the land of such bad, good 70's movies. Uh, not so much. While so many aimless teenage films of the 70s (or just ordinary movies of the 70s) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, Joyride does not even try. It's just aimless. There is no interest. Each character is so poorly designed that it's no wonder these actors look so listless. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is about three 20-year-olds who go to Alaska to start a business, but instead have to find work to be robbed. They are beaten, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. It's all very typical, but it's done in the most banal way. There are no surprises and the river is so bad, and the actions of the characters are so ambiguous that you miss several scenes and do not mind. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then this is a must. That's still not enough to reach the lowest score I can give. <br /> <br /> Best line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * out ****
