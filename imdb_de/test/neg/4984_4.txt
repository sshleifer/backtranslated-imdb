Actor: James Belushi; Peter Dinklage; Alex Neuberger and Jason Lee Underdog is a true hero story. Here's the story of Shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. When a dog is made by a megalomaniac dwarf who is curious to destroy, something crazy happens. <br /> <br /> Our quirky little neighborhood puppy wins extraordinary powers. He can run as fast as a cheetah; fly as fast as a superhero and have the power of thunder. He is no longer shoeshine; he is underdog? the best criminal in the wildlife. The city can not sleep before underdog gets it from the evil dwarf. Simon Barsinister and his cronies free. <br /> <br /> If you fancy really carefree entertainment with all the clich√©s of superhero action flicks, then this is the case here. For quality entertainment, this offer is for the juniors only. Those of you who want to enjoy the comedy of fast-fading star James Belushi - a word of caution: this is not one of his finer works.
