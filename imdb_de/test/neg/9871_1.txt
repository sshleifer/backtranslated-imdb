Whether this adaptation of the Marvel Comics was made or not? and reset? So the production company can keep the copyright to the characters, but it does not change the fact that it is perfect garbage. The costumes Dr. Doom and (especially) thing are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a lack of cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can not even point at things with a camera, without including such howling as POV of a blind woman. The dialogue is absolutely bleak, the team's costumes do not fit well and the effects are frightening: the human torch seems to be drawn with felt-tip pens on the film, while Mr. Fantastic's powers come to life with a curvy blue stick and a glove at the end become. Joseph Culp compensates that he must wear a mask by waving his arms wildly. Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying. The rest of the cast is terrible at various levels, and although it's hard to get any publication for all the guys who think about this movie, it's just as difficult to imagine that one of them believed that it was really good.
