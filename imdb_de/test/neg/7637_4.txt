For Valeria Golino this could have played an important role, but instead the film decided to turn its attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino), who is married to a fisherman and a mother of three. She is a free spirit and prone to outbreaks, so the rest of the village and her family decide that she should be sent to Milan and see a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa in front of Sicily and shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rival gangs who are just trying to find something on the sun-baked rock. The eldest son of Grazia Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) loves her and tries to protect her during her depression. The daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a thriving young girl who falls in love with a local policeman and the youngest son Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very naughty and scoffs at the accent of the policeman. When she learns that she should be sent to Milan, Grazia runs away and Pasquale helps her to hide her in a cave while everyone is looking for her. This movie could have been more effective if it had focused on Grazia. We see some outbursts and irrational behavior on their part, but these scenes are not pursued. That does not mean anything. The film looks great and is beautifully photographed, so that director Emanuele Crialese has to thank for that, but the story had to focus on something essential. The film is a good job to show us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children. There is some speculation that Golino's character gives the impression of a mermaid, which is why she has difficulty living on land. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way, and if you do not, you can submit to the harsh realities of their rules. All speculation, but I think the films could have caught the attention of Grazia. After hiding in the cave, she really has nothing to do. In a sense, the character is stagnant. I wish Golino had more to do because I always liked her and when she's on the screen, you just can not take her eyes off her. It is a bundle of anger, passion and raw energy! What a shame that Crialese did not play a fuller role for her than she does. When the movie ends, your left feels empty of an incomplete story.
