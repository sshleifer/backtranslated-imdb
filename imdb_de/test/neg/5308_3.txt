If Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty did not exist, this could be an OK movie. When I say that, I mean that there's nothing in this movie, unless it's another dreadful dialogue or stereotype scene. All the lines like 'I will not say more than I have to if Get shorty seems to appear in this garbage sequence, all cameos like Steven Tylers are being treated terribly and are not needed, and like Christina Milian, man, do not bring me Unfortunately, some of the coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to be pretending to be down with their children and their hips, and have almost ruined their reputation playing with one of my least favorite actors , Vince Vaughn, together. The man tries to be weird while talking to the seemingly rapper's crocodile as Cedric a Andre and} and the only funny part of the acting of Cedric, Andre and the rest of the gang is the way in which the pants go up to knees so you can clearly see boxers there and the only reason I find that funny is that there are many people actually doing it. So, in the end, this movie is trying to be funny and failing miserably, it has no new material, no comedy or coolness as it copies every other movie and after all, the only reason you should see it, if you want me to compare how bad with his brilliant predecessor. Get shorty.Oh yes, I forgot to mention that in the end there is a big clich√©.
