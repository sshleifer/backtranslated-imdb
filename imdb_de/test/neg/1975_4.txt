This show lasted most of the 80s and had their moments, but the actions were usually thin and often painless. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, both deserved better, but there are some nice memories, and I made fun of a few repeated scenes. June Whitfield's talent for the comedy may occasionally show through (if she's not a foil to Terry) and she's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s are the last decade you'll find this kind of music middle-class, middle-aged comedy, and many people like to remember it, but I'd rather remember the decade of alternative comedy and the biting satire of Spitting Image.
