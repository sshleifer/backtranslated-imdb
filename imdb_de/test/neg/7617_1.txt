I was a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the beginning. The most beguiling thing about them was the shown love, innocence and camaraderie. Kermit was a role model for deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, yet sweet and believable. All the other characters were a bit eccentric, but it showed how different kinds of beings can coexist in a caring way, respecting each other. <br /> <br /> Subsequent films have maintained the same atmosphere. In this "It's a very funny Muppet Christmas movie" Jim Henson would turn in the grave. These characters have been completely rewritten to be horny, evil, selfish and cheesy. <br /> <br /> The cast shows God as a reckless corporate head, with a mean trail. Angels as spiderless, non-spiritual collaborators, and the movie was so bad that I had to stop watching. I had bought it for my great nephew, but fortunately I have a preview of everything I give a child. <br /> <br /> Instead, this movie earned the trash and has no social content or charm. Shame, shame on the people who rewrote the characters and move away from Jim Henson's original, heart-centered, socially-conscious version. It's a terrible disadvantage for a big-hearted man who's not around to defend his creations.
