The only reason I rated this movie as 2 is that Channing Tatum is beautiful, but the whole movie lacks emotion and it was boring to watch. Usually I love a good romance, but this was just a waste of time. I did not shed a tear, though it contained sad content that she just did not do well. I'm not a film critic, but I only recommend girls to really avoid this, unless the only reason you see it is to see Channing Tatum was good) I would have stopped seeing it much faster. It's really a shame, because if the right actors were selected for this film, he could have had the potential to become a real drinker. If you are looking for a good scream or a movie for a girls night in ... then give it a trip !!
