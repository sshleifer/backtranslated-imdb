I actually saw the movie before I read the book. When I saw the movie, I was upset because I wondered why Dean Koontz had made such a bad book / movie. The movie was confusing and had no flow at all, it was choppy and I wanted to throw a rock on the TV. I could not connect with the characters at all, so I did not care about what happened to them (usually I love the characters because I can relate to their personality or issues). Then I read the book and I really liked it. I often read the book again and the film collects dust. I wish someone would shoot a Koontz movie following the plot of his books, then the movies would not shit so much. DO NOT VIEW THIS MOVIE IF YOU DO NOT MONEY MONEY!
