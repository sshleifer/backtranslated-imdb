Dreamland started moderately interesting, but never went further than Tedium City. A low rental thing without well-known actors and ridiculous effects, which is recommended for no reason. The best thing to say is that they were actually shot on location in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can not imagine anything good about that stinker. The finale is supposed to be a kind of revelation, but flat like the rest. Oh, I thought about another good point about this cheese. He arrives at just over an hour, although he is not so popular anymore. When the girl walks around in the desert at night, it seems to take forever and gets worse and worse. The horror attempts are in the least ineffective. The story is an attempt to feel in a zone of dusk, but fails very much. Check out "Retroactive" for a good science fiction B movie.
