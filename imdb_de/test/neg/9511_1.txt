It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no definite performance - no single performance can be "right", but some can be wrong and that is it. Hamlet has at least two things that can not be dispensed with: 1. His indecision and inability to take any action. For God's sake, that's what the piece lasts so long. If you had Othello instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead at the end of the first act. Every production must try to explain why Hamlet has delays, why he is incapacitated. 2. His sexual disgust. His utter disgust at the thought of what his mother and uncle find in bed fills him with utter disgust for all sexual matters, and this means that any relationship with Ophelia is impossible. Hamlet gives in at the slightest hint of sex. So what does Mel Gibson give us? Lustful Action Man You could not keep coming from Hamlet's character if you tried. There are many ways to play Hamlet, but this is none of them! What I do not understand is that they have managed to get such good performers for the other parts - Claudius, Polonius, etc., why could not they find one who also plays Hamlet. Mark Rylance would have made the movie a great movie. This? Mel Gibson, whoever he is has completely abandoned the rest of the cast. And let's be honest: Hamlet without the Prince really does not work.
