This is one of the worst parts of the cinema that I have seen for some time. This is also my first review, so you can say that I have to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like my serious movies. I do not particularly like Hollywood, I like French, Italian, unconventional USA or anything that tries to communicate something sensible. <br /> <br /> But that was terrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was absolutely incredible, even if the director seems to depend on a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character does not recommend him. Does he smoke for coolness or to show us his fear? For God's sake, this guy is supposed to be a former mafia lawyer. Do we have to be more interested because he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet? And he smokes ... so he has to have deep personal problems. Pop psychology at its finest. In the last moments, I almost cheered as he was buried in the cement. Best place for him. And I thought that was the only good scene. Or maybe that was because it was so close to the credits. <br /> <br /> The totally tired and unbelievable interest in the main character of the beautiful girl. It was simply because beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old, old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as shown by smoking). It happens all the time. In really bad movies that is. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace was so bloody. I like slow, I like being careful. But that was just deadly. 5-50 A few other things that I really can not disturb. <br /> <br /> Awful.
