I can not believe this horrible movie was made by the same people who made Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Look at that and skip it. The plot is messed up and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suppose the editor had gone on vacation in the middle of the movie, because there are a lot of choppy cuts that just confuse things rather than explain them. The end also makes no sense. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a propaganda film, with which the Serbs regret themselves and can berate America for the NATO bombings in 1999. Our allies during the Second World War claim that the whole world is unfair against them and ignored everything that Slobodan Milosevic said and did, like the war with three neighboring countries. They seem determined to make a political film, but only a few seconds show Milosevic on a television screen without sound. A nationalist agenda evidently replaced any consideration of art that was not the case with Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this movie to a teacher when he played at the Seattle International Film Festival last week. He also cited the bad cut and confusing conspiracy, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You were warned.
