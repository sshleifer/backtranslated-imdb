Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Together with an assistant of the Air Force and a comic geek, they look after a super-secret underground laboratory on the west coast. Morrow is thrilled to discover a meteor going through the atmosphere, but not surprised when the meteor decides to dive in the Pacific Ocean and emerge on the Mexican coast as a fantastic machine. <br /> <br /> No one knows what the colossal block structure is. Obviously it is a kind of carpenter artifact, because it consists of right angles with a hemispherical ball visible from above. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, called Kronos, is far away from planet and was sent here to rob the earth of energy. You see, here on Earth we learned to turn matter into energy, but on Kronos' planets they found out the other half of the equation - how to turn energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on the other planet. Are you taking notes? Well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can address some of the scientific questions of the Kronos mission. For example, if the Kronos construction workers are able to transform energy into matter and vice versa, why not simply turn some of their own materials into energy instead of sending complicated machines to earth to extinguish the lights of LA? However, it is doubtful that the authors could explain it as well. Reversing the polarities of two antennas is referred to as "anthropic transformation," meaning "toward human change," which makes no sense. But it does not seem that any science makes sense for that matter. The diagram that Morrow draws on the board shows that the current is going in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with the transportation of Kronos. It marches along the coast and threatens "populated areas" (see Southern California), but has no joints in its two or three legs. These stumps bob up and down slowly, crushing some people. The movie does not do much with these crushed people. They are shown as Mexican farmers, so maybe they do not count too much. The USAF also drops a hydrogen bomb on Kronos - while she is in Mexico. Nobody raises an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> There is not much action and not much. Jeff Morrow has a strong and resonant voice that is great for radio or TV voice-over. His face is less expressive. He has only one expression, no matter in which situation - a close smile, as if he would be photographed at the Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a fine, golden quality when she produced "Street With No Name" a few years earlier. She was a slender 17-year-old wife of Richard Widmark. Here, her body care and behavior reduces her to the level of a B-movie actress, though she is still beautiful. It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these films. He made so many that I messed them up. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the movie looks flat, I'm afraid. (However, there are some nice shots of a B-47 in flight.) The sets show a low-budget company. This is not necessarily bad in itself, but the barren settings do not matter. Low suspense in the script, no stage advertisement and little effort for the performances. <br /> <br /> You may get a kick - a relaxed high - because this is clearly unchallenged. There are only so many better films of this genre.
