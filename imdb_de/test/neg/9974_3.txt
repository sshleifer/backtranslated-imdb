This HBO original is pretty straightforward and pretty stupid. Armand Assante, once again a poor Stallone imitation, is Ray Wellman an ex-con who is currently on probation. All he wants is his old friend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy has met with Elliot, who is being played by Sam Neill. Further complications are that Ray's old Cell friends are looking for a favor and abducting Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot work together, despite mutual aversion. <br /> <br /> What follows is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win the Oscar in the future. Sincerity and some pretty explicit nude scenes make this almost worth watching. Nearly. <br /> <br /> Borrow "Fever" (no, the title does not fit the movie) if you're a fan of it, otherwise skip it and be grateful that the stars are improving things. <br /> <br /> Note: This is a hard "R" stitch for language, violence and nudity.
