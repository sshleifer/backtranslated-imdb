We've already seen a story like this: A spouse in marriage (played by Nastassja Kinski) has sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and wants to return to her life with husband and wife. When she comes home, she learns that her husband has finally found a job. Everything seems bright. However, Kinski learns that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who is still showing interest in her and seems to be doing everything she can to get what he wants. What should I do? Say nothing? <br /> <br /> I did not really like the movie. It was not only bad, but it was clearly missing on "this something". Maybe it should focus more on what's going on in Kinski's head. There's nothing to say about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessive boss), but the characters seemed a bit stereotypical and looked like the characters you see in your daily TV movies. After all, the end has destroyed everything that could have been an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie was trying to look cool, it had a bit of a blurry camera here and there, a few stills, fast cuts and glamor, but in the end I think it fits much better for spelling production , The same applies to the music. Otherwise it did not look that bad. <br /> <br /> Some may like that, but it was definitely not my cup of tea. To be honest, I do not usually see much of this kind of thriller. This felt too long, even if it took only one and a half hours. I think it could have worked better as an hour long episode in some TV series. Some scenes were absolutely not necessary, especially the shower scene. <br /> <br /> My tip: Try it out before you buy!
