"Death Machines" sets a pretty decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts assassination machines sent out to kill a criminal boss's opponents) and turns it into insurmountable chaos. I've rarely seen such a stunning combination of budget, bad behavior, and incoherent scripting as a so-called "movie." It's by far the worst martial arts / action-oriented movie I've seen in years and even left "Ninja Holocaust" (which had at least some good fighting scenes) behind. <br /> <br /> The real "star" of the movie is the white "Death Machine" (it's basically his vehicle), so he's prominently featured in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He is in good shape and does not look bad, but as an actor he is hardly there - think of Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", just without energy and emotions. This is obviously a deliberate decision of the actor and the director. But you have to be Arnold to do that sort of thing, and that guy is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> The film (and the director) does not seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that were originally asked, such as: who was that Shadowy figure who gave orders to the Asian lady with her marbled mouths? How did the "gang war" end? Why did the Asian lady use her mouth to kill her zombie assassins? And what the hell happened, that her assistant was dead and she wore a katana like a broomstick? <br /> <br /> However, there is time to film a completely different bar fight, where a sailor (well, he looked like Popeye) destroyed a bar because the jukebox did not work. It is only related to the rest of the film because he is also KO's "hero" of the film, a bartender / karate student who became a victim of the first big job of the "Death Machines" (he chopped off his hand killed his teacher). This is followed by one of the most unloved "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend that I have ever seen. The Segue does not make sense - at the end of the bar fight she dislocates his splayed-out body and the next thing she finds in a "tasteful" shadow montage of sex and love that looks like she's from a Hallmark card. By the way, we'll never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it's as if the director and scriptwriter had never really seen a movie scene in a police station but had heard of second hand and decided to record some without really knowing how they worked. <br /> <br /> The film is a textbook case in which poor actors and theater actors fidget on the local level without sound direction. The three Death Machines seem like lumps; The "hero" knows his lines, but he can not wear the movie because his character is an ineffective sissy. his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other smaller parts are barely visible. All of this makes a pretty bad movie - but the "dragon lady" pulls the movie more in underground stinker territory than anyone else. She looks ridiculous; Her tiny, expressionless face is overwhelmed by her skyscraper wig, which carries her ton of hair. She wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe and speaks with a horrible word-of-mouth that screams "needs time with a dialogue coach". Poor lady - she was obviously out of her element and, as far as I know, never appeared in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add a low-budget synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and plays anything appropriate or interesting. shitty movie stock and lighting; Fight against choreography, which is strictly from hunger; and generally all around Tristesse and lack of energy in blocking and in the stage business ... and you have a lame film. <br /> <br /> I received this as part of a 50-movie DVD, which would probably cost me 50 cents. It was not worth it. Feh!
