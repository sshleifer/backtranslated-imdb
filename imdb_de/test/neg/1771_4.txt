This is a species that already breeds in a beautiful model (Mathilda May). A crushing baby with the urge to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a strong start and will be infected in the middle to the end of a Bohrvirus. <br /> <br /> The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot / story. How to compare it had, Natasha Henstridges species has received the same act, but holds a lot of interesting subplot together and not mentioned here the good actions and the strong klymatische end in Star Trek Next Generation; He wanted to find more models in a glass cage floating in Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> A must for sci-fi fans.
