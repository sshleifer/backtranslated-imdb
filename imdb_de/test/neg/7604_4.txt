That was a real disappointment for me. The original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy movie, but this movie was pretty weak. I was not interested in the new characters, who unfortunately dominated the screen time, and the story was not well developed. While the first film was tragic and involved, it was tedious (as I only counted the time to the end when the unfortunate lovers would actually meet). The action was bad in this case as well. The fights were not very well choreographed and there really was not much kung fu. Only a few faint swordfights fight between the very worn-out Lui and one of Lin's executioners. Lin himself mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes their hair, far from the impressive whip and kungfu presentation she had shown in the previous film. I still gave this movie a 4 because it was at least a high tempo and I wanted to see what would happen in the end, though I (as most of the first saw) predicted that it would work that way and After seeing it, I felt it was anti-climactic and wished that they either did a proper sequel or just left the story alone. I really recommend the first, but as far as the sequel goes, only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as a bride have to apply again.
