I do not understand why people praise this movie. I did not like it at all. I look at it with several people. Neither of them was interested in it. First. It's just clear that another low-budget studio is trying to pay off with a big name story. The actual shooting looks like a live television interview. The make-up is bad. If you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see that the people who participated in it have great enthusiasm. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of the comedy and the added skits. I read several books and watched various shows about this story. What I've always caught of all the stuff about it is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could really make a good movie about it. It always fascinated me. The bad drama has really ruined the story. The situation of the little boys has put it even more. If you watch this movie. The little boy and his problem is what you and your friends will remember and laugh about. It made no sense why his brothers laughed at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch was so threatening, but it was alright to throw her little brother. It's an incredible story with him and his little problem. I still can not get over the little girl saying, "Mama said tobacco would rot your teeth." Frank Fox's statement and facial expression are so bad. The scene outside in the yard where he gets food is pretty stupid. The sound of parts seems to be from the psycho of the film. The girl hovering over the bed and her little "bubble control problem" come from The Exorcist. This film lacks the talent of creativity. We recorded the movie for a few minutes and knew immediately that it was a crap. I also noticed that there were shortcomings in the film quality. Parts of it looked like what a person could film on a home video camera. I noticed that many people had many jobs in the credits. So this movie was probably composed. Someone said I like this story. I will meet all my friends and make a movie with a video camera and a computer. It does not matter if we know how to act. As long as we get it on film and say it's good. We got the family together and prepared food. Then he sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.
