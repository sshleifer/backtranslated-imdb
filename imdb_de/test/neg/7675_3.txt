"Oh, you pilots are such men." "You do not call it the cockpit for nothing, sweetheart." Such a dialogue is just one of many reasons why The Concorde ?? Airport '79 (or, if you've seen it in the UK, where it pulled its heels, Airport '80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the least of the series. The catastrophe film was in dire straits in the late 70s, which caused a lot of unwanted fun for The Swarm and just boredom and the desperation of trying to find a new spin on the genre - Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, Time Time Out and City on Fire obviously. This time it is a plot of conspiracy. Susan Blakely's news anchor discovers that billionaire friend Robert Wagner has sold arms to terrorists and North Vietnamese. Of course, she decides to tell him everything instead of making the story public, but he takes it away with the explanation, "I'm a very rich man, I have everything in life that I could ever want, why should I risk it by doing something? " so incredibly stupid? "Just in case she does not buy this line instead of hiring a man to kill her on the ground, he decides to destroy the Concorde while flying to Moscow via Paris." I have many things but I'm not a murderer, "he insists on his way to re-program a guided missile to destroy the plane, so there's nothing incredibly stupid there, and if that does not work, he sends a jet fighter And if that does not work out? <br /> <br /> Do not think about looking for something that resembles logic: this is a real bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, even the studio abandoned and commercialized in the US as a comedy after critics laughed it out of the screen.While the previous three entries all looked like glossy conversations, this small screen (the only one that can not be recorded in 2.35: 1 widescreen format) creates ) not einm al the Concorde, which looks good quite a performance. Television veteran David Lowell Rich probably had the directing show because he was quick and cheap and had previously shot the television movie SST: Disaster in the Sky, in which the supersonic plane of Peter Graves could not land due to sabotage and Senegalese flu. (at least deliberately a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and seemed the natural choice for a movie that looks like a $ 14 million television movie that somehow fled to the theaters when no one was looking , <br /> <Like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars are very scarce this time, and most of the vaguely familiar faces seem to have been squeezed out of rehab clinics and broken sitcoms. Alain Delon gives the career in Hollywood, which was last turned as a pilot, "Happy Fish" (do not ask), George Kennedy moves from the executive floor to the co - pilot seat, hoping to remind people of the other films while the The rest of the ensemble consists of a few veterans of The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), a soft porn star (Sylvia Kristel trying to be respectable), an Ingmar Bergman regular (Bibi Andersson), and she plays the hooker !), David Warner's navigator on a diet with nightmares being chased by bananas, the voice of the devil (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and her Seeing Eye Chihuahua ("Dohn miscon-screw me"), Martha Raye and her weak bubble, Jimmie Walker plays the saxophone in his seat and smokes grass in John (in the few moments it is not occupied by Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson kisses her credibility as a compulsory mother with a critically ill child and a frozen H arching in the luggage compartment, airline owner Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning occupied the best seat in the house, Ed Begley Jr in goggles and the Russian Olympic team and their gracious coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on a goodwill tour of the States (Who knew about the boycott? ). To add a touch of The Simpsons to the processes, Harry Shearer makes a report in the same tones he would later use for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlight? Despite the spontaneous wedding ceremony during a crash landing, it only needs to be George Kennedy, who deflects a heat-seeking rocket by opening the window, sticking out his arm (at almost twice the speed of sound!), And firing a flare rocket? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so that the rockets no longer have a "heat source"? Yes, somebody was actually paid for writing this, and that someone was future Oscar winner and scriptwriter of Munich and The Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone has to start somewhere), though producer Jennings Lang came to his defense in action. What do you expect from a movie that credits stunt balloonists and ends with a shot of the Concorde flying into the sunset? It's amazing that Universal Studios in one of those areas where the studios did not usually tend to admit they tended to record some 20 minutes of footage to include them in the network TV show (not on the DVD included). Unfortunately, the failure at the box office led to the fifth entry in the series, the Salmon Rebellion, which would have been Airport in 1984: UFO, who never got on his feet. Even more tragic is that the Concorde used in this film crashed 21 years later in France. (Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo says to her chihuahua in unsolicited Spanish, if it's not allowed on board, it says, "What do you think? Do not worry, when the revolution comes I promise you everything fly, whatever you want, I promise, what a shame, my dear, what do you think they are? ")
