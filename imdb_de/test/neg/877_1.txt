If I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a chick movie if it's good. However, this is beyond bad. You have the story through the book, girl is divorced, boy with problems appears. BOOM magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes that her life has a new purpose. Now, while I can believe this could happen, I'm not an idiot. It would not happen during a weekend of geriatric Rumpy Pumpy, it would take time. But here the producers know that they have only 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they force the change of the two. I think a night of hammering and a night of gramps and grannies like dogs in the heat might be enough. I think romance novels were the gospel ... but most people do not. <br /> <br /> Well, if that's not enough ... the producers remembered that having a chick film made the viewer cry. Well, they tried to make you cry while the two seniors started doing it because of failed Jiggy abuses. How could they beat you again? Why I know, we have one of the characters killed for no good reason, except that a random death will certainly bring a tear in the eye .... and now the teenage daughter makes a magical connection with a heartbroken mother for no reason it would be nice (completely unreal, but who cares.) So, there you have it ... girls find boys, boys find love, death finds boys and mother cries ... What a movie - NOT.
