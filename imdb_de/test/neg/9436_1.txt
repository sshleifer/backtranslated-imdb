You will feel as if you have experienced a holiday in hell after watching this terrible television movie. This is an exercise in which you excessively (very badly) go beyond situations that are more than what they are. I will not betray the plot, but once you know why people in this movie are running in front of the native man, you will reclaim the two wasted hours of your life. The only advantage is to see Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!
