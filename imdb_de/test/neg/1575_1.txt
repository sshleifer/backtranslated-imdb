Lay the film down and slowly pull it back. The actors compete with a high school game, the action is kicked, and the production values ​​are slightly higher than in a community theater. The fools are so plentiful that it becomes a laugh. Rooms are moved, the dead move, dogs are used for wolves, men are shot with .45 caliber and can ride snowmobiles, blouse buttons and buttons without human touch ... this is a movie by baaaaaaaaaaddddd. I almost fainted when I saw the average rating. Taste is not considered. By the way, there is no nudity.
