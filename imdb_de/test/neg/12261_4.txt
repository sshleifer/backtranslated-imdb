The reason I gave this movie a 4 was for a couple of reasons, but this movie was not that bad. First and foremost, the editing, which I sometimes found rather bad, the script (or what they had of one) was not very good, and if Nunzio La Bianca was not, the drama would have been crap. Besides that (ha ha, I know, it's like the whole movie) it's not so bad for an extremely low ind. , Low-budget movie. If they had gotten more money, slightly better actors (but they were intimidating, so it was good) and a more detailed script would make this movie great. Someone has to tell me that this guy from Walter Hill was very much influenced by the warriors. I mean, this movie is just like that. who has seen both films, will agree with me.
