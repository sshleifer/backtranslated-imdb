George Zucco was indeed like Boris Karloff, no matter how poor the movie in which he appeared, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and perform well. "The Mad Monster" is no exception to this rule. It's a bad (albeit entertaining) movie in every way. The filmmakers obviously did not know how to get the most out of their low budget, and the script seems like it would come out in a day or two. Nevertheless, Zucco is good and credible as a crazy scientist. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a pleasure at the warehouse level. Usually, normal horror movie fans do not like PRC movies. However, these "Poverty Row" productions have a small but faithful cult. Occasionally they would cross their borders, with "detour" the best example. Usually they looked like this. Despite its technically poor qualities, "The Mad Monster" is an amusing opportunity to kill a rainy afternoon. The Retromedia DVD is commendable as it combines this with another PRC production, "The Black Raven," the original movie trailer, and an interview with Glenn Strange, who talks about his role in the film. (4/10)
