A group of seven people fear that they are the only survivors of an H-bomb explosion that ends near the world. They not only fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hills. One of the group is already contaminated, but represents a strange danger to others. Only the friction of various personalities to get up close, is the subplot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge and plays a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to populate a beautiful new world. None of director Roger Corman is the best. This is predictable black and white science fiction.
