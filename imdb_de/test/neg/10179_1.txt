Allegedly a film about a magazine in which journalists have been investigating reports of UFOs, one of which is more or less tolerant or agnostic about the matter, and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic laughing at UFO nonsense. It's all a joke, a kind of money making. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this movie is indeed a scam and a trap to announce the Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs I've heard before. This is an ad hoc statement that is not biblical in itself, but was invented by some modern theologians who can incorporate anything and everything into their mythology. The paranormal? It is really only demonic, if it does not take place in a Christian context, then of course it is from God. Simply, if it's not from God, it's the devil's, stupid! I think that since Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was not inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or the logic would lead to absurdity. <br /> <br /> We are informed that the Bible does not report on life on other planets in the universe, so there is no (a version of the Ad Ignorantium fallacy) and that God created the universe so vast, so great that it shows us its almighty power. I remember Carl Sagan's remark that if God had created such a vast universe and kept life only on Earth, it would have been a tremendous waste of space. <br /> <br /> So what are UFOs? They are demonic activity and deal with the soon to be experienced Christian event, the break ... I mean rapture. Before the tribulation, the true Christians in masses will disappear from the face of the earth and cause mass panic, confusion, crashes of cars and planes ... whatever. Satan, knowing this, therefore sends his demons to create an illusion of alien spacecraft and abductions that can then be used to explain this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan's plan, which of course will keep people from looking at God or Jesus and fall in love with the lies of the Anti-Christ. <br /> <br /> This ad hoc statement is also typical of the theological mish-mash, by telling one secret with another. In contrast to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strangeness and the enigmatic as far as possible, first by the known, if not by the known. <br /> <br /> It's like jumping straight to an extraterrestrial kidnap if a child is missing and not taken into account. I think I'd first go into more mundane explanations of how the kid ran away, got lost or abducted for ransom or kidnapped by a predatory pedophile before he called aliens or the supernatural or Satan or something. </ This kind of scam or trap of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to free rock concerts that begin with something inconspicuous and then suddenly switch to overt Christian music, followed by a sermon and altar call. This kind of obvious deception could mean more Satan's ballgame. But maybe because the Christian faith will soon be in its death throes, these people feel that everything is alright. Any deception or deception or scare tactic is acceptable to try to maintain the belief in life faced by both secularists and serious resistance to competing beliefs such as Islam, the fastest growing religion in the world replacing Christianity because Islam is far more coherent and consistent, and logically more durable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this would be of little benefit to humanity, this would replace one intolerant thought system with another. <br /> <br /> And of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of Pascal's wager. The atheist Aussie, who is almost skeptical of everything, is told. Well, if you're right, there's no life after death, and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, do not worry ... but what if you're wrong? <br /> <br /> Basically, statements that reality does not go beyond an atheist point of view or conform to a Christian fantasy is a false dilemma or a black-and-white fallacy. Even if the atheists are wrong, this would not necessarily correct Christianity by default, or if it turns out that Christianity is full of holes in its theology, the materialist atheists are therefore correct by default. <br /> <br /> For all we know, Native American spirituality may turn out to be the best description of the ultimate reality, and we would all have wished to have treated Earth and its creatures a little better. <br /> <br /> This film should be stamped correctly on the box: Attention: Contains religious propaganda and is not intended for informative or entertainment purposes.
