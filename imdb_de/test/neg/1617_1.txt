* Spoilers here * <br /> <br /> Where do I start to see how stupid this movie was? "Mole-sized people who live under the garden and attack the inhabitants of a big house" !!! When I first looked at this movie, I did not know that the protagonists were not poltergeists, but 10-inch-high goblins who looked powerful enough to kick hard and wide. I kept watching because I like watching movies, too horrible. This movie was awful. My girlfriend, who had fallen asleep for the first ten minutes, not only found it a great help for sleep, but also thought it was weird that I had bothered to see everything. <br /> the thought is silly I know) are about as scary and threatening as flat coke. They only managed to trip a guy "deadly" and kill a cat before they were blown up, The End. I mentioned that it was sucked right?
