I admit - I was lured by this hype about this topic - and I did not stop to look at the sources. "One of the best indie exploitation films of the year (1999)" "shocking" and "a must". <br /> <br /> Well - I wasted my money, but not everything was bad in this movie, at least they did the right course of action and some of the most unique murdering methods you've seen in a long time, there's even a storyline (somehow) and that's all. <br /> <br /> But for one there's a surprising amount of content - we have 3 interracial babes - maybe we have a psychotic vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok, that squeezed me) and some female versions of Gene Simmons (I understand that We have honestly said that Capone - among the best actors in this film - is not a compliment, and finally we have a government conspiracy in - I do not know - try to do the revenge / random / subject murder to connect Jimmy Boy with each other, so that the Vietnamese psycho seems reasonable ??????? If nothing else, this film proves that the Italians and t The Americans have no influence on this type of film. The Latinos can be crap like the rest. Kudos goes to everyone involved in the achievement that has overcome them and made themselves a career.
