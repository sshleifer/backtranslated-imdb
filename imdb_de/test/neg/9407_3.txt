I'll leave it to my bettors, er, better here to puke and see this wonderful, wondrous movie, and I'm just saying that I thought it stinks. The great thing about this site is that you always get a variety of views and track them by all means. Not to say with what you will come from the movie. For me, those who have seen through the simplicity and the phenomena, have my money. There was one, absolutely perfect, when he pointed out the two big moments of the matter that belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Apart from that, what a waste of time. Completely. Pacino does the same thing over and over again, and it would have been better if he had reduced his performance by about five levels at the level of his protegee. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Surely they could all have been. But most should never have been done. Including this.
