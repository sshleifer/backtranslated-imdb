After receiving a DVD of it with a Sunday paper, I hoped that it would not be the usual Duff movies that were forgiven because nobody would ever buy them. I was wrong. Sheen's acting is similar to that of a ten-year-old child in a pantomime production, and the same applies to the majority of the cast. Neill is satisfactory, but plays Russian and is not supported by his hybrid Northern Irish / New Zealand accent, and the rest of the KGB characters do not sound like they're in a Cambridge Footlights reunion. In fact, the only people with real touches are extras who give a weird word here and there and helpfully tell us where the hell is going on in an otherwise complete porridge. For the most part, the "spy" factor is insignificant and consists mainly of Sheen wandering around in various ridiculous disguises as he tries to blend into the background and quickly become not only boring but also laughable. The plot has potential, but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. That could have been so much better.
