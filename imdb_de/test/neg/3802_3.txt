Maybe we're all on the other side here in Sydney so we can floater like this s-eek! Merge -Ele in stylish theaters. The hilarious all-tar drama released in 1980 was greeted with joyous laughter in the session I attended. In fact, the audience was so excited about the ridiculous antics on the screen that it was played like a rocky horror session. Within 5 minutes, we all knew that it was a real disaster: the drag scene, where you can see the buckets of water thrown in from the offset. After that, it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice that cheered for bad acting and Oo-Waah reactions. The shootout in the hold between the boxes is particularly idiotic and allows drunken spectators with friends in altered states to watch, too, to make an appropriate contribution. I call these movies Michael Caine his vacation movies, as I always think he does them because he has seen a house he likes and does not want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it's called.
