one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but extremely funny (but not on purpose). Every scene that has something to do; Airplane, romance, script or acting is messed up. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all pilots, it is so bad that you should burst into laughter sometime in the movie (see also airport 79): the Concorde, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Who else, avoid this movie like the plague (except for fans of B-movies of course) <br /> <br />
