Oh God! Book II is a bad remake of the original rather than a sequel. It's not so funny, its plot plays too much like a rejected situation comedy pilot and using the slogan "Think God" is another twist on the idea that worked a lot better in the original. John Denver did not come back for this movie and that made a big difference. George Burns, as wonderful as he played God, does not have the same chemistry with the little girl he made with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> <br /> George Burns; the rest of the cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved the first, you should not watch this movie.
