I watched this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We both tried to watch our watches long before the end of the movie to see how much we had to endure even more. Two hours and six minutes. It's roughly equal between combat scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable) and the plot development split. <br /> <br /> One would have thought that the subject is the son of a small tribal chief who conquers half the world, the plotting would have been relatively easy. There is a lot of raw material to make a pretty good story of. However, the authors completely filled it up. We do not get a real story. Instead we get a Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What keeps the young Temudjin through his long - almost endless - actually, or at least so, the tribulation to the viewer? Why, of course, the love of a good woman. <br /> <br /> How is he out of jail? Now, an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to bring a talisman to this good woman, symbolizing Temudjin's love for her, and falling so close to her that she can find him while he lies there talisman in his hand. And then of course she goes on and rescues him (inexplicably) rich and powerful. <br /> <br /> How does he escape the shackles? Well, he goes to the shrine of the great wolf god Tengri (or a similar name) and Tengri frees him by magic. Yeah right. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to become ruler of the Mongols? Apparently the wolf god again. Off Temudjin goes to ask for guidance, and - surprise! Surprise! - he understands it. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need are laws, good, simple." Golly, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And finally, how does he win the decisive fight against the more powerful forces of his rival? Better tactics, but also with the help of the good old wolf god, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All troops cower as the thunder rolls and the flashes flash (Mongols are afraid of thunder, you see) - but not our Temudjin. The troops, impressed by his courage, call him king! <br /> <br /> I do not know what makes people produce this kind of garbage. The funny thing is that it's riddled with all sorts of bitter realism: sipping a lot of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this film wanted to do the little things right, so that the audience does not notice how childish is something of the big stuff. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of violence in the graphical close-up: slashes, spits, blood spills, blood spatter, blood clouds - the blood guys really had a great time. Despite the realism, it is impossible to take seriously. <br /> <br /> I have to mention the ridiculous CGI battle scene. How everyone thinks that things look realistic, is not me. They do not do it. Oh, and it's all shot in standard Hollywood style - breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery and super close-up Stedicam stuff for the fight scenes. And the standard Dolby super-sound effects of Whumps and Thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to maintain the tension. <br /> <br /> Effortless. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
