Physical Evidence is one of the movies you want to like, but it should be a lot better than it actually is. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that all involved only made it while waiting for something better. The premise is perfect to use, mostly technically efficient, though surprisingly pleasantly uninspired with Henry Mancini's Musacky, but one can not believe that things would have worked out better if one of the leaders had turned out to be a murderer (as rumor had it originally) the case). As the opening scene of his little-seen, personally catastrophic Heat (1986) showed, Reynolds has all the makings for a great screen villain. There are few surprises and the feeling of half-heartedly filming numbers as it builds a head of Intertia while tuning in uninterestingly to a less than great will-this-doing. Final. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is fine if you go through charisma, which is clearly a star vehicle. Unfortunately, one can not say that of Theresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress in her husband Nic Roeg's films, which enables her to immerse herself in the dark side of human nature. She's trapped in a part that requires star quality instead of depth, and she does not have it in spades. She does not flirt with her lines and does not bump into the other actors, but that's all that can be said for her amazingly stilted and often amateurish performance that makes the movie bad. With the exception of Ned Beatty's prosecutor, the understudy adds only a slightly surreal presence in a Boston where everyone seems to have a poorly camouflaged Canadian accent and the streets have an exciting resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Likewise, director Michael Crichton, who has shown in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery that he can lean an audience on the edge of the seat, seems to be handling the action in a short chase Do not even fit together and seem almost arbitrarily thrown together. The climax itself has no sense and is utterly threatening or dangerous, and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth. It's no big surprise that Crichton, aside from the uncrimped revivals of The 13th Warrior, has not since then directed the opening. Whether this is a reason enough to see it, lies in the individual taste.
