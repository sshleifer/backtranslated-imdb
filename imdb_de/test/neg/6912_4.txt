When I saw this movie, it was an afternoon when I came home from work. I love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy, but that costs the cake. The plot presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems a bit intriguing, but as the film progresses, the script makes a wrong turn with horrible clich√©s and a poor presentation, which in turn makes the movie boring and boring. I do not intend to continue to criticize the script and plot because that is not the worst thing for me. I have to say, all in all, acting was not bad for beginning actors, and I was impressed with Taylor Locke, one of his first films. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They stinked on a low budget and really ruined the conversation of the audience, even if he was interested in the plot remotely. I recommend you to watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and action. Only then can you really appreciate good authors and directors.
