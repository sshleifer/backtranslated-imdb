A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People wonder if they did it. The police investigate and investigate suspicious evidence. The couple is insulted by the public and accused in the press. The cops speculate that they are Satanists and ritually murdered their own daughter. They will be charged and brought to justice. They are represented by lawyers looking for advertising who give them bad advice and charge them $ 100,000. The evidence against them is distorted or hidden by the police. Fictitious intimations of sexual abuse are presented. Her other child is taken away and taken to a nursing home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to her baby being removed. Judgment, she did not do it, but he did. He goes to the slams at the age of 45. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the movie, with Dillon in jail and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we're slowly seeing people who are antagonistic to the couple's defense of witnesses lied to to have. Other facts are brought to light that eventually lead to the release of Dillon. The killer is never found, though the movie offers us thoughtful whacko as plausible pots. <br /> <br /> This is a mistake from beginning to end. Nothing seems to be right for the couple. Oh, there are some happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and tear up for joy, or a piece of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug each other. However, it does not take long for someone to storm through the door with more bad news and all faces turn into tragic disbelief. (Usually, a crossfade follows to block.) It's not necessarily something wrong to move moving tragedies, though I can not imagine the joy we see in people suffering. There are also many tragedies in Shakespeare. I think whatever we find interesting in tragic stories lies in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm the fool of Fortune!" Romeo screams for the death of Juliet's brother. Here's Dougherty walking through a hospital corridor in her robe screaming, "Where's my baby ???" There is no ambiguity or irony in the story - because I'm sure there must have been events in real life on which it is based. People are either good or bad here. Otherwise they are bad, then they will be fine. <br /> <br /> The film does not aim to explore the human bizarre or the way things work. It aims to tear the audience's tears. The actors provide first-class role models. I can not remember the last movie I saw so many tears in. There are tears. Showers of them. Cascades of them. A true Niagara of them. A Lake Lacrymose of them. <br /> <br /> Well, let me give you an example of the efficiency with which the film is made. Dillon and Dougherty hire a police officer from Chicago who also works as a private detective (Ed Asner). Asner is sympathetic to them, but he does not really accomplish much. He does not seem to be in the film because of his importance to the case, but because he can give the victim couple a kind of philosophy - "learn to live with it," which is fine, and because he suffers from colon cancer, so we can watch as he takes his medicine, doubles in pain and finally dies. <br /> <br /> What frustrates the film is the fact that, if he focuses so intensely on the suffering of the couple, one of them omits the more important issues that come up - the role of gossip in regulation of privacy. Gossip is really a strange thing. If we call it "gossip," it's bad, but if we call it "public opinion," it sounds at least acceptable. Of course, we all have beliefs on issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is again brought to justice, accused of abusing a boy, and I wonder how many of us were excited about the news and immediately believed he was a pedophile.) But gossip is not all bad. It's like water. If it is properly controlled, it is a common good. We need gossip to keep us in line. It helps us to maintain public order. But like water in a tide or tsunami, it is ruinous for a village to go out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is fine if you are not looking too much in the way of insight into human nature. It's done so smartly that it's hard to argue with in view of its goal.
