I saw this movie because Calexico did the score. A real disappointment. Annoying, trendy scenes, with urban hipsters and their clich√© hips. Cheesy, stereotypical Mexican border culture (mystic grandfather with the rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter in her mariachi-style restaurant visit). A few laughs, but hipper-than-you, and she lacks vision and basic talent for filmmaking.
