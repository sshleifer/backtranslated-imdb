I had the funny chance to see this four years ago at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I have to admit that it was not done as badly as in other science fiction / horror movies of the time. The plot revolved around an astronaut who came to Earth with alien embryos inside. Now the plot is quite strange, if you can even call it an action. (To see how a space program comes out of a building and an old pickup truck is totally funny!) I admit that by today's standards (and 20 years ago) it was awful ... but I see myself watching 43 years ago and be charmed by this movie. It's not even close to the evil invasion of Neptune Man, Manos: Hands of Fate or Future War. <br /> <br />
