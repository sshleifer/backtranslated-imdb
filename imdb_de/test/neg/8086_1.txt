This movie does not have a redeeming function in the truest sense of the word. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©d, unbelievably misogynistic and stupid. The script looks like it's been cobbled together out of 100 other films, acting is horrible, and part of the 'gross' humor has made me sick, I think EVERYTHING would be funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I have seen in recent years.
