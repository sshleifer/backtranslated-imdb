It was so boring! No plot! Basically a watered-down version of the Lion King mixed with Animal Farm. Again no plot. Dreadful! Worst one and a half hours of my life! Oh my God! I had to go out of the theater for a few minutes to get some relief! I laughed maybe twice. All half funny parts are in the previews. I hate such movies. Yes, the movie is pretty shitty. I do not know how it got such good reviews and ratings. IT IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE !! If you see this movie, bring a pillow or girlfriend / boyfriend to persevere. Dreadful. I do not think I've ever gone to a movie and I did not like it that much. It was a good thing that the tickets cost only five dollars, because I would be angry if I had paid $ 7.50 for this crap.
