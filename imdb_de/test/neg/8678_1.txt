I watched for 40 minutes and could not stand it any longer? The TV went off and I returned to some light "Lobotomy for Beginners". <br /> <br /> It was hard to say which aspect of this production was most unpleasant - the dialogue consisted entirely of sound bytes or the play After Numbers. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to determine when the drama should take place. There were throw-away references to Lord Nelson and slavery, but Edmund, the future cleric, played by Blake Ritson, was the only actor believed to have lived in the early 19th century. The other young people had make-up and costumes more akin to a 21st-century costume party - the bleached blond Fanny, with Billie Piper the least credible character. The British commercial television seems to think exhausting bosoms, pouting lips and deep, meaningful looks make a good story. Fortunately, Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> If you want to find out the story of Mansfield Park, buy the 1983 Miniseries DVD.
