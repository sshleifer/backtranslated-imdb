That was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots and bad sound (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I could not hear what they were saying, sometimes I blew my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters were mostly incredible neurotics, bipolar and caricatures. The development of the characters was terrible ... the brave little sister (why was she even written in the script?), The nagging mother (again - for what purpose?) The crying friend (why did not he have them long ago unloaded?), The "Dark Suits" gang (as original - I could not imagine a better name), the hot girlfriend of the drug dealer (I have a hot Latina, if you have LA Gangs, but really ...), etc I can not believe that I saw the whole thing.
