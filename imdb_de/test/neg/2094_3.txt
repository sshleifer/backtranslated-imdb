Not to be confused with the acclaimed Samuel L. Jackson vehicle SNAKES ON PLANE; SLIMMING ON A TRAIN is a low budget, there are no actors (to say of), but some pretty decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry a woman's choice for her husband; So she is exposed to a powerful Mayan curse that hatches snakes in her body and slowly devours from the inside out. Their only hope of survival is a shaman living across the border in Texas. Time is running out for them; and she's taken to Los Angeles on a train from El Paso. After a short time, the snakes leave their damaged body and grow bigger quickly. The passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon become snacks for the snakes. The final sequence is undoubtedly the best of this 91-minute film. Also the acting credits receive Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
