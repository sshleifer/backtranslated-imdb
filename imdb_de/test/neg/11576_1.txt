I watched the sci-fi channel as this steaming pile of crap popped up. Although not as bad as Wynorski's "Curse of the Komodo", that's still bad ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as "Curse of the Komodo" as well as the same actors and the same house. The effects are first-rate (surprising), but that's about it ... I do not know what else to say about this movie ... oh yeah! As in "Curse of the Komodo", the government participates and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (Teilmann, Komodo AND Cobra!). Overall, this movie is absolutely crap even on bad movie standards. Just think about whether Jim Wynorski had anything to do with a movie ... steer clear ... so as not to fall asleep, repeat "it's almost over ... it's almost over ...". 0 out of 5.
