I do not know why this received decent reviews as this could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is only there for a cameo and his performance is as unnecessary as most lame attempts to make jokes (and fear). The direction is terrible and the spectacle is worse. It seems like every year the producers are trying to make another Evil Dead, but those faint, unoriginal attempts only recall the memory of a real horror classic. <br /> <br /> Whether his filmmakers say, "This is not a remake, but it's a retrogression back in the '80s (which I think is just as unoriginal - Hatchet) or people trying to combine it with other horror classics His misbelief is still misleading and makes up for the lack of fear, horror, comedy or even a decent movie <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL THE COST !!!
