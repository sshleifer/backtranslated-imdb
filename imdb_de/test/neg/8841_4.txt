Obabakoak is a series of short stories with a single common point: the small town of Vasaba in Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange movie, as it is another main character (the movie takes about 20 minutes for each story) than the city of Obaba. Every story is really well explained and the fact is that they are very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but that does not say much. The only good thing about the film are the precious scenarios. It is filmed in a very valuable valley and it is more pleasant to spend time with the scenario than to be aware of the story.
