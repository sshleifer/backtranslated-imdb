I saw that on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even this show did not really make this film bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course you expect terrible special effects with such an old movie, but I've seen Silents better. The plot has huge gaps that allow you to find out why they are even in certain scenes. The cameraman does not seem to know what a tripod is, and had too much coffee or maybe something harder because the camera is ALWAYS shaking. I could not even follow the plot, but suffice to say, this is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in my life. UPDATE: I saw Epic Movie some time ago and decided to give this movie a 2. It is NOT the worst movie I have ever seen!
