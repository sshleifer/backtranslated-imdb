This movie smells. No money, no drama, nothing. I recorded this at 3:00 pm this late evening movie and felt compelled to comment. This movie has nothing to recommend. I can not believe it was ever released for US television! Nobody in this movie can get out of a bag. The lame attempts of the comedy fall in the face, the special effects consist of a worm-like "monster" of the hand puppet ... I can not even say how deep this production is. It looks like the shooting cost maybe $ 50,000, but only because it's 16mm, and that's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I quickly lost interest and had to content myself with seeing "matlock" reuns rather than ending it. So bad is this movie !!!
