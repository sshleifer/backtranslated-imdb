When I first saw it 9 years ago, when I was nine years old, I thought it stinks. I'm 18 now and I still think it stinks. I mean goodness no special effects or anything, it was boring and somehow anti-climatic. My cousin watched once and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how it should be much better, but he kept less and less money. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.
