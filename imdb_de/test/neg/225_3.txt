After reading Fool For Love in a drama class, I was looking forward to seeing Sam Shepard's wonderful play transferred to the screen. Much to my horror it was not nearly as entertaining as the play. The film seemed to draw, the music was inappropriate for the tone of the film, and the raw energy of the piece seemed to have been sucked out of this film version. It's a shame to see that even with Shepard's involvement as Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... check it out the next time it's listed near you, or just read the book.
