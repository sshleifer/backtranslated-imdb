The main problem with 9th Company (9 Rota) is that it's not sure if it's Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. The experiments of the Spielberger Sentimentalismus are embarrassing, like the Burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers !!! The training sequences have neither the intensity nor the realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. Another point of contention is that the Afghan fighters are called ghosts because they beat and are hardly ever seen. Here they attack a Russian fortress almost in formation, without trying to use cover. I am sure that tactics have evolved since Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie was previously seen and significantly improved in other war movies. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: why do all talented shooters have to chew a match? <br /> <br /> After all, I'm always suspicious of a movie that starts with no narrative Qualify the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no, you do not have that.
