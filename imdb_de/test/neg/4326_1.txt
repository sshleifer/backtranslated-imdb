You see, a movie has turned out to be the worst. I suggest it could be India song. When I saw the film in 1976, he played at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place frequented by people who are very interested in film. About halfway, people just poured out of the theater. My girlfriend did not want to let us go, but in the end the theater was almost empty. I told the people as they left that "the good will come yet". And it was. The good thing was the screen at the end, on which "fin" stood. It was the only good part. I'm still upset about this movie 24 years later. It was pointless, stupid and distracted (Marienbad, Part 2). Only see it if you want to spend an infinite two hours making a difference between simply bad and just terrible.
