The widely forgotten monster movie of the '50s truly offers terrible special effects - the "claw" in question is a huge puppet that would make Jim Henson kill himself. I just saw the movie last Thursday and I can not even tell you who was there. That's a bad sign. I was told when the movie premiered, he laughed off the screen ... and that was in the 1950s, when the standards for special effects were much lower. Basically, I should have gone out of the theater as soon as the words "Produced by Sam Katzman" would appear on the screen, if I knew what was good for me, but then I was sitting through "Harum Scarum", so I think that deserve it.
