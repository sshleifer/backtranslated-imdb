This is the worst movie I've ever seen of Bollywood this year. I can not lie, my wife liked this movie very much. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal who made this movie incredible, but Amisha Patel. She plays the role of a blind woman who gets into trouble as she nearly falls off a mountain where, fortunately for her, the hero Arjun Rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of the danger of falling off a mountain because it can not see its surroundings. From this scene I saw the movie very closely and in every scene there was a mistake in the acting of Amisha Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. She only does that by not looking the person she is talking to. When I saw this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with her performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level when she appears as an actress. <br /> <br /> In any case, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's the clich√© story. The sudden Arjun is killed by a man who loves Amisha immortal. Amisha is desperate, but then Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor in my view, but he can not take the movie to a higher level where Amisha Patel puts him deep in the ground. I have to say that Bobby deserves better roles in better films than he has received so far. Bobby got into acting from the first movie his loving daddy gave him. He was so bad at barbaring, but if you see him acting now, you get the shudder and believe every word he says. Only a film with high potential like a Yash Copra film has to find its way. <br /> <br /> Okay, when Amisha falls in love with Bobby, somebody enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes in this crap? Not me. Why did not you give his role to one of the ugly guys in the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and Bobby play a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a scream for an actor like Bobby, who gives him a great role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (bigscreen tv face) Patel. This movie was so horrible that I regret having bought it.
