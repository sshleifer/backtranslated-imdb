At the other end of the spectrum of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is David Hemmings' utterly inferior adventure of saving a World War II plane with a valuable cargo. Assets include beautiful settings in New Zealand, Brian May's energetic music, and some dandy helicopter flights and jet-boat chases. The bad, however, far outweighs the good. Donald Pleasence hams as perhaps never before; half of his dialogue is almost incomprehensible. George Peppard tries an Australian (in my opinion) accent and then gives it up in half. Lesley Ann Warren is the most irritating. Ken Wahl is good Ken Wahl. The dialogue is painful to hear, and the direction of Hemmings is largely inappropriate. The script is not only obvious but terrible. Jokes are noticed, scenes do not strike and continuity is practically nonexistent. According to the credits, two men were killed flying jets during the movie. What a waste.
