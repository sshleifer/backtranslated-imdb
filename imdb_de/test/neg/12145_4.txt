GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A boring western / comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, which I've always enjoyed as a "third stooge"), with their usual skills and traits Directed by the normally reliable Edward Bernds who also did some of his funniest classic shorts - so you have to wonder what went wrong this time? The most likely answer is that what has worked quite well as a 15-minute two-roll mechanism is too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike many classic short designs, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth considering. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
