Clossius says Baltic Storm is banned in Sweden. That is not right! Instead, you can buy the movie almost everywhere, like gas stations, shopping malls, of course the Internet and so on. Often at a very low price, because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep the interest alive. The film addresses only conspiracy theorists, psychos and other people living in La-la-Land and those who "know the truth". <br /> <br /> Working on a museum with the Estonian catastrophe as a theme I've met them all! I have heard of every theory that exists: cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, the Russian - the American - the Estonian - the Swedish - and the Finnish intelligence, often in various combinations. <br /> <br /> Some ordinary people asked why we did not show the movie. A question that was asked only by them who have not seen this horrible nonsense film. <br /> <br /> Also in Sweden "Baltic Storm" is not forbidden. It has some entertaining features, but what makes Donald Sutherland hell in this movie?
