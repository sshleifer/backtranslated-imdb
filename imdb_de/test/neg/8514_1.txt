When a friend and I saw this in recent releases, we decided to get it, even though none of us had heard about it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn, so we thought it could not be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was really that bad. No actor or actress could have made this movie worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and a nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste everything together. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there were a few giggles. I laughed when the boy from the cabin asked Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he was a Pussy Marine. The other laughs in this movie had nothing to do with writing. I would like to know how the people doing this movie thought you could turn a cruise ship upside down and keep it quiet. It's not a tip or anything. <br /> <br /> If you want to look for Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or any of the rest of the cast, move on. Find something good that you have done.
