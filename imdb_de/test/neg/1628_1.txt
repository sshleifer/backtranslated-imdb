The sequel nobody asked for the movie nobody wanted. There are obviously too many flaws in this movie to name it. So I'm just focusing on acting. Miles O'Keefe would have been more apt to play the agitated Asian buddy Thong, mainly because then he would have no dialogue. Lisa Foster expresses her lines and shows an emotion, dullness. Charles Borremel brings his part to life by pausing all five words. And finally the extravagant John Saxon guy ... no comment is needed. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the Barbarian" if you must, but do not waste your time with this low value-budget loser.
