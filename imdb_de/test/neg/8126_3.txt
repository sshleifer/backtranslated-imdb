The real estate television team is tasked with hitting a hockey team at a small high school in the city that meets a serial killer wearing a black mask and a hoodie. Many interviews in which the members of the crew (and some of the locals who live in the town of White Plains, where most of the film plays) talk to each other about the camera they meet in the city of White Plains, their current situations and the showbiz side of her life. The screenplay is often sour, cynical and corrosive, and Killer Movie essentially makes fun of reality TV shows and features a number of characters that can be found on The Real World. If this action is attractive to you, strike out. I found the characters boring and the satire is old hat. After the cast, Paul Wesley, the director who needs a big break and comes across more than he thinks possible, is a nice guy, Jake Tanner. He is very sympathetic and tolerant of the crap he struggles with, considering the prima donna and immature people in his wake, who often cause only migraine. Especially annoying is his producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant who constantly barks orders to all. Her poisonous attitude creates a lot of tension. She's the kind of producer who wants to use a small town outbreak in terms of the killer with the help of the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy in White Plains. Those familiar with Kaley Cuoco know she's perfected the spoiled princess now because she's the only role we most often see her. As a Blanca, she polarizes the way she demands attention and milks what a little celebrity status she has under control. It creates a lot of friction as she becomes a source of frustration, and she has her mouth full of pots (Cuoco has just taken over the role) that escaped her usual TV sitcom roles that allowed her to whip up obscenities. Cuoco serves Killer Movie along with the entire cast as a feast for the eyes, but it's hard to find a character you do not want to see chopped up with a piece of meat. Beil Jason London is the sound / equipment guy, a real crook with one An acidic attitude that often torments the others with his nasty comments for which there is no reason. We are seeing many clashes between personalities and watching these Hollywood guys talk to each other in the cast-snipe. The identity of the murderer should not surprise anyone, that's obvious. A little gore, but most of the violence is shot off screen. Despite tame lesbianism, this is not even satisfactory. Leighton Meester appears in the movie as a cute victim. Director / writer Jeff Fisher has a pretty attractive cast, but I can not tell that from the countless slashers that have filled the horror shelves of the last ten years since SCREAM. Although I've never liked one of Cuoco's characters, I never tire of looking at her, but eventually she has to find a role that's not made up of plucking, with smug arrogance, always lamenting and plaintive.
