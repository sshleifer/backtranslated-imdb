Along with his role in the super-slick "classic" THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), this is considered the ultimate horror of Cameron Mitchell. It's a little too slow for my liking, has zero sympathetic characters and not much action until the very end, but Mitchell's dedicated central psycho-performance as a vengeful whack job Vincent Rinard is fun. Not Anthony Perkins good, mind you, but definitely fun enough. As a parody of the shallow imagination of Hollywood, it's just so-so; as a horror movie, it's only fair. And even if it's just a simple vintage image, it's fine. I'm a big fan of the unnecessary, unnecessary dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the performance of the Gazzarri Dancers who are currently governing. Five of them make a crazy hairstyle, floor-length, hip-hop dance routine to "Do not cry, look for the rainbow" by T-Bones. Watching these ladies with their big smile in the fringe bikini top and the parachute ensemble is a key reason why I give this model a slightly higher rating than usual. <br /> <br /> Former movie makeup man Vincent Rinard ("The Best Since Lon Chaney!") follows the people at Paragon Studios. A flashback shows Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio manager, ejecting Vinnie's face right in front of the smoke. He is in flames and immersed in a pool, but not before he scraps a side of his face and loses an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). Vincent now works at the "world famous" Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California, using a special serum (described as a blend of truth serum, nerve medicine and special "vitamins and minerals" ... Attention Center!) Paralyzing victims. They disappear, and the dense detectives of the case (led by Scott Brady) seem stunned when new "statues" are exhibited in the museum. Vince talks to himself ("I'm a terribly nice man!"), Smokes, mumbles, hisses and describes how he gets "excited" by the scream of a woman. <br /> <br /> He too has to deal with a series of stabbing scumbags and selfish witches, most of whom deserve what comes to mind. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a nasty, incompetent guide who blinks a statue but does not go to the cops. Apart from Max (a real joke that does not even die!) And the stupid cops, the other two main roles are women and both are pretty cruel. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not a typical innocent heroine. This tramp got engaged in this movie with five different characters (!), Including Vince, Max and two of the wax characters / missing male stars (I think she never had time to try the missing girl). , For some reason, she pleads and pleads with her irritating baby voice that Vince gives her a copy of the head he designs for the latest missing actor (and fianc√© number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She does not know that Vince has already stabbed a syringe in his neck, but I love it when Mitchell dryly agrees with her demands "so you can totally withdraw." He also wants her to "pose" for him, which means that she is eventually held in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole through which its head protrudes, so we still have to be attacked by its loud moaning. The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. She has shown for the first time that she is rhythmically deficient in rhythms on stage in a light green fringe bikini. Theresa is bearable before she speaks, but when you realize that her grueling presence combines the abrasiveness of Lorraine Bracco with the lighthearted mentality of the Landers sisters, you want Vincent to inject her serum as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, we are first exposed to a scene in which she makes endless demands on the studio honeymoon and walks around the museum to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are totally unsympathetic, but they serve as a means to entertain the Hollywood system in general, I think. And I probably give more recognition to this movie than it deserves. The benefits are few and far between, but (except for Mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre finish that gives the impression that Rinard is severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life with it his personal hell ... Married to Marie! ... Yikes, that's scary now. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are director John "Bud" Cardos (also production manager) as police sergeant, with James Forrest as director, Virgil Frye as statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as bartender. Many of the people who worked on the film (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) have also worked on the Al Adamson movie BLOOD OF DRACULAS CASTLE and other atrocities
