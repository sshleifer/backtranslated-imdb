OK, when I was little (and I mean like 2 or 3, not 6 and 7), Barney was one of my favorite shows. I grew out and threw away all my old Barney cassettes. As I leaf through the canals one day, I see Barney playing in a carriage, and I thought, "Uh, is that the right show?" When I realized that it was so, I freaked out. Why did you change the setting of the show from a school to a CABOOSE? Since then the show has been absolutely terrible and the only reason I give her a 2 is a) because I'm nice b) because of reef and c) because the show used to be bearable in earlier times. Now I just hate it. HATE YOU. <br /> <br /> 2/10
