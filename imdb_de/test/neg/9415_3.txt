You know, I only watched 15 minutes of this movie, so I can not really describe how great the movie is. I mean, the concept alone is so original and fascinating that it simply did not let me go. Then there's the mass of Academy Award-winning people involved, as well as the Academy-winning director. You must not miss. I mean, it's the middle of the night and you're not tired yet. This movie comes up. They see it and are shocked. It's so awesome, so original, it's so great. It will make you feel like you turned off the screen half an hour later, but when you go to your bed, you see, it's only 15 minutes past midnight. Enjoy !!! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points
