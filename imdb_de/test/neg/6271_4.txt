One of my favorite actors, C. Tom Howell, plays a major role in this bland remake of WOTW. He runs around a lot while a CGI-generated, spider-like machine bypasses and kills everyone. The budget for this was obviously pretty low. It was also one of the asylum productions. Did you see any? Yikes! I'm not sure why anyone could have done this while the cheap Spielberg version destroyed them at the box office. And when the truth is told, none of these versions are so hot. The George Pal version from the 1950s is still the best representation of the H. G. Wells novel, primitive special effects and all. Maybe because Gene Barry was much more convincing than Howell or Tom Cruise at the top.
