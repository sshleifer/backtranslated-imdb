Michael Myers, the confused, not-so-young psychologist who seems to get darker with every performance, is revived by his Druid brothers to endanger his family and anyone else in the way. Gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael, who had originally preferred strangulation and kitchen knives, learns to swing an ax and use the necessary resources to deliver his victims. The result is a dreadful, patchwork dollar store movie that's virtually unsupported by some really spooky sequences. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story so that someone could be billed as a star. You just do not want to cover your eyes during this, but you'll shake your head when John Carpenter's classic creation slips down.
