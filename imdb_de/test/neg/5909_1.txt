Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor have teamed up in this uncompromising comedy about nightclub owners being crushed by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this disgusting ego trip, and therefore blames only himself for his failure. This is a really bad movie so completely devoid of energy and humor that it is just one example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be remarkably easy to continue beating on this film, but I'll show more mercy to him than he showed it to his audience and stop now.
