The Kindred opens for shots of a Porsche racing on a highway, picking up an old pickup truck and being stopped. The driver (Benjamin J. Perry as Ben Perry) calls obscenities and honks as he passes the pickup. Distracted, he sees no obstacle and crashes his Porsche. He is quickly freed from the rubble and taken to a hospital. The Paramedic (Randy Harrington) trying to rescue him suggests he probably will not make it. Then the ambulance is attacked and forced by a van from the street. The driver of transporter Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F. Boeke) strikes the paramedic and steals the patient. Ambulance driver Harry (Charles Grueber) makes no attempt to stop him. Once the injured man is placed in the Van Jackson, he turns his attention to Harry, who seems to know himself. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw the last time. Jackson knocks Harry down and throws him a bundle of money. The film then makes it clear that we are in San Francisco, showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond gets a phone call for her boyfriend dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) awakened to inform him that his mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter), who recently suffered a heart attack, regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called 'Geneticell Corporation', is excited about the news and is on his way to her. Once there, she asks him to return to his old childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all her notes and experiments, especially the "Anthony magazines" Hollins has never heard of before. She also claims that he has a brother named Anthony Back in Geneticell, Hollins speaks with a dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother, since they had worked together before they came into conflict. He asks him about her investigation and if he knows someone named Anthony. He claims he knows nothing. As Amanda after visiting the sinister Dr. Lloyd dies, Hollins decides to execute his mother's request and find out who Anthony is. At the funeral ceremony, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a great admirer of Mother's work and research after she helped her. As Melissa seems to know so much about his mother's work, he invites her into the house as she may be able to help answer the various questions he has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) and a girl with a watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, what were the names) her parents think!?). They come to the point immediately, but find little interest. For some reason, no one here thinks of looking down to the basement, which is as good as something down there, something big, slimy and many tentacles. First, it kills Duke, the dog. Then it goes on to the larger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides that he has to destroy all traces of his mothers and everything that is Anthony. Carpenter, co-written by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, also served as cameraman and Obrow as producer. This is a pretty bad movie in my opinion. The script is credited to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny, and Joseph Stefano, and with five people working on it, I'd like to think they could find something better and more coherent than this one. Nothing is explained so well, why did Amanda create these monstrous hybrids of sea creatures and humans? What is the interest of Dr. Lloyd and his motives? Why does he steal body from ambulance? Why does he have a cellar full of mutants? Why does not one of these so-called genetic researchers believe in checking the cellar? Could Melissa look more suspicious, even if she tried? Why does not any of the characters get background? Why do people always mention a substance found in marine life called Hemocynine when 99.9% of viewers have no idea what it is about? There is also a serious lack of blood and blood, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all scientists survive in a vomiting that leads to a "happy ending". This is a horror movie, all we want to see is the slimy monsters that kill and eat humans in different ways. The death on screen is actually quite cool, someone has slimy tentacles under the skin, in the ear and in the nose, in the movies just a decent horror sequence. To try it out, there's a scene in which Dr. Lloyd experimented on a skinned animal, but it only takes a few seconds and has no bearing on the rest of the film. Melissa also becomes a fish, do not ask. There is no nudity, which is no surprise. The movie looks professional with reasonable production values, but is just so boring and trots at a snail's pace that we see the huge monster in the basement only 15 minutes before the end, which is far too little. Later, when it does have an appearance, that's the effects okay and that's a pity it was not used anymore. All in all, I was very disappointed and expected much better. A horror movie with only one death on the screen and a total of only three. How is the world coming?
