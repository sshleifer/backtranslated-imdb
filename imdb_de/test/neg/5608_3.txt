Simply put, this movie is without any fabric. Take my word for it and save the time it is a complete DUD !! I would say the characters are one-dimensional, but that would mean that there was a kind of character development. I thought Eric Roberts would jump out of B-movie status every second. <br /> <br /> The 70s girl is beautiful ... but if you're not a stalker fan, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie was taken directly to DVD for a reason ... for that reason ... it's a train accident !! !
