The innocent virgin Indri is in a prostitution home run by a reckless pimp MG. Indri is detained in MG's private prison after refusing to love him. Of course, Indri and the secular Top Con Helga team up and plan to escape. Maman Firmansyah's pale, uninspired directing and Piet Burnama's boring, talkative script thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality this film needs to qualify as a gratifying piece of babes-behind-bars-exploitation dirt whatsoever (the girls show during compulsory Group shower scene no skin at all!), The expected tortures and humiliations are both extremely tame and lukewarm, the moderate, sullen blood also does not impress, and even a ridiculous catfight sequence is not the case of anything to look forward to. Thomas Susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the ridiculously mean synchronization, the torturously long run of 102 minutes, the juicy title song and the Cornball score of Gatot Sudarto add further insults to the anxious injury. Only a decent eruption of the last role offers a small relief from the otherwise overly abundant mutilated boredom. A completely yawning dud.
