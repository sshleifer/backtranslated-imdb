On the way home from a day at the beach, four young people seek shelter from a heavy downpour in Lord and Lady Alexander's house after their car runs out of gas. They do not know, but the house they live in is said to be the site of a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only woman in the group, is to be sacrificed. As her male companions rush to her aid, one of them kills Lady Alexander by mistake. Things are really out of control and everyone else attending the Black Mass is also killed. The four try to escape, but soon discover that there is no escape from what they have seen. One by one, they meet their fate. <br /> <br /> Gong in the tragic ceremony, I was sure that I would enjoy it. Slow burning gothic horror is right in my alley. I also like some other movies by Riccardo Freda like The Horrible. Hichcock, The Ghost and I Vampiri. The tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things do not always work the way they should. The biggest tragedy of the tragic ceremony is the time I've watched this mess of a movie. With a few exceptions, the film did not appeal to me or worked for me. The characters are unlikely, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic and the tempo is terrible. There is a subplot about some cursed pearls that leads nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further. Besides, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. When the four leads realized they were in danger, I was far from taking care of myself. And I do not understand the reviews I read and praise the play by Camille Keaton. I think it's a great achievement to think of an emotionless drowsiness as an actor. The three male derivatives are the definition of indefinable. They do nothing to attract attention. The cast includes some genre favorites like Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but no one has anything to do. In fact, Muller's main feature is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film that tries to explain what has happened in the last 80 minutes or so. It's a weak attempt to look up a very weak movie.
