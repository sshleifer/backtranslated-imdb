I expected "Born to Kill" to be a thrilling, exciting film noir. Instead, there are two good action set pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some wonderfully atmospheric movies by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising merit for a noir), but the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psychic kick, but it's a performance that strictly follows the numbers, which mechanically proves what the audience expected after "Dillinger" (an overrated film, but at least better than that). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to appeal to the audience, and the action (as it is) remains so determined in this damn house in San Francisco that the movie becomes claustrophobic rather than truly exciting. It's one of those films in which the supportive players - especially Elisha Cook Jr. (whose homoerotic character of Tierney is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise rather obvious script - and Isabel Jewell play the lead role.) It does not help that almost Half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized psycho-killers on screen in Psycho, Tierneys is so crude and obvious that he could tattoo "PSYCHO" on his forehead A clue to why the source novel was called "Deadlier than the Male" - but perhaps James Gunn has made the female characters stronger and more interesting than in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment to Robert Wise, who already has some quality movies in the movie Bag and would make an outstanding career.
