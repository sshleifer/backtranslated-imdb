If you've seen Pulp Fiction, you will not be able to see this movie. This movie is NOT funny. This is the worst parody movie of all time. This is a bad attempt of parody movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad. The movie is bad. This is one of the worst pictures ever made. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original pulp fiction of the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Plump Fiction is not a good movie. That's not funny. It's so stupid and vulgar.
