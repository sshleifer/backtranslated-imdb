There have been many films on how to live the American dream. And that's one of them. <br /> <br /> First of all, technically a lot is wrong. The sound is bad, I had trouble understanding the dialogues here and there, and the camera positions could have been better. <br /> <br /> They really tried to make a good movie, but for example, the part where they are showing Jonathan in a dream with girls, drugs and alcohol is going to be very bad. Acting is also very bad of all the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time watching them from start to finish and could not wait until the movie was over. <Br /> <br /> If your expectations are low and you feel bored on a Sunday with bad weather, look at this. If you are interested in a deep story of action, this is not your movie. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would not have a score of 1, but 4.5 for this movie. But the reason why I gave him a 1 is because of the bad sound and the use of the camera, not to mention the poorly cut scenes with cheesy effects.
