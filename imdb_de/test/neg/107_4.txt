Horror movie on a low budget. If you do not raise your expectations too high, you will probably enjoy this little movie. The beginning and the end are pretty good, occasionally in the middle, and seem to go nowhere for a long time as we watch the madman's goings on, add the atmosphere, but do not move the action forward. Pretty much blood. I enjoyed the performance of Bill McGhee, credible for such a favorable picture. He has managed to wear the film in times when it did not seem like much. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well, so be prepared to beat her towards the end! It makes some really stupid mistakes, but that makes these low budget movies so good! I would have been outside of this place and five states long before she even thought it might be a good idea to go! If you like this movie, try Committed from 1988, which is basically a rip off of this movie.
