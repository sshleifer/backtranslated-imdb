My mother forced me to watch this movie with her. She will apparently watch everything with a vampire council. I was bored. <br /> <br /> Underworld is reminiscent of: Rise Of The Lycans On Spartacus, The Battle Of The Planet Of The Monkeys, The Passion Of Christ And Mandingo! What reminds me most of all is the Italian swords and sandals of the 1960s (not the good ones), which spend an awful lot of time showing greek or roman despots in robes, while they wait impatiently for the Muscle Man hero and his lover, usually the despot daughter, to do something. <br /> <br /> This movie needed some color and excitement. The characters were pretty two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sets looked like they were made entirely of tin! I wonder how many Civil War chess sets were melted down for this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wears fishnet stockings on their arms and black lipstick can simply click NO.
