Disney-style entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy and stereotypical moralization. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his bad buddy. Laughable special effects. Exaggerating with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the flood? Strange twists and too much negotiation that the Bible does not mention. God as a doubting father, who only needs to be whistled before deciding the world, must be saved from the catastrophe. <br /> <br /> John Irvin, director of B-movie wannabee, adds yet another defeat to his worthless list of ill-advised individuals who lack the storyline and direction.
