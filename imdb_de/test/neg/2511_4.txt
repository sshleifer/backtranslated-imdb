Alien body snatchers in the desert. Small blue rocks that look as if they were made of cheap plastic. The whole plot is not bad if you like it, but the acting is so far beyond the poor that I'm surprised that some of them actually entertain me in The X Files! And the special effects? Hello?! Where did you get your FX crew from Secondary School? I mean, come on; There was so much more that they could have done! It was amateur and extremely easy. I did not really enjoy it (and my dad fell asleep!) And of course our hero falls in love with the lead actress! It is so typical and very predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
