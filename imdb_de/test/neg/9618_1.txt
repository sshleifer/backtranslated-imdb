The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was created very badly. The mastering engineer must either have been drunk, slept or not even in the room while he was done. It looks like it's been made from a tenth generation, and about half of the movie's audio sync disappears. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the sound. If you are considering buying this DVD, please save your money. I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1973. Also the VHS copy of this movie titled "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining minutes of the movie are "missing". Where is the original camera negative?
