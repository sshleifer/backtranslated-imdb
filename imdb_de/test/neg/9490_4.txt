Daft potboilers do not get much, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that fixes everything. Except in this case not. Based on a mysterious novel by the devout Lloyd C Douglas (he wrote "The Robe"), which was filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, he has more lift than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant Playboy, who is not only responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow, but is later directly responsible for the accident that causes her to lose her sight. To make amends, he takes the medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, it's not that stupid, he had planned to become a doctor before he became an arrogant playboy). In the meantime, they fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Try to find the redeeming social commentary and criticism of American customs that should lie just below the surface of Sirk's films. this one is not too deep). On the plus side, Rock Hudson is not half bad (I think I'll find it rediscovered), and of course it looks great (in Sirk's films, people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). Nothing in this film fits in with the best of his later work, and even with soap operas, this is definitely a daytime television.
