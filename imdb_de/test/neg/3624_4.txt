This was another of those shows I watched to eradicate the positive elements and because I've been a pitch fan for years. Some of them were stage sets, B-Plots, guest stars and some of the leading actors who were good. I tried high school on the show when I quickly went to Jamie Spears, along with the other chicks on the show who can not act. The only characters I seemed to like were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael, and Logan. Quinn is a perfect outsider who fits in at some point. Stacey is an absolute idiot. Dustin goes through a series of strange, random situations. and Michael is a kind of comic relief from Logan. There is a notable difference between the performance and acting quality of the B-actions they are involved in and the A-actions, where a bunch of screeching girls and an iconic "Miss Perfect" were shown. This show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the minor plots, but the main plots just do not deliver. When it came back in reruns recently and I tried to see it again, I was more dizzy about the girls' vile drama and had to change channels. However, I will credit the previously listed characters because they were more or less worth the show.
