The film begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) during the break. Within two weeks they fall in love (!). But he has to go to war and she has to go to college. But they stay in touch by writing each other. Then the 11th of September happens. He wants to re-list - she wants him to stay home. What are you going to do? <br /> <br /> Hysterically bad romantic drama. The lines are attractive - Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he has run out of water without a shirt after surfing) ... but he can not act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is awful. When I saw it, I and a friend of mine struggled hard not to laugh out loud in a "romantic" dialogue at the beginning. It was just awful. For the first hour I was either bored with the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the terrible "romance". After that first hour, there is a tragedy, and I have to admit, I had tears in me. However, the filmmakers do everything to ensure that you cry before death, funerals, and meetings with people who cry. How can you NOT cry? That would have worked if the drama was better. Tatum's face never changes his expression - not once! He always had a blank face on his face. Seyfried was a little bit better, but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sex chemistry on the screen at all! They hardly looked as if they liked each other, let alone love each other. There were some nice photos of the Carolinas, but this is a boring and stupid romantic "drama". A 1 across the board ... and I usually love stupid romantic dramas like these!
