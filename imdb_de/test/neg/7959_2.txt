I am a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, her film lacks all that is needed for a good movie. The film seeks to show the plight of widows in India in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas for their rehabilitation at about the same time. Presented with a child widow as a central character, although the plot was too banal from the Indian point of view, it could still have been a very powerful movie. Oh! The film lacked both the sensitivity of the fire and the intensity of the emotions in Earth 1947. <br /> <br /> Although it is believed that history is a matter of course, although there are hundreds of things I would have liked differently Well, the filming is especially unfortunate. Everything is said. Everything is being shown. Lack of sensitive implied sentences. Missing things were not said. I just could not believe that this was a Deepa Mehta movie. <br /> <br /> There were some very typical Hindi movie characters - like an old widow with her own interests or a father who has two standards of the highest quality. Can not write a script without these old Indian movie characters in the old style? Many people have praised Deepa for making a film and proving against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that she took a bold step, but should not you worry about the quality of the film, or is it controversial to be an end in itself? It's obvious that if you start with a story like Water, you end up considering the pain of the widows - it takes no savvy director to do that. And the movie had nothing more than that !! So where's Deepa's contribution to the movie? <br /> <br /> And talking about acting, etc. - miserable !!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, a very pretty face - but that's the end of it. She can not speak Hindi. She can not give in. John Abraham is not better. Most widows are unnatural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the young girl. They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And this was an epoch movie - but the Hindi dialogues are shit. Even there, utterance is as unnatural as it gets. No rustic accents !!! No local slang. No nothing. The only correct one was probably the film locations. I thought the Vidhwa Ashram phrase was reasonably real. The blue tint in the entire film is also true. <br /> <br /> But do not look at this movie. You will not get anything. There is nothing in the story or direction. If you have to see it, pay attention to the acting of the little girl.
