Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it could have been almost impossible to do anything wrong. Of course, it has a few funny moments - the scene in the showers, in which Robbie Coltraine Lon Chaney Jr.'s creepy "I can not help myself" tune line sounds, is weird. But after all, action, script, and direction are as flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90-year-old nun after 180 "Ave Maria." When I was a kid, carry-on movies filled this niche a bit better, which is a really sad charge of a movie with such a promising cast.
