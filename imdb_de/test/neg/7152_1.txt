If this movie comes to a theater near you, consider it as a threat. I had the misfortune to see this movie here in Tokyo. Being a Dutchwoman, I was surprised to find a Dutch movie in a metropolis like Tokyo. I figured it would have to be something special if a Dutch movie made it all the way to Japan. So I went there with some friends and we happily told the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out, this was one of the most infantile, silly, stupid, worst, worst English movies I've seen in maybe ten years, and I left the theater to shun the staff of this disaster movie. Sometimes you get the feeling that you know what the director was aiming for: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting like a movie. Instead, it was more MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. But if I was not annoyed too much, the film was now and then unintentionally funny because it showed Holland from its smallest side.
