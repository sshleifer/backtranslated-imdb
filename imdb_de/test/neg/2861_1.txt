This seemed to be very similar to the CHILD'S PLAY films, except that it was much worse. A lawyer tries to rescue a criminal convicted of murdering his son from execution. She fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet the murderer has buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. After severely injuring several people, they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll and saying she did not hurt anyone. In this movie, I've always wondered: Why am I looking at this shit? over and over. The end was so bad that I saw the Disney cartoon version right after and slept with the lights on.
