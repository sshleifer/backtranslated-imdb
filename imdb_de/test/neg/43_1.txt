I was totally bored with this movie, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Everything gets so serious and people swear by really stupid expressions. Then there is a serial killer who can apparently kill a person to get the title of serial killer. Well, the serial killer likes butterflies and is exemplified by sound effects that you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern movies. <br /> <br /> Why? Why? I have no idea. It really wants to be scary, but I think in this universe it's scary to tell a lot of people and add dark ambient sounds. Really filmmakers have to do their homework today before they make "horror movies" or at least call a movie a "horror movie". It makes me say (ironically, ironically too): "Acolyte, you take forever to say nothing."
