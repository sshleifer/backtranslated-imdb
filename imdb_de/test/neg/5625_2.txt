What a cruelty. I'm not the one who demands absolute accuracy from a movie, but the plot and script of "Killing Zoe" are so artless that I contracted through the entire (mercifully brief) ninety minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews will have found out the story by now: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with American safecracker Zed, is also a bank employee who will help Zed find a Bastille Steal day robbery. <br /> <br /> The film puts credibility right from the start. Zed and Zoe's Night of Magic is extremely prosaic, and Zoe's claim to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime seems to reflect the screenwriter's long-lived teenage fantasies more than any other chemical chemistry on the screen. Zed's utter indifference as his friend Eric Zoe throws out of the hotel room barely sets the stage for her later strong bond. <br /> <br /> In Act Two, Erics Gang of Bohemians - Drug-Dependent Losers Leading a Marginal Life Of Little Crime - Prepare for their big raid with a night in the city. Here, Roger Avary's main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread is convincing us (through endless repetition) that Eric is really happy to see his old friend Zed again. Really happy. Eric's devilish caring, exaggerated extravagance, and affection for Zed are not nearly credible. For example, look at how he discovered a dead cat in his apartment house. The development of the characters that will accompany us through the rest of the movie is a reflection. <br /> <br /> The robbery is a disaster - understandable, as the plan is ridiculous and the criminals are complete amateurs. Here Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino, showing that he can be more violent than violent. In reality, it is just boring than boring. To build up the excitement, an extra guard is hidden in the vault. It was boring in video games, and now it's boring. Zoe is taken hostage during the robbery, but despite our expectation that she will play a key role, she is simply sitting pretty. Or more precisely, Avary can not do anything with her. In the last five minutes, she literally comes alive, stops the hostage-taking, and saves the grateful, but she still stuns Zed from the aftermath of his crime. Why she does not mind being involved in the crime or why she cares about him at all is impossible to say. After all, she had no chance to see that he was more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is thoroughly dull and spurious. Much of it is in French. As a native speaker, I can confirm that it does not even sound true from a distance. Eric's sugar-sweet discourse, which quickly alternates with hard people, is said to be alternately charming and scary, but is instead only tearing. Meanwhile, his accomplices of timidity are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric gets knocked down in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the hostages of a bank, we'll soon be freed from this miserable ordeal.
