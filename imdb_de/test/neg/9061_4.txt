I'm a fan of the old SCTV show of the late 70's and early 80's, and John Candy was the main reason for that. He was very funny from the wall, and he was just funny. Unfortunately, he could not play these roles in the movies. Again and again I was disappointed with the mediocre movies in which he almost played the "straight" role instead of the funny guy. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comedic skills or those of Harold Ramis. It's just a very predictable movie of cops and robbers. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, the movie is available. Just do not expect much to laugh.
