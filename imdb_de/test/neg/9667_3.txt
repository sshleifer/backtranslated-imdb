The anti-social feeling that can be found in a Cheech And Chong material is something weird. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wished that more songs would start like that these days. But in this excuse for a video, the Stoner duo shows us the videos for four songs on their current album, including Get Out Of My Room. They hear a voice-over during the opening credits, in which an anonymous producer calls the record a novelty that only takes up space in the charts. Unfortunately, this first voice-over hits the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> Most RIAA-recommended music recordings seem to follow the rule of getting the best footage into the album early on. When you pass this first song, the demanding listener often notices that the recording has little or nothing to offer. Bands that opposed the mainstream convention, however, often kept their best material to the end or at least spread it evenly throughout the CD. In this case, Cheech And Chong seem to have decided to hedge their bets. The opening track "Get Out Of My Room" is a funny song with an unbelievably bad video. For many observers of a music video from the 80s, the sloppy direction is a bit nostalgic. Cheche's concept of the British punks is also hilarious. <br /> <br /> Where it goes downhill is the second number, I'm Not Home Right Now. There's nothing to interest in a song that's as good as repetition, and it's hard to be more repetitive than this Aural Turd. Honestly, you feel the need to slap Cheech in the face and tell him that we have the idea that he is not home now, so please move on. The next song, besides the theme that love is a weird thing, is the absolute low not only for this collection, but for Cheech And Chong in general. It's almost as if this song was made for the sole reason of blowing out the album's runtime. Thankfully, the Stoner duo saved the best in the end, but it's also curious that Chong is perfect. This cut is missing. Born In East L.A. is a simple number based on the old Bruce Springsteen number mocking Reagan's view of multiculturalism. As you learn from Cheche's story, you have to wonder how many poor people who could not speak a word of Spanish were deported to Mexico just because their skin was not white. Racism was and still is an integral part of American culture in 1985. If anything, it has gotten worse, so you have to wonder what Born In East LA would look like if it were written in the current era. Unfortunately, two cuts do not make an album, especially when there's so much boring filler between them. For example, the interviews before Get Out Of My Room are pretty funny. Not how many of Up In Smoke split sideways, but funny enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their making-of material. Boring song makes boring filler. If you cut out the middle half an hour of material from this video, you have something much better. <br /> <br /> I rated Get Out Of My Room three out of ten. They are earned through the first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars are looking at the material today and wondering what they think.
