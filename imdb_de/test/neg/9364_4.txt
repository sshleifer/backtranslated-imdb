Today's film class was The Legend of the Suram Fortress. In the 87 minutes, he quickly got into my five most difficult films of all time. That's hard to see; Films that are so different from all others that you see something completely alien. A brief summary would be that a group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves against intruders, but every time they're about to graduate, they collapse for no apparent reason. They go to a fortune-teller advising them that if they want to keep the fortress they have to find a boy, a big, blond-blue boy who will be buried in one of the walls during construction and his presence will make sure that the construction work will be completed smoothly. And in those closing moments, he likes to be smeared with cement and eggs and giggles while buried alive. Only his mother mourns. <br /> <br /> It's actually a pretty simple story. But director Sergo Paradjanov, who worked in Soviet Georgia in 1984 and not too long after leaving fifteen years in prison, does not follow any of the rules of filmmaking we're used to. There are only a few close-ups. Very often, the action we have to follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a landscape shot, which is usually easy to miss. There are very few close-ups and sometimes it's hard to tell who has what to do and why. Every now and then, the film goes on excursions that have no meaning for the main presentation and usually confuse the viewer. The music is totally crazy, with found sounds, on screen instruments and church organs, which were seemingly randomly recorded. In times when seemingly nothing happens, someone breaks into a device and plays almost to the next scene. Angry, however, is an obvious film voice behind it, so you try to understand the message. Once, when your eyes are glued to the screen just because you can not believe what you see.
