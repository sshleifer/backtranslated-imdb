Sure, you see some fools, but if you look for anything in a movie, you get more miles on Youtube. I just paid a dollar from Redbox because I saw Val Kilmer's name. Bad train. The plot did not thicken, the dialogue was bad, the characters at best undeveloped. Someone said the cinematography was okay but did not expect too much. This movie moved very slowly and ended without grace. Blacklist. I have spent much of the movie wondering if an event or a color scheme of things is symbolic. I never rewound to find out, because in the end nothing was explained. No twists There were also many questions that, as it turned out, had no desire to hear answers. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
