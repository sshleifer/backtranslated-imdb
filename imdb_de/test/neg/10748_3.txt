There are places for political commentary in the movie, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get enough of it from Newsweek and every other editorial in the paper. Now I have to see that in horror movies? Come on! All I wanted was a good zombie-lock movie, no more "Bush is bad!" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, then let him go on Air America. And if you have to insist on making a "message" movie, be a little smarter. This had the hint of being hit in the face with a dead fish. By the way, Joe, do you really want the left voice block to be associated with brain-dead zombies? You may want to think about it before you make another political horror movie (God help us).
