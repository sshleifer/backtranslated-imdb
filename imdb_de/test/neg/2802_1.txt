I was in blockbuster and saw a movie called Dark Harvest. The cover looked great, the plot was not so bad and the slogan (you reap what you sow) made the movie look pretty good. But that day I was stupid because I did something I should never have done. I rented a "Straight To Video Independent Horror" movie. I went out with my much better tenants, went home, dropped Dark Harvest into the DVD player and it started. I thought I would see the trailer after the movie was finished (BAD IDEA). NOW for the meeting. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First of all, the acting of the "kids" is shitty and the scene in which the 2 (main characters) speak, the lighting sucks and the buildings even seem fake. Now they go to this house where relatives of Sean Connel (I think he's the main character, I do not care) have lived. Suddenly they are all killed by ... (panting) A KILLER SCARECROW !!!! Ahhh !!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of a low budget, and the scenes in which the scarecrow is computer-controlled seem so fake that they are weird. It makes dinosaur sounds and everything! And then in the end ... they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (which for God's sake is red and looks like it was bought from a local family dollar) and it stops for a while and then ..... (panting) BLOWS UP !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save your time, I'll tell you, this movie is shit. If you need an hour and a half, look at the wall, because a look at the wall is fun compared to this disaster. It's pretty funny though. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F If there was something lower ** F - ** then I would give it.
