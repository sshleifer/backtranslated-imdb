Am I the only one who thought the point in this movie was graphic violence? I did not know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented him, and would not have if I'd known most of his previous films were horror movies. I'm not into it at all, I just expected an informative docudrama from the 9/11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing for me was that I wanted to read the report to find out what this movie was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because I'm shocked that we've become so insensitive to violence in movies and on television that it was not even worth the bloggers whose reviews I've read.
