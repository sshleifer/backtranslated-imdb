I do not leave any IMDb comments on movies, but that .... this movie was bad. very bad. I made the most of it quickly and stopped where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, just to continue the fast-forward. Formula plot: Once the obvious killers were strangled, there was only one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene, it felt like I'd read the script once, because there were no surprises, no secret. The Tori character ... bad acting. A real waste of time on DVD and a final option "Let's go to bed early", if that's the only thing on TV. If you watch this movie, you will find that you can never get back the time you have just wasted.
