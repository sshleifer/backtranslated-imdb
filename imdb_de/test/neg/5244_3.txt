Another B-movie for teenagers, based mainly on CGI effects, industrial soundtrack and some medieval images. It is a pity that the legend of Beowulf is used in such an uninspired way. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit that he's getting worse and worse as an actor and his films. Rent it if you are just a teenager.
