Before I saw this movie, I understood that it would be a low budget Gore movie. But even at these low standards, this movie does not cut it off. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers were on a low budget or had bad acting, writing, directing, sound, music and editing. I expected all this to be bad, and that's it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it did not even do a good job out of the gut. Most of the action takes place off-screen, and all we see is the after-effects, which are very fake - even to the standards of low-budget Gore movies. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse that the trouble is so bad. At about the same time, Peter Jackson made the equally low budget "Bad Taste," and he was somehow able to make more convincing brains than was shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Failure of almost every one of us can not recommend this movie to anyone. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> <br />
