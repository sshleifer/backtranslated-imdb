Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid I will not do that. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn it off because of the rejection in the middle of the movie. Too much time is spent crying and emotional chaos, and the point where the Bullock character is devastated by her divorce is rammed into the head of the observer. Enough now!! And why did not we learn more about her ex-husband? He is shown only as a suit that comes by now and then. Something had to make her marry him, what was that? What's wrong with him that has devastated her after her divorce? You could spend more time than another shot of Bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is stale, clich√©d and horrible, similar to those stupid "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something. There is no imagination or creativity in this film, everything is very predictable and therefore boring. This movie also goes into the cutsiness factor, very silly and not funny as it should be! This is just one of those terrible movies "I'm a Woman, Hear Me Roar," similar to "Waiting To Exhale." If you want to see "I'm a woman, hear me roar" movies that are really entertaining, original and well done, then check out "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this crap !! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
