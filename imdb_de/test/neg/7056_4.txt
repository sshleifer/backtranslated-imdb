'Nuff said. A covert policeman from the state capital is sent to a small county in which the moonshine run is rampant. In the end, he is run by some local hicks who have no idea he is an undercover cop (so they just go as weird as ever). He is soon looked after by a woman and her three daughters, all wearing low-cut tops and short shorts (I must love the 70s). He falls in love with one of the girls, but in the meantime he still has to figure out who makes the moonlight and goes to the local bars and restaurants. He also has to deal with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who thinks he is the lunar Sagittarius because he's new to the city. <br /> <br /> Life in the small town in the 70s. YEE HAAAAAAAAAA.
