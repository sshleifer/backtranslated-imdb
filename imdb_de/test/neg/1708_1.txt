As an indie filmmaker, I try to make at least a decent movie. This piece of ____ was above the low budget. It was shot on video and not at least 24P Mini-DV. The look and feel of it was just Baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at the ShowBiz Expo in LA, and he talked about this book, Filmmaking for Dummies, which he put together. I thought this little video would be something, but I guess I was wrong. He could have slightly increased the value by shooting 16mm film instead of this horrible video. The plot was as stupid as the acting and the whole fake green screen and the sound and the whole nine meters. I had the choice to rent a movie tonight and made the wrong decision. Damn it!!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a fucking movie. Maybe the director should read real movie books about filmmaking and not try to cut the corners when trying to make a cheap movie. Maybe he should learn from the masters, make the Night of the Living Dead, and see The Evil Dead and Chain Massacre. just to name a few of the all-time low budget hits. This is a video that should have been dead. I can not call it a movie because it did not use a movie.
