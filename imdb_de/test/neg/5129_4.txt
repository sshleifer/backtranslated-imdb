Spoiler, attention !!! Flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion. Some things confuse me about it (for example, Jeanie Alex asks how long it took her to dance so well; Alex replies "Over 25," should Alex not be 18?) And some things fascinate me ( I loved the twists!). Overall, it fascinated me. When this movie was made, I was not even born. I did not really experience the eighties (I was born in '85), and I have to ask myself: sometimes Alex just walked around a bit or threw himself everywhere, was not really dancing, just poked things and threw them in the head wave back and wave with the poor - was that then considered "dancing"? If so, I'm not sure I would have liked it. The twists, the flip and the flowing movements were great, but some of it - my neighbor's toddler could have done better! If Alex is a welder during the day, would not she be tired after a hard day's work? If she does not go to work for almost a week, will not she be released? I live in a warehouse - I can almost see it, but not quite. It does not seem right that she is a welder, owns a warehouse AND tries to get into ballet. None of that really makes sense. I should not be too valuable given my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I do not know. But in any case, they could have chosen a better actress. The actors were fine. I even liked the romance. You make your own decision. But mine is rented, do not see it again - it's not worth it.
