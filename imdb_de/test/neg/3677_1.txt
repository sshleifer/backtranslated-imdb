Wow ... where do I start? I rented this movie because it sounds like I'm interested. With a name like Val Kilmer in this movie, I thought how bad could it be? This must be the worst movie I have ever seen, with such a big name. I was wondering why it had slipped through the cracks, and I never could remember it when it first came out. It starts off pretty well and reminds a bit of the intro sequence in the Borough identity, but after about 30 minutes it gets worse and then ventures into WTF land. If you have not seen it yet, do yourself a favor and do not rent or buy it, unless you're a masochist or looking for any movie from Val Kilmer. There are many more titles that will earn your time more. This movie (if you can call it that) is a waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
