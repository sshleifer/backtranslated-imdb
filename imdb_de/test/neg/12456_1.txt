I will not even waste any more time to describe how bad this movie is. Conclusion: It was terrible, had huge action holes and went absolutely NOWHERE. The only good thing was the description my digital cable made for the movie: "A married man with a troublesome business has an affair with his secretary." Huh ?? Wrong movie, apparently, though it could have made things a little more interesting if one of the descriptions was true. <br /> <br /> - Shelly
