The honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (as Eric Gregg) is optimistic but poor. His wife, Sheila Bromley (as Nona Gregg) designs, longs for the beautiful things in life. Ms. Bromley describes herself as "not burdened with tons of justice," and starts spending more than Mr. Reagan deserves. Bromley gets the finer points in life, but the couple is in debt. Bromley is a joker. <br /> <br /> Handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as cheeky co-worker Gloria Blondell (as Patricia Carmody); but he does not treat himself. To pay the bills, Bromley gets tangled up in insurance fraud - which helps to fire her husband. An unemployed Reagan seems to be seduced into a criminal life - does he stay upright or crooked? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene. *** Accidents Will Happen (1938) William Clemens - Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell
