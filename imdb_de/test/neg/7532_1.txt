This is a really bad movie. That may seem like a simplification. An erratic, childlike response, akin to an insignificant unfounded insult. The truth is, there is not enough that I can say about the confusing, pointless conspiracy, the really cruel spectacle (I'm talking evil), or the random images of violence against women that make up the chaotic devil of radically horrifying films. Make mistakes that drive this affront to everything that is good and decent in the world of cinema, even human culture. Please, take my word for it, never look at it. I'm serious. Stop. You will thank me later.
