When I heard that they were doing that, I was pretty happy, considering that the first movie was pretty good, albeit a little too short. I look at you Little mermaid 2). Anyway, I saw it and unfortunately was very disappointed. The best part is that the animation is outstanding. It really has the special shine that the "real" Disney movies have. Apart from that ... the rest is disappointing. The story is serious everywhere. In a moment it's about something, then it becomes completely different and then a completely different story. It reminded me that the Family Guy movie was like three separate episodes turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> I may have laughed at most once. Kronk was very funny in the original movie, but in this case he is just not funny. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie unless someone gives it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
