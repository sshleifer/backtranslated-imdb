I should explain that this shutter makes a head over The Grudge and Dark Water as long as this trend applies to Asian horror movies, though it still does not achieve the same atmospheric creep that The Ring sets up. <br /> <Still there are films like life not in a vacuum and are therefore compared to other suspense / thriller / horror movies. To be honest, I'm not writing a long synopsis here and I'm going to say that this movie tries to rely on music-driven "frightening" horrors rather than the atmosphere, and the "mind" itself is really not that remarkable. The plot is pretty simple and predictable and is nothing special. While there are some exciting scenes that are creatively scary, the movie is pretty pretty for the most part. If you enjoyed The Grudge and it is the same, then you could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> degrees: C-
