How was this movie done in the name of decency? <br /> <br /> Subtitles are thought to be "awful" for each and every picture of this really gritty effort. <br /> <br /> Horrifying spectacle, terrible dialogue and lack of talent from all involved nightmare makes for a terrific 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall impression? <br /> <br /> A bunch of excited drama students got lucky with a lottery scholarship and made one of the most painful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This makes Hammer Horror TV series look like an Oscar material. <br /> <br /> And do not think for a moment that this falls into the category "that bad is good". It's not that bad. <br /> <br /> But the fart scene is probably worth a different look.
