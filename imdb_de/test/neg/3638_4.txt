I've seen this program a few times and the more you see about it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was approached for this fact because she's Britney's sister, and I'm sorry to say that's obvious on the show. They've created the character Zoey to be anything people want to believe, that Jamie Lynn is smart, original, smart, pretty, popular, and so on, as she is, more of a boy than she wanted. There's nothing original about it and it's filled with money, so every kid has the coolest fashions and things there. I must also say, for a 13-year-old girl (or how old she is, can not be much older), she wears very mature clothes, these short skirts are too short, and young people want to wear them wearing this make-up to the rising problems of why young girls get so much trouble. The only thing I want to say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, given her age, is not bad, much better than her sister when it comes to vocal ability. Sorry, it's too mature and yet too stupid. It's bad with predictable storylines and there are far too many clich√©s.
