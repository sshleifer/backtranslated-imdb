It must be said something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular one being shown. <br /> <br /> The "square" is populated by such a miserable, unreliable, amoral, hateful, relentless group of characters as you can imagine. Everybody pushes someone in the back, everyone tries to commit adultery, everyone tries to cheat someone. That or they are stabbed, cuckolded or cheated. Nobody is happy. Nobody laughs. Nobody has an incredible stroke of luck or a really nice day. It's hell with cockney accents. I suspect this program must be sponsored by the Samaritans. It is perfect for those affected. It does not cheer her up; What she does is a whole fellowship of such an endlessly desperate sad donkey that audiences are convinced that their lot could be really worse - they could live on 'Albert Square'; As a representation of London's Ostend, it is pure Hokum. The programmers were obviously never in town. The first thing you encounter on Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this pretty well defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a scattered and rapidly declining minority. A major ad now near the Bow Road overpass, sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care, states that "eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor faster." Ten healthy, smiling faces shine down on the viewer for confirmation. Eight of them are dark-skinned ... <br /> <br /> Also a few years ago I worked with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon - dare I say 'pukka' - Cockneys. And I can tell you that I had a horrible racist experience that I've never experienced before. Every day was like a rally by Oswald Moseley. They could not last five minutes without denigrating any race or nationality other than their own, in repulsive and repulsive terms. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' Fackin 'Maceroons' were the little change in the conversation. In fact, their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixed on genitals and their application. Alf Garnett was by comparison a model of liberal virtue. <br /> <br /> Any program that was supposed to represent the East Caucasians living in London in their true nature would be totally inappropriate for a broadcast - even after the 9 o'clock clock. Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you're somewhere near the mark. But if they were not die-hard fetishists, they were at least extremely happy. <br /> <br /> I do not know how such a soap opera came about. This imaginary daring island of white misery has absolutely no influence on the real culture. And if you are comparatively confident, you will quickly become the tears of sorrow. Comparatively ordinary actors who pretend to be comparatively ordinary chronic depressives with cockney accents - what's the point of that? Dull, dreary, relentlessly disillusioning and ethnically absurd. The most popular program of a seemingly sick and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague.
