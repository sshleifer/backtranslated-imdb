The credits are from Sandy Frank's Stitching Job, which was made to make Cave Dwellers available for re-release from this film. Now that's clear ... oh! Tormenting, painful eyes. Blade Master shamelessly jumps on the sword and sorcery bandwagon that started with the Conan flicks ... except that the band wagon never left the garage anyway. As such, this Italian film is a doodle trying to break a blockbuster, with predictable results. However, this would pay too little tribute to the director and the authors who make no effort to maintain coherent conspiracy, continuity, and any semblance of timely continuity. Miles O'Keefe is not a leading man now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved that if Ator did not). Only an unlikely picture and a laborious work.
