At first, I was not sure who the film was for - it seemed to be a story for kids, but they had stuff kids would not understand and be bored with. It was not really busy, Bruce Willis was not stretched as an actor at all. With his half smile, he looked a lot to the side - unless you are a big fan of him, I would not bother. And if it's the story you're interested in (a guy who seems to have everything, but is emotionally lacking, is being taught by a kid), I would visit About A Boy. It has everything this movie lacks, humor, sadness and reality.
