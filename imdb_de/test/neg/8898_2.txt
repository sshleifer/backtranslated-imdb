Although I rarely agree with Filmkr√∂nikan, I have to say that while this film is not terrible, it did not interest me at all ... and everything just seemed out of place ... it had its moments ... three or three four that made me giggle ... but mostly I just sat and wondered why? Why did the characters do that? Even Hot Shots characters felt more thoughtful and sophisticated ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice Norrlands movie, then check out Pistvakt. There were more than just random ethnic groups shooting at each other on the Swedish tundra ... <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed ...
