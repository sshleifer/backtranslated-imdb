Well, I would probably agree with all the bad comments on this movie because I thought it was such a bitch. I mean, the actors had a horrible acting job and the script was all awful. The special effects were not bad, but I think that would have thought much more. I mean, how was it possible that Clara Bryant was successfully included in this film? I mean, she'd do a lot better looking a little farther, and with Kristen darling defending herself, I mean, it must be a total joke. She should at least do much better than what she would call a soldier, or heroine, or bravery. But the point is that the actors did a completely soulless, lousy job, just like the director and author who made that movie. You should have gone to film school to come up with some better ideas, and I hope everyone agrees with my methods, as they probably think the same thing.
