A couple of friends and I visited the video store a few years ago and we were in one of those moods to rent a few cheesy, unseen movies. My friend grabbed the head of the family and we were greeted by a head in a wheelchair. Well that made us laugh and we decided to make a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay the movie. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life. We came home and put it on and rolled around on the floor, laughing about 45 minutes because it was the funniest movie in the world. I do not remember much about it, but one thing I remember was that the blond girl pulled it on every 5 minutes with a guy in the back of a shop. This head made me laugh and when I look at people's comments on this movie, I laugh even more. The head of the family is so good and the head is funny and still laughs ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
