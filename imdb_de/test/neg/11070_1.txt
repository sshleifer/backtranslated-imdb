If I could give this excuse for a movie a 0 or a negative rating, I would do that. I was dumb enough to pick up this DVD in the store, read the blurb and think, that sounds pretty good, I'll spend 10 pounds and buy them. All I got in the end was a 10-pound saucer. Absolutely terrible, I do not know where to start. I have no idea why someone gave more than 2 stars because I can not think of anything good, which I can say. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically 7 people go into an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. Nobody else knows they are there. When they come into the cave, they can not come out and are gradually killed by a monster. There is no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has some demons from the past in which his ex-girlfriend drowned in a cave 2 years ago ... There also seems to be no reason for it. I suppose it's just a nonsense in character building. Anyway, the monster is a guy who walked into the cave as a normal little kid and spent his whole life there. This makes him a superhuman being able to glow, to see in the dark, to take bullets, to breathe underwater, to be in two places at the same time and to be crazy (able to move boulders, adult men as dead weight to wear etc.). <br /> <br /> In the final scene there are still 2 women alive, they wake up naked, covered only with a little carpet. You will then find a picture of a child. The monster then bursts in the door, wrapped in a rug with a kind of animal skull over his head (says in the commentary of the directors, it would be a skull skull if this was the frekin biggest crow I've seen in my life) and literally "Raaahhh" like a kid on Halloween. I saw it with my friend and at that point he literally broke out. The guy then sees a picture of himself as a child and has a flashback while sitting under a tree and his face burned, then gets up and wanders into the cave. That's the extent of the background story of why he maims people, and you feel a bit cheated on a story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other to finish the credits. I know that the rape scene was shocking, but as a woman, I just felt sick and was what touched me the most throughout the movie. He could have killed and cut her and eaten her, and it would have been less terrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that end up going unanswered. Apart from all this, the scenes where there were minutes in which there were only black and nothing were annoying, and the constant disgusting camera angles where everything is turned upside down and you can not see what is going on have me at one point so upset I almost turned it off. An absolutely terrible movie. You might as well get the money you would spend on it, and set it on fire, it would be better money, as a smart guy who wrote about me said: once you've looked at it, you can not more watching it.
