If you are an insomniac and can not sleep, I definitely recommend this movie. If you rent it for any other reason ... DONT! ... this movie is by far one of the slowest moving turtle motivated movies I've ever seen. The only reason I rented it was because my brother wanted it for a strange and strange reason. I can not write about this movie anymore ... IF IT'S ME AWAY !!!!!!!!
