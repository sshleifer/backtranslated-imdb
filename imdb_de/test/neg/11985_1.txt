Obviously, this would have had a potential in more capable hands, but given the success story of Uwe Boll, it would have been surprising if there had been merit for this farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the dreadful one-liners delivered by GI Joe soldiers feel like they're being brought into the same genre by another company. <br /> <br /> If you leave the movie at this point, do yourself a favor. You have already passed all the highlights and you have spared the suffering of going through some of the worst acting in recent history. <br /> <br /> Enter as an absolute nonsense talent. The leading man has the same charisma that you will find in the garden snail. <br /> <br /> There is an awkward piece of contrived romance - this feels so wrong that you can only speculate why this scene was summoned in the first place. Usually, the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to add some humanity and sympathy to the otherwise cut out cardboard figures - here it beats down on all cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action is incredibly boring. Where other classics, despite budget constraints, show originality and imagination, everything seems to have been spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There are not any redeeming features here - not even the "it's so bad" is almost good. "It's just bad and in a bad way. <br /> <br / > Our hero questions the starlet about the night they spent together and how they would classify him, giving them 2 out of 10. I give the whole thing 1 (I would have gone for 0, if that had been possible). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this dribbling, there's a lot of crap out there, which surpasses that ridiculous rumble in the jungle Oh, and finally, the movie with the popular game Far Cry has little to no nothing to do (at best it is extremely easy) on it. <br /> <br /> Terrible, join in!
