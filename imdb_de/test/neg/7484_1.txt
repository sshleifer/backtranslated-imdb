I often do not feel strong enough to post about a movie. This was just the worst movie I've ever seen. The performances were ridiculous at best, in the worst case they were well, there is no other word for it, terrible. Especially the female lead actress, who has arbitrary sexual occasions, must be seen and heard to be believed. Honestly, the plot is nonsensical, the dialogue is scary and the characterization ... there is none. I'm surprised it's not an Alan Smithee movie. I can not stress that enough ... avoid it at all costs. How are films like this ever made? This is not a budget where the movie is worst.
