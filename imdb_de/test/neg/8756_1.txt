A majority of the 80-year low-budget bouts created exclusively for video are always stinking worse than slippery old socks. This extravagant and amateurish no-budget Chicago set bargain basement "Nasty Necrophiliac Nusscase" on the loose "bloodbath" serves as an oppressive confirmation of this cross-border fact: A bearded, ragged, long-haired, pearl-flowered shirt with wild-eyed hippo. Fruitcake starts off with your usual cruel killing spree and graphically kills libidinal young couples who engage in strenuous mansonsque insanities of exhausting coitus. (Hmm, do I recognize a rather obvious and self-righteous Puritan message "having sex and dying"? man, man.) Boy, this mentally unbalanced disease is a real way Puppy: after the knife of his female victim, our certified cracker killer loves to love his freshly killed bodies. (WARNING: Possible * SPOILER * advance .. ) Towards the end of the painting, the corpse on the corpse is roughly interrupted by the policemen rade does the unthinkable with a Cuban carcass, causing the evil-smelling pervert to start with an understandably painful attack and deafening scream "Nooo!") Well, is not this gonzo guy definitely a sweetie and a half? <br /> <br /> Too bad that this movie is doing so badly. If it had only been done with a touch of flair and skill, it could have been a shabby little gem of a horror exploitation object. Sadly, Wally Koz's shock-proof director, Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth's stubborn static and immovable cinematography, Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez's fade, monotonously head-hugging "Hard Rock," the pathetically cheap and unconvincing make-up F / X, flat , noticeably restless plywood that acts as a disgusting thumb and unsightly non-pro-casts, lethargic tempo (too much screen time gets tired of the dirty police efforts to catch the Wacko), a particularly lame "surprise ending" (Die The true identity of the Mystery Killer will surely make you groan), the equally boring, incessantly brimming and positively formed characters and a steady sequence of boring softcore sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two thugs for 90 minutes straight all together make a profoundly foul and unaufwendige saggy, wet noodle of a dry clinker. However, to be honest, this film has one outstanding virtue: The Insane Butcher certainly has a great taste in tropical-haggard Hawaiian shirts.
