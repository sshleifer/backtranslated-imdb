This movie must have looked like it was filmed as it was being developed, with a Redgrave and a Jacobi aboard that the moneymen must have upset. All I can say is that they clearly did not have anything this week. Jacobi keeps it the way Jacobi can, and I thought he seemed more like the actor he parodied a couple of years ago in Frasier as a cameo role. Vinnie Jones is not bad at all, he is simply overwhelmed as a leader. He is really lovely and if this was a pilot for a TV series, maybe it was just picked up. The script and the camera work, however, were terrible. Why this "journalist" and a spokesman for the Met would ever work together is never explained. It certainly can not have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there are none. There's nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-fetched storyline that you can hand in as an original, but the whole thing is just invented in such a way that the two stories make no sense at all. It was as if two stories were confusingly cut into one to make up only two hours. Look at some colors dry. Your life will be more fulfilling than watching this garbage
