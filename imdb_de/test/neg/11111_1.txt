Oh my god ... where should I start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-horror movies ever made. This crap makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist". Special Note: A horror B movie must have at least one sex scene. Do not even expect a hot girl in this one. With this inexcusable mistake I should start with the complete bash. <br /> <br /> If you are shooting a horror monster movie, you should first spend a large part of the budget on creating a "cool" budget monster outfit. "The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween Costume There's no way the Chupacabras (yes, it's spelled it) look threatening in the movie, it's an actor in a Halloween outfit, please !! it looks so cheap it drives me crazy Secondly, the gore effects are the backbone of any horror movie directed at a video monster, and again the producers decided not to spend decent gore effects, the blood looks damned Take a look at the guy who gets hacked in half, which is probably the best scene in the movie and lasts about ten seconds, the end is a very bad scene that will not satisfy you. > <br /> Acting is the last thing what you can expect from a quality of these films. but in this movie it does not go on. A cast of nobodies with no theatrical experience turns the fool out for about 85 minutes. Special mention deserves a blond man with curly hair who tries to convince SWAT members that he is ill. The cough he fakes is ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor in a B-horror movie, no joke. Captain Pe√±a delivers a terrific performance in the first ten minutes of the turn. <br /> <br /> The true story of Chupacabras is not even told. They only learn that the monster sucks goat blood. Why deal with this piece of crap? Plesae, do not even look at it, even if you have the chance. Not even if it is broadcast via cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support horror movies on a low budget as the actors at least try to do something "different" than Hollywood, but that does not mean that horror fans like me should accept that kind of garbage.
