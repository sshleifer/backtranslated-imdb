... and I bought a vampire motorcycle staggers like a drunk whose laces are tied together. Some "bad" movies are quite pleasing (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some "bad" movies are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but "bad" movies trying to do the postmodernist thing of consciousness bad should always be approached with extreme caution. For example, many people think that Tromas Terror Firmer is a bad masterpiece, but I estimate that anyone over the age of nineteen will dismiss it as worthless muck. Then there's John Carpenter's Dark Star. Yes, it's quaint and certainly a product of its time, but as a film, it's only two scores higher than worthless. This no-budget British black-comedy horror outing seeks to achieve a satirical tone, with its infinite references to its fellow splatter flicks (including Psychomania, Horror Hospital and just about everything else from Pete Walker), but ranked out for sombre performances two-string TV actor (the lead actress looks like Amy Winehouse), a script that seems to have been written by two "boys" on the back of a peeled beer mat, without understanding how movie comedy works; Dean Friedmans (intentionally?) grim Elevator Rock soundtrack and production values ​​that never go beyond the mediocre are the result, a movie that can only be laughed at with AT rather than WITH. If your idea of ​​Whoopee is dominated by anthropomorphic turds, Chinese food stalls, Fu King, and references to long-forgotten TV commercials, you'll enjoy them, but do not expect too much.
