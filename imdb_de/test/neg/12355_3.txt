Must add a comment !!! <br /> <br /> First of all, ironically, you have to add the "Spulier Alarm" to comply with the IMDb parameters, but there's absolutely nothing that can be "spoiled". There are six characters: the handsome girl whose A-list mountain guide in the area of ​​"Climbing" is, and apparently among all the guides (including the Mount Everest Sherpas) on the planet; her lost love, which disappeared from the title two years ago, which the party supposedly seeks but never finds; her friend of the shopkeeper, also a leader, who is better than a sherpa, but not suitable for her; the strange lead actor who claims her services and says they will find their long-lost love in the trade; his only co-worker, a computer hacker with supposedly limitless expertise so high that Gates could ask him for advice; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who does not seem to have an IQ near three digits. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, nefarious occurrences, and the secret quest of the lead actor is the recovery of a satellite that has fallen into the "passport" and has world-changing and unique data to bring them untold riches , Exactly what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> If you take too many actions, the script looks like something that would get a C in a freshman (but an F if submitted at a higher level) and the Thespians are gnawing each a piece of landscape like a horde of beavers. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of this film for me has been to compare parts to three other roles or roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First The mysterious, secret, secret data is reminiscent of "The Spanish Prisoner," an A-List / Mamet movie that surrounds a valuable corporate "process" that has never been specifically clarified, but better for this. Definitely not that way here. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the lead Biscuit might have been more resourceful than "Rambo" when he was quick to deal with when he later switched to threatened Steven Seagal (not to remember the title) where he was half conscious and about 1/3 of the time sank, and for another third was completely comatose. Although I did not seek much of his work, I have seen enough to realize that in the coma he has delivered the best work he has ever had, and most of the consistency with his laconic personality. While awake, the young hacker in this opus was the most exciting character on the screen, but while he felt uncomfortable in the last section and was unable to emulate, he offered the best acting during this seemingly endless two hours br /> Take the thin, stupid basis for an action here. Imagine being compressed to SNL, say, a Gbita Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in the four roles. You could get record laughs here with just a few changes to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of the last analysis is the consideration of what information in the spy satellites might have been "even billions" worth of many nations and yet made worthless (according to the guru hacker) when they simply surf the internet and then have no obvious consequences? Even a turkey like this should have a little bit of logic somewhere. This one is completely empty.
