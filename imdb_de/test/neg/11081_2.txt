When I reviewed the review of the movie after watching the movie, I was surprised that there were good reviews. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about bad camera work. Everything "scary" happens off-screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone who has "seen / heard this?" No, we did not see that! We can not! And when there were no close-ups, the camera did something unusual, like turning it on its head, or really shaking it up and down to either mediate something or make us physically ill. <br /> <br /> The characters were unlikely because they screamed the same thing every two minutes. I do not care if that's really "real", I did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! I expect unreasonable things like aliens, demons or good deeds! They were stupid too - Let's have intimate relationships in a cave! With all our clothes on! When you talk about it, the ending contradicts something that Domingo said just before he died. This bothered me a bit, though not nearly as much as the fact that the end led to a ... grave invasion of a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera work. What is left? Oh, right. The end may have had a "twist," but in general, with horror movies, the phrase in the end actually has a meaningful relevance to what has occurred during the movie. Sixth Sense does that a lot. Hide and Seek too. But the cave had a lame turn that served as an "explanation," if one could call it that, as it is not. To explain. Everything. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. You're welcome.
