This son of a successor son was, to say the least, terrible. One might think that production would be better 10 years after the release of the original, but Retro Puppet Master was not directed or written by the original authors and contained bad stories, lack of emblematic connection to any characters, and slowly brought the scene to scene. No build-up of strong plot, very weak climax, you will get angry all over the movie if you can sit through the whole roll. I could never understand why a horror movie continues after the release of the "last chapter". I hardly suggest watching this movie, but if you have to, I would not recommend anyone else see through you.
