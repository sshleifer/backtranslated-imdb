This must be one of the most annoying, arrogant poser movies I have ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached a new level of presumption. It is clear that there is virtually no action, even though this part of Greek history is material for great films. He just had some supposedly symbolic (actually Shambolic) scenes in mind and built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme, repeating itself to the point of weariness, along with litanies, processions, and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the film, but unfortunately, it is the film itself. A completely incoherent result in which you can only say What? or "oh honey" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development, nada, zilch. Usually I complain that some films have two-dimensional characters, but oh man, he created one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and humiliating for some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favorite actors, Giorgos Armenis, out of wood. <br /> <br /> And to the core of the Angelopoulos movie: No, we are not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please tell someone that this type of symbolism needs to be subtle. Theo Do you really underestimate your audience so much or are you simply incompetent? Personally, I think he was trying to build a Greek subway. No matter how he tries, he can not reach Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Just save the mercy: photography, costumes and music.
