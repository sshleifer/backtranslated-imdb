The enthusiastic response to this film surprised me. It seemed boring to me, as I had enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the details of the actions were often poor. It also seemed to be an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone would be with a mind in their arms and complained that the film was strongly misogynistic. It's not just that the two captains are portrayed as complete idiots and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless and form a utopian community that has no conflict and is based on relentless generosity and good humor. Utopias are known to be boring and this turns out to be no exception. But it's also interesting to know what's going on (and here comes the plot plot, though it's a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) Her mother hastened to take responsibility for it, and (2) the daughter seems to have almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life disappears from the movie). It's not really a glorified killing, though Aldomovar's camera remains bloodthirstily on the blood as if she were making an attractive painting, and then she is soaked and out of sight, without bleeding either daughter or mother, neither materially nor emotionally. Later, the film reveals another murder, again by a woman of a man, and again it is a murder that the film implicitly advocates. In short, Volver is an ideologically driven film with an awkward and indeed repugnant ideology so I write an ideological review. Besides that, it's just not very interesting. It does not have the depth of Aldomovar's conversation with her that I loved.
