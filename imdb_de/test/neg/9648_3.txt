This self-important, confusing b + w "movie" looks like a toddler on a very bad acid journey. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a rotten piece of lettuce that accidentally fell out of the garbage of a truck. There is no room for action if you have "visceralist images" and "subtle" allegory. For me it seems like the director is trying to make the next big art film while begging for intellectual honors. I did not bring my beret either. When I looked at it, I almost felt offended, because the "film" dissociates itself from you so effectively.
