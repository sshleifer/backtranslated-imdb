The only good thing about this movie was that it made me hungry for ice, except for the dead body parts. The movie is one of the most kitsch I've seen in a long time. When the "Ice Cream King" died in the beginning, I laughed so much because the boy took the ice from him and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and say, "Leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so I can see how my acting career goes down the drain at a young age." That seems to be about one line. Then I wondered why the Ice Prince was behind the bars of his ice cream truck. Did someone want to rob him of his twenty cents? I've never seen bars on an ice cream truck window. It seemed pretty stupid. You might as well forget acting because it's just awful. Forget this movie and go to the Milk Queen and get yourself an ice cream.
