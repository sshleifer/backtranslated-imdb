I bought this movie in a car sales when I was 15 years old. I hated him then and saw him again, only hell, it's even worse now. You hear the director and the cameraman in the background commands such as "Zoom, Zoom, Zoom !!!" scream. These are not special effects, just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain. This is total crap, and originally I thought it was a unique home movie or something I bought. But that has been redistributed elsewhere and it's just strange to know that other people have seen it. Whoops I need 10 lines .... well .... This can be an interesting thing to see how no-budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. That sucks. Yes, look at this, just to see if you can get through the worst. If you can do it, you can do it through everything.
