In Pasadena, Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to return her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is interned in a hospital after a fire, to the United States. After her meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her. She is cursed in the same situation and chased by the spirit of the house. In Tokyo, the three high school comrades Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and hunted by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves into the apartment of her friend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with his children, teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight). Next door strange things happen to the neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge 2" has fearsome sound and visual effects, with the scary wife and the boy, and I watched a couple of movies while watching it. However, the complex script with three subplots is completely confused, making the intricate story a mess. There are too many characters and situations, and at a certain moment I was completely lost with the disjointed and fragmented narrative. In the end, I was completely disappointed with this confused, but also scary movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("The Scream 2")
