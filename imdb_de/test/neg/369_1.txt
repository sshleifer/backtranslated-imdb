I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and fake them in every single episode of South Park (if they're not shown, then mention them), and they love to mock and joke and even make fun of them to go too far. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the most frequently used topic in the "documentation" is that the episodes are meaningless bitches that they just spent for their money. Obviously, this is totally untrue if you even bother to watch a series, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." said the main characters at the end of almost every episode. The creators are also portrayed as pompous, arrogant asses who are only interested in money, including a supposedly funny, but not scene, in which Isaac Hayes lines up boss (over the phone) and Trey Parker screams and yells at him for sucking and Hang up. I suppose it should be funny, but the claim it contained really shook it. <br /> <br /> The way they interview employees of Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants pushing their employees to the limit, all just for money at the end. Not at all, of course, and all a joke, but it's just not funny. It's disturbing, even if it's just a joke.
