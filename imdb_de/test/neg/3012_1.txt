This show is pathetic. I can not imagine how someone who has a bigger IQ than a can of pea soup that has passed the expiration date can readily sit half an hour through this garbage. It's one of those rare shows that are so awfully awful in every way that you can honestly say you're less intelligent, just by reputation. I did a study and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points every 15 seconds she watches this show. That's just a second after another Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19,863,221 lost IQ points per second) and pretty much synonymous with Girls Will Be Girls. The keys to the VIP owe each of us an apology. Whenever I see this travesty of a show, I am sad for the company. How may it continue?
