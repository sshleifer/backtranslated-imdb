I saw this movie in the theater and paid money because I thought it was at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed was when Robin Williams crashed into the car at the bottom of the hill and at the end when he seemed to be killed. Glenn Close was abominable and obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have her children taken away by the Children and Family Department. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his glassy, ​​good-looking donut look are just too sweet and too mild for me. He has two roles he can play: Funny person or sad, tragic, good-natured victim. See the Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and all its "dramatic" roles. It is always the same performance. Put them all together for a long miniseries. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Do you remember the deadly attraction? Would you have an affair with her on your worst day and when you're single? Did you feel any spark between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warming up a screen? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. This was when he was a serial killer and villain. So it was funny to see him as a transsexual. Garp is for those people who like to watch movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it's beautiful and profound.
