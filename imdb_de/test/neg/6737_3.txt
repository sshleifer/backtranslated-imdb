I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds because it was garbage. It was not Seagal's fault that it was just the crap that directed the few action scenes. The plot was also confusing and basically just rushed, maybe it was postponed and released to take advantage of Seagals' newer films. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> He is not finished yet.
