I did not like the movie at all. Basically, they took a few one-liners from different Shirley Temple films, threw them together, and let Orr behave like Shirley Temple on the screen. "Oh, my goodness!" was said quite often. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will see several lines directly from their films. The problem is that Orr says this in Shirley's everyday life. In the end, we get a mix of newly created Shirley Temple films, rather than taking any real look at the life of Shirley Temple. Save yourself the trouble and borrow Shirley Temple movies. It's much better than seeing Orr trying to redesign Shirley's acting style.
