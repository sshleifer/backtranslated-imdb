Everything that made the original so funny seems to be missing here. This is simply a "run of the mill demons on the loose demolition", but without the passion that graced the original. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one completely. Here, the demons are released in a high-security building and cruelly kill most of the residents. The make-up effects are less convincing than the first time. Although the performers in Demons were not brilliant, they are actually much worse in Demons 2. They are not interested in these characters, ALL. The plot is nonexistent, the music is bad (apart from a Simon Boswell song), it's not scary at all; It just is not that good. <br /> <br /> The worst movie that Dario Argento and also Lamberto Bava have been involved with is slightly involved (Bava has a cameo in this movie, not a very funny one). <br /> <br Maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least I could see everything and I did not think to stop halfway. My advice; Stick to the original.
