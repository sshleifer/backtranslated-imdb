I saw this on a cheap DVD release titled "The Entity Force". Since I like cheesy horror movies of the 80s, I thought I had a real treat. Unfortunately, the movie is usually boring and you're always waiting for something to happen. Eventually it gets a bit more interesting, but this is in the last quarter of the movie. It is a case of too little too late. If the action happens, it's not so great. What we get are dead corpses floating on the ground chasing the girls in the mausoleum. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but you can do a lot better. I would recommend this to die-hard collectors of the kitschy 80's horror.
