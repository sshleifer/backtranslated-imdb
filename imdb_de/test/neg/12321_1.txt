A vivacious and downright degrading adaptation to the classical history of children lacks not only the charm of the forefather, but also any talent. Not only was Mike Myers ashamed of his terrible performance, but a clear rip-off of what Jim Carrey did, but he should give up playing all together. He is so annoying that you want to clear the crap out of him if you could jump right in the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very bad. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but that's not just the cake, it's undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made.
