What a bad movie, the premise was all there, the actors were all there. Yet there was no credible plan, good dialogue, and characters to relate to. <br /> <br /> A typical raid that went wrong with the premise that everyone was shocked by the system. The main character Tye and his little brother were out of luck and their house is repossessed, along with the godfather Matt Dillon (who looks not much older than Tye and therefore does not know exactly how that happened) to rescue with a plan money to steal an armored van, where they work as security forces. Tye has a quick flirtation with a conscience, but decides to join. And so begins a truly terrible hole that has ridden for 30 minutes of unbelievable garbage. I will not list all the ways this movie was unrealistic, but let me point out the most important ones: <br /> <br /> Because Tye has decided to be a good guy because a homeless person has been close to collateral damage Friends including his godfather die. His godfather, who is supposed to be a family, and the man who lavished him at the last minute to help him, dies of Tye. Tye, while defeating his friends and godfather, destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that took back his house. Nevertheless, he has chosen the alleged family of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> There are many more, needless to say that this movie was threefold and I sincerely hope no one else sees it.
