This is one of the most unromantic movies I have ever seen. Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles. Diane looks a bit eager and frowns, as usual, but she does not seem to be convinced of the romance itself. Support the cast not too memorable. <br /> <br /> Story: The medical drama he's dealing with is unconvincing and not interesting. The story is weak - not enough to make a movie. There's nothing new to say or any new way of saying it here. <br /> <br /> The environment is a bit bleak and the house she is in is unattractive. <br /> <br /> NOT destined to remember well.
