Tedium as only the French can. I checked my watch for the first time in 7 minutes and 143 minutes left to go. I will not even try to talk about the incoherence of the "conspiracy" or the inability of the characters to be friendly, because after about an hour, I realized that all this did not matter. It was not just selfish or overbearing, it was a vacuum. A sucking vacuum. This film has no saving grace, no pleasing character, nothing funny and nothing sad. It is not smart enough to be a drama, and there is no moment that is a bit absurd in the least. The most fascinating thing about this film is how it managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. I've been tricked by these reviews, but you do not have to be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back.
