I watched the first episode and found it a very wooden performance. <br /> <br /> I watched the original from Big Girls Blouse until the last series on Channel 7. Kath and Kim were a great mocumentary and humor is something most people get. <br /> <br /> In this American version, however, it was boring, Molly Shannon is too fashionable to be Kath Day, Kaths wardrobe is in the 80s stuck with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes is not as good as what the original Kimmy wore. I also found that Selma seemed to open her stomach a lot, she's obviously an (Australian) size 12, in which Kim (Australian) should have a size 16/18. <br /> <br /> The stock exchanges of Molly and Selma are obviously so scripted and there are breaks in which there should be no breaks or the breaks are a bit long, as someone has suggested that there may be a trace of laughter during these breaks could. It's as if Molly and Shannon are not used to one another, there is no mother-daughter chemistry. Phil was okay, he had the eccentric air like Kel. However, Craig was too handsome and not the sweet, simple, modest board from the Aussie version. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very bad stage play. The acting was pretty wooden and the exaggeration of Selma's expression was funny after ten minutes. Especially her pouting scenes. <br /> <br /> In summary, I think this show is a waste of time. The script was obviously dumbed down for Americans, most of whom say on the blackboard they prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why they did not pay the producers to screen the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda. They are a smart cookie that does not let the producers use their character of Sharon.
