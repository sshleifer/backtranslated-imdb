God! Where should I start? From beginning to end I could not help hate this movie. Grape vines that make mobile phone noise ?! Oh yes, I am so scared - I will get rid of the weeds of the earth! Come on people! The plot went nowhere. When the group discovered the ruins and the villagers (no pun intended) came to warn them and wield weapons in front of their faces, do not worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! In this whole scene, I was really wondering why she did not take pictures of her friend Jeff (Johnathon Tucker) and chewed Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots first threw the rope at Mathias, the rope was at least three meters above the ground, but eventually it could only be two to four meters above the ground. I can not begin to handle everything that was wrong in this film, there is just too much to report. I'll say the graphics were fantastic so far but nothing worked as the acting and script were so terribly bad.
