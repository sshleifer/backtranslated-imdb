If you are a kid who likes fairytale adventures "in real life", then you will see it. If you are a teenager who likes children movies, why do not you see it? :) If you, as a parent, see a movie with your children, HOW better to choose the squirrel! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this movie was a bit funny and good venue for the events. But after a fun introduction of characters, attitudes, and potential conflicts, the story got pretty boring. When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" comes back to me again and again, just like parts of a dented LP or the commercials that you really hate. And the culmination of the conspiracy ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
