Yes, it was a horrible movie, but there was a song at the beginning of the movie, I think, titled "I got a woody" or something. I would like to find a soundtrack of it, if one is available. I saw this song on MST 3K, and as awful as it was, it had its moments, and this song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like babies in bikinis, this is the movie for you, but if not, then do not bother. It was great material for MST 3K, I have to admit, though. I would really like to know where I can get a copy of the soundtrack. Not only this song, but a few more were really funny and are classics for me.
