This very forced attempt to merge Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (himself greatly overrated) is neither informative nor entertaining. The character development is arbitrary and unbelievable - especially in the final scene of the bat and the little boy, as other critics have noted. Apart from a few humorous moments, the film is not so funny (black humor or otherwise), as the director seems to believe.
