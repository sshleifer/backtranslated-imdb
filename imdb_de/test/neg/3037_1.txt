Unlike most reviewers, I hated this movie simply because the bloated ego of the writer / director got in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many film fans put "EXTREME self enjoyment" with "GENIUS!" Um, but I do not know this cult of personality. A movie should deal with its theme, not with its director (unless it is, of course, a Woody Allen movie). * SPOILER * (that's a good thing, save your time ...) There's nothing better than showing you the foot-length porn star you know, what in the last frame - that's actually a heavy maneuver SCREAMS is called Hackescher the film school. <br /> <br /> The Poseur film has achieved the status of a 'great movie' for the audience, due to its forbearance and young talent. that's first and foremost the author / director. But the rest of the audience should also look at the grumpy, brutal nature of the porn business. The film had a distanced look at the porn industry and looked at every single player he could beat. Anyway, I love your author / director. I love these four-minute steadicam segments that are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow they had all the momentum of an off-switch. Love the story - no matter how boring it is - about the uprising and filthy case of a porn star. But of course, look down too. While the topic has the potential to be intriguing? Innocence, Money, Humiliation, Beauty - Your venerated writer / director has somehow managed to make everything look dull again. Partly because of the term. Your Auteur hero has NOT tried it: Give the characters a dimension. Or soul. Anything that is definitely a scream, except for Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I do not buy. I do not buy breakneck hype into forgiving hacks. <br /> <br /> Another over-length auteuristisches Hackst√ºck with fifty times more hype than quality. I know that some of you agree. The rest will probably see this indulgent movie again. Not my problem.
