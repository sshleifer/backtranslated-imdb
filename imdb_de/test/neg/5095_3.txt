This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a while. I'm in my late 40s and I saw it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and my son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched for about an hour and turned it off. The hour we saw it, I spent more time with my iPhone than with the movie. I gave him a 3 because I enjoyed the scenery and the cinematography; Otherwise, I would have given him a 1. I'm sure there are people who really care about the "art" of everything that will make my review scary, but we all have our own opinions, right? I could not figure out if this was a "chick movie" with the focus on the mother, or if it was a movie for men focused on battle and adventure. In my opinion, it did not succeed either.
