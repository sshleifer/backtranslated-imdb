For the first time when reviewing movies I was immediately uninterested in this story. I do not know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused and completely unoriginal. For the first thirty minutes, I was quite apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt like I had seen this structure before, and Tart offered nothing new to surprise me. After thinking that it could only be my mood, I stopped the film and decided to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. I just did not care. This is not a good sign. The characters were boring. When I say mild, I literally mean that you will never have a taste in your taste buds as development evolves. The story seemed almost plagiarized. I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she has not added anything new to the perspective. The casting was awful, the underlying imagery and themes were so lost that no critic could find them (or the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. They did not know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of putting more emphasis on the characters, we found drugs, petty sex, and money in our faces instead. These are topics that we've seen in every movie since the movie started, but somehow Wayne could not capture them creatively. <br /> <br /> What drew me away from this story right away? It was mainly the characters. I've seen most of Brad Renfro's work, and frankly, he needs to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined him and strangely, he can not leave this stereotypical character. I was bored within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular yet impressive, just repetitive. He had to bring some excitement or tension into his role instead of playing that arbitrary society. Without a strong character, the final climax of this movie instead comes as a disappointment. Renfro did not show the best skills in this movie. While I'm on the subject? nobody showed the best of their abilities. What's going on with Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I do not think she really did show up as an actress, and tracking down roles like Cat Storm does not help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I saw when she tried to bring something remarkable to the screen, unfortunately, because all the other horrible acting had lost them all. Wander around here and there and in the second act honestly almost forgot. Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast, and most of the film's budget was probably spent on her TWO scenes in which she was. Maybe the rest went to the random guys from The Kids in the Hall, who urgently need to stay away from the project. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem outside of acting was the tempo of this movie. Nothing, and that's hard for me to say, but nothing works together. In the course of the film, there were so many sub-stories that no real substance was formed. The robberies, the "fear and woe" of the teenage years, the wealthy socialists who find out how awful the real life is, the random kids in the hall, and even the end just felt rushed and terribly cut together. With this slender craftsmanship, the whole story has never really formed a real shape. Family structures have never been defined, characters have never received emotions, and all that remains is parts of honest remains. Wayne has not completed the task. <br /> <br /> Although I do not want to burden the director by any means, I have little choice in this film. With a dreadful title that shrieked the exact opposite of what this movie is about, the cast with amateurish aptitude in every scene was able to give any emotion, leaving us with disgusting drama and bad storytelling and storytelling difficult to place "good" behind Tart. This was a movie I had not heard of, and after seeing it I can see why. All Wayne did with this film is a random selection of clips from other films that better defined all the elements above and put them all together to make the movie Tart. It's hard for me to say that, but Wayne ruined that movie. While I do not believe history left much to do, the remnants of excitement remained empty when Wayne took over. While most of the time you can credit part of the story, maybe strong drama or even music, you can not judge Tart at all. From the opening sequence to the end, I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal. No consistency, no strength. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a waste of time. If you are looking for deep symbolic elements or possibly a joke of our society, you will not find it in this movie. While I know that's what Wayne tried to show, the end product seems to be on an etch-a-sketch. It was an embarrassing movie to sit down and not encourage anyone to record. Wayne threw away all the lessons of her education at Columbia University and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Note: * from *****
