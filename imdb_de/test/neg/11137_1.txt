This was obviously the worst movie ever made ... Ketchup was the starring role in this movie and would be the only nominee for an award. I could have done a better horror movie in my backyard within two hours with a handheld camera with grass-filled dummies as actors, at least the acting would have been better! Do not waste your time or money on this ... it's extremely cheesy and terrible !!
