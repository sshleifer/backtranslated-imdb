Stupid hikers camp in the mountains of Utah to meet only a murderous, disfigured gypsy. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a beautiful run of the mill loop movie that suffers mostly from imagination. The victim characters are all too familiar idiots, which means they do not really care about them. We only wonder when they will die! Not to mention that there are too many cheesy moments and filled with endless, unnecessary nature shots. However, it does have a few moments of interest to Slasher fans, the occasional touch of a spooky atmosphere and decent music by Don Peake. Nevertheless, it is common for normal camper movies. <br /> <br /> There are much better movies in this direction, but The Prey can be seen by die-hard Slasher fans. Although you may be rewarded more by watching Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
