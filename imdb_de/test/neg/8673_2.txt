... if we all know, it does not make anyone like the BBC. <br /> <br /> As an avid fan of this kind of Sunday night, I was really looking forward to it. How disappointed I was! For the first thirty seconds, I did not think it looked promising and after two minutes it was hard for me to watch. <br /> <br /> But I and my friends just insisted on finding bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. The plot was hurried to the limit and the make-up and costumes were gaudy and very 21st century in a "BBC Robin Hood" style. This modern style may have been able to place sharp camera angles and visually opulent cinematography, but unfortunately we do not have either. The director felt decidedly sloppy both for the acting and for the choice of the film. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes we could not resist and pulled out 'The Prestige' (which is very good) Maybe it's so unfair that I can judge that because I've seen so little of it but seldom did I feel so forced to warn people not to see something! However, me and my friends thought that the house and umbrellas were pretty - but that's as good as it gets.
