I saw this after seeing "Death Tunnel" (which is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen in my life), so you can understand that I let my eyes roll a little when I saw the directors and Producers of this movie jewel saw responsible for this one. At first I thought that the director and the producer are the same. Both are Kid Rock and Dawg, the bounty hunter. I looked at the TAPS investigation and I'm not a skeptic. I think TAPS is the next closest to any scientific method in this field. That was cool and believable - I really think they are being persecuted. <br /> <br /> But like the reviewer mentioned above like a tour. Okay, a tour, fine, but the "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to make a pretty small penny and have a financial investment, whether they haunted them or not, and if they have fantastic stories, I'll need them with a heaping teaspoon take salt. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, I could see what I wanted to see in about 50% of the cases in the picture. The rest of the time I could not mind. Also unrelated to the photos - time of day, camera type, humidity in the room, dust particles (75% are the balls), weather and many other factors. I can not accept her. I can not help thinking that some of them could be treated. Why should this band let the numbers out the door? Vandalism? During the TAPS investigation they also tried to dig up the death certificates of these nurses - and they only found one that was considered "accidental" (people did not want to officially declare suicide). However, when one of the leaders mentioned this, he said "yep and his pronounced suicide." It really felt like the guides to the ghost houses here in October. However, I also enjoyed the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospitals, which gave a lot of perspective and a personal touch. I am also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best intentions and were not terrible guards. They were not the best methods, but all they had. They absolutely wanted to stop the disease.
