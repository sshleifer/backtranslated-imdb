Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One would think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie, but no. Travolta takes on the role of Chili Palmer again, but this time we've already seen a gangster trying his luck in the tough world of filmmaking. It is not funny anymore. This is a typical problem in Hollywood. You think, if the first one is good, the second will be twice as good, NO, the first one was original, the second one can not be. Give us a new twist, not just the same movie that was created on a bigger budget. I found myself laughing all the time I barely laughed when I saw this movie, but there were still a lot of cool actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock just for that and that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
