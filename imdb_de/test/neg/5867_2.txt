I bought this DVD for my little son who loves the ToyStory movies. I never thought it would be in the same league as the Toystory movies, but what I got was another lazy Disney cartoon, far below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is unoriginal, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is below average, even buzz is not great. The movie could have been so much better. I especially hate the numbers. I know it's meant for kids, but even kids know when something stinks of that level lameness. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of the movie, the first part of the movie with the Slag really made me mutant monster, from there it was downhill.
