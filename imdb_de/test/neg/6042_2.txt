Someone said that WEBS is very similar to an episode of SLIDERS and I have to agree. Spoiler: I've never liked the actors on Sliders and have rarely seen them unless nothing better works. WEBS is the kind of movie to see if you have no choice. Read a book. WEBS have these types of TV actors who look like they're there as part of their PROBATION or work release program. Some low-budget television movies have actors who at least look excited. The actors in WEBS look like they're getting a minimum wage and working on a timepiece. They have this desperate "The Paycheck Better Not Bounce" look. The queen spider looks good unless it is rarely seen and there are no other spiders (and no tracks). The queen spider bites humans and they become spider zombies, which means they try to keep their eyes open when they attack humans. People are fighting each other for different reasons and are not sympathetic. After meeting all the "humans", I would have recommended the Charm School for the characters. All WEBS felt was APATHY. I was deaf to the characters, hoping for interesting gore and special effects. The gusset was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen who looked good. If WEBS had a bunch of spider creatures that ate humans, that would have been more entertaining. Apparently they could only plan "spider zombies". WEBS is a sad introduction to SPIDER-oriented films. It could qualify as the worst spider movie ever, because Eight Legged Freaks had great special effects.
