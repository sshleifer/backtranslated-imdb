My 15-year-old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable TV. As someone who has seen Revenge of The Nerds in a movie theater, I found that this movie is an extremely predictable remake of it. The nerds were simply replaced by dorks. I drove her crazy because I could predict exactly what would happen in every scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> Writer Chad Creasey should be ashamed that he made such an obvious remake of an early '80s movie. The title should have been simply "Revenge of the Dorks". Maybe the sequel will be revenge of the Dorks 2.
