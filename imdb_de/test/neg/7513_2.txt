This is a polarizing film. People either love it or despise it, it seems. I despise it. The film comes from the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but although this is a masterpiece, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Both films take Kafka's unfinished novel - America - as an inspiration and general ideal. America is a surreal story of a youth journey across the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer who does not change in the course of the journey (although the book is about 300 pages long and still only a quarter done, we never know). Allow Kafka to focus and comment on the absurd / surreal situations and environments. Oh Lucky Man follows this template to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell, and Weekend does the same for France. Both films are also very Brechtian and use various tricks and techniques to point this out. This is NOT REAL, that's confabulation, etc. But the difference is that Oh Lucky Man uses the constructed film to add the absurdity of life and the class system convey. Weekend uses the constructed film to beat us to death with ideological polemics. Because Godard goes further than Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we have two main characters we have no investment in at all. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but they can not care less. Intentionally so. At the same time, Godard leaves us a film that deals exclusively with his own message, conveyed in the first half of the film by relentless and presumptuous symbolism, and in the second half by a series of long, camera-directed speeches. Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes like the really cruel pig slaughter, far worse than all the violence of car accidents in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The end result is as if you are listening to a political hearing expert over and over again about his views as you repeatedly mind you so that you receive the message. The problem with Brecht is that if you alienate the audience too much, then you have alienated it from what you want to convey. Which was always natural for me. <br /> <br /> The parts that are really in the hands of this film are the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit, verbal description of the threesome in the beginning and the off-screen view of the comic rape in the middle even if it could be considered allegorical, it completely destroys the film's belief in itself and its characters, as little as it ever existed. It's so french with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> Oh Lucky Man. That's a brilliant job. Weekend is a job of the claim. <br /> <br /> Two stars, only for the congestion scene and the piano scene, which are just an indication of genius, though they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfactory than without it being a bad movie of the worst and most demanding Director of the world, with them it is obvious that this is a damn good technical director who produces the most intellectually demanding movie in the world. Somehow that's a lot worse.
