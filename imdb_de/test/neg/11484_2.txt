When I saw the trailer for the first time, I really wanted to see it. I found some of the other director's works pretty good, but I have to say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman living with a widowed father and two of his two sons. They move into a well-guarded community, but everything is not what it seems; a kind of twin peaks. The woman begins to see things of a people or not. During the first role, I had a hypothesis and thought, "That can not be the whole reason?" Well, the end was alive, or better DOWN, and gave us what I thought was a really weak final act. The sound mix and quality is excellent. I saw it in a THX certified theater and was impressed .. by the sound and only by the sound. The picture is missing substance.
