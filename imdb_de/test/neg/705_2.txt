Let me first say that I am a Laurel-Hardy-Buff. I have read every book printed about her and have seen all available movies more than once. I even took a chance and called Stan on the phone. He was very nice and talked to me for over ten minutes. I followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back. I still have this letter. <br /> <br /> This movie has some nice comedy moments, but Stan and Ollie are not in their usual form. Stan was seriously ill during the production and looked worse than after ten years. In my opinion, every Laurel and Hardy movie is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel. To quote him: "This film should never have been made."
