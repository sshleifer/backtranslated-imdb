I'm not even willing to pick a single star for this crap, but IMDb has no zero rating option ... the worst movie I've ever seen. History of the movie 1. Predator ship crashes on Earth 2. An Alien and Some Face Huggers are released and begin killing people. 3. A predator arrives on Earth and begins killing aliens and humans. 4. Then a human jet drops a bomb and kills humans, aliens, and predators. 5. Some people find the shoulder canon of the predator. 6. The final directors should consider refunding money to the viewers. If you still want to watch this movie, download it from a torrent site and thank me for saving money. The entire film was shot in a dark corner of the earth. You can even see dark shadows even in action scenes. too much violence .. I did not expect it from a Fox movie
