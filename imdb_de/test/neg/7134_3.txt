I liked the first The Grudge. It really scared me and it had something that made me want to see it twice. Something was missing in this sequel. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really stays in your memory. They are people who die because an eerie mind comes out of the shadows and Boo says. And most of the time it was not even scary. <br /> <br /> This movie is a dead end, as far as the plot is concerned. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she got nothing to do, and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfying, because he came so fast. I was also disappointed with the sideline of Kayako's mother. I thought she might offer a way to fight the Grudge, but she dies in her hands - hair? - by Kayako. That was such a stupid turn. All in all, it's hard to feel for characters you know will die from the first minute. Everything in the same way. And there is nothing they can do. It does not feel like a cruel fate awaiting her. It's just boring because you know what's going to happen. If they objected, it would have been more exciting, even if they had failed. If there was hope, the fears would be justified. Now you are just waiting for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we've seen her too often and that has taken away a lot. I was still scared during some scenes, but I actually got used to the big eye and the blue face. The makers obviously realized that this would happen if they added more frightening ghosts. Yes, I was afraid of the school psychology scene - even if I knew where it would go as soon as she said, "I was in the house". A nice gesture. Toshio, however, was not scary at all in this movie. The non-blue Toshio with black eyes and a blank look, which sometimes appeared in the first movie, attacked me much more. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing to me. <br /> <br /> Some characters seemed to be really unnecessary - the notorious milk scene with the girl, whose name I can not remember, comes to mind. I was not afraid, it was just "Huh?" I am not sure if the students were really needed. Karen could have brought the grudge to the US. It could have killed people who had to do with their lives, at any funeral or something. It would have been boring to see them all die, but meeting so many unrelated people was really annoying. I hated the scene "I will not call you mother". Aubrey's mother problems were just as boring. The little boy was a touching character. <br /> <br /> The sequel to Ju-On was a bit scary than this one. There were a few new twists - dreams and reality that blur, for example, a lot more - and even if I felt pretty depressed, I was somehow satisfied. I had to think a bit and wonder. This movie was just cheap scary.
