The volcano is located in Los Angeles, where a small earthquake has just occurred. The head of O.E.M. (Emergency Management Office) Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to shorten his vacation and enter. As soon as he sees there everything is alright, he drives to the epicenter of the quake, where seven underground workers were killed in a fire or intense heat. Mike is not sure what to think. He brings the geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) with to explain and explain things. Unfortunately, a huge underground stream of molten lava was released following the earthquake and outbursts when the La Brea Tar Pits were dispatched. The lava that streams into the city's streets devours everything and everything that touches it. Mike, his men and the rescue services have given up their work to stop the flow of the lava and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Mick Jackson, this was the second big budget Disaster Strike It was about the idea of ​​a volcano erupting in 1997, with Dante's Peak (1997) released just two months before Volcano. Dante's Peak is hardly a masterpiece, at least it's a little better and more plausible than Volcano. The script here is total nonsense and is not based on reality. Subterranean lava flows seem to appear and disappear just as fast. Various characters stand centimeters away from a lava flow, but are not affected by the heat (if this guy) In the train, the metal seats melt around him, but he remains perfectly fine. As far as I know, human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) & It happens constantly, helicopter flying ash clouds reality would be impossible), a simple blockade at the end of a road will stop the flowing lava (how about the other roads and other directions?), be able to blow a perfect ditch in a street and then blow up a huge building makes a huge dam and when Kelly sees the lava coming towards her car, she gets off like any other but then, for some reason, she just stands there watching two firemen get burned and waiting for her father to save her. At that stage, her leg caught fire, even though all those concrete blocks were put together in less than twenty minutes, The guy does such a great job that it does not manage to push through a bit of molten lava and even more than this massive building e, which still falls on Tommy Lee and his daughter after that, both are doing well. The characters are also terrible, though they were not as clichéd as usual and no romance blossomed between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche & Minimal City officials trying to shut Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before the event called them a scare. There are a few badly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments in which Los Angeles is contracting. The black guy and the half-racial policeman who are warm-hearted to each other and end up wishing the kids a happy ending and the little kid in the end when he says, "Everyone looks the same" is terribly worthy and certainly a shit-up attempt to say whatever color we are, we are still human and we can all cope in times of crisis as it brings people together. I think Volcano is one of those who are so bad that they are good movies, entertains them and moves at a decent pace, but simply does not expect anything in reality or any human drama. <br /> <br /> I suppose a movie like Volcano could be considered an update to a catastrophe movie of the 70s like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but with a huge budget that works with modern effects. As far as the effects are concerned, they are fine, but no one is so noticeable. The sets are also surprisingly forgotten. Sure, there are a few impressive explosions and a few OK lava flows flowing through the effects of Los Angeles, but little else. In general, Volcano is not particularly exciting and although it is occasionally unintentionally funny and completely ridiculous, it does not work the way the makers intended. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 90 million, it opened a little under $ 15 million at the box office, it looks good and there's a lot of fire, but nothing stands out & Volcano is a pretty unforgettable movie. I think most of the places shown here were shot in their right places. The performers go through the movements with some terrible dialogues and ridiculous set pieces, Tommy Lee Jones deserves more than that. <br /> <br /> Volcano is a bit of a catastrophe in both directions, it's a disaster-themed movie that takes itself too a disaster. It's worth it for a few unwanted laughs and the ridiculousness of everything, but it's nothing big and I doubt I'd ever want to see it again.
