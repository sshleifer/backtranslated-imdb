This is really one of the worst movies ever made - and I do not mean it's so bad that it's good. Eddie Murphy is a great comic and it's a testament to how bad this movie is that he almost killed his career. The writing and the directing are inappropriate, the stage sets and productions are as imaginative as a Brady Bunch episode, and the acting shows how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to do. If it were not for the costumes - which, aside from Eddie Murphy's ego, seem to be responsible for most of the budget - you'd swear this thing was beaten up by a bunch of high schoolers wasted on peppermint schnapps. That someone can find this travesty funny or entertaining in any way is overwhelming. It's probably no coincidence that the misguided souls praising this stinker can barely read. But if your idea of ​​amusement is that Della Reese gets her "little toe" shot down, then in any case put aside your drooling mug and go out this movie.
