A pretty lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot depends on a pretty decent idea, the script is deeply lame and two of the three main teenagers are absurdly wooden. The problem is that in order to go through their plan, the children have to be far more ruthless than shown, but if they were so concerned about the devil, it might be difficult for them to be sympathetic, so in the end, they are neither really. In fact, I only enjoyed the movie when I wanted her to die. One of those films, which would be the most sensible option in about a thousand places, would call the police. I realize we would not have a movie if that were the case, but it would be nice if we could believe that they really would not. Avoid.
