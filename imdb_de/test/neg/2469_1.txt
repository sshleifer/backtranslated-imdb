Two deathless girls remain immortal in their beach house. Uncle Beeny does not like a party. But guess what? The unbelievable girls have, as you guessed, a deathless beach party. If you have not understood the not so subliminal message that I am trying to convey. First of all, you're an idiot. I'd rather watch a naked Jello Tag team watching a match between Bea Aurther and Cameryn Manhiem VS. Rosie O'Donnell and Jessica Tandy. This movie, and I lose the term easy, is just so bad. <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kristin Novak and Charity Rahmer go topless, Iva Singer shows breasts and pastries
