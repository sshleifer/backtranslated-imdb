Dee Snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and exaggerated style has ruined it for me. The whole movie just seemed too serious. It tries to reach the dark atmosphere of "Seven" without good acting. The film emphasizes the subculture of urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art and expects us to be impressed (frightened) by the size of a man's nose ring. I'm not an expert on movies, but the script and acting in this movie are just awful. Dee Snider looks like part of the villain, but his behavior is downright horrible. I advise you not to waste your time unless otherwise available.
