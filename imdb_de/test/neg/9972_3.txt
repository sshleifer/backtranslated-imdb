This movie is about a woman who falls in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From then on she has to share the time for the two friends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like it was done on a minimal budget. The majority of the films are in an apartment with minimal furniture. There are only three main actors, all other actors listed in the credits appear only temporarily. The wardrobe designer does not seem to have much to do, as the actors wear very down-to-earth clothing and are actually mostly naked. <br /> <br /> The film is very dialogue-intensive, which would have made up for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialogues sound too composed and awkward. At the beginning of the film, most of the dialogue is made up of a person who says a very long sentence, and then the person says "me too". After the madness of the coincidence, the dialogue gets into a mess of disconnected and confused word salad. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film that I can imagine is that it serves as a feminist element that conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big disappointment.
