If you manage to laugh through this movie without laughing loudly on the screen, you are a better movie viewer than me. <br /> <br /> Count the Logic Losses, Jumps and Credibility ... Betcha Need More Than Two Hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If another movie uses a location that is clearly UCLA and claims that it is another university (in this case: Berkeley), I lose it.
