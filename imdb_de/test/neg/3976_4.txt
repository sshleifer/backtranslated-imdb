The movie was not that bad, especially as far as the plot is concerned, but the doughy (and hairy!) Actor that they chose for the lead role was a bit chintzy in the acting section. I would have chosen another. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was very ingenious, and the main character, who questioned everything he had ever known, made him a little sympathetic, but not so much when there was a pasty spot for a leading actor was interesting. The question arises as to how the subject of cloning will be treated in the future. Certainly cloning is not allowed for the purpose of the film, but it is still a valid argument today. Clones are still humans ... right? <br /> <br /> The film was not particularly special, but it is still much better than some of the cheeses published in the 1970s. Let's not forget the "Giant Spider Invasion". I give it a 4 because it does not stink absolutely, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10th (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You'll like this movie, but it will not be your favorite.
