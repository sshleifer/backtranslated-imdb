I do not even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth writing a review, so I'll just quote what another user wrote, because I agree, but I give it 1/10 instead of 2/10 "I can not find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was." The initial guideline was promising, but after that it was totally terrible Plot - good initial idea, but really terrible development.There were many points when I thought, "No, nobody would do something so stupid." The end was amazingly clutter.Characterization - all characters were either completely bland or grotesque Caricatures I'm constantly trying to think about One that was not - possibly the mother, but that's it - music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible - sense - totally amateurish - cinematography - doubts, there ss you have heard of it. Camera angle / stability / zoom levels are often very bad I'm totally amused by how well this movie has done. It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if not at all. "
