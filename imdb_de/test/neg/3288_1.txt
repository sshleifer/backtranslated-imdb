I would call this show terrible if it were not on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and is being refreshed while AD was aborted. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely indescribable how cruel this show really is. But let me try and describe it. Take an extremely low price Archie Bunker and let it spit out humor that would have been outdated if he had been married to Married with Children. Then take great storylines from AD (the son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and mute them so the idiots watching sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> When you see this I have completely lost the respect for you, just like your family. But if you're a fan you should love FOX's new comedy "Til Death". Looks like really funny, innovative stuff. I mean, couples do not get along ... awesome.
