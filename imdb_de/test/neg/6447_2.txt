I rated that better than terrible, because I liked to see Jonathon from Buffy back in something - even if it was the same role. <br /> <br /> First, the concept is pretty sweet for a brief moment, but not an entire movie. The letter was forced and invented. I feel like the movie suffered the most during editing. <br /> <br /> Second, Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed - even if she does not try to do it. She is just not funny. She always plays a kind of girl who looks bad when she's victorious herself - ironically, considering that Amanda is always a caricature. I would really like to see them in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she's always in those great roles where she's shaking and making faces and somehow that's a good thing? <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole "I'm a Dork" segment was demolished by the nerds' revenge. There was nothing in this film that was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Pity, shame, shame.
