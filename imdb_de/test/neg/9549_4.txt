History has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, Washington is fine, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow, almost everything about this movie exudes mediocrity. The action is lame. The only thing that I liked more or less about this film are the rather original methods with which the offender ends his victims. Technical details are worse than the broadest CSI knowledge and the gizmos, and halfway there is the question of whether the director has ever taken care of the credibility of details. (Some spoilers later!) I mean, an ECG machine with a pure sine wave that reflects a man's heartbeat, a quadruped with full-body muscle spasms, and a working index finger. A killer who exploits the guts of a man while keeping him alive for the rats to capture, followed by a rat aiming at the guy's face! What about all this stupidity? Then there are a number of continuity issues, but you can find the others here on IMDb. Honestly, I found it even an insult to my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Waste of time. Still 4 out of 10 to keep my friend from kicking me.
