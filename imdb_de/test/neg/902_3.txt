Some films are unconventional, but enjoyable, but many films are just incredibly funny. "Motorama" does not fit so well in the latter category. Many seem to like it for endless guest appearances and total futility, but these two things can only bring a movie so far, and "Motorama" simply has no other merit. <br /> "Motorama" enjoys plot improbabilities. His protagonist, Gus, is a 10-year-old chimpanzee on a road trip through an imaginary land trying to collect tokens to win $ 500 million. When interacting with adult characters, none of them seem to notice the fact that he is 10 years old. It is incredibly funny at first, but it quickly becomes unbelievable, especially given the people he encounters and the fact that he seems so unimpressed by the many disturbing (for someone at this age) occurring images. Gus has no depth, and as an anti-hero who has no problem with others miserable with his characters, it is hard to regret him when he encounters difficulty. <br /> <br /> Trouble is through a series of guest appearances that have abused Gus in ever stranger ways. Apart from the fact that the exhausted action is even more incredible and less enjoyable, the characters share the lack of depth of Gus and are equally unforgotten. The character's actions may get a little interesting, but the actors themselves do not add anything to them, negating the sense of getting big names (they could have been played by anyone and the character would have been the same). These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for the marquee than anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but the script has too little sense for it to work. Incidents that should have a lasting impact on the anti-hero and the viewer will not do so as the movie moves quickly from incident to incident, hoping that something will make the audience feel sorry for Gus or understanding , That never happens, because nothing is allowed to connect, it jerks like on a conveyor belt, one incident after the other. With such a nonsensical story it stops being fun, and a main character who never develops to take care of himself or others at a higher level has little to offer "Motorama" except a brat who sneaks around and trying to get rich. Why should we take care of it?
