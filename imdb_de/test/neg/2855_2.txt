This movie is just stupid. Do not bother to look at it; Believe me, you are better off. <br /> <br /> Long and close to conspiracy: A defense attorney represents a man who has murdered his son and other children. In defense, she comes across a wooden doll by Pinnochio. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio is obsessed and begins to kill people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly just to have such a weak ending. The plot is very bad and the music of Dennis Michael Tenney is pathetic. The story written by Kevin S. Tenney is simply meaningless and does NOT cause any horror or fear. This is a long way from his work on Night of the Demons and Witchboard, which are decent trips, but nothing to write home about. His direction is fine, but with such a bad story no one could have done well with this film. <br /> <br /> In summary: 2 out of 10, maybe the most boring, boring movie I've seen all year.
