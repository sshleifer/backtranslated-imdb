I will not go into detail why this movie deserves a terrible rating, many other people have already done so. Suffice to say, among the more than 400 films I've had on DVD, this is the only one I've got rid of - it was so worthless that I never wanted to see any of them ever want to see any of them again <br /> But I have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 15.03.06). When going through the 4 pages of the reviews I have not seen a higher rating than 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie 4 stars or less. It seems to me that a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie out of IMDb's Bottom 100 list. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie 10 stars (no one who wrote a movie review) are actually active users. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled Film is not worth your time.
