It is incredible that someone could have thought this nonsense and then produced it. That it actually aired on television, and advertisers who were actually paid to be connected to it, is mind-boggling. This bite-sized excuse for children's programs is almost too revolting to say anything. I burned all the Barney cassettes - yes, burned - that people gave to my son. Finding this terrible programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, do you get these smarmy kid actors? Do not your parents have any sense? These kids will use drugs before they are teenagers. My goodness. The last insult is that I need to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.
