As the title suggests, there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread to this film: if a man has the talent and is looking for his way into society and into the money, what could be the result if he does not deny it because he has the X-factor does not have? This question is unsatisfactorily addressed in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me pretty cold along the way. Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and apart from being annoyed on a funded trip to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned goal, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity lead to a violent collapse that escalates and becomes complicated for the rest of the film. Law, Damon and the damn pleasing Paltrow as Dickie's girlfriend are fine. I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman's happy Freddie Miles, the friend of the Bluff Society, whom Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story will lump without bow or salvation, which makes swallowing rather difficult. 4.10
