Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this: he's a co-writer, producer and director of this animated cartoon about an atomic submarine and his efforts to reduce a radiation ring orbiting the earth. A potentially exciting story can not stand out despite its eclectic cast. The varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are intricately intermingled and add a touch of color, but this squishy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few lost laughs, but Allen did not seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventures and campy nonsense. Later a popular TV series. ** from ****
