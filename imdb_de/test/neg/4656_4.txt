Like his close contemporaries "The Great Race" and "The Great Men in Their Flying Machines", I always associate this film with my childhood, especially on New Year's Day. On New Year's Day, we visited my grandmother and after lunch, while the adults talked, the kids watched TV wherever one of those three crazy racing movies was about to run. <br /> <br /> Alone, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo Or Bust" well, but I'm afraid I can not, the child is not the man's father on this occasion. By that I mean that I can only see the mistakes too clearly and although I was tempted to smile occasionally, I really wanted all the competitors to arrive well before the end of the race. <br /> <br /> Of course it's dated by the stereotyping of nationalities and women as the weaker sex, and I was not interested in one or two stray, admittedly mild vulgarities that occasionally popped up. More than that, the cast does not sell the movie enough, even though it was brashly thrown up. Tony Curtis, who was shot in a test run for "Yank Abroad" in the TV series "The Persuaders", seems to be too old to play the young Galanten. Terry Thomas just is not deceitful enough, Eric Sykes is unbelievably Lothario, while Gert Frobe is outraged as Teuton is just weird when he plays Camp comedy, remembering that he was Bond's best villain Goldfinger. If the English perform best - Susan Hampshire is at least a "bright, young thing" suitable for a more distinguished role, and although chained to the leash of the script, Pete and Dud have the most fun as stiff Oberlippentruppen, although the "Carry On "team did so much better in" Carry On Up The Khyber Pass ". <br /> <br /> Director Annakin is trying hard to whip up the "Golden Silents" with slapstick sticks. misleading identities, accelerated camera shots, dramatic stunts, and light romance, but there's no real suspense for such a famous race, and the race at the end seems like another hoax. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would have given it another time if they had stuck to the alternate title of "These Great Men in their Jaunty Jalopies", but in reality this did the animated series "Wacky Races" much better.
