Comedy works best when it refers to things that are true. But even as such, some effort is needed to make jokes everyone likes, and even the most surly spectators can smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole thing "it's funny because it's true," but I do not see the effort and often I do not see it when it's funny or just trying to make it a point ( I notice this mostly in the interview segments). The Daily Show started as a news parody. By definition, they enjoy making the media their own news by posing as stupid news reporters and presenters, and they've tackled a lot of topics from science to movies to politics, then Jon Stewart came with ... and everything went to hell. The first few years that Jon Stewart ruled were probably golden, I thought he was so funny, but then came the year 2004 and from then on you have a great chance on the show. The humor of the show is outdated, Colbert went, Steve Carell went away, many of the show's best anchors remained, and now it's mostly about Jon Stewart, and the show was turned from a spoof to a serious newscast, essentially Evening News, however with some gags here and there. For those who have not seen the show yet and are struggling to figure out what's on cable, I'll give you a brief description (at least until 2009) of the show: -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (unless they happen to be an opinion that is also shared by Democrats.) They are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocritical. Anyone who represents conservative beliefs is evil, corrupt, and hypocritical. People who doubt the man-made theory of global warming are evil and stupid. Voice Democrat There I have saved you 25 minutes of your time, look at something else. At first, I thought the producers had kidnapped the show for their personal political agenda, but when I actually see the interviews, it becomes clear what this show is about (which I mentioned above), but I'll do that in a moment. After the goodbyes, the humor in The Daily Show, according to Jon Stewart, expects you to find a randomly shot quote that is either weirdly said by Bush, Cheney, or a random Republican, because. Jon puts the joke down, puts it in a specific context for authors and expects the random quote to somehow provide the point. So if you do not "understand" the context, it's completely useless as a bankable humor. Also, the Daily Show expects you to laugh when they show the montage of a politician speaking and in another separate video say another thing, which in turn is put in a context that the authors expect you to do Understand this and make fun of it, why? Well, because Jon said it. Imagine The Daily Show using this formula countless times a week for years, and you'll begin to understand what used to be a salmon feast, which is now just 25 minutes of silent glances (yes, even in the Lewis Black segments ). , At first, a little decent effort was put into these jokes, but now much less is evident. And the interview has the strangest feeling I've ever seen. Jon Stewart describes Bill O'Reilly as a tyrant, but what makes him upset when he sees every single actor and democrat (in front of John Kerry, now Obama) appearing on the show and looking down on respected Republicans and savvy conservative journalists your own Bill Kristol of Weekly Standard? He brings her to a tribunal, as if accused of a crime. Often every person on the show who campaigns for Bush is portrayed as a delusion, as if this person is not connected to reality and assumes that he speaks. For the majority of America this is the de facto treatment for any conservative, unless they share a similar view with Democrats. If so, then it's an endless love affair. Still, it does not matter in the eyes of Jon that you were wrong before you went to the show, and you're still wrong. That's the kind of treatment you get when you're quite far away. Now you have to wonder what that could have to do with humor. One wonders what happens when the Democrats win the White House ...
