The film is set in Newcastle-on-Tyne in northeastern England, the city where I was born and raised. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - so he presents the city, the children, but especially the men of the city. In this movie they are all stupid, violent, thieves, thugs. I suppose I could comment on the plot (predictable), the performances (competent unsightly), the direction (lazy and unimaginative), but for me it's all irrelevant, compared to the director's insult to the city and to the people. The invitation in my summary to the director and writer Mark Herman to leave the Northeast.
