If you returned to the dawn of the talking picture, you would predict a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was a comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage rather than performing in the purgatory of the music hall or the vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that matched his image. In addition, his "silent films" had built in 1924 sequences based on the audience lost sound gags (eg, the ringing sequence in the case of Frolic by THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). But Lloyd's sound features failed at the box office as the novelty of WELCOME DANGER subsided. Lloyd accused his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the enemy of the glass figure was not healthy, but the Great Depression. The audience before the Depression, which is dizzying with optimism, may be rooted in this ambitious ruler whom he has seen as a substitute. Depression despised him as the person who would probably seal off their mortgage and dump them in the gutter. This problem of character choice is perceived by Lloyd as a disingenuous, happy handler. Sincerity is, of course, a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing back and forth. Maybe it's because he was afraid to return to that state permanently. The CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but only the revelation of the pro-fascist agenda of Lloyd. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was made to shoot this film because he saw the presidency of the FDR as a dictatorship that wanted to wake the rich and the switches against crime. We should remember that he was not alone in that feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax officials and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because fascism was treated lightly in a "comedy" and his release was particularly bad given the events in Germany this year. The 1934 Production Code would ultimately limit the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the constitutional rule, as laborious as it may be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-natured almighty leader, who creates a utopia once freed from the controls and balance of this omnipotence, comes from classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter, even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the country's democratic experiences, shows that America in FDR was safe enough to accept criticism. In Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR or Mussolini's Italy, one sees no parallel criticism. But can one laugh about the gallows humor of the upcoming Fascism? Lloyd's unwanted movie is turned to the right and could Goebbels himself, if he of course had a sense of humor. It presents an alternative story in which a chosen one restores order and loses honor by any means, with good nature and fun. Threatening fascism addressed by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the advantage of playing in another country, based on a thinly veiled actual persona and event. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces little laughter these days because he underestimates the extent of human evil, but succeeds in spite of his misplaced and inappropriate speech, because it has the distinct advantage of being affirmed by history. However, Lloyd should be credited for two things: First, he made neither more pro-fascist films nor later hypocritical Allied films during the war: second, he never sold TCP to television. The world after 1945 had seen the face of fascism and it was not funny.
