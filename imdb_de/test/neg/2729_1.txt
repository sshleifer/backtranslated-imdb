You'd be more excited than cutting off your testicles than looking at it, a trick that will make you rent "Descent" instead of "The Descent," which is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> This is a total rip-off of "The Core" and much, much worse in terms of special effects, I could do better with a box of cereal and a roll of tin foil, I mean, come on! .... this "mole" thing, bore more resemblance to a vibrating dildo than to an underground vehicle. <br /> <br /> Do not be careful - if you do, you will find that the room you are in has a funny smell after days, and you have this tormenting feeling in the back of your mind that you are should kill or something.
