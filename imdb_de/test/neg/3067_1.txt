OUCH, no real need to say anything else. In fact, I thought about suicide in this movie. As a big fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies, I've found that this may be the worst attempt I've ever had. The movie never really seemed to be everywhere! What was the meaning of everything, I feel hopeless and lost. Damn, that was so bad that I can not justify bombing it. I'll just hang myself in the closet. OK, now I've tried to send my comment, but the server only accepts comments with ten or more lines. So here it goes ... Bad, terrible, not close enough blood. No tits !!!!!! How can you have a zombie movie without tits? In fact, the female lead had a damn big racquet, and the only reason I saw the movie until it was finished was maybe to get a glimpse of it by accident. NEE! Of course, there was a line that deserves to be mentioned, a line I am looking forward to one day (when I feel the need to smack my face) "This pig does not smoke itself" so badly.
