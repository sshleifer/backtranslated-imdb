Well traded, yes. Well, I have to say, although I do not speak Chezck. Nice cinematography. But the script is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera in which you know exactly what will happen. OK, maybe the end is not so predictable, but is it good? It's one of those movies that you've already seen and forgotten the day after. <br /> <br /> I just received a message from IMDb stating that my comment was not long enough. This is really sad, because I have no idea what else to say about this film, which actually says a lot about it, right? The thing is ... It has no soul and no originality. Compare this movie to Barrio or Riff Raff, which was filmed more than a decade ago (or the extraordinary recently shot The Child). It is sad to see that this is a much worse movie.
