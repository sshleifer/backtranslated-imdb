I love exotic sci-fi / fantasy movies, but this one was very uncomfortable to watch. Suggestions and images of child molestation, mutilated bodies (living or dead), other cruel scenes, drilled holes, boring plays made this a regrettable experience Limits episode was better at exploring this idea. I gave it 4/10 because some special effects were nice.
