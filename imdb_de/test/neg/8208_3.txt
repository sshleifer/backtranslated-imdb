This movie tries to be more than it is. At first, the spectacle is terrible. You have to overcome the incredibly bad lines and terrible emotions. The plot is very interesting. There is a shipwreck (apparently because it was made of threads and balsa wood), and a few men find themselves ashore. If that was not bad enough, a guy named Count de Sade lives there too. He lives in fear of pirates and has become completely crazy. Anyway, he has a big slave, a young wife and some dogs. There is another woman who does not speak, and his wife who is leprous. In any case, things are going badly because these men have to deal with this crazy case. He is arrogant and poses and likes to deliver lines. The rest of the movie involves an escape attempt. It has an ironic ending that I will not reveal, and it somehow saves the movie. I would not mind if I were you.
