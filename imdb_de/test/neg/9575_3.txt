Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a terribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her chance to be beautiful. If she has denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she is beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it does not take long for her to leave behind a series of bodies. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the phrase "as exciting as the drying of paint"? That sums up Satanik pretty much. During the film, one of the characters speaks the line: "Something so terrible, it's unimaginable." I was not sure if he was talking about something in the movie or the movie itself. I am really disappointed because I had high hopes for this. Satanik had possibilities, but they were never realized. At every opportunity, the storyline lets Marnie do the most boring things imaginable. The writing is terrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so appealing and can not wear the movie alone. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and the editing. It is a mess. We see things and places that do not concern anything in the film. The camera stays on the record too long after the scene is over. I can not imagine a single attitude that would be anything but unoriginal. This group of filmmakers has little imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I may not be familiar with the Italian comic book Satanik is supposed to be based on, but I'm sure it has to be better.
