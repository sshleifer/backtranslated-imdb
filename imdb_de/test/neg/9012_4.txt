What a travesty of film quotas injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Guys, that's a lot closer to a 3.0, I even bounce up and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a network of static electricity that surrounds the Earth, and about amorphous structures of foreign cells and not at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you have all these great dialogues like, "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I do not think they ever got back into this mud. Anyway, that's the kind of movie for which 'Z' movie Diehards live live, and now I can sit back and relax. Actually, I saw this a few years ago without the proper appreciation, along with Corman titles like "Attack of the Giant Leeches" and "The Wasp Woman". I do not know what the fascination may be, but to quote a character from the movie, "Whatever it is, it works fast!" a third element that competes with your red and white blood cells. When the astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) returned from the dead, I had visions of a scene that could have been a precursor to the "alien" of 1979, but that was not to be. Instead, budget constraints narrow the picture down to a disfigured Big Bird drop, though that concept was still nearly a decade away. Who knows where one idea ends and differentiates itself with another? <br /> <br /> Look, that's not so bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Whenever you can connect astronauts with landing parties with alien beings committed to conquering Earth, you have a winning combination. Add the cheesy monster factor and you're on the way. Remember - "such a big injured animal is not good".
