Five years after the US Civil War, Western peoples are more concerned with the ancient war between farmers and ranchers. The Cattlemen keep their goods, from Texas to the back town of Abilene, Kansas. There, the cowboys not only find big money, but also big confrontations with the home guides. Big in the saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (as Dan Mitchell) tries to keep the peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience in brokering between trail hands and saloon godparents. He also juggles the finest women in the city: sexy salon singer Ann Dvorak (as Rita) and pretty church lady Rhonda Fleming (as sherry). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (as Bravo Trimble) offers more humor than snipers. <br /> <br/> "Abilene Town" begins with some promising symbols and contrasts: shots interrupt Scott and Ms. Fleming singing a hymn In the church; Then the camera changes to Ms. Dvorak, who sings her saloon number, whereupon a man fires his gun in pleasure. After that it is really a standard western. it's kind of boring than it should be, but not terrible. The young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the homesteaders. Dvorak's leggy costume is the movie's biggest asset. In her she is a real movement. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin - Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
