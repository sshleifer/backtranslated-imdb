There is only one word to define the entire film, namely: terrible. How "Mostly Martha" was redone is terrible. The title of the movie is terrible. The actors are terrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cooking with the US is terrible. If you have seen "Bella Martha", this is the original title and means "Beautiful Martha". This is a punch in the stomach. The acting of Ms. Jones is so bad and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, who considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp), would have done better. Not to mention the chef, who was better off playing a different role. And the little girl ... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very nice movie, an authentic one ... why was it redone? There was a story ... here they took it out. There is no story ... What should it represent? In a way, this movie was perfect as well. You know when all the ingredients go together? That's the case here. A perfect crap ....
