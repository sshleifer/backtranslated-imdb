-SPOILERS ------------ I'm a fan of 60's and 70's French cinema, but not necessarily the more modern one, so frankly, I've seen it because of Bellucci. She is very young here, extremely beautiful and on top of that this film supposedly met with Cassel, so it has a special place. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very beautiful style reminiscent of DePalma. Then we are suddenly thrown back flashback, and the back and forth goes on, which becomes tiring. I do not mind taking a flashback, but do it and do it with the man !!! A certain hole in the storyline that allows the rest of the story never lets me enjoy the rest. I can tolerate small holes here and there, but do not support the entire action on hot air. This is the story of a man who is literally looking for an old flame. This is the main story. I'll go along, if the story will eventually convince me that really mysterious things are going on, but in th is history, there's nothing really mysterious. Bellucci-Cassel are a couple, then Bellucci must go urgently to Italy (not the farthest place in the world of Paris) and she leaves him a message that later explains that he is not OK, so what? Do not these people have phones? Supposedly she was on the road for 2 months (not exactly a century) and would not call her friend in Paris to see how he was doing. Of course not. Instead, even if she comes back, she forgets everything about him. And that's fine, but later in the film, she tells her friend that it's her greatest love and that she's ready to get involved for the first time in her life. She could not call him for two months and never tried to return with him. And what about Cassel's character? He probably could not find her in Italy, really hard to find someone in Italy who probably looks like Siberia actress, who is probably even listed in the art papers. And after 2 months, if she returns, it's really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. They say she wanted to avoid him, but no, we find out that they just could not meet. OK, I do not have to go any further because this is the incident in which the entire movie is based. What's worse, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but this other girl is Bohringer.
