I did not have a chance to watch the previous movie, but from what I've read in other posts, it was supposedly worse than this, though I doubt it's possible. I'm a big fan of the zombie genre, and I'm intrigued by the psychological aspects of looking at creatures that are human in every way, a cruelty worthy of being shot in the head. Apart from that, HOTD 2 takes the zombie movie to a new level. <br /> <br /> Without making big spoilers (which I absolutely should not do, so you do not take the time to watch this movie.)) I want my complete contempt for the way the writers of this movie are doing the special units represent our countries. Gomer Pile would probably have survived longer than the "Spec Ops" soldiers in this film. To scream out loud, they should have called them Special Education Forces instead. If you write a script into which you send an elite team to deal with the outbreak of zombies, the soldiers must at least be smarter than the wandering corpses. I understand that you have to kill some or most of the team, but you can find better ways than letting their machine guns off and going over to lay a tender hand on the drooling madman's shoulder rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark, spooky cellar. <br /> <br /> The authors are actually trying to bring the whole zombie thing to a higher technical level by becoming a virus for which they are looking for a vaccine. and the idea has an advantage if it is not in the midst of such a ridiculous portrayal of headstrong filmmaking. I mean, come on, zombie movies are not exactly "high art", and the viewer is looking for a bit of fun and thrills, but HOTD 2 is the kind of cheese that makes the channel disgusted and awe at the mere stupidity of the characters. If you're a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.
