It's great to hear the three comments indicating what "Footballers Wives" means to women. The title alone eliminates any alleged equality that women have in the media industry or in society, and reduces it to two-dimensional cartoon cartoons in which men think women should behave. It is a postmodern, joking farce. It might as well be called "Footballers Wifey, who stays home and knows her place." <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it could indeed be a kind of parody of the representation of British garbage by celebrities and the role they play in maintaining a patriarchal society. This way, women can undermine stereotypes by behaving like these stereotypes and having the image created by men for them. No, that would be too ironic and smart. I also feel like praising it. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is easy to camp and exaggerated to be taken seriously. Just like an even cheaper Cruella de Ville. She just needs a few crazy, condescending but self-cherishing laughs to show her true acting reach. Oh, does she? Law. It sums up who it is. Either "clever, clever" journos who think it's a startling show of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think it's "real." "Finest actors"? OH MY GOD!! Stop watching this aftermath of a pantomime and get a life. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely sexist and of such low quality that those who like it think they are "in" the "joke". Are the actors really interested or do they understand what they communicate? It is so humiliating for women and men. They are not all selfish, selfish and football-loving materialistic idiots who think women are just another trophy that should be presented to the public. It's so humiliating. I am sure that in her "real" life, Mrs. Lucker could easily stand against her and turn her around, as it is so easy in "Footballers Wives". <br /> <br /> But of course not really important I mean, it's just a TV program. So please let it hurt. It is terrible and is only considered in the same contradiction for which 'Prisoner Cell Block H' was so lovingly remembered. <br /> <br /> How did that happen? It's certainly not subtle or complex. It could only come from the same group of thinkers that FHM magazine has read, which considers it "alright" to watch soft porn, and so many women who bow to their "will" and chant patriotic and racist comments "whenever you want" Football team losses / gains It's totally awesome.
