I seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out, but over the years it had avoided seeing it. I wish I had waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I do not know. I was younger then but it did not seem like the world was so different. Michelle Pfeiffer, as nice as she is, never convinces. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the landscape, but stuffs it like a gerbil in her cheeks, to save her later. As a mob boss, Dean Stockwell is as compelling as James Gandolfini would be as the Bolshoi's main dancer. And Matthew Modine showed the most pronounced case of late puberty I've ever seen. All in all, it's not bad enough to tear your eyes out to a melon baller, but it's not far off.
