I am a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs. Python" and working on making my collection with titles as good as "Troll 2" and "What's up Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to get on the list of wonderful horrible movies. It's just lame. The guy who said he had a better dialogue with his potted plants has it right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot runs into the car, it seems as if he knew it would go up in the air. There was no reason why he would go in that direction. "Judge, jury and executioner," "The perfect cop ... but they've gone too far." I mean, come on, why do people make these movies more? ROTOR. Do it because it's hysterically horrible, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it's not even bad enough to be so bad that it's worth seeing. This is part of the home theater collection of a person they can be proud of, but that's all. I'm busy, it was on an HBO channel (with only 1 star, which is why I looked at it) because it did not belong there. Even if you love bad movies, do not look at this movie. It's embarrassing
