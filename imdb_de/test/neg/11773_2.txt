I saw this here in Sundance and I do not know why it won the director's award. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. It's the kind of movie that's only appreciated by film festival snobs, who believe that every movie that many people like has to be among them. <br /> <br /> The jury of Sundance this year seemed to consciously endeavor to reward the underdog films with extremely low budget. That's all well and good, but this wandering, tearing chaos looks like a home theater. Mini DV footage in a snowy gray winter leads to a drab look for a drab movie. <br /> <br /> Certain motives (snakes) are struck to death, though they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> Well, it was not all bad. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She will visit places, and she deserves it. Your co-star Hugh Dillon is also doing a good job. Honestly, there are many beautiful moments in this movie, but they just do not go well together.
