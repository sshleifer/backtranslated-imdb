I have to admit that I'm disappointed after watching this movie. I had expected much more from the followers. The movie was absolutely terrible. There was a lack of action and the acting was not the best. Do not waste your time. The movie is not what the trailers make you think. I would say that I usually do not write anything about movies on IMDb (in fact, this is my first), but this movie was such a disappointment that I just registered to let people know that they were spending their time and money do not waste. The storyline is that of a robbery that's about to happen, and it looks like it had the potential to be good, but the things that happen in the movie are a long way off to be credible. Look at another movie instead, maybe the inner man ???
