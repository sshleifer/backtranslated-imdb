Okay, there's no way to gloss over this. The plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was unreasonable, the effects were ridiculous, and all outdoor scenes had apparently been filmed in New York's Central Park. I said there was something about this movie that I could not leave. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super-vixens or the Amazonian women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can not sit on the edge and criticize, without pointing out some redeeming qualities here they are. <br /> <br /> A violent leap in the women's lib movement will be presented in a wilderness setting (of course in Central Park), and all the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed. In addition, some scenes where certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic (you'll find that I'm writing rather dramatically than writing convincingly). <br /> <br /> I can only say that some people watch B movies and I am one of them. If you are one of them, try it. Cheers, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for eternity.
