The guys were the most attractive things in the entire movie. The girls were lame and pathetic, I mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies and production studios and not smell that bomb from afar? in order to gain a responsibility that I do not really understand with the sense of punishment ..., you will be sent to paris, far from home, to live with the so-called strict grandfather, who has an important position in paris. I can not really remember what he was, so who cares? The detail does not help, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something. So what exactly do they learn if they can meet two French boys and manipulate the guy watching them so they can hit these guys on scooters? the typical film for young people, where all children at the age of ten feel uncomfortable and can afford to travel to Paris or to a faraway country far from their parents? I do not really like the olsen anyway, they could never really shake off the image of Michelle at full house ... if they did not see that, they were lucky from the start. (F F-)
