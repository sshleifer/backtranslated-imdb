This catastrophe film is a 1973 movie remake of the same title based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is right next to the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also on the edges of plate tectonics, whose displacement will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese name for tidal wave). Of course, this is a natural requirement for a disaster picture. Hollywood has a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently The Day After Tomorrow, which addresses the issue of how global warming is triggering natural disasters around the world. <br /> <br /> But I have to say the following: The Sinking of Japan makes all the aforementioned films look like classics. This catastrophe film is a disaster, a huge one. Watching my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that does not appeal to the film and feels like it has exaggerated its running time. <br /> <br /> The special effects are beautiful to look at. From satellite imagery from space to the vivid replica of all natural disasters that can hit the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, spectacular computer-generated graphics do not make a film tasty, because too much of the good is just boredom. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the trailer that seduces you through the effects and the effects, certain scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, these scenes are indeed. There are no details and everything is seen from a distance in a divine way. Things happen on screen as well, with an attempt to go deeper into the depths to see the problems up close. It's like Godzilla upsetting buildings, and it's as if there's no human or loss of life through this single act. As morbid as it sounds, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan not only suffers a disaster with an extremely low death toll, not when the filmmakers unleash chaos on such an epic scale. <br /> <br /> Attempt to weave a romance into the movie made a sore thumb. There are many characters in the film, but each of them has no real qualities or humanity and looks like wandering zombies, no expression, no emotions, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes are stuck in generic control rooms, issuing instructions, instructions, and wording guidelines, reacting to incidents like a computer game, all done at the touch of a button. These are characters you do not scream for. <br /> <br /> If I can only use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are great effects, there is at least an attempt to create a microscope view of the entire disaster from different angles. It contains numerous action sequences, big ones like the catastrophes themselves and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human mind, which makes it relatively compelling. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this film should preferably be one to sink and refuel, and hopefully suffer a quick and quick death at the box office to make room for better things.
