Stumbled upon this movie on Amazon.com. Never heard of his release, but the three reviews gave him five stars and rave reviews. As a lover of German films I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was not impressed. The production values ​​are cheap, the story is distracted, the characters are less appealing and for a comedy it is surprisingly short laugh. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like that, but I just thought it was dark. Or maybe I expected more from an independent German cinema than a gay spin on The Full Monty and a bunch of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> There are parts in the movie that make no sense at all, like one of the leather bears trying to get Ecki in a noose - as if he even watches him twice? Or the vindictive ex-wife who showed up at the match, but in the end cheered on her strange gay husband? Bunkum is not the word! Well, at least it explains the British title of the movies, I suppose ...
