I saw this movie 2 weeks before a snowboarding holiday, so for me it was really just to make my thoughts for my holiday fashionable. The movie has some cute snowboarding skills while the movies are shown in the action scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching extreme sports channels. Unfortunately, the story was pretty honestly awful, the drama was generally okay, with a pretty small cast. This movie is apparently a comedy, at least it tries to be funny, but it seems like the comedy and plot were written by a teenager. The story lacks depth and purpose, and the comedy fights are more than just a little snigger during the movie. It may be worth renting for the snowboarding action alone, but there are also many films that deal exclusively with snowboarding stunts and do not contain a hilarious, badly written story.
