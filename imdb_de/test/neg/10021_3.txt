I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film as it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS box and was very excited. I love to find old Slasher movies on VHS because the cover artwork is fantastic. Usually, however, it turns out that the movie itself is not exactly fantastic. The Prey is one of those films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it started off well with the killer chasing cliché teenagers in the woods. The heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that will make you tense at the sight. This film is basically a big, fat cliché, and when the section "Campfire stories" comes in, the movie takes a new direction and spends almost half of its runtime with the killer's backstory. I actually thought that this was an original idea. The backstory, however, ends abruptly and shows us stock footage of a burning forest (the lack of budget is really evident now). Then we return to the stupid teenagers who are picked up in the woods. The killer himself is not shown to the end, which is a pity because he actually makes a powerful-looking killer. A bit like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As far as Gore is concerned, it's not too much, though there's an OK moment at the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone but Slasher Completeists - it's really a mess.
