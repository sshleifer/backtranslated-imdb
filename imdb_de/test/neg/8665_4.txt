Is it just me or is most of the cast in this adaptation age-related wrong? <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave, though a superior actress, seems to be joining her children instead of nodding on the couch. (I would have loved to see Brenda Blethlyn in the role, despite her connection to the latest pride and prejudice.) Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only two who were in no way inferior to their characters' mind and achievement. Everything else seemed confused or out of place. <br /> <br /> Luckily I am with Dr. Who is not so familiar. Who (I've only seen a few episodes so far) or would definitely have made this even more sour. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Mansfield Park is not yet on screen (either big or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to successfully balance all complexities of the characters.
