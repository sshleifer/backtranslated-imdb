Zeoy101 ?? This really must be one of the stupidest attempts to attract people in my age group. It's about a neat girl named Zeoy and her friends visiting a boarding school. BORING!!! Everything she ever does is moan and complain and behave like a spoiled idiot. I remember that show came out in 2005, I was 13 and 14, and even then I thought it was pointless. The only episode I've ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls' dorm. THAT'S IT. Anyway, I just do not understand why Nickel-oh my bad nick needs to unite that sorry poor apology for "entertainment." This decade turns into a joke every year and it keeps getting worse. What about this generation? <br /> <br /> However, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998 / 2005?
