What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This movie is so dissociative and confused that I literally lost my mind after it was over. I will never be the same person again. I try to put my finger on what's so crazy ... It's not just the funny techno music or the "out of time" medieval / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander setting or the comical CGI "Grendel" -Monster that looks like a man made of animated sausages, or even the "Grendel's Mother" monster, who looks like an Alabama-Tabledancer who bred claws and tentacles when he lay too long in the solarium. All these things are weird, but the really weird thing about this movie is acting. I just can not explain it. This script is obviously hellishly stupid, but the actors radiate deadly seriousness. Lambert is always strange and usually boring, but for this he has gone to the area of ​​Dolph Lundgrin: I can not help but laugh, every time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I will give this film something to deserve to be completely crazy and crazy, as opposed to conservative and boring. I will always take a bizarre catastrophe of a movie about a very mediocre movie. Warning: If you want to see Christopher Lambert as a Beowulf, you should be prepared to walk around the streets a few hours later, a sort of nightmarish hyperactive catatonic drowsiness. This is true. When I finished my Beowulf Spirit journey, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a puddle of blood and milk. Next to me was a dead wolf, and later I found a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf sat nearby on a hastily built stone altar adorned with candles and withered flowers. The band told me to go. I got up and walked.
