The first user comments are very detailed for a very vague movie. I do not say that I do not agree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To put it in a nutshell, this is quite similar to seeing a really bad amateur porn movie. There are a few funny points in the movie, but with the things that are happening in today's youth, it's actually pretty lame. The lead actor in the film is a pompous ass and both the guy and the girl in the movie are far too modest to be in a movie like this. Do not waste your money in this movie. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least one slightly attractive girl in the movie and in the end you've seen almost full nudity from the front. It's worth it to see it. the end
