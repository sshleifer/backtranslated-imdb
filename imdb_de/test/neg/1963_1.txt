Okay, we start in the office of a shrinker and apparently not very well. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in the shrinking office, producing random rhymes about Jack Frost. My goodness, alright, my brother screams '' Turn it off! ''. In any case, back to the shitty movie. <br /> <br /> The Shrinker has turned on his speakerphone and lets his secretary and friends listen to this heroic insane sheriff. I suppose he should be the hero of the first movie, but he does not look like him! Yadda Yadda Yadda, they are laughing at the poor sheriff, Yadda Yadda. Now some people dig the snow cannon that is against frogs, Yadda Yadda. Now we're in a lab with a kind of doctor / Evil Killer mutant snowman with needles, heating, shocking, adding weird and bizarre chemicals all the way around nine feet. Nothing. Okay, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on top of the tank. The janitor comes in, cleans things, knocks on the fish tank and the coffee spills the tank, causing Jack to come alive. <br /> <br /> See the power of mocha! Now he's kinda in..ah ... I believe the Bahamas ... but it looked more like Hawaii ... but it could not be Hawaii! Unless they spent their entire budget on Dang airline tickets. Bah .. I will not spoil the rest of this lazy movie, so you have to borrow it and watch yourself ... Um ... I would not suggest doing this ... Sheesh ..
