... but memorable because it contains an actor that I actually recognize! James Horan is following these standards of the movies Lawrence Olivier. He has done some decent performances with things like Highlander and various Star Treks. It's kind of amusing, if a bit depressing, when he watched him demoted here. Okay, yes, there is a conspiracy. Horan's character and his wife fight, he has an affair with a movie critic as he tries to make his "masterpiece" movie, and her guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watching Horan is really the only treat you can find here.
