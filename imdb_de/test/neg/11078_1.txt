Let me first say that those of you who rated them as "10" are just kidding and trying to get the voices to a respectable level ... something this film does not deserve. (The only films that earn a 10 IMO are the classics ... godfather, shawshank, etc.). The full list of films with the best rated films of all time. I've also found that many people rate this as very realistic as far as it is in a cave. Although I have to agree with them in the area, they just do not rate the movie as a whole ... They are infatuated with the environment, but do not miss the overall rating. It would be like choosing a 10 for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think the beach scenes remind me how it is in the Florida Keys ... although that may be true, it deserves that Movie not a 10, because the movie was rancid in total. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you that something has saved this movie, as if usually something in a horror movie stinks, something else picks up something or makes up for the weakness. (Ex: - Bad actors are overshadowed by a great storyline and / or great camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD and it all started pretty normal. We jokingly started figuring out who would die first ... After a short drive and hiking, they set up camp for the night. At that moment, I entered a few things that really made me play the rest of the movie. I had two main problems: bad effects and an even worse story. The first thing we noticed was that the campfires were not real ... you can just see the "cgi" or false flames they were all sitting on. For a horror movie that had such a blatant effect, the mistake would have told me what I was going to do in the next hour. <br /> <br /> Only a few minutes later I was shown how badly this movie was written. I can not remember exactly how they came to the point, but basically we find that the "symbolic nerd" is writing a book about speleology, and so on. Another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates, "I do not want that story in your book." The author convinces and convinces the others that he will not include the story in his book and that he can trust him. (A direct quote: "If I tell you the story, you'll definitely want it in your book.") At the time, I was fully expecting a beautiful, more than five-minute story, complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. What I got was a short, badly told (and traded) statement. I say a statement because it had about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I do not remember the exact quotes, but basically he says, "We were in a cave, the cave was flooded, a girl died when our friend saw her drown." You may think I'm exaggerating and very critical, but that's not far from a direct quote, line by line, from the movie scene. <br /> <br /> In the next 50 minutes or so The movie is set in the cave and although I imagined the light as in a cave, I could have really done without the really blurry look on the film, and the blurring the camera is just one I have not seen go for (I have a really good view, and after looking at the main parts of the movie, I felt like I was legally blind.) I was emotionally disconnected from this movie, therefore, the parts that were probably scary were not. If I had been able to overlook the very slow and poorly functioning beginning of this movie, I would have been scared, at least, but I can not remember anyone in the dark room flinching on any of the "action" scenes /> <br /> The last scene was probably one I'll never forget, and that's not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped naked in a room. The "monster" comes in to attack / kill the women ... He is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. A flashback occurs when we find out that the "monster" was injured as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave. Back to the present, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with a deerskin shirt). He looks at the picture and the two women seem to have found the caveman's weakness. At this point he stabs and kills a girl, then rapes the other woman more graphically. After about 30 seconds, with the camera shaking and wobbling as he rapes her, the credits roll, the movies are over. Honestly, if I had to do it all over again and I was wasting money on renting this movie, I could have saved myself an hour, seeing the first scene and the last scene of this movie, and still thinking the same way now. <br /> <br /> Those of you who compare that to Blair Witch are a long way off ... if any of you had read about how the director and writer did the filming of Blair, he would realize how revolutionary it was ... giving each cast member a script per day / night, without the other cast members knowing what they knew The other actor was genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb would let me down, that would get a negative score ... I do not understand how someone who is sane can recommend this movie.
