Playmania is extremely boring. This is the base of the show. Mel or Shandi ask extremely simple questions that a 2-year-old could answer at a very slow pace. This show lasts 2 hours and they probably play only about 10 games during this period. People like the show because the hosts are a feast for the eyes, but they are totally hot because they are so damn annoying. <br /> <br /> During the show, they mention that we need more players than a million times. The top 5 surveys they take will probably take about 20 minutes. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. They probably do not have a caller because the show is so cheap with the money. Most of the money I've ever seen was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this "Game Show" is canceled by the end of 2006.
