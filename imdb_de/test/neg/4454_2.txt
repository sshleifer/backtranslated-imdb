Many books by Alistair MacLean have made it to the big screen. Some of them (The Weapons of Navarone, Fear is the Key, Where Eagles Dare) were translated quite well; some (Breakheart Pass, Ice Station Zebra, The Secret Ways) were passable enough; a few (River of Death, Bear Island, The Road to Dusty Death) were pretty rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another movie based on MacLean's long-loved bestseller, but unfortunately this is another movie that deserves to be included in the "rotted" list. Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure of uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and antics, both as a thriller and as a conversation. His only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) that she is shot in very attractive locations in Provence, and: b) Charlotte Rampling looks absolutely gorgeous as a female protagonist (with quite naked scenes). <br /> <br /> Disillusioned American drifter Neil Bowman (David Birney) travels aimlessly through France when he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany each other and get to know the mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale) on their hike. The Duc persuades the couple to help protect and accompany the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is being sought by various dodgy parties for some information he carries in his head. The secret of Bowman and Lila is the fact that Zuger has found a secret formula for using solar energy as cheap and economical energy. The Hungarian desperately needs his formula to go to New York, but rented weapons have been put on track to capture him? presumably so that he can be returned to a merciless criminal lord and tortured to reveal his invaluable secret, which they can then resell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their frightened refugees fleeing from their deadly opponents in the countryside in France. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an ultra-low-budget independent movie made by a movie entrepreneur -professional cast and crew. However, the film was thrown out with a fair amount of money, and everyone involved did much better work at various stages of their careers. Therefore, it must be assumed that the film is bad just because it was written, acted and directed with a certain lack of care and interest. The pace is deadly slow, and the plot becomes so tedious that the viewer has to make too much inappropriate effort to keep up with the story. Birney's performance is indissoluble, and Rampling causes a stir only through her nude scenes. The character itself is an absolute boredom, and the actress looks right bored. For those who manage to keep the movie to the end, there is an unusual scene with deadly rodeo clowns and a wild bull (!) That, while not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is in many ways a very disappointing movie, and once again a powerful novel by the prolific author has suffered during his transition to the screen.
