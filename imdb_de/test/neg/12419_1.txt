I just caught "Wild Rebels" in one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" archive compilations, and this movie was so bad that even the MST3K crew could not make it entertaining. There are some MST3K "goals" that are films whose concepts were so stupid that they could not possibly have been good movies (like "The Green Slime"), and others whose prerequisites for really entertaining films would be if their filmmakers did not do this, they did not get them around in the execution. "Wild Rebels" is a movie whose basic requirement DID made a good movie three years earlier when Don Siegel directed his remake of "The Killers" at Universal. Both films deal with a failed racer who was led by a femme fatale to drive the getaway car in a robbery raided by the woman's friend - only in "The Killers" were John Cassavetes, wife Angie Dickinson and The criminal mastermind (savage but successful against the type in his last movie) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are already a comedown! What makes REALLY "Wild Rebels" a horrible movie is directed by William Gref√© (notice the accent over the final "e" displayed on his screen), which has absolutely no sense of tempo and leaves everyone shining At least once in half, as long as he has to make his dramatic point. It's just a pity someone (2009) did not make a mocking comment on this movie; the comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairstyle and Rod Blagojevich's would have been irresistible!
