This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course it is a fake. But it is painful to look at. Personally, I know more creative, film-influenced minds that could make it "real". The young captain could not be more convincing. He reads everything he says. Do we really believe that he knows what he's talking about? There is a wealth of possibilities, as Blair-Witch shows this show. Fear does not develop from what appears to be "cool" and computer-generated. Nor does it produce proverbial lines like "What was that? Did you hear that?" There are also really convincing doctors who do not just "want to be on the screen". Another DUH factor is ... how do these producers believe that we will actually buy paranormal activities within the 2 possible 3 days (if we're lucky) cast spells that they're filming. I do not think a 2 + week in one place would be more convincing. It is also disarming that they feel that "Nasa radar checks" and computers showing offbeat bs are really scary. AND IE: Exorcisms should not be staged like the movie "The Exorcist". When will you do it right? The possession of the devil or other evil spirits affects people differently. They do not just growl and low their voice like Linda Blair or snake like Courtney Love on a drug spree. As I said, better concentrations on "psychic abilities" would greatly support this show. We want to see EVERYTHING and hear what is probably flashing in front of them. Not cut to other stories bs. Finally, shooting stars do not arouse interest if you show fake pictures of UFOs in advance. I would like to reiterate that the young dark-haired man who hosts this show is absolutely terrible. Avoid this show. For the shock: Look at old Unsolved Mystery episodes ... not the new ones (the recovery has made it so wrong). But that's for another blog.
