If you have just seen All Dogs Go To Heaven and learn that there is a sequel, then do not watch. It is terrible. It is absolutely terrible. They crowd the characters to develop. Sasha, for example, begins to sing as one can count for love. And in the end, it looks more like a dramatic romantic movie than a comedy adventure movie. They tear Charlie out of his character and replace him with a bubbly, soft, yet rebellious version of himself. <br /> <br /> The humor behind Carface's character is simply lost. He is a very different dog. He does not have a cool voice anymore, he's not the rogue you hate, he's just a weakling voiced by no one other than Spongebob's Mermaid Man. Speaking of voice actor. Charlie has a completely different voice. And though it's not terrible, I do not like it. It's horrible compared to the great work Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first movie. Dom DeLuise is as wonderful as Itchy. This character stays true and that's why this movie gets a 3/10. Pure, because Dom DeLuise still spoke Itchy. Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann Marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, and so on, but did Charlie forget her completely, or what? She was NEVER mentioned in the second movie. I mean, even a small mention of Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we have to go back, you can not take care of every child that needs to be saved.) Or something like that. I mean, he died with her, she deserves a mention. <br /> < br /> Do not look at it if you are looking for a wonderful sequel.
