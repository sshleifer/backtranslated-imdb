Impressive! I really regret having seen this picture ... Funny, I agreed to see it only for my wife, who had to endure seeing it about half an hour before I retired, while I was watching TV, but only to feed that The masochistic in me and me, because I wanted to know if this film in its entirety was so bad or if there were redeemable aspects that could ease the feeling that I was a fool when he was This girl named Two Girls and a guy ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong ... since the initial, absurd premise of two women who are stupid enough to be with their mutual friend to stay until the terrible, but compassionate, end, not forgetting the terrible spectacle of the three actors ... Do not believe the rumors, the drama of the junkie is bad and I do not see how Graham made a name for himself within the film industry has ... <br /> <br /> I wonder why, after the producers had saved a few dollars with only three actors and a single place, they had not hired a person to write the script instead of a monkey to do so At least I felt a bit good when I destroyed the DVD and threw it in the trash ... Anyway, somehow ( and just a little bit), brunette actress Natasha liked me a bit, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of face-offs, so Two Girls and a guy go down .. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
