I see that C. Howell has performed in many movies since his heyday in the 1980s as an accomplished young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the internet and the internet to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not remember that I've seen him in movies since the 1980s. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: what a big disappointment. I give some low-budget movies a chance, but it started lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman talks in an Asian chat room. They basically get into their own chat, they insist on meeting the participant in person. She meets him, has sex, captivates him and murders him in cold blood. The plot then deteriorates further. <br /> <br /> The action is thin and thin and the effect is very stiff. Do not rent it much less if you buy it, even if it's in the $ 1 DVD shelf. I intend to make my DVD copy goodwill. I'm really surprised that one of the previous reviewers rated this movie badly.
