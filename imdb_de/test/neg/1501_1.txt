Oh my God, this movie is amazing, it's the worst movie ever and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a fan of scary movies! <br /> <br /> The story is totally stupid, a group of adults decide to have a party, and a stupid guy with a terrible mask comes and kills everyone ... the dialogues are sort of a worst case scenario they just talk about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) to discover for yourself! You will be really surprised ... (not possible! Yes, that's it!) And the movie lasts only 58 minutes. (not possible (until) yes it is!) Worse than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, forget it forever !!!
