Wow, this movie was crappy. <br /> <br /> This film was an embarrassment to the original sand slot. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was awful. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible Every part except the part of the "Mexican" Sandlot Manager was awful. Luke Perry, although only a few parts were absolutely terrible. This was the worst role ever. Even the kid actor who played him as a kid was someone you might still beat, lol. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of those children's movies that feel particularly good and a bit stupid seem far beyond the fun stage. The humor was for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 years old and want to see something of value, skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead.
