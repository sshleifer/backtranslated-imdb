Although I can not recommend this film, I do not recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Although I did not give away the end or most twists of the plot, this movie would be best to see without any previous information. It's hard to pinpoint the main problem with the movie Donnie Darko, because there are many to solve. Richard Kelly's first feature film seems to have amassed enough scenes of adolescent rage, nocturnal stoner diatribes, self-righteous reasons, and harmless, trivial philosophy to inspire twenty teen dramatic dramas; Then they crushed her into a single two-hour package with a sci-fi shoot. The result is extremely stressful - for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience on tortuous paths with no sense of symbolism or meaning, to sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that he will ignore the underdeveloped action that is fraught with disjointed loose ends by playing she hides a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man dedicated to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and hostile and dissatisfied with his suburban life. We're supposed to feel he's smarter than his classmates, though sometimes that's a difficult assumption. For example, if one of his friends has an absurd theory about the Smurfs and counters Donnie with his own theory, his friend complains that Donnie is acting "all wise". Donnie's speech, however, is no wiser than that of his friend - just angrier. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is that his principal describes his standardized test results as "intimidating." Given the director's inclination towards simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie uses prescribed medications to combat mental health problems that are not directly addressed in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is undervalued, and one of the director's first chances to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange fate, the possibility that all of this is a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background and makes the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very shaky. The explanations for time travel are weak and sound in the best case as distanced, uninformed hiking. We have the idea that the author of the film once read a book about time travel or a few chapters and can not remember exactly how it works, but he was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to get it into the movie , The scientific part therefore depends more on expensive computer animations than on the actual development of the theories concerned (at one point, a teacher talking about time travel, if he continues to talk about the subject, would be fired.) No further explanation is required) , Donnie's handling of a visitor from the future causes him to do several evil acts. The rationale for these actions is a difficult one. He's damaging his school, but it's okay because his school does not treat him like a person. His punishment of a scary proponent of self-esteem (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) leads to public humiliation of the man. But should the public believe that Donnie is a kind of avenging angel who fights against ignorance and debauchery? He himself does not seem to know the effects of these actions until then. Apart from these shortcomings, the film is riddled with shallow, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story takes place in 1988, shortly before the election of Bush / Dukakis, and the director touches this point during the film. However, the focus extends as well: Donnie's gruff, stocky father chooses Bush while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans for Dukakis. There is nothing here that is reminiscent of a political statement. just a statement of the obvious. The former is not necessary to make a good movie, but the latter should be left out. Donnie's heartfelt speech that he can not put all human emotions in the bland categories of "fear" and "love", does not require the viewer to great leaps in understanding. Everyone knows that there are more than two people emotions and the emphasis on this fact are worthless: Mr. Kelly in his film pays homage to some symbols of pop culture of the 80s: ET, Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future, and basically This film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and opponents, affirmations and disillusionment, which were roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Characters who have little or no significance for the storyline (including the archetypal tyrant, the fat girl, and the right idiot teacher) are treated needlessly because the director really wanted to wrap them up somehow. The awkward confusion of Donnie Darko makes us wonder if Mr. Kelly still has enough ideas in mind to shoot another movie, or wasted all his creativity in a pointless, overworked and intricate effort. </ Br>> My rating: 1/10.
