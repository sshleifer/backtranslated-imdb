A blind man could have done better with this movie ... seriously! The director is clearly a freshman. He must be Dennis Hopper's Cola Dealer or something to convince him to be in the movie. I felt so embarrassed for Dennis. <br /> <br /> For John, the director ... PLEASE withdraw from the direction. Your contribution is neither needed nor desired. The medium of film is stronger without you. You are terrible in governing. Stay with food packaging or something. <br /> <br /> This film would have bypassed "straight to the video" and "striaght in the bin". I am a stupid person because I have seen this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF AND THE ART FORM OF FILM!
