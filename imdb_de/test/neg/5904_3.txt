Robin Williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity that the material is not enough for him. This may work if you sign up for the "U-S-A! Number One!" Interested. Mentality, but in terms of history, not much happens. Really a shame, because the film really tries to say something and says it sincerely. It just does not grab enough emotional pressure.
