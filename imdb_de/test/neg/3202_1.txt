Did not the author of this movie see the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this one. Who dares to kill UG? This was certainly not the Ug who in Number 2 was almost like a brother of Charlie. Do you remember his speech? Charlie said, "They would not just leave me on Earth, would they?" Ug answered "Charlie, Bounty Hunter" and said he was one of them now. How dare the writers ignore this particular link between them and turn them into a bad guy killed by Charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized that the movie was getting boring. In the first 20 minutes, we get a new cast and have to wait until we find out what happened to Charlie, the hero we've been waiting for. I waited and said, "Come on, when will Charlie show up?" Angela Basset must do her best to deny that she was ever in Turkey. By moving to the future, it is no longer possible to see a continuation with the original cast or in our time. I think the authors have decided that their movie would be the last and they can do whatever they want. This movie is in complete agreement with the first two. And it did not even seem that the same people had written that at least had humor and could be easily seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and mean (Eric DaRe) is especially cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hated it, hated it, hated it. I hated the fact that anyone could enjoy it, and I hated the fact that this ruined one of my favorite camp classics. I'll just start this because IMDb.com will not let me down.
