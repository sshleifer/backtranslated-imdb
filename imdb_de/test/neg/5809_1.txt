This movie is on the level of "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" for the largest pieces of garbage that have ever come to the screen. If these people were not the gay friends of Adam Sandler, this script would have ended up where it should have been: as a big man's toilet paper. I hate this movie, I want to hurt people. I admit that I have high standards, but honestly, I would rather see Step Up 2. The most sad part was when I signed up to IMDb and read that the garbage actually gave this movie a rating of 6.9. This is a testament to any delays in our society that look horrible films that are only fifteen minutes thick, fart and weed joke with little to no originality. After watching this review, I'd like to suggest "Tyler Perry's House of Pain" to everyone who enjoyed the movie. You'll see high-quality humor at about the same level of this vile abomination.
