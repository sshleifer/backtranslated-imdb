Dreadful! I'm a teenager and I do not care about teen movies, but that's awful! Aaron Carter plays this pop star named JD McQueen, and to keep his notes up, he works with the "nerd" Jane Jane, whatever. But the "mean girls" are too predictable and the clothes that most girls wear in the movie are not realistic. How would one of those girls without a bra, tube tops, and shirts that expose the belly get away? ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION? At my school we would be sent home for something like that. <br /> <br /> And in one part of the movie where JD Jane Jane writes, she says, 'Sleep well? He must think that I am an idiot! I did not know that SMS is so exhausting! 'How is SMS exhausting? And how obsessed Jane is with JD and how he "falls in love" with her is very stupid. Dialogue is cheesy and stupid, acting awful. The music is a bit entertaining and the plot is little or not at all. You'll love Tweeny-Boppers, who still loves Aaron Carter. If you are a casual observer like me, this is NOT the movie for you
