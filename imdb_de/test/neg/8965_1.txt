This movie is truly incredible in the truest sense of the word. I could not believe what I saw and heard, and yet I did not believe it. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but that was ridiculous. Since I'm a hillbilly myself, I know how it sounds, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the man who had played Charlie Chan so often, Sydney Toler, was played as one of the Hillbillies with a proper accent. Maybe that was a practical joke to think about. I can not imagine another reason for such a special casting. Well, maybe that. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan's Island, performed in this piece on Broadway. Can you imagine what role she played?
