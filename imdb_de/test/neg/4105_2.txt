This movie was really bad, plain and simple. How a movie like this is published is a miracle to me. <br /> <br /> It's a decent idea, but it just did not work out. Edward Burns is a decent actor. I liked his little role in Saving Private Ryan. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the big topic here. <br /> <br /> The visuals were so incredibly bad that I thought I saw an old "Dinosaurs In 3D" CD-ROM adventure demo with mouse clicks under Windows 3.1. I mean, in console games from before 2000 I saw cutscenes that have better-looking dinosaurs than these. I mean, hell ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one. <br /> <br /> The lizard monkeys were ridiculous. I thought it was some kind of rip-off of Killer Instinct. I have now seen better sock puppet monsters in which I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there are a lot of TV-TV movies that are better than these. How does a gem like Scifi Channels "The Shining" get such a small audience, but this amount of "CGI, easy to 4 Kidz" gets publicized? I do not care if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee
