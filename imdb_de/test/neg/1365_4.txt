I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies, and indeed I always seem to dislike them each time I see a new one, and that's not really surprising when I end up watching movies like the Brotherhood of Satan! Despite IMDb's low rating, I was surprised to hear some good things about this movie and my expectations rose. This turned out to be a big mistake, since this is exactly the movie the review points to: a very bad movie! The plot is your basic group of Satanists causing trouble, and we focus on a small town where people were murdered and abducted, and it's not really clear why. Of course, Satanists are behind it and this is bad news for a mother, a father and a daughter who are on a road trip and locked up in the mysterious city. I felt like this movie might be in the same direction as the shitty Satanist movie "The Devil's Rain," and while not as stupid as Robert Fuest's later film, he's not much better either. The plot seems pretty down to earth, but it's also pretty boring and I can not say I really enjoyed this movie. The brotherhood of Satan obviously has fans, but I'm not one of them. This is a movie that I see no reason to recommend ...
