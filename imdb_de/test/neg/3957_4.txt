A group of teens discovers a bootleg video game, but once they start playing, they start dying, just like in a video game. When they become addicted to the game, they must find a way to defeat the game's central villain, The Blood Countess, before killing them all. <br /> <br /> The premise sounds a bit stupid and familiar, but this movie could still have been entertaining. This "horror movie" is not scary at all. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The movie takes itself too seriously and the movie is not fun. Sure, there is a laugh from time to time, but the movie is usually very boring. PG-13 horror movies can still be good like The Ring or Cry Wolf. The Ring and Stay Alive, however, are not the same kind of horror movie. Stay Alive is more of a Slasher movie and since its PG-13 ranking, the death scenes are very tame. It should have been the film's main selling point, and since he had an interesting concept, the deaths could have been really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience, and the movie had to be changed. <br /> <br /> Acting is a complete joke, and most actors give horrible performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leader. He lacks the charisma to really motivate the audience or the audience to take care of him. His character is not unlikely, just very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually performs well, albeit a bit too boring to really hold on. Frankie Muniz probably shows the best performance in Stay Alive. This is an honor at the level of being the best player in the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible, like in October. Your performance feels so hectic and spurious. The most annoying character of the film is Phineas, played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikely that you will die for him. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are unlikely to make it even harder to get interested in the movie. It's just hard to apologize for some of those annoying kids, and it's much more fun to survive the characters. The only good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a bit old, but it works somehow. The film is also very short, so it is not too painful to sit through. However, I would not really blame the cast because they worked with an inexperienced director and author. The direction is not very good and the script is not much better. Stay Alive is not the worst horror movie of 2006. This honor goes to When a Stranger Calls. However, Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity. In the end, this kitschy and lame horror movie is better on the shelf. Rating 4/10.
