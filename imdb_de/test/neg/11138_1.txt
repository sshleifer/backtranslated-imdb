I think Trash is really shitty. I saw it a few weeks ago and I have not seen this kind of sex in the movies since Female Trouble by John Waters. The dialogues, the acting; It really stank, it was so bad that I wanted to leave the cinema and ask for my money. But actually I am glad that I saw it, because then I could say my honest opinion. You should see this movie, even though it stinks.
