What I liked most about this movie was the chance to see Joan Woodbury, who saw me as one of the many beauties of the Charles Boyer classic "Algiers" in a lead role. She does well as Rita, an orphan who rises to assert herself as a criminal. Her ascent to the top reminds me of the characters of Joan Crawford, eg. Mildred Pierce, who realize their ambitions with ferocious determination and willpower. If you are looking for a movie noir classic, you better look elsewhere. In different places it is difficult to know where this story is going. My first impression was that it included Rita's plan for revenge against the father and son, which led them to endure the rap for a drunken moving death committed by the Playboy son. The payback period was, however, only a minor point and a springboard for the somewhat confusing second part of the film, in which Rita is increasingly involved in the corruption in the city. Anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so a second consideration should eliminate any turbidity. My copy comes from a platinum boxing set called Mobster Movies. The picture quality is good, but the soundtrack is bad and constantly skips fragments of the dialogue. There are eight films in the $ 5.50 box, which costs each movie 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as Rita's childhood friend Bob. Alan Ladd does not get much time. It's definitely a picture of Joan Woodbury.
