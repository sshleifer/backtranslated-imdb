I wish Depardieu could have completed his book and see that it will be a dazzling success. At least he would have coped with something. <br /> <br /> The movie seemed useless, spacious and very stylish, as in some other French films. It does not knock The latest American movies are pointless and wandering and have no style. I think we should be grateful for the photography that reminds of a European city in the midst of a wind-blown continental winter, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> But it may be too much of a good thing. Golubeva stumbles in the middle of the freezing cold night near the sea and sets in a bad accent on dreams and so on. (There are some sequences of dreams that include swimming in a bloodstream, for example, and you'll love it when you're Vlad the Impaler.) Many people are dying. Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide with the motorcycle. I do not know why. Golubeva's young girl dies too, and I do not know why she dies. She is hit in the face, falls on the sidewalk and dies. <br /> <br /> There is also supposed to be an explicit sex scene. I have to take her word for it, because although it is stylishly photographed, it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. Do not worry that the kids will be shocked. You're probably going to sleep anyway. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. When we see him deteriorating from a well-groomed, handsome-looking young man - well, good-looking, in addition to keeping his nose out of his way - to a limp, murderous, hairy physical wreck, the guy makes us sorry. Golubeva has a pretty face, with huge, half-closed eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. Her next movie was to be a remake of Lewton's "I went with a zombie". Then there is this mysterious guy who runs a band. I think it's a band. As far as I can see, the band consists of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Every viewer will find the resulting sound interesting, but uncultured listeners who like "Easy Listening" may not like it. If you do not like the music, this is a reward as the sinister composer and conductor is hit over the head with Depardieu's cane. <br /> <br /> I have to say, it's hardly worth it to get through. (And it's also a longie.) Sometimes it felt like waiting at a railroad crossing in a car as a long, long freight train rolled past and sometimes stopped. I wish it had had a few jokes.
