AT THE EARTH'S CORE is based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs and offers little more than a means to escape and relax your brain. A Victorian scientist, Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing), invents a huge burial machine with which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) have screwed their way deep into the earth to explore what secrets are contained therein. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures that conflict with prehistoric monsters. Cushing acts as an absent professor to nerve-wracking. Instead of being a brave adventurer, he comes across feminine. On the other hand, McClure has played enough to make a fool of himself. Caroline Munro plays the pretty Princess Dia, who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. The cast also includes: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
