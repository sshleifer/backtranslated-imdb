Cell phone scene is nothing new ... the drama of the guy who is hit by a train, is somehow sucked ... I mean, everything was missing Dramatic ... OK, this is for children from 14 to 16 years, the Japanese Listening to rock and thinking that they are so unique ... let's say it. There are a million of you = D that's one of them. 3/10 I've seen worse, but you will miss nothing if you DO NOT see that!
