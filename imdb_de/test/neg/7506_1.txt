I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the city where Zombie Planet was filmed. I had always heard about the film before, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. Then I heard nothing for several years. Imagine my surprise when I found that it was all alone in the local video library and was just rented. As Cinephile, which I am, I have decided to give these local filmmakers a chance. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is too long, boring, badly played, badly shot - and that's just the good stuff. I tried my best to enjoy it. That included removing my brain and placing it on the table so it would not interfere with the terrible plot. Unfortunately, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad that it is pathetic. And even the idea that they are planning a sequel makes me believe that the director and his followers have not heard any of the criticisms that I have heard for sure. Go on, people. You're welcome. In fact, do not shoot at all. Or take a few courses on pacemaker and storytelling exercises. Basically, it is important. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, open it out of love for God.
