I think a lot of friends of people who have acted in this matter have come and been judged because I tell you it's just awful. Acting is worse than the soap opera, the impact is like what you would see in a 1970s episode of Doctor Who. The story is, well, there is no story. And they use the same 2-minute song again and again. And the werewolf? It's like the Muppets they used in the Wing Commander, the giant cats. Do you remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the man who ran this thing is terrible and should never do anything else again, except maybe his son's school play, but even then he should pay the public for it. Ghostwolf is nothing more than a bad joke.
