This film has just arrived in Mexico and as I have read very good reviews here, I have decided to look at it with my friends and my girlfriend, but I was very disappointed. I do not understand how people rate him and directing was beautiful, but a great movie requires a good story that is totally missing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed several dramatic Asian and European films, but they had a good story. Watch this movie at your own risk, if you are not East European or Orthodox, I do not think you'll like it. Half of the people on the show left, including my 4 friends who were waiting outside because they were really boring, so it was me. I always wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it was extremely slow, with lots of wasted scenes, the full length of the story could not have been shown in more than 40 minutes, but they made it longer by showing scenes how the monk got coal, which is about 15 minutes of the whole movie plus panoramic view and so on, until they made a full length movie a really boring movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you listen to me, if you still watch it, come back and rate this comment as useful after the stations help people to avoid this waste of money.
