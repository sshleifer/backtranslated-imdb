This movie starts with an interesting stage set and a promising premise, but does not provide the cult movie material. It is located in a parallel universe in which everything is owned by the "Blump" Corporation. It's a horrible stand-up comic that succeeds when it pulls a third arm out of its back. <br /> <br /> All the potential for great cheese is here - the tense '80s star Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, unusual images and weird conspiracies, overweight women in tight lingerie, necrophilia - but it's never worth it. <br /> <br /> Tempo is the main problem. Every scene is extremely slow. Nelson's stand-up routines should be funny because they are pathetically not funny. But every idea continues until it's not even tangentially funny, just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone would introduce you to the longest, craziest joke imaginable. Imagine you never got a punchline after two amazing hours. You've just spared the effort to see The Dark Backward.
