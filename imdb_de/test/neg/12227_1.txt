We came to the theater too late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and "The Comebacks" was the only movie that had not started yet. I had a clue how bad a movie was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people came in before the movie started. The scriptwriters and the director cast every imaginable sport clich√© on the audience without creating a single laugh throughout the movie. Think of all the football films that have been made, and the millions of dollars that schools and fans spend every year on football, and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or to be on fire. If you add Texas to the mix, you should imagine the sports version of 'Little Miss Sunshine', not a big yawn. <br /> <br /> The first movie that came to our mind when leaving the theater was "Can not Stop the Music" By comparison, "The music can not stop" without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine or the villagers , <br /> <br /> If the film had a single grace, Matthew Lawrence grew up.
