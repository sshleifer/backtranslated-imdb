There's nothing I hate more than presumptuousness in a movie, and this is one of the most pretentious movies ever made. It's self-evident in every frame of mind, "Look, what a profound, clever movie we do," the director and screenwriters seem to say to us, and to themselves they say, "Let's see how we get bored and People can confuse even more. "I would rather watch the worst movie by Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than that. At least they gave us honest trash, and at least their movies were entertaining in their vile manner. This movie is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia and is therefore a torture. <br /> <br /> Have these scriptwriters ever heard the word "story"? It does not look that way. They have a concept, they create an atmosphere, they have put together an excellent cast and demanded good performances from them. And for what? To be bored for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, which lasts only about two minutes, occurs when one of the soon-to-be-evicted homeowners shoots at the government officials who tell him he has to leave. But nothing comes of it. Too bad he did not keep shooting till he met the scriptwriters. The only redeeming thing about this film is the acting and a beautifully photographed scenery at the end. 3.10
