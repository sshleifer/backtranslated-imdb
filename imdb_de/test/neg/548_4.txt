The enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's latest films - after which he has only been a few directors. He shot the "Maisie" movies in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits it says "From the novel by Elizabeth" and leaves the last name of the author completely ... rather strange, but since it was from Armin, they may not have wanted the German Association ... Sad to hear that there is a Flop was, when it was released, with those funny names like Frank Morgan (the magician) and Jessie Ralph, who played WC's Fields' disapproving mother-in-law in "Bank Dick." Two London men (Ann Harding and Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to house two of their friends, but things are not going as planned. Reginald Owen plays the husband with several personalities. Apart from a few funny moments, it moves pretty slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot here, as an overpowering recording state, and the image is blurred and out of focus for much of the movie. The views of Italy are all obvious scenes. The only salvation is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they did not give Frank Morgan a bigger role. This was repeated in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
