I was ready for a Crouching Tiger movie and all I got was the worst I've seen in years. It was almost as bad as Baron von Munchhuasen. Dead script. Dead Dead Everything. <br /> <br /> There were some good fighting scenes, but the positive side ended there. When this movie arrives at your house, run to a phone and dial 911 and say, "Please help, there's a movie in my house that's supposed to force people to commit suicide."
