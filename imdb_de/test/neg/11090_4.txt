Julie Delpy plays the main role in this terrible film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in 14th-century France. The film attempts to destroy the heroic medieval knight's romantic knight's image by showing a rather gloomy picture of the era defined by mental dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a child, François, who grew up in the shadow of the Hundred Years War. His father said he should bring his mother to safety and wait for his return. François acts as he discovers his mother in bed with a lover. François murders him in the name of defending his father's honor. François grew up like a child's son and leaves his family to go to war with him. This attitude is, in a sense, an explanation for the events to come, as on the way home we already notice that there is something wrong with François. The war did not work well with him, he has changed. <br /> <br /> The daughter Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy) is expecting her beloved father to return from English captivity. She is heartfelt and she had to take care of the property while her dad left. In the absence of her father, Béatrice faces financial difficulties, reinforcing Béatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. On his return, however, she realizes that he has lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. From this point, the film shows different ways François tortures his family. Starting with the humiliation of his own son to the rape of his own daughter Béatrice. <br /> <br /> The setting of the film in the Middle Ages should mitigate the impact, as the viewer can tell himself Violent acts were held in difficult times. In fact, many films on incest, such as Tim Roth's "The War Zone (1999)", which are contemporary, have been more shocking. Delpy appears in this movie in several daring file scenes. In fact, she seems angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was upset when I saw some animal torture scenes. I believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for making this movie, which really upset me. The quality of a movie falls when real violence against animals is used. I would hope that this movie will be re-released without these cruelty scenes. These scenes do not contribute much to film history. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is too long. The script is problematic. We do not see François and Béatrice before the war, we do not really get the answer as to why he has become so extreme. I should have passed this movie on, but I have to mention some scenes that made this movie worth seeing: <br /> <br /> * Scenes where a young child can kill in cold blood is really shocking. I first saw it on "City of God (2002)". Here François murders his mother's lover while his father is at war. Excellent scene and very graphic. * The scenes in which Béatrice was raped by her father until she finds out she is pregnant are really shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burns her clothes and cleans herself. She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach, hoping to have a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * The brother humiliation scenes in which the father pours his son's head into the food - humiliating that he insults the war. Later he dressed his son in women's clothes. <br /> <br /> The film won the César (French Oscar) for Best Costume Design. The film's location is Château de Puivert, a real 12th-century castle and a historic monument in Aude, southern France. Beautiful views of the castle and the mountains will help you to get used to the time of this film. The film was also nominated for three more César awards, but all were kidnapped in the hugely successful French film "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Goodbye, Children", 1998) as "Beatrice" in New York City, March 1987. Only seen in November 2007 in France. I saw it at YES3 on May 3, 2007, 5:45 pm.
