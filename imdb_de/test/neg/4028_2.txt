This whole movie is so horrible that it is a total mess. The story is just so stupid that I can not believe that someone really sat down and wrote about it and thought it would make a good movie! Acting is probably the worst of all B films ever made. I've seen a lot of sci-fi movies, and some of them are actually pretty good, but some of them - like Venus - should never have been made. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers I think, just because they put something together and somehow got it on the shelves of a movie business, that they've achieved something - that it's good and should be seen by people. This is not always true and definitely not from Venus. This film loses in every way: terrible acting, stupid plot, very weak special effects, ugliest costumes, unrealistic dialogues, bad direction, etc. One can only say that this movie cost only about $ 20, and I may give it is too much credit there! I urge you to stay away from this train wreck of a movie for your own good!
