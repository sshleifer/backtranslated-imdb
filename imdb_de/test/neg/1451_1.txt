I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was probably one of the most boring, wildest films I've ever seen. Especially Matthew Modine is a terrible actor and has ruined most of the movie. Besides, the plot is way too stupid. The only reason a movie was checked into this movie was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was pretty quickly eliminated. If you're not a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you probably should avoid this movie like the plague. Many people can not praise this movie enough, but I just can not figure out what people like about it. If it's the black humor that makes this movie so great, then I think that anything can happen to the comedy these days.
