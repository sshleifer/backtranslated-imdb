Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the first reviews posted by alleged reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38, rated this movie as 10. Compared to other great movies, these reviewers found Quick and The Undead to be a better movie than, The 6th Sense (8.2), Saving Private Ryan (8.4), Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1 ) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8), just to name a few. Hopefully, these shills use their next discounted Lasik procedure, which they hear about, because it is quite obvious that those reviews were faked. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that this film has a unique concept in the genre of zombie film making. Unfortunately, when looking at the fast and the undead. It is obvious that these reviews come from people who have either been involved in the production or are very interested in the marketability / financial success of the films. Nothing cements this in my mind more than hearing that part of that movie was filmed in Texas, and the random allotment of the early posting from which the movie was praised comes from. The zombie movie / horror B movie culture is a forgiving group overall, but unfortunately this movie can not be saved. The characters are recycled and the plot bad. The movie quality was not bad enough to be called a camcorder, and at least they used a movie quality camera. The acting is terrible, the star tries unsuccessfully to clone as Clint Eastwood. Christ on the bike !!!!!! Even the main actor is called Clint. He was just terrible. The only similarity with Clint Eastwood is that the lead uses the "wood" from Eastwood's name in his acting style. The zombie makeup was over the party quality of Halloween, but was not fully applied to the entire undead performer. Many zombies were not made on their hands. The plot was so hokey that I hoped for a power failure, a flaw on the DVD disk, or that the zombies would turn their attention to the director. Maybe the movie is worth a few viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. Fortunately, I used my free loan coupon to watch this DVD. Maybe this film will be saved by Nott Entertainment (appropriately named) by releasing a special collector's DVD that fixes loose bugs and delivers the promised merchandise ??? Like, I DO NOT think !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Let's just hope The Flesh Keeper is really a "guardian" of a movie in their next release ... and not a recycled version of the 5th Generation Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Thumb crossed, people ... but only if you are interested.
