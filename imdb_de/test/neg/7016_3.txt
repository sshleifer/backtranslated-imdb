Who the hell had the "bright" (?) Idea to make Lucille Ball work in this movie? It should have been Angela Lansbury's baby the whole way. At least Lucy should have synchronized her vocals. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Hermans score is pretty well preserved except for "That's how young I feel", and we get performances by original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Preston had to be given a song, hence the inferior "Loving You". <br /> <br /> Overall, I think that the wrong redhead fell here.
