Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people come together with some cash, a bit of film knowledge, a mix of aspiring actors and a lot of determination, but without the knowledge and skills to do more than a pretty poor one After School Special (bad, not in a nostalgic way). I mean, this is such a high-quality home cinema / student movie material if you want to pass it on to family and friends for free. Luckily I found it somewhere in a discount box. Sure, there may be a market for such things, but it's a market that seems to exist only by default because there are so many poor B movies. All the more in this day and age. <br /> <br /> The only people I would recommend this move to are aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. First, I would recommend that you look at the special MAKING OF feature included on the disc. See the enthusiasm of the film crews, their hard work, their joy and their very high opinion about their own product. THEN watch the movie. In a few pictures you will hopefully understand what went wrong. Bored, I went through the whole thing and obviously the director and the cameraman tried, but I do not know enough about what they do. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, this suggests: they knew enough to be dangerous. This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie (I think of a decent one). A few actors were okay, and cool Stoner, who looks like a guy with a tattoo (real or fake tattoo, I do not know), was probably the best and most natural and I hope he does. But her natural acting talent was what came through despite the bad movie, the bad scripts and the so-called directing principles. If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters, he successfully studied proven camera techniques and lighting principles to better direct his crew, and if the script had actually been edited in a week (according to the very indulgent documentary) then maybe that could have been more of a movie. Instead, it's a movie that has a sense of potential and some moments (because of the genre as the movie itself), but it shows almost every image WHAT IS NOT TO DO. If you want to see what a decent low-budget horror movie can really look like, check out Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified home movie (no joke), get bow creatures.
