* This comment may technically contain "spoilers", but it certainly contains no surprises. My cousin and I rented this recently, hoping to laugh a typical amateur amateur laugh for a horror movie. Unfortunately we did not get too many laughs and certainly not too scared. <br /> <br /> Plot: A plane containing the daughter of a company commander and a strange piece of technology crashes in an airplane In the area where our furry friend lives, the company boss puts together a team of personalities, instead of experienced hunters to get it back. <br /> <br /> It gets pretty boring for the first 3/4 of the movie. It's mostly footage of Big Foot lurking in the trees, with party members occasionally listening to it and passing it on as nothing. From the point of view of Big Foot, we also see several shots of the group, and he obviously sees in the thermal view. To set up the plot, we need to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire about ways to justify the existence and actions of the Sasquatches. "Maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming". Sure, we'll see later that he can. "There are many unknown lands where the Sasquatch can live, maybe this is one of them that has been overlooked." And of course it is like that. "Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members." And that is the case. In addition to these scenes, there are a few "Oh my god, it's the Sasquatch Oh, it's just you!" Scenes, and unfortunately they are among the scariest. <br /> <br /> Then people finally start to die. Well, at least two people. In addition, the bodies of past victims are discovered. The death scenes are pretty lame. It usually just leaves it to our imagination to show how the Sasquatch grabs it and then switch to another scene, but first we are treated to some terrible screams in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Then we come to See the final showdown of the protagonist with the monster. I have to admit, I found it quite exciting while it lasted. But unfortunately, it's pretty short-lived, and after we face an end that makes a half-hearted attempt to be cryptic. Then a final text with a rather boring conclusion. I can not say that I can recommend this movie. It's not bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie. Just do not bother with it.
