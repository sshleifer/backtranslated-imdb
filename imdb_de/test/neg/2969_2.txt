It seems some of the previous reviewers have seen a different movie from what I saw tonight ... Actually, this movie is the reason why I signed up with IMDb. Sure, Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and I give this movie a 2, but the rest of the movie is just crap ... The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad and the effects are bad. Sure, the actors are in good physical shape, but they can not act! Sometimes I like to watch bad movies, but this movie had no charm and after seeing this movie, I felt very sorry for seeing it. Sure, if you want to see mediocre fight without anything else, then this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for spelling mistakes ... I'm just tired as a cause of this movie!
