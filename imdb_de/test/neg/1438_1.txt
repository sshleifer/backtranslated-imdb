Wow ... this movie is really shit ... 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> The story: A psychopathic cybercunt hunts and lures young men and women into excruciating traps ... It goes like this, Kidnap's people, they find him, he becomes a changed person and he's back in the world released, returns to its old ways and begins the torture again ... The story is stupid, it is implausible. The characters are stupid, they are implausible ... or at least way beyond. It has some very violent images, and if you have a week belly, you might just want to stay away ... But even if you do not have a week belly, you might want to stay away ... It's stupid. <br /> <br /> The cast: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage ... If you're an avid fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, you might find it interesting as he is the author and star of this movie. His acting is ridiculously bad and you can say that he is the one who wrote the horrible screenplay. Kevin Gage ... Well, they say he starred in a lot of other movies I've seen, but I can not remember any of them ... and you will not remember him. Do the movie ... you do not do it well ... you just do it ... <br /> <br /> One to five scale: 1 It's bad ... It's very, very bad. In fact, it is so bad that this movie should come with a clip-on pistol to treat Russian Rullet with ...
