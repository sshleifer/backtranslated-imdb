This is the worst movie I have ever seen. From the faint-looking, poorly lit stage sets, to the ridiculous acting, the infantile conspiracy, to the shitty, lengthy action sequences, this movie is so bad, it's funny. For about ten minutes. After that, grab the remote control or power outlet to end this movie. Although it was obviously made from the entire tongue of the entire production and acting staff (God please), I found Jack Frost 2 so awful that it was second to none for more than fifteen minutes. If you do not get enough after this time, you must indulge in substance abuse.
