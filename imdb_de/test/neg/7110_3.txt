This 1988 movie was recently shown on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie that supposedly started, but because a mix-up, Rent-a-Cop, was shown in that window. We never saw it when it was released commercially. We dared. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonders what the people behind the picture had for "Rent-a-Cop" or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. It looks like this movie has failed for a long time. This movie does not add anything new to the genre. It is absolutely predictable, because once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what went on behind the scenes, or maybe the direction Jerry London gave him, had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has an expression throughout the movie. He just does not register emotions. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli makes no sense as a whore who witnessed the original slaughter at the Hotel Chicago. The romance between her Della and the church seems wrong from the start. She and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this turkey.
