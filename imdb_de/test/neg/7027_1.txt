"Mame" is a shame for many things - for Lucille Ball, for a story that has often been told better, and for the music genre as a whole. Ms. Ball does not understand her character at all and seems to be heavily sedated. Bea Arthur is good, but it is not enough. The production is very inferior and cheap, the songs are below average and almost every joke goes wrong. Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to slow down to a tempo. Avoid at all costs, but see the adorable "Auntie Mame".
