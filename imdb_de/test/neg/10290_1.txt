I'm not sure who recommended the surveillance, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Fat Guys At the Movies". The person said they were surprised at how great it was and said it was one of the wildest / most disturbing films. (I paraphrase and do this only out of memory, so forgive me if I quoted wrongly.) Anyway, I've decided to look at this. So I blame myself for my own miscalculation when I saw one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt I've ever called a movie "stupid," but that was the first word that came to mind for a third, and I remembered it to the end. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? Incredible premise and reactions, unbelievable brain dead characters (could be guilty of writing or actors or just doing both) and hugely bad acting. I'd rather believe Bill Pullman as President of the United States than an FBI agent here. (Of course there is a reason for that, and I'll go into it in part.) And to top it off, if you can not see the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, you have to do so came too late to the theater or came in the room, to see it late. Do not worry, they will tell you the "turn" every five minutes thereafter. <br /> <br /> There were several serial killers who were unleashed in the most distressed city in the district or around the world. But there is more to the story! Some stupid and corrupt police officers like to blow tires for their own amusement. Could there possibly be more? Oh yes, there is a family, maybe not, but there are four people, a boy, a girl and an adult couple. The girl says that she sees things with far less conviction than Cole sees in The Sixth Sense Dead. It has to be more than what I mentioned! That makes a movie interesting! Adding so many subplots that may or may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, then I move on. We have stupid FBI agents who made me laugh. A pair of Giggling Drogies who first shocked their dealer ODs but then resorted to robberies. A handsome policeman who must have been employed for reasons of comedy and always fights against an angry / suspected police officer. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who not only called his performance, he barely wrote it down. <br /> <br /> None of this work. They are all told in different forms of the presence scene or flashbacks, and you think you lose the feeling of caring when the first of many deals begins. In addition, some of these characters are the most shocking of all. I think I'm referring mainly to the cops, but mostly the girl who lost his family or not and hardly blinks. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's hardly bloody when the person who recommended it called it true, unless its exposure was limited to goose bumps. And what about the title? Monitoring? Oh I understand; It is because in 1/50 subplots it was only used to film interviews. Since this is so coincidental, it could also be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this terrible mess.
