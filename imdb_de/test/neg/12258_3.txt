This seems to be two films in one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I had never heard of her before. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this brew. Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I had fallen asleep anywhere. I had not been in a small town, but on the way to the title Honeymoon. <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice moments. The first part is better with roles for the seemingly third actress working in Hollywood at the time. <br /> <br /> And what about Mrs Woolworth? It sounds a bit like Betty Hutton. She sounds a bit like Marie Wilson. She is certainly pretty. But she is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> Pitts was often used in very small roles. Here she has the biggest role. She's always fun, although I've wondered in this movie if a little bit of her is not far away. (As comic.) As a tragic actress in Von Stroheim's Silents - "The Wedding March" and Greed "are the two I've seen - she was brilliant.)
