Embarrassing disaster Mishmash has a team of scavengers who overrun the S.S. Poseidon stumble, hoping to plunder it before it finally goes down. Irwin Allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "The Poseidon Adventure" was released in theaters seven years later! Anyway, no one cares anymore, why are you giving us such a modest production, filled with sombre characters and fake actors, just to destroy the memory of your biggest hit? Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones would have really felt sorry if it was not for their expressions at sea (good for a few lost laughs). There is a moment when Saint Jones is tempted to just take some treasures for herself, and she shyly starts stuffing her pockets, which is an unintentional scream. The film was a career lover for everyone involved, especially Allen, who never fully recovered from it. * from ****
