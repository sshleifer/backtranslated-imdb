In all the episodes I've never seen real action, drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The story repeats itself. <br /> <br /> **** Someone gets something old and then someone else tells them a bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it came from and how much it could sell and if there were any Work was done. Anyway, I've seen 30 of them ... there's no drama ... no one ever loses a limb or a life, divorces or gets hit by a car or plane. <br /> <br /> There are no chases or explosions - not even a horse race with old carriages. <br /> <br /> All these rifles and swords and no one makes a violent murder rush ... what is there? No Pshycos, no ax murder, no old Englishmen in bad suits ... just Jap Yap Yap ... They have an old tea set and it came 1602 from the country Germany - bla bla bla. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone to appear on the screen with a time machine and ask for it, but no ... it never happens and the only thing that happens is that something stuffy An Englishman or a woman gives something crap about something old that was sold during the Ming Dynasty in Boston or China - big EFFIN deal. <br /> <br /> Can no one ever kidnap one of the leads and consider it a ransom? Is not there an alien spacecraft that would obliterate the entire ground? Who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake? This is about as entertaining as drying the paint - just with comments. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show is shit! What happened to supermodels who wore belts and spewed lasers out of a futuristic weapon? Antique Roadshow - Rather like a blanket and a pillow and go to the sleep show ...
