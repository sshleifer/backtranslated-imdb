A fine lineup of actors and a seemingly beautiful plot - albeit not original - promised me a nice evening watching TV. I was disappointed. The performers were on standard (Juliette Lewis cuddly as always, William Hurt stuck, but in the background, Shelley Duvall persuaded as always), but the story was too thin to keep me busy with the story, and the turn to the finale was too obvious and too late; There was only one character who was nice to the girl, so you know what ?! Then the final after-twist ?? I do not know what to think of it. The friend and the neighbor? Contract with the devil or just so she can move in? What! The movie had a nice idea, but the idea was not worked out in detail. It could have been good, but it was not like that. Too many loose ends to tie, Columbo would say.
