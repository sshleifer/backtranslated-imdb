The movie is fine. That means I do not regret having seen it! I found the drama pure and most of the dialogue stupid ("Oh no, that was my grandmother's bible!"). It's a kind of bad remake of U-Turn. A man comes to a desert town in the middle of nowhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. And when it comes to getting involved, he thought he might leave him behind. The movie is pretty predictable and it's really nothing new. When it's done, you did not really care. Most characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All in all, just another movie from the States, but okay on a boring Wednesday night. IMDb vote: 4/10
