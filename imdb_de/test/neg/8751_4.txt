In search of water, a young woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) encounters something else. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt hopes for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically, he controls the hired hand that opened the box. Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body. also buried on Jessica's Aunt Farm. While Jessica is certain that she feels the presence of evil, can she put an end to Drew's plans, and will she be on time to prevent him from becoming complete? <br /> <br /> I thought I knew most of Universal's horror editions before 1960 pretty well, but this is a 1950s universal movie that is certainly not mentioned much. The thing that could not die is not what I would call a "good" movie, but it has a few things to offer. First, the film has some interesting ideas and is actually quite ambitious. Director Will Cowan can give the film a pleasant atmosphere from time to time. And the special effects that affect the head are certainly scary. But the whole project is destroyed by acting. I'm shocked to learn that one of the supposed "actors" in this thing ever showed up in something else. You might think that this is a "one-and-done" movie for most people involved. Kearney is the worst offender. She is terrible. The thing that could not die was perhaps too ambitious for its own good. Given the budget and other constraints, the film could not aspire to its sublime ideas. Finally, the movie ends pretty abruptly. Just as things start to get interesting, The End. What is it about?
