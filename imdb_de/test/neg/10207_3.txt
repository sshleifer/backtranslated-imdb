I remember when they made a big deal when it came out. They showed clips on WWF television every week and everyone was excited. It debuted at the opening weekend in second place behind Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Then it made a dive. Critics hated this movie. I can not remember having seen a good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I did not know that was what they meant then, but now I have been doing it since the movie made references to gay bars, women who are beaten and nearly raped, and a disgusting bar-toilet with overflowing urinals. When I was younger, I did not care. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! <br /> <br /> Now I think that's pretty bad, but it's still fun to watch every now and then when paired with Bodyslam (who has a better storyline). First of all, Hulk Hogan's acting skills are not very good. He is one-dimensional like the character he plays in the ring. And actually, Rip and Hulk are not too far apart. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he can not play the bad guy. He is better at comedy and nervous drama characters. He just is not credible as Brell. There is not much character development in this movie and those who suffer from it are the characters of Randy, Rips brother and Charlie, the coach (In wrestling it is unheard of for a coach to accompany a wrestler to the ring Lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus the way he wants to be played, so there is no problem. Joan Severence is passable and she has a lingerie scene for all softcore dogs. In the end, you realize what this is about? <br /> <br /> Turn off your brain (like other wrestling movies or movies where wrestlers are the main stars). You will enjoy it more if you do it.
