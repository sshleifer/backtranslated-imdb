This movie is so boring that I spent half on IMDb while it was opened in another tab on Netflix to see if anyone had the impression that it was one of the more boring, lumbering and tricky films he ever had has seen. A warning: I could not finish it, so those are my impressions until minute 54. Keira Knightly has a lot of screen time. As others have mentioned, her mother wrote the screenplay (maybe during a kind of drug disorder where inhumane behaviors and unemotional statements about emotions like interesting dialogues sounded) and the movie seems to be a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree that she is irritating (with unexposed teeth ... her hairless teeth scare and frighten me), I found her reactions forced and badly timed. Like in, William or Dylan makes something sweet ... Pause ... HAHAHA of K with dimples and a playful arm thrust. Like a minute too late. What? And she can not agree with Cillian Murphy's intensity. He somehow manages to really look at her and see him as if fascinated by her and falls in love with her while she seems completely disconnected, almost as if she's interacting with a mirror. It must be torture to face someone who does not provide as much energy as you. Do you know what else is torture? This movie. <br /> <br /> Knightly looks out during her cyclical cycle "I've got 1940's pin curls and a hot dress out. Watch me sing!" Shots, but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks, it's bizarre: "Ooow, Deelan, what do you want?" This confuses me because the accent is so mixed and inauthentic, but sometimes so thick that I have no idea what she is saying (or maybe she has fallen asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or worries or few do, was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from the rest of the action (just a joke there). <br /> <br /> This movie seems like someone was dreaming a movie, maybe after reading a bit of Dylan Thomas at bedtime. But instead of adapting to the awakening world, it was like "The dream was so interesting" and tried to replicate it. Then someone else warned, "Your script needs work, nothing that happens promotes a story or makes a necessity," and the author is everything: "But that's how I dreamed it!" It's like the nimble imagination of a child, one of those wild and twisted yarns they spin to grab your attention. And then William went to war, and Vera got a baby and then a blond chick drank too much, and there were so many planes and curls, and each one had ruby ​​red lips and ... Like that Dylan Thomas character (so bland, that's all I can call him), why did not he have lines in this silly biopic? He only drinks beer and smokes cigarettes and rolls around with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that she'll spin a wheel in public! Get out of here, you crazy poets! (I recognize that she is not a poet, but she and Thomas are, like these, a foul-smelling unit of crazy men who have gone through crazy times, like a lukewarm sailor and Lula of Wild at Heart.) Someone asks in the message board if he should buy this movie. I say it. Leave it on your shelf and use it only as a weapon to stun children, the elderly or lingering houseguests. <br /> <br /> P.S. to Murphy's character ... If someone asks if you were "in the shit," you can say yes because your war scenes seem to be shot in a dump.
