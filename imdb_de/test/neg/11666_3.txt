This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it is also one of the most funniest. I like to compare it to Plan 9 because it can be so bad, so dreadful, so stupid and so wasteful that I have to laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems So it's a complete rip-off of Robin Hood, and be honest and say, I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's face it, the forbidden love between Peck (who is definitely slumbering, although this was a fair few years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (apparently so forgotten) I forgot her name.) In the final scene where the good people disguise themselves as monks to deceive the bad guys who scream "ROBIN HOOD" everywhere. <br /> <br /> I do not think film is not worth seeing. On the contrary, I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, even if it was unintentional.
