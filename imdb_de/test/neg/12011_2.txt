"Problem Child" was an okayer movie, but did he really deserve a sequel? I do not think so. Gilbert Gottfried was the sole redeemer of the original film, and in this sequel, he was not even good. <br /> <br /> I can not really say why this movie was so bad. For starters it was just not funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I had no sympathy for Junior (Michael Oliver). His character came to me as whiny, even despicable, and especially as a rebel with no idea. He seemed to hate every woman his father Ben (John Ritter) had hated. It also does not send good news to children with divorced parents (who now make up more than half of the children in the US), when the one woman who marries Ben is a southern aristocrat who is vengeful and hates children how it is. <br /> <br /> And as cool as I thought it would have been if original SNL actress Laraine Newman returned to the big screen, she could not even save this movie. I also found it odd that she was a white southern debutante named Lawanda. That sounds more like the name of an African American woman. But of course that has nothing to do with why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie did not work because you had antagonists that you should hate, along with protagonists who did not hate you. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who was desperately trying to teach his child right from wrong, without adhering to authoritarian parenting. Instead, he came out not only as a shaky parent, but also as one who wanted to find a wife within days, no matter how well he knew the woman. Did I mention that this is bad news for children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In short, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included that Amy Yasbeck returned unnecessarily and inexplicably to play a completely different character, this young girl who was even more objectionable as a junior, totally unwise for toilet humor and even more vile and outdated homophobic humor (involving dog catcher). The movie was just a mess and does not deserve a DVD release if it does not have one yet. It was supposed to rot on VHS along with all the other bad, forgetful 90s comedies.
