This is a pathetic movie. Even more pathetic is the time, effort and money invested in a super predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> By the way, these are some kind of monsters and insects. Do not expect an explanation of the action. There is nothing. That could work if there was something interesting or characters that might interest us. Is not everything that happens to one person as predictable as the other films the sci-fi channel does. <br /> <br /> Do not try to understand what some of the characters say. They speak gibberish, especially the annoying head woman, whose accent is a kind of fat Briton, harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen. She is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent on great sets and sceneries, and that's the main crime of this movie because it's simply not worth it.
