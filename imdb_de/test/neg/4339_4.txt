A clever overall story / place for a story. Action is respectable. The kids are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain was a nice change, but could have been better. "I Love You" was more than exaggerated as "you complete me", but at least Van Damme had the chance to show a little tenderness. One of the better films by Van Damme.
