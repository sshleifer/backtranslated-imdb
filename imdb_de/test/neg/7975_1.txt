Please give this a miss. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the rest of the cast have shown terrible benefits. The show is flat, flat and flat. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Michael Madison could have allowed that on his plate. He almost seemed to know it would not work, and his performance was pretty lackluster, so all Madison fans miss that.
