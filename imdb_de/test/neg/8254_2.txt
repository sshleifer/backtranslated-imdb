Oops. I did this because I thought it was Bitter Harvest (1981), which was recommended. After the appalling Patsy Kensit's appearance, I reviewed the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it can be seen, because the main characters are very sexy, but the spectacle is terrible. Stephen Baldwin looks boring all the time, which is understandable given his teammate. Is Patsy competing with Liz Hurley for the title of obviously the most useless actor on the screen?
