The idea is great, time is spoiled by the judges. <br /> <br /> Why make fun of people? If what the inventors say is true, and as most of them say, they have spent their lives saving the invention, the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun of people when they want to accept an idea of ​​the crier they have added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only person I respect is the person who always sits on the right side of the table a respectable person <br /> <br /> of course the English snob who claims to be a businessman Being a suite does not make you a buddy who sits between the English and the Screamer. Wake up, man, this is not a job and inventor you can call yourself. An inventor is an attribute, not a job man. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add somebody like Simon from the American idol, they thought it was working there, that it could work here as well. The context is different and the idea is completely different. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea and they could have made a good show of it by just changing the judges and removing their deeds and attitude. <br /> <br /> just stop making fun of people.
