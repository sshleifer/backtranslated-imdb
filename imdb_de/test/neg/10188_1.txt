This movie was a big bait and a change. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a well-known Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in a UFO movie. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think she was in this movie to help a friend or boyfriend of a friend. My first indication that this film was not what it should be was when I witnessed the special effects of UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the film progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny that almost everyone in the film wore solid colors. (There are a few exceptions.) Rebecca was very disappointing. She is always in the house and does not show the realistic facial expressions of a man whose husband has returned. Does she never leave the house? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the movie several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe the message of this movie - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change from LOVE, NOT FEAR.
