I've never seen the original 1930s version, but this remake is one of the worst I've seen in a big production studio in years. Watching actors like Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, who were once near Talent A-Level and slumbering through poorly scripted roles, are painful. Someone Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing do not play valuable roles that have no bearing on the storyline and do not add entertainment value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a trick to look modern and have an African-American lesbian character, but in reality she's only there to be cool. There is no real reason why brass is different in this film than to fill in the number of women in the original I take. The minor characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters with Mendes depicting the vixen who wants to steal the affluent but bored and slightly neglected husband and Mazar on the gossip rolls. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring and lacks charm, humor or compassion for the characters. It almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is a shimmering hope in the film, no matter how little it may be, framed by the darkness and dying stars are Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an amazing talent, bringing her remarkable charm and humor to the little role she plays.
