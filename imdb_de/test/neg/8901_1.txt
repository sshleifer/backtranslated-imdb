If this film won the Lumiere Prize for Best French Language Film, what kind of garbage will come from France these days? <br /> <br /> The theme is an important issue - how African economies look like economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the government budgets of some African nations are paying for Western debt while their population suffers from disease, dehydration and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject was treated in the driest fashion that could be conceived by man-dryer as the Sahara surrounding the country Mali where this movie is playing. More monotonous and action-less than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another appears in this "process" that is "trapped" in the film and condemns the world. IMF. Some critics may include the colorful visual element in the film, but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They were better in a coffee table book than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the characters in the movie say something like "This process is boring" and "When will it be over?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Have these people on the screen read our thoughts? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a short appearance in this movie. It is a TV movie from "Bamako" playing in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any western spaghetti I ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was when a Caucasian villain accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse. Maybe it should symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it kills Africans unintentionally. <br /> <br /> And one last technical kill, the subtitles were hard to read with so many bright colors on the screen and not enough black outlines to the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I got the movie already summarized for you. Do not be fooled by the hype. You do not need to see this movie. You will never get those two hours back in your life.
