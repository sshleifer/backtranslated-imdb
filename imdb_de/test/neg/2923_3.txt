A very disappointing film by Oliver Stone, who, in contrast to his recent epic "J.F.K." does not stimulate any real emotions. "Talk Radio" is about talk-back presenter "Barry Champlain", a very loud, opinionated man who manages to upset a lot of people and still attract an audience that most want to call and listen to abuse. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) summarizes his character very well and says that he is just a shoe salesman with a big mouth. And since Barry (Eric Bogosian) gets a death threat, the bottom line is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of film that usually has something very powerful to say. "Talk Radio", however, makes no serious comment and remains a frustrating, pointless movie. Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
