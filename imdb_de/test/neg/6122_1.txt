I find it very interesting that this film is called a thriller. It is anything but exciting. <br /> <br /> Mostly you can hear piano sounds. Then you hear piano sounds. Then some people talk about facts that do not affect anyone. <br /> <br /> Then a piano sounds again. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was the reason for me to sign up with IMDb, because I think this movie is one of those that humanity needs to be warned about. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most action-packed part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: the "actors". Yes, the quotations are, as you may think, intentional because they do not act. They play the piano and do small talk, but it's not acting. <br /> <br /> I think I never left a movie before this movie and I was angry. Really, this movie got me mad. Angry at the time and money I spent on it.
