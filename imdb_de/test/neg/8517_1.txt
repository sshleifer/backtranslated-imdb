I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a few years back and is now experiencing a comeback at the local movie club. It uses every clich√© in the Intellectual Movie Maker's Handbook (Beginners Edition) to be as intellectual as the director might imagine. You get your normal slow-motion speed, a brown color gamut, slow pans through bombarded environments, a blank image, suffering from facial expressions, over-symbolic images, and the necessary miserable ending. <br /> <br It is a total failure, an unwanted perfect caricature of the typical Russian art film. The director Aleksandr Sokurov masters the technique brilliantly, but he lacks eye. He does not see when he crosses the border into the realm of the pathetic. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wet dream for art-movie haters. It does justice to any stereotypical view of the genre that exists. <br /> <br /> If it were fun in a fun way, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you are afterwards royally blabbered, we need a new term. This movie is a Sokurov.
