This is the most frightening movie ever made in Hollywood. It's a cautious story of taking a European masterpiece and sucking life off it until it's a dry shell like a insect carcass on the windowsill. Frightening, because it shows how the world of Hollywood really works: ignorant money that causes slagging. I wonder how many great films could populate the corridors of my memory if the Hollywood process did not focus them on a forgotten mediocrity. Scream for the murdered children! Look at Spoorloos or read the golden egg if you dare, for they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life: walking on the street and seeing a "missing" poster; on normal-looking parking lots; if you listen to the Tour De France on the radio; and especially if you think, "what's the damage?" When I wear a sock with a hole in it on a normal day. <br /> <br /> If only I could give a zero.
