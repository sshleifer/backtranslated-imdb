"Airport 4" is basically a jumbled mess for Universal Studios to try to turn a new twist - the supersonic plane Concorde - into their formula "disaster-in-the-sky" inadvertent humor. It is best when George Kennedy puts his hand out of the Concorde window at supersonic speed to fire a flare pistol at a heat-seeking rocket that follows the aircraft's trajectory the same plane to continue its flight despite all the airborne problems. Many stars, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /> <br /> Not really related to the other "Airport" movies.
