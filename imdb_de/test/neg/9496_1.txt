I have never felt the need to rate this site, but after playing the movie, I felt it was necessary to warn parents who might think to show them to their children. Please do not! This is not a Disney movie. This movie tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your kids, you are in my opinion too. <br /> <br /> The video box describes the movie as "Joy for all ages" and the IMDb plot sketch describes it as a "family movie". All I had to do was find a definition of "family film" and came across the following: "These movies are mostly comedy or adventure games, often based on children's literature and containing a variety of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds Irrespective of the situation, there is little or no insulting material, and in general a lesson is learned. "No apt description by Tarka The Otter, which contains some totally disagreeable scenes, totally inappropriate for young children and an end, that qualifies the film as a "bad feeling". The lesson learned? As I said: life is cruel. Family entertainment? I do not believe unless you hate your family. <br /> <br /> Another review that is more informative, but worth reading, can be found under the link "external reviews".
