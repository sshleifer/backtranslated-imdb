Oh how terrible is this movie! I do not know if it's a horror movie or a drama because the story and the two genres are not very well established! The story does not move, it is slow, boring and sleepy from start to finish. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it's authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great actor in this movie, but it did not make me jump off my seat. But this movie makes me take a pillow, put me on the bed and sleep until the credits run ... <br /> <br /> Boring! Not worth seeing! I tell you, this movie is shitty! <br /> <br /> 1/10
