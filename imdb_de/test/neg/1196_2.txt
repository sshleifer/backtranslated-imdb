This movie was okay, but like most TV shows, it would be better if it was just for television. The best and most popular characters only had a five-minute role, while the three mediocre characters were all the way through the movie. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British films based on TV series, this movie starts and it seems to be a winner, but the pace suddenly stops, but wait the three mediocre characters in the real world to catch the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The film goes nowhere, as Hillary comes in a room with the captured Steve, Lipp, who disguises himself as Steve and Geoff, who enrolls in some way in the Middle Ages. What made me think? Why does not he need a key to penetrate this world unlike the Royston Vasey figures? The medieval scene was fine, but Monty Python did a lot better, and of course, weird, with cameos by Peter Kay and Simon Pegg. Both said nothing funny. Kay had a line and Pegg was sitting against the wall, looking bored. <Br /> <br /> What was also very pleased me was that they seem to forget what has taken refuge in previous episodes like Hillary in the television series 2 in the Caribbean, but in the film he has escaped from prison, and Lipp, too, a pedophile vampire not mentioned in the movie at all, which was pretty disturbing as he cared for the kids alone. <br /> <br /> There were many storylines and inexplicable situations, such as Geoff and the Dark Escape from the Middle Ages back to Royston Vasey? As in Series 3, it started well, but as the movie progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable end. <br /> <br /> You should have been better, what Monty Python did, and all their best and repeating classic sketches from the series 1-3 and the Christmas special, turning this in a movie, the one completely new, the figures imagined audience that can not be asked to look at the stock or to buy the DVDs <br /> <br /> Best advice is to save your money and wait until it's on TV ..... Where it belongs ,
