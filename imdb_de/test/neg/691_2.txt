This was the worst Wrestlemania in history. The only good matches were Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez and the tag-title match between the British Bulldogs and the Dream Team (this bordered on the classic). Everything else was either bad or terrible. The idea of ​​having three host cities was unnecessary, confusing and disrupting the tide of the show. The celebrity guests were awful on comments, especially on Susan Saint James. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the WWF of the 80s, you better rent or buy Wrestlemania 3 or just another PPV affair.
