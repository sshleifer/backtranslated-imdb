Found this movie on a $ 10 DVD shelf. It was not worth it. Some camera works and dialogues seem and sound as if they were made by a film student. Sandra's performance was a bit believable, but the movie was predictable and the action was spotty and sluggish. <br /> <br /> One thing I will give you, though. In contrast to most action films, people in this movie actually had no more ammunition and were looking for new weapons and ammunition.
