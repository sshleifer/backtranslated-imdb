We found this movie almost impossible to watch. With such a super-cast, it's a pity the writing and the direction were so terrible. The agonizing tempo in which the story was told was crazy. The flashbacks were awkward. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy metaphors - the river, the cat - were repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> The film Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was written and staged more closely. <br /> <br /> The photograph in Empire Falls was lovely. Too bad it was not a travelogue. <br /> <br /> I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some problems with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Maybe the screenwriters and the director were so impressed by the novel's reputation that they felt they had to include every damn thing in their film. This should be a TV movie, guys, not books on cassette.
