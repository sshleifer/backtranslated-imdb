First let me say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is by far the biggest sport and our national team, the Springboks, has twice won the rugby world cup. So here it is a big deal. I have played all my life and am shocked by the lack of attention to detail in this movie! At first I thought it would have the potential to be a great movie, considering Neal McDonoughs, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole, and Sean Astin, for God's sake, but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport. They basically mixed it with your normal, everyday American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values ​​of rugby, but the discipline or should I say the total lack of it during the games is contradictory. In the final, it looks more like an NFL game, in which Penning went to the referee many times against the ball ... that would have immediately led to some red cards, because such a foul would never go unpunished with a referee, I can assure you of that! You also could not find a coach in World Rugby who would have so little control over his team. Each coach would drop a player's head if he deliberately stiffens an opposing player or double-plays him, as in the final ... red card and certain suspension, point. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd that a coach would take a brand new player who has played wings all his life, whom I gather, who will transfer him to a highly specialized hooker and say that for the good of it of the TEAM. What?! Hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row, where you can scramble extremely well and preferably throw in the ball at line-out time, which Penning NEVER does for any reason. Moving the wing to the hooker without lengthy training would, for the first time, result in your team dying at the scrum time. Second, the poor kid would probably break his neck! How good is that for the team I ask you? After all, the overall high emotional mood of the film is much too much, because although rugby is a great sport and builds great friendships and team spirit, you rarely get that out of hand. I've seen real football dramas with less emotion than in this movie, and it turned out that the acting skills of Sean (Penning) are being pulled too far and the film attempts are forcing the audience into an emotional reaction. This is sometimes boring and hard to look at. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has made some great sports films over the years, but next time they're doing a sport that they've just conquered in the US They should try to do their homework and maybe some experts to fight. <br /> <br /> DO IT RIGHT OR DO NOT DO IT ALL!
