I bought this at the local video store for a few bucks as they cleared their cassettes for DVDs. I doubt they'll somehow replace that movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibal scenes. Me Me Lai is not naked enough (only about 4 or 5 times). And she is not the Thai goddess I expected. Two of my reasons for watching this movie have been eradicated. <br /> <br /> There are some serious animal acts of violence for those who like these kinds of things. A big fight between a mongoose and a big snake gets pretty bloody. Animal cruelty too, some of which are real and some are wrong. Fortunately, the fake is a little weird, but the reality is just a bit morbid. <br /> <br /> Generally it's a 70s movie - too long, underdeveloped and not as deep as it would like. But it is something else, right? ONE AND ONE HALF STAR!
