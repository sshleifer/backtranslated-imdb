The film started very well ... so far could Isabelle's exorcism be believed ... but later, my God !!! I did not know if it was a horror movie, a drama or a must not to see one! The obsessed creature that attacked the sheriff had no connection whatsoever to the movie ... the make-up !! Well, it looked pretty real in the beginning, but at the end of the last part of the movie, the make-up (especially teeth and eyes) was over the top. If you want to see a good "exorcism" movie, check out "The exorcism of Emily Rose". <br /> <br /> Along with "Hard Candy" (totally boring, pathetic plot and end), these two movies are the worst I've seen from Lionsgate !! But the film company has given the horror movie fans excellent films, but with this movie you wish you never rent them !! Exorcism movie fans, just stay with two "The Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
