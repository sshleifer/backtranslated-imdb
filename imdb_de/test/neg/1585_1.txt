This is the bleak story of the selfish affair between two unlikely people, one married to another. It's high on my list of the most boring movies of all time and I'm a tough romantic. My husband decided after the first hour of the three, at that time, little had happened. The desert landscape is spectacular, with the endless sand and sunshine on Katharine's golden hair. Cinematography, however, is not a brilliant movie unless it is a travelogue by National Geographic. The wonderful Sahara landscape in this ill-invented story is like putting a perfume on a pig. The film revolves around a heavily burned, dying pilot named Count Laszlo de Almasy, who remains in the care of a Canadian army nurse Hana during World War II Italy. He does not seem to remember much about his life, but a book in his possession reveals his story VERY SLOW with the help of a man from his past, Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to map the Sahara Desert. He entered into an affair with Ms. Katherine of a co-investigator who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile, Laszlo's sister has her own affair with a sikh nicknamed Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines. <br /> <br /> My disputes with this film are long, long and boring for beginners. I can not blame acting, it's just not a good story. Caravaggio seems to be unnecessary, his connection to Almasy is sketchy. He has a torture scene, but does not seem to serve any purpose in the film. <br /> <br /> The key issue is that the two parties to this affair, Almasy and Katharine, are unfortunate, shallow and dull. They are just not very nice, so there is no one to enjoy. Almasy is cool, reserved, haughty, and finally disgusting at the wife of another man. Katharine is also distanced and uncomfortable, not to mention a deplorable lack of guilt or a sense of her imperfect but loving husband ... except for the fact that she only had a tiny tear in the corner of her eye when she died. <br /> <br /> This is a story of LUST instead of love, with such pearls as "I can still taste you". Almasy ridiculously voices his erotic obsession with a colleague's throat in his lover's neck, which is more likely to suggest a focus on Katharina's body. The victim of this irreversible adultery is the unfortunate husband Geoffrey, who is little more than an unpleasant nuisance. It's all rather disgusting and disgusting, Katharine's charade, to faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much-vaunted unbridled passion as Silent Night is sung in the background. I'm not sure if it was intended to compare the purity of the song with her selfish lust, but I was definitely not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine, but her sex scenes are cold, selfish, lustful and sometimes downright hateful ... neither warm, loving, giving nor really passionate. If one of them has an emotion for the other, he is totally selfish and definitely NOT to love because I define the word. Almasy's return to the swimmer's den to get the body from there. His lover looks more unconventional than moving. Katharine only has to run out a moment earlier, as she shows an excellent color and hardly sleepy, not at all like a corpse. Of course, all this is a dramatic effect, as the romantics who watch this story (I would normally be one of them) would not appreciate a decaying, putrid corpse. In order to recover the corpse of his adulterous lover, he betrayed his comrades and the Allies by handing over his cards to the Nazis, with the English being cast as villains of the play. Regardless of whether he keeps his last promise to Katharine or not, his treacherous act is nothing that I admire greatly. <br /> <br /> Kip seems to be a pleasant guy and Hana generally sympathetic, but her romance is not in the least enthralling, just a brief raid with the parties during wartime, which points to a little trauma at parting. Switching between the two locations (the Sahara Desert and Italy today) was distracting and uncomfortable, but both stories were as boring as flushing water. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was the tense mine scene of Kip. <br /> <br /> Since I'm not totally heartless, I had some sympathy for the current burned and dying condition of Almasy. However, my main complaint with this film may be euthanasia at the end, when Hana forces her patients into a morphine overdose. We should feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for Almasy, cries while preparing the lethal injection, and loudly reads from his supposedly passionate Herodotus book to comfort him while he dies , <br /> <br /> The amazing masterpieces of David Lean should not be offended by comparison with this pathetic, immoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in Lean movies (Doctor Zhivago, Letter Encounter), those who engage in affairs contrast with sympathetic characters who show admirable restraint, guilt, and some respect for the betrayed spouse to the total selfishness of this couple. In Ryan's Daughter, the cuckold husband shows touching loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This movie is an allegedly intellectual, hugely overrated, boring and disgusting idiot, which unfortunately expresses itself as a great love story. His best picture Oscar does not speak well for the academy. For those who wonder why people in this movie are so tough, the answer is simple. It is terrible.
