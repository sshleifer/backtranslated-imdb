This is a very bad movie. However, I read that it was done by a high school teacher, so maybe I should give him a little bit of praise for his ambitious (but awful) special effects. Here's the plot: A monster emerges from a pile of garbage and pollution in the town of Milpitas, California, and begins a destructive raid. I'm about to destroy the "big surprise" about what the monster looks like. Please read the rest at your own risk. You were warned! The monster looks like a huge, two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by a stop-motion animation. The spectacle is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Stay away!
