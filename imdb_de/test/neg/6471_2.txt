I really enjoyed the first movie, and when he reappeared without thinking or looking, I took a family of friends to see him. I was ashamed that I had so excited her. <br /> <br /> Disney has processed the original film the way the human body processes a delicious meal - something good comes in and turns out ... well, you know. And if an FBI man has a dark-skinned person, the results of the informant's fingerprint were suppressed. <br /> <br /> As an isolated movie, I think it's not so bad if you like this weird thing, but if you've read the book or seen the first movie - terrible!
