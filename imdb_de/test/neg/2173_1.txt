Usually I do not write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I could not turn it off. I do not think I've ever seen a worse movie, but there I sat and watched. It was like a terrible car accident that blew blood over the highway. It was disgusting, but I could not turn away. Where should I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so ridiculous that it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a dumb / stupid way. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to do a sketch at family gatherings. It's painful to look at, but at least it only takes a minute or two. Second string lasted over an hour. <br /> <br /> Anyone involved in this movie should not work again. The writing, directing, acting and everything was just awful. The problem is, I can not describe how bad it was; You just had to see it. I am sure that this will NEVER be shown again. So if you have not seen it, you're out of luck. I mean, it was almost worth seeing, just because it appreciated me for every other "bad" movie I've seen in my life. And for any movie I can see in the future that I can not stand, I'll think, at least it was not as bad as Second String.
