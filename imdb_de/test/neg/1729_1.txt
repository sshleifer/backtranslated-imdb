This is a disaster movie in both meanings of the word. Every character, every role, every conversation, every turn, everything in this movie stinks great. It's a shame to see Dennis Hopper's talent lost in this terrible movie. I can give you hundreds of examples, but see for yourself. <br /> <br />
