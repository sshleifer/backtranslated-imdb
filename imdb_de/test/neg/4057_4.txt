It's amazing what you can see when you wake up at 2 am and turn on the TV. I did not know that they show such films. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who was reusing movie locations or using other locations for his own films XXX Movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, only minimal dialogues that led to stripping and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the movie, but there were certainly a lot of big busts and hot lesbian action. There was also a male / female action, but it was only about 25% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing came to mind when watching this movie, which might interest those who buy HD DVDs. Sony declined to license Betamax to adult filmmakers. You can guess what happened to Betamax as the adult movie industry produces millions of videos. Sony has again refused to license Blu-ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a contract with Toshiba. You can guess which high-resolution system will disappear.
