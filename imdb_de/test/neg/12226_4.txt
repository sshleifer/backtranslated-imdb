When Matthew Lawrence made The Hot Chick in 2002, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If The Comebcaks had been released in March (as planned) at the same time as TMNT, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Granted, Matthew Lawrence did a quarterback well. He did not have to resort to dirty words, which is a plus. But when he started playing with his private parties as well as with other football players and touching the breasts of a girl, those were the minuses. <br /> <br /> But the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every footballer was allowed to join in the mock music video, except Matthew Lawrence (add The Price Is Rights Horns)! Another big musical opportunity for him, just because he's shy about making music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt often disappointed me (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad), where he came so close to a musical moment, but failed in the end. <br /> <br /> Joey had a singing career with two albums on his belt and Andrew started his own music career. However, it is very rare to find a musical moment from Matt. The two who stand out would be Brotherly Love, where he played guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he incidentally wrote, and the romantic Boy Meets World moment when he sang "This Dame" (Like time flies). <br /> <br /> Matt, you played jocks too long. Why not make a musical comeback? You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
