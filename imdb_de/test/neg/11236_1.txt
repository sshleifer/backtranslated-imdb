I had to watch this movie for a film lesson, I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian, but the movie really hurt me a lot. The basis of the film is racism, altogether minorities (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) Narrow minded. The ban on film in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and subjective representation of Asians. In addition, the biography of Anna was given an important attention. Many critics argue that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself well. Some critics of the film and the biography have even stated that Anna invented the whole story. A terrible movie, but good for discussing BioPics as a narrative narrative rather than a work of nonfiction.
