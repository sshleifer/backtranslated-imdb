Now let's be fair. To follow a cult classic like Road House is no easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and you'll get a monumental task. So, with Patrick not on board, whose idea was it anyway to do this dump? I'm going to blame the director who did not even give 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the movie. I was really shocked to have Will Patton (Armaggedon) jump on board. Johnathon Schaech did a good job with the leadership but the writing was cruel. If I refused his crystal bombardment party (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes, I wanted to eject it right there. But I stayed with the movie and hoped to catch a glimpse of the great cheesy humor that worked so well with the Double Duece. No such luck. The cover of the DVD is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes who show a 10 second long appearance in the movie. Costar Ellen Hollman also shows a decent performance. But again, the effort in a garbage and a shame like this is in vain. Was Jake Busey ever cast in a decent movie? Could not you at least get some actors for some kind of nostalgia treatment from the first movie? Even one or two of the old bouncers or Jeff Healey for a performance would have been nice. Take this movie out of your queue immediately. -LostFlix
