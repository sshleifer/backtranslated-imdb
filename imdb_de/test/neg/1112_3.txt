Wicked Little Things has a great overview: empty house next to an abandoned mine in forests with a tragic past; The family moves in and strange things begin to happen; little spooky kids show up here and make scary little kids things there. But here ends the wisdom and the possible fun. This group of children had been sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now seems to be eating weapons in search of meat (bad make-up). Oh, I understand, this is a ghost zombie movie. Hmmm .... I really appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, but it just did not work. What was the motivation of the children to devour meat? Why did they need weapons? Anyone else imagined that the filmmakers were all chuckling around the daily footage because they felt that this would be a cool / creepy movie? I realized that after thirty minutes, I felt the familiar resignation that I had just spent my time with another modern manure festival. While the drama was good and the backdrop / cinematography of good quality, the script itself suffered from a seemingly lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre. A few kids walking through the mall are scarier than this set of poorly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, and although I appreciate the story, maybe I even enjoyed it when I read it. Instead of looking at it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more accurate is called Wicked Little Turd.
