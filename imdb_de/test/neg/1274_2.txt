I will give it: it tried. It tried to do well and even involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do that much. He can not make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The gag with the bully was indefinite. He was never funny and I was sick of getting over the gag very quickly. And the barefoot baby was a bit weak, too. He hitchhiked to Florida? Yes OK. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes felt like an average kids movie with this supporting mantra: adults dumb, kids smart. And this little bit is boring. <br /> <br /> But the only funny moments were the police car Wilson drove around when he lost his patrol car. I loved this little car, especially when Wilson made the sirens. Otherwise, nothing else was worth my time. "D-"
