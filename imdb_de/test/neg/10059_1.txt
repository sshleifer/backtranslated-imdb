I have never seen so much talent and money as I have produced in my life such a bad thing! As mentioned in other comments, a Who's Who of talents like Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland, and many more has been put together in a movie that is not recognizable as Agatha Christie's story. I keep thinking about how it could be with the same cast, done right. <br /> <br /> The film is even less intimate than the "Superman" films by Christopher Reeves. The big cast makes the Slick production even less effective than in these films, because there is not enough time to get to know someone. With Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack, I wondered if the wrong video came from the rental business. The music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed. It's hard to say if the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from previous scenes was more offensive. Someone who has seen the most Christie films (that attracted me to this topic, that was one of the few I did not see), I miss that one. It's not an Agatha Christie movie. Golan Globes are better suited to producing flicks about big-time wrestling than the cozy atmosphere of the English mystery.
