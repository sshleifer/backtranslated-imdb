I received this movie as a birthday present because all my friends know that I'm a big fan of budget airlines. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy gory stripes that were delivered. I loved seeing their movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I saw Bugged a fancy comedy, but overall the writing is just plain bad and that was number one mistake. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to be a better author before becoming a filmmaker. After reading the credits, we realize that he has given himself the most important role in the movie!?! two words Mr. Director "acting classes" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who occupy their own films, and that's the number two mistake. <br /> <br /> The only thing I believed to have saved this movie was the artistic camera work and the music, (let's hear it for the crew!) Somewhat cold, really towards the middle and the end of it Production warmed up. Everyone pulled together and helped demolish this movie. Ronald Armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a decent director or actor, but I say that about him. He seems to know how to organize people so they can all come together and break down his productions. This film, I must say, can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making his own film, because if Mr. Armstrong Anyone else could do that. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, watch the movie to get inspired to do "better" in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better horror flicks for this genre to return from its grave.
