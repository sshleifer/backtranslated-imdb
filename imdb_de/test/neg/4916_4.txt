Not good. - Not at all. <br /> <br /> This episode revolves around a descent from the original murderer in the home of Amityville, who has to face his past to free himself from the nightmarish terror of Amityville. <br /> <br /> It's basically nothing. My bet is that this movie was made for some extra fast cash to buy a boat or something ... because it's just ridiculous ... Luckily it does not kill or destroy the series, but it does not affect it the series at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that the very fact that the old, infamous house is constantly being referred to is probably the only thing that makes this house a little more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".
