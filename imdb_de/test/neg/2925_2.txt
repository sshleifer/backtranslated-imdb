The 33 percent of nations that still support W. Bush would do well to see this film, which shows the impact of the French Revolution and terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post-9/11 social-political landscape. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and taking the A ** whopping they deserve. It is a pity that if a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him are not denied the right to vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no character. <br /> <br /> What really stands out in this film is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre; a persecuted empty man who can use a simplistic, reducing ideology to clarify the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic Litmus tests reinforce the hopeless situation he helped shape. That sounds like warlike, overprivileged, backward Yale cheerleaders you know? <br /> <br /> Wojciech Pszoniak blows the sloppy Deparidieu off the screen. As nice as Robespierre's misery is, it is reassuring to know that shortly after the end of the film he will tear off his chin and be sent to the guillotine.
