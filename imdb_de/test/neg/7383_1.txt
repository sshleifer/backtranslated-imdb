Oh my God!!!! This was the first movie "Broken Lizard" that was shot as a group (though he only recently came to the video), and I've never been disappointed in my whole life !!! I'll tell you what if I had seen this movie before I saw Super Troopers (which is a Kick A $$ movie, by the way !!!), I would never have seen it !! I had read several reviews online and on the cover of the DVD, which called it "Broken Lizard's Funniest Movie Ever". If they talked about Super Troopers as their funniest movie of all time, I would not hesitate to agree, but not this one. Talk about dry. It took about 45 minutes for the movie to get started, and until then I was in such a mood to watch the movie that it was not worth it. Maybe you have to be tall so it's really funny? I do not know. I love these guys, I really do, but this movie is by far the worst they have done. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but this one is just Wow. I would highly recommend Super Troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want more romance, drama, and some fun spots, I'd say you should go with Puddle Cruiser. But in my opinion everyone has their own claim! :)
