"Sex and the City" has some great things to offer. The problem is that it's filled with a bunch of negatives that really hurt the ultimate rating and rating for the six seasons. <br /> <br /> The good things about "SATC" are that many of the conversations sound right life, the romance stories are interesting and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that only a few women look like complete whores. These four women have so many partners who even go lesbian in some episodes that they have no choice but to roll their eyes in total absurdity. For the most part, men on the show are portrayed as flat, degenerate, liars, cheaters, and antics. The bad language that these women use is by far exaggerated, which involves a normal conversation. Why are the authors doing these things? Sure, to be over the top and to get your attention. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling) is how some relationships end up. They just did not ring real for me or anyone else I talked to about it. <br /> <br /> But even though I gave the show 2 stars, I'm glad I saw the show. I have actually seen several times every season. I recommend the show to anyone who is not offended by strong obscenity and softcore pornography. I could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts, but the romance was very good and the saga ended pretty well.
