I know, everyone said that this movie was totally crap and I agree with them. I spent a couple of years after telling other people that it was crap. I did not recommend seeing her. But when it came on TV, we saw the ad. I turned to the family and said, "I know that's sad, but I think about it." My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, me too." And you know what? It was funny. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a good movie. It is absolutely a waste of time. But it is a good waste of time. You may still think it's crap and fair enough, but I thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy. I did not like a few things as if the fish had been hit by the car, but otherwise I thought it was good. I loved sitting there and picked out all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald and so on. <br /> <br /> So if you want to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise you will see a drama or something.
