I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them and watch them every few months. I lend them to colleagues and friends so they can be scared by the quality of Japanese filmmaking. I think Takashi Shimizu has written a great story and presented it very effectively in these four installments. <br /> <br /> I was a little excited about the opening of The Grudge 2 in the theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before I saw the four originals. The grudge was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better, but I got a good Halloween scare from the 2004 American Grudge. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 started off badly and went down from there. I've always been waiting for it to get better, to show meaning, to show Shimizu's talent - nothing like that has happened. The best part of Shimizu's Ju-on work is history. While it's usually said in an incoherent style that you need to think about connecting its components, it's still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of deaths from characters you never had time to worry about. <br /> <br /> The editing was disgusting. Disjointed (as in the Japanese originals) is one thing, but the random sequence of the scenes was exhausting. I always just thought, "That's so stupid" and "No - he did not sell that much, did he?" I wanted to go out of the theater, run home, and see the original work, just to assure me that Shimizu did not always do that stupid, generic, boring, non-sensual, jumbled threesome.>> <br /> If you look really have decided to watch this movie, you should wait the 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people who were in the theater with me left the house after about 45 minutes. I've discussed whether to do it myself. Going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at this point. <br /> <br /> I'm really shocked at how bad this movie was. Let's pray that Sam Raimi will not spend more money on The Grudge 3. It's just not worth it anymore. Sigh.
