The 1993 film "Stalingrad" is very disappointing with all its technical lightning. Before watching, I had read non-fiction books from the Stalingrad campaign and seen a lot of documentary footage and photos of the battle and its participants. I do not think any film will really be able to really portray the titanic struggle and real suffering, but I still wanted to see what a relatively young German film production would look like. There are some good elements in this movie, but overall it is a failure. For me, the worst aspect is that it contains considerable anachronisms, and also some very fictional and clichéd elements, most impressively in encounters between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also some ideological elements The film leads to very distorted perceptions, including a caricature of a German chaplain, some exaggerated class war news, and problematic portrayals of "good" vs. "bad" Germans. The German forces of World War II certainly included men who remained reasonably decent throughout the war and others who did very bad things, but the attempt to show this contrast is very simple and childish. I give "Stalingrad" the creditworthiness in the sense that German troops are not represented in the simple demonic quality that is the stereotype of many people. However, the film also contains its own stereotypes, such as an almost too good result. a true infantryman, more akin to the 1990s and 1940s, and two totally evil infantrymen and a rear-line officer. <br /> <br /> Some new films such as "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private" Ryan are often praised for their "authenticity" in the depiction of graphic combat scenes, but the same films are in their depictions of attitudes, values ​​and behaviors Soldiers and civilians of 1940 deeply flawed and distorted. "Stalingrad" and "SPR" have major and minor characters who lack the self-confident stoicism common to ordinary people during World War 2. Soldiers have been known throughout history for their frequent use Grumbling and occasional cynicism, but the selfish, talkative and sensitive characters in these two films are something quite different and much more commonplace in our world today than they are in the 1940s today, while today many people want to denigrate war films from the 1940s and 1950s, which contain more patriotic messages and are not so vivid about the fight are many These earlier films like "Battleground" are much more accurate in their portrayals of typical soldiers. Attitudes, and often manage to portray the terrible effects of the war more indirectly. <br /> <br /> A well-done part of "Stalingrad" is a fight between German infantry and Soviet tanks to capture part of the horror and confusion in such a fight. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a bad job, though he shows the overall appearance of the frontline soldier. Part of this could be due to the difficulty of finding laborious, haggard-looking extras in our spoiled and well-nourished America and Western Europe today. Nor do too many of the German troops in the film wear their uniforms and equipment properly and, even in the years of the German defeat, they do not show the usual professional attitude in the German Wehrmacht. If you would like to get a picture of the actual German troops, I recommend the following documentary films that contain footage of the Stalingrad campaign: "The World at War", "The War of the Century" and "The Russian War". The books "Operation Barbarossa in Photographs" by Paul Carell, "Stalingrad" by Geoffrey Jukes and "Stalingrad" by Paul Carell contain many helpful photos. It also recommends books written by Antony Beevor and William Craig on the battle. The latter is especially good with respect to ordinary soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films that I think are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during World War II and the general feeling, appearance, horror and grudges of this war are "The Downfall" and "Talvisota" ("The Winter War"). While "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Longest Day" are more likely to cover events on the Western Front than in the East, they are also excellent war films and are very close to factual reports. The last two films lack some sand, which is more prevalent in recent films, but they offset that deficiency with their other strengths, including truthfulness.
