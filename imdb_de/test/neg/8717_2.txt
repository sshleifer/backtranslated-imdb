Certainly one of the lamest shows ever produced on these shores and that says something. Even many of the leading actors did not stay here for the duration. The fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment of the average intelligence and cultural background of the Australian viewer. It went around in circles, with repetitive gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God's sake. Did they actually pay the authors of this show? I wonder if anyone has verified their qualifications. There were tired gags about the rural population and secondary fringe situations that mimicked a thousand English and American sitcoms. I think I hate it so much that it seems that nobody is interested in making it original or smart, instead choosing the lowest common denominator every time.
