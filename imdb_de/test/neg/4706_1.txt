Well, Dude Where's My Car could be a novelty at least, since one of the few Hollywood movies was written, cast, filmed, and edited in less than a day. I really can not believe that was done (or that I allowed my friends to go through the whole thing). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "stupid-funny," and the actors involved seem unable to create any kind of fun if the script actually provided it. Strangely enough, unlike most pointless slapstick comedies, this movie contains too much plot - each scene seems to introduce a new, stupid and uninteresting subplot. Of course, they were obviously moronic, but it does not work in any way ... There is only one aspect of this movie I've enjoyed: Donkeylips from the old Nickalodean show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role. This is the role that will make him the next Richard Gere.
