I have to look at STARCRASH (1979) - this notoriously cheesy Italian - against STAR WARS (1977), but it can not be much worse than this misunderstood piece of garbage that makes Mel Brooks crazy SPACEBALLS (1987) look like a true work of art ! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered today is because of the tragic fate that befell its lead actress, Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, who was killed by her insanely jealous, disfigured husband before the movie premieres would have! <br /> <br /> Although Statten (who later made two biopics in which she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is less upset in a chair that allegedly a spaceship drives on a 27-year journey to any planet; In fact, Galaxina is a general-purpose android who also serves the crazy crew their snacks, puts them all under the collar and even searches for the Blue Star (cue-choral) once they land! However, in her white robe, undoubtedly she looks radiant, and even if her role hardly requires an acting talent that she possesses, it is not exactly demeaning. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless it is ironic In a movie that bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would be crazy about her crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (who gives you the idea of ​​the level of here shown comedy). An eared, winged, colorful fellow, a smoking, proverbial old Chinaman and, best of all, a giddy, stone-eating, hairy alien whom they hold captive. The villain of the play is a metal-clad non-being who, however, has the best laugh in the movie when he hears the choral music after each mention of the Blue Star: "What's that?" Listing Fi classics that are misused by this stinker in his ridiculous attempts to fake the genre, as they are not only lame but obvious; Incredibly, a breast-obsessed but ultimately benevolent alien appears to be played by Hollywood veteran Angelo Rossitto. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the scenes on the planet that you visit (what looks more) are a western set as a planetary landscape) has a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants "Human Gourmets" (delicacies on the menu are Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Patties, Baked Alaskan, etc.) Mention a motorcycle gang serving their own deity (the Harley Davidson) and our heroes on the back of it Escape, they dare not shoot at them because they are afraid to meet their "master". God (terrible) indeed ...
