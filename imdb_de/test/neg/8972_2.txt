Stage star Grace Hayes plays a major role in this obscure little movie. After years on stage, she will visit a small university town to look for her son raised by his grandfather. The boy does not know who his mother is, and if she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a fat idiot. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. Interestingly enough, it turns out that Mum is really rich and not only funded the life of her son, but also a strong contributor to college. So she has the idea to force the young man to maturity. She talks to the man who raises Peter, and his allowance is cut off completely - in the hope that he will take this opportunity. It also turns out that she puts the screws into school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible. Now it's where it gets pretty stupid. To show that they know the value of hard work, she hires some of them to sing and dance in the malt shop she buys. Talk about fictitious !! What happens next is like a long and not very good talent show or maybe a poor version of a Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney musical! I would suggest that the kids try to do something else to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay them to stop them! I know, I would pay her. <br /> <br /> Considering that the talent is anything but talented, Peter is a bad actor and his move from a lout to a responsible adult is almost instantaneous. Not a very good movie for any standard, this is an obscure movie that should have been obscure! By the way, it's interesting that the son of Mrs. Hayes in the movie, Peter, is actually her real son. The only problem is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really terrible actor. He is not handsome enough to be a leading man, and he looks either boring and uninteresting or downright offensive. In particular, all the stupid impressions that he makes are really bad and he has the charisma of gelatin that you scrape off from spam. Despite this terrible performance, he had a fairly successful acting career. Who would have believed that if you had seen him in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here he is about as welcome as the plague!
