I saw this for the first time when it came out in the theater. Although I was only 13 years old at the time, I eagerly read the science fiction stories "Hard Science." The technical gaffes of the film are branded in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following can cause significant spoilage. <br /> <br /> Even as a teenager, I knew that the premise is stupid. The rocket launches into a lunar mission, in a cosmos where the crew always has a gravity effect (though loose objects float in weightlessness) and therefore the "cabin" (the area with the controls, whatever it is) became gyrostabalized to maintain the "right" orientation (they did not land on their heads when landing?) and at least in near-Earth space, the rocket engines had to run constantly - with burning propellant without oxidant. As the engines disengaged, the rocket stopped in space and could not start until a doctor-chemist realized he needed some oxidant. This time, the rocket remembered that it had a swing, and next our heroes know they are near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that such a minimal-energy voyage would take over 200 days would). <br /> <They land and find that the air was breathable (although scientific data at the time showed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do any good). They decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire. They come armed, although they allegedly went to the moon, where firearms were not needed. <br /> <br /> You see a collapsed civilization, meet stray Martians who look the same as humans, and develop an anti-nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to return to their home planet and try die by falling on the ground! Achieving this would require such a long orbital period that they would have died of hunger long before they reached their goal. <br /> <br /> The movie, Destination Moon, was the real science most effective. Rescue "with the oxygen tank forgotten (moment arm from the center of gravity of the tank to the exit nozzle) .This film showed a regrettable ignorance of the most basic science.Only technology illiterates should imagine this as a science fiction film: It is similar to the old Flash Gordon series where their rockets were pulled off their bellies and climbed in spirals and their engines were always on The story on this topic I thought banal, and I can only recommend this as a film to be shown to students, so you can select technical gaffs.
