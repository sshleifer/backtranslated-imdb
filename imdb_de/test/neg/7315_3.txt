University professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) has made it. A good-looking, sophisticated teacher with a loving wife and two adorable kids. He plays saxophone, owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him. When the temptation calls in the form of one of his smart, handsome, sexy and willing students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), he gives in stupidly. The next day he is charged with her rape and his perfect life could ruin him forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in Australian film, we know we do not want a masterpiece. But even with low expectations, "gross misconduct" is a huge flop. Based on a piece with a fairly unimaginative title, which has then been turned into a reasonably enjoyable book, it can not convince its audience at a most basic level, convince, or even interest only remotely. The script is awkward and unconvincing. Acting is usually not much better. Watts gives a decent performance and demonstrates her emotional roughness for the first time on screen, but she's the only good thing about the movie, which looks almost like he does not wait to be over. <br /> <br The direction is not disgusting or distracting anyway, but it's just painfully mediocre. Apart from the already mentioned Naomi Watts, who could be forgiven since this was the beginning of her career, the acting is made of wood and gets worse as the movie progresses. The normally reliable Jimmy Smits does not seem to have tried in this case, and who could really blame him? However, all these little mistakes only contribute to the film's ultimate, fatal flaw, which is that the focus is completely in the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome has been lost in a sea that is essentially softcore adult entertainment. In the end, the audience is likely to get bored, tired, and wish they had done something else with their ninety minutes. If you do not want Naomi to strip naked four or five times, you can definitely afford to miss this movie.
