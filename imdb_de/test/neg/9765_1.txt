What a disappointment. Forget about this horrible movie and instead access the TV series. What have you done to make the American President relatively healthy? ALL politicians should have been buffoons (Peter Cook is good as British Prime Minister). It lacks the snappy satire of the original, but the slapstick "lowest common denominator". 1 out of 10, if I'm generous! Unfortunately, this is another example of a remake that misses the point of the original, with the difference that both were written by the same people.
