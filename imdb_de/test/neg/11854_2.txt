I'm a big Eric Roberts fan, I collect his films and have reached 60 so far. But to be honest, he sometimes makes really horrible films. But that's why I like him - he's entertaining. <br /> <br /> But this one has to accept the price, I can not wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and Corbin Bernsen in the picture. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is just terrible (I really do not like him), Roberts manages to be the best in the movie does not mean much). He does it practically routinely. <br /> <br /> The female lead (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and looks like one. And Tim Abell and his crew look like action man plastic dolls and look like them. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is really embarrassing. I have not seen any of the Carnosaur movies, so I can not remember the footage that was added from there, but it explains some things. Nevertheless, there are huge crater holes on the property. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are outside the lab in the nearby forest. But in the end they blow the whole lab to pieces and just relax that it's all over, but they forgot those outside ?????? <br /> <br /> If the helicopter pilot is alive, I wonder how she could not notice a T-rex climbing into the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The guys in the orange jumpsuit are my favorite - what are they doing, doing a jog or what? /> <br /> Of course, there is a sex scene in the B-movie standard, in which silicone tits are involved. This time, Lorissa McComas welcomes us. I have no problem with that (she looks awful) but looking at a guy who pushes tits and is about to climax for 8 !!!! Minutes are just too long. <br /> <br /> Pity everyone (including Eric Roberts) - Now I'm looking forward to Con Games (I wonder ???)
