I found that this movie is a complete waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a funny kid and is very confused! Was he only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** Why did he leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls spending their free time with boys? and the cowboy, who lives under jones, also sneaked me out, how he knew that what happened in the flats, not a minute past me. I do not understand how he was thinking about the girl who was photographing for fun and stayed in her room when Mandy Moore was always over and it was pretty obvious she wanted to be more than just friends with him. I do not find this movie really funny or artistic or dramatic or anything. I found him stupid and a complete waste of time. (D-F +)
