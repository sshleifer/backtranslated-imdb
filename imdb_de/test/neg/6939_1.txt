For some unknown reason, 7 years ago, I saw this movie with my mother and sister. I do not think I laughed so hard with them before. This movie was sooooo bad. How extensions were produced is unknown to me. It has been a while since I last saw this "movie", but the impression that he has stayed with me over the years has been, "You must have found the script in a dumpster in the background of a cheap movie studio I'm pretty sure they spent the entire camera work budget and the so-called "special effects" and then had 13 cents left to play script and the "actors" pay.
