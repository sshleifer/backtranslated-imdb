There really is not much to say about that. It's really, very bad. Acting is bad, the script is bad and editing is probably one of the worst tasks ever. It's so sloppy and choppy that it only serves to confuse the audience. There is no real plot to talk about, mostly a really fake monsterfish attacking Europeans trying to impersonate Americans. Pass this on.
