I do not know if I hate this movie as much as I did when I saw it two weeks ago, but if you expect the events described on the box, forget it ... that would have been a good movie. The great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into complete desperation I witnessed watching this movie. If you've seen HBO's Taxi Cab Confessions, it's the same, just fictional and not so interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the 20-minute break that Encore occasionally runs on Encore. I've never asked for my money for a movie until I saw this ... thing. Boring, boring, boring. However, it offers a unique feature, namely: It lets you decide what happens to each passenger and let your imagination fill the void. Which would be great if you were really interested in one of these people. Instead, I screamed at the screen, cried like a kid, and either prayed for the end of the movie or for my own death. The taxi driver himself (though well-played, deliberate) seems to go through random emotions, from sarcastic to sympathetic, to frenzied insane and apathetic. Sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it is just an ad for itself. "Damn, I learned all these emotions in acting classes and I will use them!" Well, since I've been thinking about it again, I hate this movie as much as I do!
