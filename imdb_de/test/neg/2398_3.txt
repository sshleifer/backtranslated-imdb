The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and nobody else in this movie deserves even a small star. Okay, Amy Adams deserves a little bit, but the smidgenometer does not seem to work, so I stay at 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you already see a trend? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, no chance. <br /> <br /> I could touch on a few paragraphs about how Charlie Wilson's war on history, morality, legitimacy, and so on glosses over, but I do not think such madness would fill the bubble Aaron Sorkin fans might outweigh. The rest of you, beware. Spend your movie money elsewhere. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a distinctive comment, here is mine. You can put hot fudge on a garbage heap, but that does not change anything. Trash is garbage and Charlie Wilson's war.
