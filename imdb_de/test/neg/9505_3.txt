This film is very hard to understand, why would the couple want to get a divorce? There is no reason, we know nothing about her life in Lisbon and nothing about the job of Marie. We can only understand that a particular hole has appeared in this life. We do not even know who took the initiative to demand a divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is special: I did not know the name of the director before the end of the film when I read On the screen, I understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I counted them)! It reminded me of some Japanese movies that I saw in the 90s. In fact, we must accept that this is the expression of another culture, even if it is a Western film. I do not know if this story would fit a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> You can see the logic of the scenes, but the result is boring, yet I decided to see it through to the end because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of everything. In fact, I only understood that the story of these two creatures is not over yet, as the train leaves without Marie. This is little for so long! I can not recommend this work.
