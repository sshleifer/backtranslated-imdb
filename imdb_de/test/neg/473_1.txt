Let's get one thing out of the way. I'm a huge fan of Bruce Campbell, I have the Evil Dead series, I saw the action figures and saw Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of kitschy, ridiculous horror movie and I know how to appreciate the whole thing "it's so bad, it's good". <br /> <br /> I wish I could say the same thing about this movie. I've seen this movie with high expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something from the BC that we all know and love. It started promisingly but after the first 20 minutes I watched the rest of this sad apology of a movie as if I had just been taken with calming arrows. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not a bad one; two men do not get along, both killed by the same psycho-woman, half of a man's brain is transplanted into the other's head, they argue, contradict each other, and the comedy follows. <br /> <br /> What killed me is how extremely disorganized and boring it was! It had the potential to be so much better even as a camp film than it was. The plot was boring, even Bruce's crazy physical baton could not work. <br /> <br /> Words can not even properly express the ridiculous robot that Bruce Frau's wife has gone into. The worst robot I've ever seen (even for a B-movie). The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What the hell was going through Bruce when he made that steaming pile, I do not know. Why Ted Raimi did not run to his big brother and asked him to make some sense in Bruce and not to mention how to make an entertaining movie at a great price is a mystery to me !!!
