I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling: It was not very motivating and did not even suggest the idea of ​​what a training plan would look like. Non-marathon runners might have an idea of ​​it have what they need to train and operate them. In fact, there was almost no technical information. I did not expect this to be a technology-driven instructional video, but when that information was close to zero, the movie was just not balanced and not particularly useful for non-marathon runners pondering their first run. <br /> There were others problems. Some of the first images were people who collapsed near death when trying to run a race. Yes, really inspiring. Timing was also hard to track as it was half-chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave a good indication of the time you were watching. And they kept information back. You see that Cantor has an injury, and you just assume that it's all about her training, but then, a few scenes later, they finally suggest that she stumbled over a pine cone in her garden. However, some of the games were very good, as was the talk of a woman resisting race officials who wanted the run for men only, and coverage of a race in Chicago where two runners fought for first place <br /> From my mind, I think of other chronological documentaries like Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are, and you feel that you have told you everything you wanted to know /> <br /> In short, it would not have been hard to make a better marathon movie, and it looks like I can not recommend this for non-marathon runners to educate and motivate them to try one, I do not think so. that it will have this effect.
