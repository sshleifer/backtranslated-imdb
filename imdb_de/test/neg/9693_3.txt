Dramatic? Yes ...... Historically accurate? Not quite! ... In this film, the biblical details of the Flood are twisted by bringing Lot together with Noah during the construction of the Ark. 2136 BC. 234 years after the flood (2370 BC) ... It's as if George Bush had met with William Shakepeare! And what about this guy who buzzes and sells Noah's stuff? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie dramatic based on historical facts, but do not turn it around placing people where they were not ... especially when it comes to God's Word.
