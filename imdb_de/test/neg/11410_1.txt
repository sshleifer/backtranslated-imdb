I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times and it really gets funnier every time. What I appreciate most are the tired character paradigms the movie offers us: the dark, all-American protagonist, his blonde girlfriend, the spectral nerd with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonistic jock and the brunette girl # 2 But then we are presented with two magician martial arts experts whose mullet drives a convertible. If anyone can explain that, please contact me. Among other highlights is Bobby Johnston's depiction of the jock figure Dell and his brand line "That's why I'm holding them around." With Johnston's performance, it's not surprising that his career quickly caught on to softcore pornography. (SPOILER) Even after repeated consideration, I still have no idea what the big demon will eventually say; they are only electronically damped noises. Well, that's probably for the better. And finally, why are all demons so slippery? Is wet skin scary? It certainly did not help in this movie.
