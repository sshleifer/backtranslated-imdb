This movie is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the department "This movie is so bad that it's funny". Rather, it's just bad. Other critics mention the bad lighting, but beyond that, the abundance of bad plastic surgery is the case. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a lot of great acting talent was wasted due to a bad script and an uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It's hard for any of them to feel pity). It's also difficult to see the four characters as close friends. It seems like only a few women are thrown together pretending to be close to each other. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the problems with this movie because it does not deserve the attention of anyone. (It's not worth the time to look at it).
