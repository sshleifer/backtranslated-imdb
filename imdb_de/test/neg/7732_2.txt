My God, this movie was nothing more than shooting by numbers. The struggling salesman can not prevail in New York, the mentor with a golden heart takes him under his wing, the fighting salesman moves to California and makes it big, loses it big and then jumps back with the simple life meets the rock bottom and tries to get back upstairs. I do not think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Case Study (Spoiler?): When the John Kapelos character calls and says he and his girlfriend are visiting Santa Cruz, and James Woods says there is virtually no chance he would come, one knew with 100% Surely they would come in the next scene or two. On the other hand, Sean Young sure looked good.
