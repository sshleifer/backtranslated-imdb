Top Gun without in-house animosity. Or great. Or money. Or cruise. An apology for an upcoming cast of Next Big-thing actors to market their ability to conduct a matinee. It's a shame, because the first shot of Charlie Sheen opens with great promise, which is almost immediately given away with an absurd wedding set. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a convertible actor to me, but he's fine in this movie, especially in the action sequences. Michael Biehn is a top-notch action hero, but not a leader: Charlie Sheen is the leading man in every respect, but never an action hero. There is a stunt cast of hundreds that are also worth mentioning. 3.10
