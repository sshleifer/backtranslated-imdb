Maybe it's just me, but this movie was more of a sequel or successor than the separate project. Why? When it was filmed (just a few years after the war) most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to the Allies, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, fifty years later, it is no more. It is not so obvious anymore. <br /> <br /> "Desert Fox: The History of Rommel" is a decent war movie, but it's simply not explained how Rommel got his nickname, what he did. Allies considered him to be their best general. Why did their soldiers fear the Afrika Korps? That's what's missing in this movie - we see its fame, its character, how it treats soldiers and enemies, but for example. We also see that Hitler complained about his achievements in Africa, called him a coward, and so on. We miss the big picture here - it's "The Story of Rommel", but unfortunately the part "Desert Fox" is missing.
