OK, I saw this movie Someone has to kick me. WHY do the Olsen twins have to insist on subjecting the world to this lazy torture? This was another movie in which you saw the Olsen twins traveling to an exotic place, meeting nice people, looking pretty and drooling all over them. I do not know anything about the US, but in my country it's extremely stupid to get on the bike of a man you met ten minutes ago. Although I am now convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that someday we will see a movie with an original, even somewhat plausible action.
