I met ÆON on TV in the early 90s and I really liked it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like about it? The quirky drawing style? The immaculate artistic action? The absurd and disturbed communication between the characters? The entire layout of the surrounding future world? No matter what you loved about it ... <br /> <br /> The Aeon Flux movie from the end of 2005 has none of this. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was hopelessly overwhelmed to transport the original content into a new film. If you are unfamiliar with the original series, you will not understand anything in the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is inscrutable and the blurry characters do not develop during the movie. <br /> <br /> Kusama Trying to improve the plot by implementing some rather weak explanations between the main characters is not just a lame attempt to cover up its shortcomings as a storyteller, but is simply unworthy of the original ÆON concept may be an attractive woman, but she can not pretend to be an ÆON character. Although she was associated with strings for action scenes, her lack of physical-exercise talent simply ruins the action sequences in the film. The result is an enormous amount of hectic image cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her body. <br /> <br /> Forget the rest, it's not worth talking about ... <br /> <br /> I give Mrs. 1 point for Mrs. Theron and 1 point for the nice architectural photography in the movie. That's it.
