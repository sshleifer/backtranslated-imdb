The only reason I rented the movie was Jeri Ryan! OMG, that was the most boring, purest movie I have ever seen !!! HOW LAME !!! I mean, give me a break! After Voyager I would hope that she would be offered better roles !! <br /> <br /> If I was one of the last people in the world, I would NOT live in the dessert trailer in a caravan !! This is just such a bad movie !! The thing about the Indian tribe and how he really compared it every 10 seconds really got old. Poor Jeri, good luck next time!
