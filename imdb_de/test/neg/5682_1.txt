First, I have to say that since fiction films I do not like so much at all! But there are some films that I really liked. This is one of the other;) I have the same opinion as some (most) others here. The movie is still in my back, but the few effects are really not enough to see all the time ... I think what they did well are the animated landscapes with 3 suns and 4 moons, but it is the only one I like. There are no intelligent dialogues (is there ???). But it's a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For the directors: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !! "
