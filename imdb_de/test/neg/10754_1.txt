I saw this movie last night at the National Film Theater in London, for a birthday. It was the first time I saw it, and I think it has now overtaken the terrible "Twister" as the worst movie I have ever seen. For no reason bound together, selfish and full of images that swing from the stark and obvious to the obscure and incomprehensible, not particularly beautiful or grim shot, I really do not understand why this is considered classical, gay or otherwise. Usually, I enjoy films that cross borders, or films that are hard to see because of their length or unusual cinematography. But that was really terrible.
