As I said, sometimes the low budget is good. You can see a good movie without much extra BS that can hide another piece of crap. Well ... that was that crap. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was not intended. The only half-understood drama came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). There was neither Bill Smith nor anyone who could act. Even Gerald Okamura was shitty and was cast in almost 40 films. The fight scenes were weird and made me feel like they could all kick their $% # @ # $. The sound was terrible, as if everything was recorded on the set. My 10-year-old could have written a better script ... By the way, my 10-year-old was sleeping ... no kidding. I give the cut a B + to cut the film to only 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
