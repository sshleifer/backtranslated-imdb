Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was written badly. First of all, Irons sits too comfortably in his chair during the hijack scene ... he seems to read something, and also pretty quiet! Maybe the director shot the actor between shots? The violence in the kidnapping was a big failure. Slowly, bullets fly - as his wife and daughter are killed, is not so interesting and the tension is lost. His grief afterwards wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all the friends and ambassadors of the industry journalists (he is a journalist for the stuffy Economist rag). How do you know that? But what really made me stop the film halfway was when Irons got into a warehouse where villains hang out - BUT NOT THE BADDIES THAT KILL HIS WIFE - and blow them away anyway. So he's just a murderer. he comes off and well ... I shut it off. I mean, I could not figure out where his friends knew, and I thought he was behind the remaining two men who were the original kidnappers. Instead, he goes after his friends, I think, or anyone who's in warehouses and lays down automatic weapons. The tension was just conventional and the dialogue was lame ("it's alright, son helping to cry," he says to his son, son says "no, it does not" and dad says, "you're right. .. it's not true. ") Irons takes questionable roles - like this one dragon movie he made. He was excellent at Brideshead Revisited, a completely different animal from this lukewarm thriller.
