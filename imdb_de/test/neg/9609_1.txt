There is not much to like about this show, it's hard to know where to start. Unusual characters, terrible storylines, terrible writing AND terrible spectacle. Do not even let me start with the disgusting theme music. <br /> <br /> Also, due to strong Canadian credentials, the show is not in contact with the US audience everywhere. "Oh, tell Derek, will you go to Queens College in the fall! How did you do it? We ought to go oot." <br /> <br/> Granted, other shows are filmed in Canada for financial reasons like Stargate: Atlantis, but although these shows may have suffered some annoyances (like Rodney, who calls a ZPM "Zed-PM"), the show was not the case Do not focus on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV runs daytime Degrassi (another show based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) when nobody is watching (most teenagers are at school when) it airs). I bet it's for the same reason. Shows that the focus on the lives of teenagers in Canada is not good for an American audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in an oven.
