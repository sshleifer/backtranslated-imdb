Similar to Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this movie can not tell the difference between exploitivity and eroticism. No accumulation at all, just throw naked women on the screen; No, that does not work that way. If female genitals are not close-ups, you should focus on the screen in many places (which I often did). The "all women are whores in the heart" mentality of the film is offensive and the "story" is alternately absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). Halfway there's a random scene that comes out of nowhere and involves one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a nude-wrestling match that she wins with a few judo moves. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the entire scene is undeniably memorable. In fact, this scene and the beautiful cinematography are the only two reasons why I give this movie * of 4 instead of 0.
