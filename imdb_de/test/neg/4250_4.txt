Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows because it emphasizes character development and continuity, providing a more complex background and continuous plots. In a way it makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show fails completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a soap opera on a space station, with two full seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced against mundane subplots about the characters. The characters are a good bunch, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers have tried too hard to make them "normal." By "normal" is actually meant "normal and boring". <br /> <br /> At the end of Season Two, we get introduced to the Dominion, who hang around threateningly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in the fifth season. This is the main "story arc" of the show, but it claims only a fraction of the entire series. We still get lame stand-alone episodes, heroes stay stranded on strange planets for 45 minutes, and there's a lot of weird comedy with the greedy, stupid Ferengi. Many episodes are just boring and some are unsurpassed. <br /> <br /> The Dominion, the main villains of the DS9, are determined for reasons of galactic dominance because they simply do not like anyone. The entire war is presented with a na√Øve lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressive pyrotechnic space battles occur with great frequency from the third season, but these are done in ridiculously simple ways, such as two huge fleets of sophisticated spaceships that fly directly towards each other and fly away. The authors of DS9 (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later known as "Battlestar Galactica") have spiced up their monotonous show with a war, but basically it's still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The full story is too shallow and too obvious to be really gripping, and the characters never really develop in interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" both fulfilled the promise of DS9 and made everything much better. At Star Trek you stay with the original and the Next Generation.
