It's hard to imagine anyone making a Tom Cruise movie look good; hard indeed, but this makes him look good. Very well. Actually, it looks like Sir John Gielgud celebrating the Very Good Acting Day with a bravura performance. <br /> <br /> The acting of the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. Part of the flaw was that the storyline was as much like the HG Wells original as the slaughtered carcasses of human victims in the film with their living predecessors: both were bloody and injured remnants of a more attractive predecessor. But to describe an act like this a little holier, one must say of Colander: "My kitchen utensil has a remarkable number of holes," unless holes are your bag. In this case, this movie is recommended for you. <br /> <br /> The other flaw was that they were demotivated, jobbing, dvd performers who knew they knew this as their show on the $ 5 DVD shelf. And overpriced. <br /> <br /> So you should see it? Why yes, of course you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.
