It's very artistic, with recordings that often seem meaningless to the story, which is hard to understand anyway, as there are not enough titles. By all accounts, Robeson's wife Adah is in a love affair between the races with a white man named Thorne. The cigar owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to have a lesbian relationship with a barmaid) does not bother her. If it were up to me, we would not allow Negroes here. "Thorne is also referred to as a 'nigger lover' by someone in the bar, Adah tries to reconcile with Pete (Robeson), but finally leaves him ...

As for Pete, he receives a letter from the mayor informing him that it is best for everyone to be the city So the movie is more about racism than anything else, but the owner tells Pete in a short note, "The sad thing is, they think they're right. The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to the fact that Adah is fair-skinned (a Grenzlinienneger) or refers to the borderline behavior of the main characters.
