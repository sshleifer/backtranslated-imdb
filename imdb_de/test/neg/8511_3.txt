I was still a photographer who worked in Europe in the summer when Jim Salter shot the movie Three. <br /> <br /> I did some swell imagery for him that I was told was the poster for the movie. I did not see the movie until years later. I thought it was bad. Too bad, because the elements that came to him were captivating. Robie Porter's girlfriend was as handsome as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stay and be an additional cameraman so they would not have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to return to NY and promised that I would come back. Unfortunately, I never came back. One of the unsung melodies of life. <br /> <br /> I wish I could post the pictures I took somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
