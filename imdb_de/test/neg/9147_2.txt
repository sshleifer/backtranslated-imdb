This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera I have ever seen, but also the worst video production I've ever seen of any opera great opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno does not even have a bird costume. He's just dressed like a guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVDs from this period have digitally restored the color, but they have not dealt with this. In addition, the language was changed from the original German to Swedish. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie version of "The Magic Flute". It's a filmed performance and it's not a good performance and it did not turn very well. You can choose any other available DVD of this opera and I guarantee you that it is better than this one. I prefer the version that James Levine conducted with sets by David Hockney.
