Conveniently composed of recycled footage, music and ideas, this movie can not really be called "good". But when I saw it as a teenager, it was pretty amusing. (I did not know BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS before that.) In retrospect, there is something nostalgic about the SF wave of the early 1980s and the special effects of that time. His old-fashioned look and his naivety provide a certain charm. To enjoy this movie, I recommend focusing on the fatherly relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. Also, I liked the idea that a bunch of rogues discovered their heroic qualities after being involuntarily confronted with the challenge of caring for a child.
