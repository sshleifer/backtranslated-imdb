CHE! is a bad movie and deserves its reputation as an unintentionally funny movie. It takes a serious theme and presents it like the Cliff Notes version or Classic Comics because there is not much emotion or narration - just episodic segments that are pieced together with mostly stupid "true stories" that come from a variety of Yutzes This is a damn ridiculed movie because it's poorly written and traded. However, what I found most interesting about the film is the seemingly gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working towards a communist Cuba, they seem more like a gay couple - with Che, Coy and Aloof and Fidel behave as a passionate admirer! The film always contains great lines, such as when Fidel Che "Cuba needs you ... I need you !!" I'm not sure if the studio plans this homosexual undercurrent, but a brain surgeon does not need it! I am very surprised that the other reviewers did not point this out. However, remembering it when you watch the movie makes watching more exciting and even funnier. <br /> <br /> One last note. In recent years, Che has been very fancy - even a fashion statement with a bunch of brain-dead teenagers who have no idea who he was and who wore shirts adorned with his face. Considering that he was a cold-blooded murderer and nihilist (a funny combination for a doctor), this new reverence for the man is disgusting. What will they do next, Hitler or dr. Mengele put on T-shirts and posters? !!? Even communists with conscience should be appalled by the bloodshed that Guevara was responsible for, and I find it ironic that people with computers work for a man who would probably have killed them with a half chance! <br /> <br /> Given how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was, it does nothing to make Guevara a hero. I would like to see a realistic film of his life - with the good and the bad, but also with a dialogue and an action that was apparently not created by chimpanzees!
