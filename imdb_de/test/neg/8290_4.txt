"Graduation Day" is the result of the success of "Friday the 13th". Both films are about creative, bloody murders and not about tension. If you like this kind of movie, I would recommend "Graduation Day". If not, I would not. There is nothing new here, just the same old murders. <br /> <br /> Although I gave the movie 4 out of 10, I'll say it's not a repulsive movie. It can be seen if you are curious, just not creative.
