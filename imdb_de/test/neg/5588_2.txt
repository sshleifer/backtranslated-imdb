Wow, what's that on the shelf of the video library in front of me? Nothing but a questionable "continuation" of 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to a film that had a very definite end and a lot of emotional depth that was far beyond this film. Basically, from the plot literally, an American diplomat David Huxley and his fianc√©e Tish Harrington venture into the filthy underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary, to find out who they are with a porno. Video blackmailed that they did together with a prostitute Risa. The entire story is based on the different characters that make up the various sex clubs, and runs through the city. The mystery is solved when Tish finds out in the end that the ransom for the video and (essentially later in the story) her fiancee, who has emerged from her trust fund money, essentially goes back to her future husband as a story unfolds to the bitter The End. <br /> <br /> I did not like the fact that this has nothing to do with the original 8MM. The only thing that comes close to the original is the kind of thriller it was, the fact that in the end David is trapped around him with some sort of bondage device that keeps him trapped looks like the confused world of first movie, and the fact that the whole thing In almost every key scene, the movie was adorned with sex. Otherwise it's a completely different movie. It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the end a possibility, because I did not believe that David's words came out all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that could get him in trouble. <br /> <br /> In most of the "shocking" moments of the film, there were ridiculous nude scenes that wanted to arouse emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish, to find out the plot so she could leave this "hellish" sex debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when only sex was seen. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing more than a movie with nude women to make the DVD totally provocative. David was not a heroic person throughout the movie. One might suspect that he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they were led to get so many of them to gain "respect." There were plotting holes (how did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father when he got the lease they had wished for when David was drawn into this damned investigation to find a prostitute?) There were cheesy technical moments (like the spoken word) E-mail program (like a bondage queen) and a gay brother figure who just showed the director trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.The tagline shown in this profile for this video is also a complete BS, since it was not even a last breath, nobody dies really, but they had a good car crash sequence that came from nowhere ... but that was a good 10 seconds out of an hour and a 3/4 long movie. <br /> <br /> Go rent (and maybe buy)) the original. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It has everything better from this movie. I would not recommend this, unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
