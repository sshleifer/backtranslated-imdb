Well, "built" Doris Day (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for Ethel Barrymore and falls in love with the dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). The older Frenchman Claude Dauphin (as Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Honestly?? What did they think? - This totally inappropriate musical includes Mrs. Day, who sings the standard "April in Paris" and others. Sure, there's nothing as good as her Columbia recordings from that time; and nothing approaches the breathtaking and upcoming "Secret Love" of Day. Although the material is not good for him, it is nice to see Mr. Bolger perform. Some of the musical numbers are disgusting. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (24.12.52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
