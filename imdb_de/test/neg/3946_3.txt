This movie was not very good in my opinion. It was not a complete waste of an hour and a half (luckily I did not have to pay $ for that), but it just was not very scary. There were places I jumped and a few minimal violent / bloody scenes, but overall, only someone who is slightly scared would think this movie scary. The characters have never evolved or grown as humans. Even at the end, the leader, whatever his name was, was not given up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute. The conspiracy also had inconsistencies. The killed police officer was NOT murdered the same way he died in the game. The October girl mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady, she had to read something from the correct text. Funny, that they never bothered and still managed to escape. The Malcolm-in-the-Middle child died in the game but did not die "in real life". Even playing the game alone was very weak writing. It would have been okay for the brother's death just to get her playing again. But you have to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again ... why do you need the game anyway? If you like movies like the Ring and what's scary and funny, watch this movie. If you know someone you can laugh at, do it. If you like "horror" movies that make you laugh and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise, stay far away.
