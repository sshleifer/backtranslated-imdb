This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. They said this was the man's response to Waiting to Exhale ... I'll just say that we really did not respond at all. I could not believe it was actually done. The director should choose a different profession because he can not make a movie. The script was not good. It made no sense and was very messy. Bet movies are much better than that, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this bad excuse of a movie. If I could turn back the clock, I would not go back to Media Play to never buy the movie. I would just hang it on the shelf instead of wasting my time looking at it.
