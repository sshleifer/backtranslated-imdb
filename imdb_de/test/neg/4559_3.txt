Ugghh !!! This is exactly the kind of pre-code movie that can falsely convince viewers that movies from that time are lousy - and they are NOT - it's just that this movie is awful. Terrible, because while the movie is trying hard to be "hip" and "grown up", it is also so hopelessly old-fashioned, boring and funny that I'm torn between laughing at the movie or falling asleep !! This is a unique combination, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Why exactly did I hate it so much? Well, the film is incredibly dark, but it has no style and the film is supposed to shock, but it lacks subtlety and too many ridiculous phrases to be credible. The film begins with a clich√© - a hooker with a gold heart. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and seems to kill a man accidentally! Shortly after her escape, she meets an old friend who insists on marrying her (he does not recognize her profession). Seeing the innate goodness of this man, she decides to change her life and end her wild life. This is hard when hiding on a fictional Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for the return of her husband, there is nothing to do, and the place is infested with super horny and totally unappetizing men. In fact, this part of the movie is so boring that it will be hard for the audience to stay focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by the presence of Mackaill that they seem to be constantly interested in rape her - only to be rejected because she is no longer such a girl. To be honest, I was tired of all those murderous scenes - there are just too many eye rolls and tongue fronds to make it look like a very bad movie. And looking at all those ugly horned dogs was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait ... it gets a lot worse. The man she killed THOUGHTS DONE appears on this tiny island (what are the odds ?!) and he also tries to rape her. He should not be deterred, however, and in the end she shoots to save her newly found virtue. While the jury on the island is about to acquit her, she rushes back to court and lies - she is supposed to kill the man, and it was deliberate (?), Because even if she is acquitted, she knows that the evil jailer He has a way with her when she goes to jail for gun possession. Given the fact that the jailer gave her the weapon to set her up, she rushed to the court and said she was guilty, it really seemed very stupid. Why did not she just tell them the twisted plan of the prison ?! Supposedly, she did this to preserve her virtue, but to admit killing someone so people think you are a virgin ?! In order to escape a brief jail term (and again the threat of rape), she does not consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the jailer has promised to rape her.) If she does is locked in). And just before she is taken to the gallows (to avoid the rape), the friend appears in time for her to send him off, and the credits run. <br /> <br /> Impossible situation and coincidences abound. - so often that the movie is just stupid. Combined with all the sexual allusions, this leads to a bad and sloppy mess of a movie that will appeal to only the most die-hard fans of pre-code movies. Everyone else, beware, that's very sticky and stupid from beginning to end!
