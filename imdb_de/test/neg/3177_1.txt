The action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and advance the story. The plot plots with. With a few exceptions (eg Graham Greene), acting was not inspired and at best pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something in mind other than the scene they were in. It's boring to drive a man through the semi-desert country of this movie, whether he drives bad or good. Such scenes are typical of the voltage level in the video. So there was nothing about this video to engage or attract the viewer, to interest him or her in the characters, and the out comes. I am doubly disappointed because I rented the film because of the reputation of the executive producer (Redford) and author of the novel (Hillerman). I note that the Jewel-Box reports that the funding will be provided by PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as by Carlton International. I would hope that this video was just as disappointing for her as it was for me and my wife, that they will not fund catastrophes coming from the same source.
