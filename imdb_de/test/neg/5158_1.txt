The worst movie ever !! It is not smart or funny or thought provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors who did their best with a horrible script. <br /> <br /> acting was so bad that you can see the dead breathe. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer / director combination was Quentin Tarantino or something (you make a movie about nothing cool) but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> I hope the author never makes another movie !! Not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and be a lifeguard again or whatever. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, even if the mute is done in stereo mode is painful 84 min.
