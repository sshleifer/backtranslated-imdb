Remember the old kung fu movies we saw on Friday and Saturday nights late when our babysitters thought we were responsible? Well, this movie is just like one of those movies. Patsy Kensing's greatest claim to fame was the love interest in Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2," and that performance was one of the reasons she never grew up: she's a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In "Lethal Weapon 2", I found her sweet. Nice enough to look at some of the other films she'd been to, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance," another disappointment that I obviously was not impressed with. But as appealing as it is to my eyes, my soul has shouted at me to turn it off because it has played another cheap, predictable role and made it very bad. <br /> <br /> In this film, Kensit starred A comedian (and not a good one) working in the clubs of France (could not cut it in her own homeland, so she makes her ears bleed), the their luck does not have, but worse, the French government wants to kick them out because of an expired visa (or maybe they have just caught their act). But she marries this Casanova (Freiss), who is just as out of luck, and predictability begins ... awful! Is there any way to rate this movie NEGATIVE? 1 out of 10 stars is overrated!
