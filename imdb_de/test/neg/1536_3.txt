Murder By Numbers is one of the films that you expect to be made for television, but not. Considering that the only actor on a note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be aiming for bigger and better things), it's no surprise that this movie quickly disappears from memory and is replaced by more important things. How ... Remember to lock your front door when you go out. Or put your clothes back on when you come out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a policewoman with personal problems (not all). Together with her new partner (a dazed-looking Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing out of the ordinary except that the perpetrators are a few teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, there is a struggle between Cassie and prime suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). Although she is very beautiful, Bullock is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical policeman as Rodney Dangerfield (actually he would be better!). Chaplin is a complete non-entity for his sins, and I'm sorry he has to include this movie in his CV to intervene in Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt are satisfied as treacherous scorn suspects. As if dubious leads were not bad enough, shooting a story that would make anyone fall asleep, and a highly predictable (but illogical) end, shoot this movie in the head before it can run. <br /> <br /> "Murder By Numbers" has absolutely nothing to offer, even a senseless nude scene from Bullock would not live up to it. Just a little, but not enough to save it. Forgotten, predictable and superfluous - this is a movie that will not push the genre of cops. As Cassie probably says in her next case, there's nothing to see here. Move, keep moving ...
