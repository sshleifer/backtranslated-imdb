I think my biggest mistake was to see this remake of '95 "Piranha" in 1995 with Joe Dante's Original '78 faithful to the original. I also did that last week with "The Omen". Curious enough to see the remake right after the '76 original, I really appreciated the 2006 version for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> But this approach backfired on the '95 Piranha version. It has reinforced the fact that it really is a lesser picture. Basically, the '95 version is more or less the same movie because it tells the same story and follows it practically from scene to scene (only the character of Barabara Steele and the military intervention were spelled out of it). But the cinematography was not so good. The spectacle was worse too. Especially Alexandra Paul (who plays Heather Menzies' character) once again showed me what a terrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (of the '78 version) had his Charlton-Heston way of acting, which was amusing, while William Katt in the '95 version did a good job of William Katt. So I really did not bother him. But the whole cast is quite inferior and the only worthwhile event was James Karen ("The Return of the Living Dead", parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. John Carl Buechler's make-up effects are not as pretty as Rob Bottin's. The score had something to sound, but Pino Donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. All these inadequacies have become noticeable as a result of the re-viewing of the original as part of this double calculation. <br /> <br /> Since the remake of Scott P. Levy follows Dante's original, I think it's entertaining enough to assert itself. However, the joke that Dante's original had is missing. But what I really do not like about Levy's version is the fact that quite a lot of material from the first movie was reused during the piranha attack scenes. I never like filmmakers to do that (and I'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other important reasons). I mean, if you do not have the budget (or imagination) to come up with newly recorded footage, do not make a freak remake for God's sake. But Roger Corman has produced this (cheaper) remake, so I should not be surprised at the reuse of footage. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see "Piranha", make sure it's been a while since you saw the original. You can then enjoy this remake a little more. And oh yes, this cool little stop motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this movie, as expected. But even worse, there's no feminine nudity in this one (the original really had some trifles, and this blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear down too far) removing her underwear!). Pictures, since this '95 version was made for television.
