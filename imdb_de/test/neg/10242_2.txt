The strange thing about Galaxina is not that it is extremely bad, though it is. The strange thing is that, although it's extremely bad, it's not funny. Bad movies have their own unwanted humor - the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is different - it's the worst nightmare of MST3K, a bad movie in which the intentional * and * the unintentional humor equally fail flat - and the reasons for that are very different. Sometimes it is a question of time. Sometimes it's a good idea that has been badly negotiated (the human restaurant * might * have * been funny, but it was not); Sometimes it feels like there was some confusion in the cutting room, with the punchline landing on the floor. and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies laugh about such unintentional Snafus. It's harder to figure out why Galaxina does not laugh about this. There is something subtly wrong about the unintentional humor in this film, just as the intentional humor is somewhat (not at all subtle) wrong. It's an extremely bad movie whose extremely poor quality is not the redeeming quality it normally is. It is absolutely unique in my experience.
