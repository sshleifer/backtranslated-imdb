All my friends and several other colleagues like this show soooo great. First, I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I could be the only woman who lives !!! I just looked at it because my best friend loves it and imagines being the Charlotte character! <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot (if you can call it that) involves four female superslut Samantha (Kim Cattrall), who most likely has every STD available and mossy, brown and green genitalia when one considering that she is threefold (she will try everything). <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like most women in NY, but rather than the show. I would not have any kind of entertainment, as Samantha (along with a good New York countryside) is the only reason to watch, and that is no reason enough. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed New York idiot who still believes the myth Pince Charming! So cute and pretty she can not be fooled, she spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), now this woman is stereotypically angry, but a feminist. I think in one episode it is assumed that she is lesbian, but apparently not ... What a shame she is almost interesting. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the most annoying character. I swear that I thought I would see Twisted Sister frontman Dee Sniders more masculine-looking, cross-dressing, sissy boy, brother! This is a girl who can not live without your love ... heard of a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I love to make fun of it because I hear it's kind of a new awakening for women. That's just sad when you're looking for sloppy, pathetic, addictive people in over-expensive clothes that drink cosmopolitans and sound like an annoying 15-year-old cocaine when there's a show for you ..... ...... Just use the protection.
