The plot: Four persons are caught in an elevator. One is a businessman, the annoying type who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a talking sample of distilled stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. A youthful rebel who just broke into a cola machine and drives the businessman nuts by his mere presence, and an older man who has just stolen $ 100,000, makes up the rest of the cast ... <br /> <br / > The film is all about how they handle their problem, how time goes on without reaching the outside world when the lights go out, and when the cables start snapping at each other ... <br /> <br /> And yet it is not so exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in a single elevator?). They do not like the characters very much, they only hate one of them. And all the twists and turns in the plot do not add to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses to fill a few more minutes of dialogue as the scriptwriters run out of inspiration and ink in a full-length movie in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that "Phone Booth" will be a better effort ...
