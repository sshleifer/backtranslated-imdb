This spy melodrama has a beautiful, almost promising cast and should be very atmospheric; There is a will or purpose of the atmosphere and also a need or a lack of it. Sheen plays a dissident who is now acting as an agent; he is a loner who is loved by women but haughty; Mrs. Fossey is his lover. Neill plays the gallant, generous, knightly Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are both essentially annoying; Finlay makes a cameo and other famous actors. Mrs. Fossey is hot; But then again, it is always. <br /> <br /> I will be your true friend and break you? The good thing is that you see Mrs. Fossey naked. Otherwise lukewarm derivative espionage exploitation.
