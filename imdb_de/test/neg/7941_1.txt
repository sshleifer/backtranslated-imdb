The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is crude, funny and - perhaps most importantly - short. This remake is mercilessly filled and talkative. Even worse, the African-American hero of the first film is replaced here by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, who makes this "attack" less progressive than that of the 1970s. God, I miss John Carpenter and his unlikely plot and funny sense of humor. I even miss his actors on the B-list who are better than Hawke and his company. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I am interested in the new villains in this version to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are generic hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his bored appearances. The music is also completely wrong - it's a fat action material that actually reduces the tension. Just awful
