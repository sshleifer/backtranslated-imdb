I'm sure there's a documentary film somewhere in the ruins of this Yawn festival. If there is enough time, the producers might find it. I do not associate with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentation. This separation soon becomes a complete hostility bordering on hostility. Due to the bad story flow, I am not really sure what happens to them and what the consequences of what they want to do. The story and the faces are jumping around so fast that it's very hard to fully understand what's going on. The third founder, who brings them for $ 700,000, is introduced to the movie so late that Khaleil and Tom have to paddle back (fruitlessly) to declare, "oh yes, that guy created the idea, too." And just when I thought I understood a little bit who all the Tertiary figures were, a crazy woman who cursed about getting a puppy? What about it? Did Tom really have to keep all those awkward speeches in front of the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it really happened. Actually, I think I feel for her.
