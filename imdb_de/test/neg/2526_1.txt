A root canal without anesthesia is more amusing. This movie is disturbing and meaningless. There is absolutely nothing credible about these characters or the storyline. What in God's name did these people think when they were ready to play in this movie? The acting in this film is so incredibly bad - even by actors who are usually pretty good. "The In-Laws" is a funny movie. "The Birdcage" is a funny movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous movie. This movie is just stupid. I can not even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind necessary to write the "novel" on which this film is based. I honestly can not say anything nice about this movie. It just does not make sense. People please - I ask of you - do not see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst movie ever made, but it's definitely on top of the list.
