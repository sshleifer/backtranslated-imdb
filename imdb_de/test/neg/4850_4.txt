Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful woman and an extremely talented and versatile singer. Her acting in this film is more than competent and in my view the only redeeming feature of this film. She very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious Helath problem. However, what I do not like about the film is the shameless product placement for a well-known French hotel chain. The other thing is that the story seems to go back and forth without really deciding what the movie is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note, the film is unpredictable. But you could also say that it is simply boring due to the lack of cohesion. There are a couple of nice shots in the movie where you think all the parts do not make a difference. It's a pity, because Kaas really shines in this movie.
