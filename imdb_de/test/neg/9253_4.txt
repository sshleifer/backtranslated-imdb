Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s, the early VicTorian offspring, in which he looked at the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Ms. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He chose these writers as the favorite favorites of the first half of the Victorian era and explained to the reading public their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them). Some of his comments are quite relevant for the day, but like any review, it also gives some idea of ​​the critic's zeitgeist. Cecil appreciated George Eliot, who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poems). But for most modern readers, they usually know their shortest book SILAS MARNER, which is still read in a high school curriculum. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, THE MILL ON THE FLOOD, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF SCENIC LIFE, are still mostly unread in print (Penguin, for example, has most of them in print). Today, the last novel DERONDA is of particular interest, in which she speaks about the Jews in the English society and a beginning Zionism before Hertzl. ROMOLA is her only attempt at a historical novel (about Savanarola's experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her most industrious novel is MIDDLEMARCH, which deals with English society in the provinces in 1832, the year of the great Reform Bill of Lord Grays. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH at the university for a literature course. It's certainly a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most adult book in English). But she suffers from a mistake (like all Eliots novels) - she can not write livable, exciting prose. While Dickens is sometimes overly exuberant, Thackeray can become pompous and prolix, and Trollope (as Lord Cecil says) can become very commonplace in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte can not explain certain relationships well, and Mrs. Gaskell seems to be the best with female Characters are all of them (and Emily Bronte in their only novel) the reader's interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to chop sets of marble blocks with a toothpick! <br /> <br /> To date I have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I find that one of the other critics never finished the novel either. But I've read a summary of what it's about. The Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title. Although Maggie is close to the beginning of the story, she falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in litigation with Mr. Tulliver Senior. Tom views this relationship poorly, and the tragedy of the story concerns the split between the siblings, who at the end find their climax in their demise (Maggie runs back to the mill to rescue Tom during a heavy tide and they die together). For Victorian readers it must have been a success, but for the modern audience it is very bleak and depressing. <br /> <br /> The film changed the ending a bit - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) eventually dies with her lover and Tom (James Mason) notes her death in the end in his book. The story is completely rewritten, except for the double death in the flood at the end. That does not really help. Although Fitzgerald and Mason perform pretty well with their parts, they can not pull the movie up by doing it alone. The end result is a pretty small movie that fortunately did not hurt the lead management's careers. The only other thing is that the friend was played by Frank Lawton, who two years earlier played David Copperfield as an adult opposite W.C. Fieldes, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. On the other hand, Lawton never really had a big movie career - he was always in pictures, some good, some mediocre.
