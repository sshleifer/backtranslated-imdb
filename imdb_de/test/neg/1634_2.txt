Another part of the long line of Conan wannabees who are tired of exploiting the film's success is this Italian monstrosity about as bad as they came. You know, it's a bad sign for your heroes to fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply that there was no money for appropriate special effects or for hiring real people. I will not even bother to step into the plot, as I do not pursue anyone to follow him and understand the plot. Maybe it's the TV cut I watched, but I can not imagine that a version is so much better. Everything seems so coincidental to me. Evil wizards, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliding? Nothing fits together. It's as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic seizure when he made Cave Dwellers (or any of the other names that the movie goes through) and threw everything that came to mind onto the canvas, no matter how disjointed it was was or how it was fits in the already enigmatic plot of the film. Acting is bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe could never find his way out of a wet paper bag, and he proves it again in this movie. The rest of the cast is just as cruel. Then there are the. , , Well, you get the idea. It's late, I'm tired and I've spent more than enough time writing about this piece of rubbish. Count on it ?? In any case avoid cavemen (or whatever you want to call it).
