This movie almost brought me a nervous breakdown. When I recovered from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just begun teaching secondary school. The entire teaching business was a bit nerve-wracking for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself to go back to the classroom, I decided to watch some pretty horrible movies. The Flintstones was one of the films I selected, and then I recorded "King Of The Streets" (the British title of "Alien Warrior"). Just before it was done, I was almost in tears out of the sheer waste of it ... my life, the movie supply, the Â£ 2 I'd paid in the blockbuster ex-department a few weeks ago, back then printing on sleeve art the effort of the participating editors and musicians has to go into the soundtrack (as insignificant as their efforts were) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me make that very clear - I love to watch fucking movies by Blockbusters. Me and my buddy Dan sat and watched many, many cheap horrors and laughed at them. This was a different kind of crappy movie though. I do not think anything came close, not even Tobe Hooper's "death trap" (probably the second worst movie in the world). The whole making of a car out of abandoned parts almost ruined me; the repetition of music on any available occasion, regardless of the screen events; the whole .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can not even continue this "critical" dissection because my gag reflex has started. The futility of this movie still makes me speechless three years after I saw it for the first and last time (but I still can type). The whole section "Building a car of odd parts" made me think about terrible things. <br /> <br /> I implore you if you are interested in this movie, just look at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story overview on the back. I can almost guarantee that it's not even half as bad as this movie is. Under no circumstances think of observing it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see a Christ allegory. not if you are a bad movie fiction and want to experience the true nadir of garbage; Even if you want your life to last longer (and believe me, every second this movie is playing seems to be at least a minute). Make no mistake, this movie is unholy. It is the antichrist in video form. When Bo Cattlett said in Get Shorty, "I have seen better teeth."
