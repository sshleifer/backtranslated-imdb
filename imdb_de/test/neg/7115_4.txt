An hour ago I have finished looking at my girlfriend. As fans of Dragonball, we think that this movie is so bad that it is good. We'll say one thing: without Sixpack beer you can now survive through this movie. This movie should be watched by many Dragonball fans to laugh their asses. The best character of the film is Lord Horn, his make-up, his laugh and his behavior make the unforgettable experience. What we liked about this movie was that the island of Turtle Man was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character similar to the cartoon is the Turtle Man. He is also a sex maniac and a kind of idiot.
