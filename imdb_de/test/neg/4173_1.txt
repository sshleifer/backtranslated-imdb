What can one say? Truly one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Your brain will try to shut down as part of an original self-preservation impulse. I was completely shaken when I saw this "movie" and it took me well over two hours to fully recover. This film now combines Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the infernal trinity of horror movies. I certainly do not mean this distinction well. I mean that in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This movie has no redemptive features. Everything is horrible. Artless camera work endlessly offers us the ugliest attitude imaginable, d. H. Much corn, a lot of mud. The story is more than stupid. The script is? Was there a script? The villain is extremely rash and wears yellow rubber boots. The kids are annoying. The captain is charisma-free. And it has the audacity to stay for 100 minutes. Without any merit in any way, this is equivalent to torture. Normally, such a statement would be exaggerated for the comic effect. Not in this case. I will even say it again? This is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. This was gratefully short. But when I recovered, I decided that I had to look at the Making Of feature. I had to understand Maybe there is a reasonable explanation for this cruelty. Was it all a complicated joke? I saw the first 2 minutes of the "making of" feature and discovered that the author / director was a bit misguided, to say the least. I also discovered that I was an idiot for watching the first two minutes of Dark Harvest 2's Making Of feature. No pleasant journey of self-discovery. Life is shit. <br /> <br /> Highly unwelcome.
