This movie is a complete waste of time, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And that definitely means something to me. I wish I could have given him negative stars instead of simply classifying him as a pathetic one-star fear. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I was open. I find the legend of Chupacabra interesting and have a fondness for kitsch horror movies. But I draw the line at this point. <br /> <br /> The acting is shitty. The lead actor gives one of the worst performances ever. It looks unnatural and sounds as it dictates its poorly written lines. The lead actress gives a slightly tastier performance, but that does not really need much. <br /> <br /> The Chupacabra ... Well, considering how low that budget must have been, the creature was bearable. It looks exactly like someone in a mask and a body suit. The mask is pretty detailed and might look personal, but not on the screen. <br /> <br /> Speaking of screen, one might think they used at least one better camera. It looks like it was shot with a camcorder to scream out loud. Not very good either. <br /> <br /> I do not know who wrote this abomination. The dialogue is shitty and I can not describe what I feel about it. At least not without problems with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It's just not worth it. If it's on TV and you have nothing else to do, look at something else or watch it. Read a book, listen to music, * anything. * Just do not depend on it. If you do, you can not say that you have not been warned. And for God's sake, do not hire this jerk. It's not worth it, even if you have the option to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.
