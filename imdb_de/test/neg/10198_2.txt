Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Being a sci-fi fan, I was interested in a movie about UFOs. <br /> <br /> Instead, this movie quickly became a Protestant Christian propaganda strip. Suitable for an audience of like-minded but very unchristian people, taking advantage of the movie mall scene and preaching to an unsuspecting audience, especially given the cost of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code has not held back its wild craziness. <br /> <br /> So, this film (and I'm fine) in B grade is probably shown in churches with similar beliefs valued for Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. However, if you are a Christian or a non-Christian, you will not feel well.
