The gang is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! Her brother demonstrates against the draft, and Charles Martin Smith does everything he can in Vietnam to be sent home. <br /> <br /> The issues of the 60s are brought to light here, but they are everywhere, starting with New Year's Eve 1963, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1964, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1965, then three minutes later, it's 1963. Martin Smith speaks a year ago about his friend who died in a drag race. A few scenes later, this friend wins his next race in a drag race. To top it off, the drug scene and the flower children enter the country image (or images, in some cases up to three different camera shots are simultaneously displayed on the screen). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you need to VIEW this movie. However, I would advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the beginning of the movie in front of almost every song played in the background, but where did he go? Maybe ER could not keep up with this movie and stop! 2 out of 10 stars!
