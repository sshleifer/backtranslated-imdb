First of all, the Mexican werewolf in the title in Texas is misleading, as many others have pointed out. Actually, it is El Chupacabra, a creature that resembles a werewolf, but by no means the same. <br /> <br /> The production and editing are just crap. When it's over, I probably could not very well describe what the Chupacabra looked like, because when it was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera became totally wobbly and you could only see the monster's face clearly , The special effects were ridiculously bad, but you have to expect that from a horror movie on a low budget. <br /> <br /> Along with the terrible production come the bad actors. Now there are some plausible appearances (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors (all the others) who seemed to have no emotions when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson), who gives one of the 2 worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I mean, my God, she was indescribably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, a chupacabra is in a small Texan town that kills residents, and a group of teenagers is trying to stop them. But even if the plot is so easy, a few action holes have leaked. Anyway, a horrible movie. But if you're looking for a movie that you can make fun of one night and laugh with your friends about it, this would be a pretty good movie. My friends and I had a lot of fun watching. Probably the second worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Dreadful.
