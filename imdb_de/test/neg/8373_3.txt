Maybe we Aussies have a completely different sense of humor and that's where my only lie is. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those I got as a gift - and this was that). Therefore, I always refer to IMDb when entering a new one, to get information like genre, runtime, director, leads, etc. I noticed that this was a comedy, and decided to look at it at a time when I was doing something light and wanted a good laugh. Well, it was not like that! There was absolutely NO laughter and an excessive amount of unnecessary obscenity (is there really radio announcers who can send the kind of filth that Steve Jones spits out?) <br /> Instead of a good laugh (or even a little giggle) too I found it very depressing, I gave it 3 out of 10, but to be honest, I do not know what those 3 are for! I think the basics of light and sound were not so bad! /> <br /> We have a supposedly rocky loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who is still able to drive a decent car (who pays the fuel?) and live in a nice apartment (who can?) pays his rent?) Given the opportunity to build a relationship that could have been a meaningful relationship with a pretty girl, he even messed it up! Maybe it was her (Lynn Collins) who earned the movie the 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects in this film that makes sense ("I make as much in a night as in two weeks"). <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be depressed and bored, forget it!
