I was looking forward to seeing Bruce Willis, especially as I remember when I was fascinated by the original in my youth. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how film companies can record a very good story mute it down until it is just another formulated hype of the fabulous American law enforcement system / army VS (the Russians ... I'm sorry that the Cold War is over, do it with the Russians) vs TERRORISTS, similar to probably 50 other films. <br /> <br /> It also treats its audience like a bunch of idiots. The choice of weapon is good, just ridiculous. Are we seriously expected that the world's most feared and experienced hitman / terrorist would choose this for an assassination? <br /> <br /> The crux of the original story was the tense dual of intellectuals between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who devises a reckless but elegant plan to achieve his goal and then escape. None of it survived. All we have is the tired old American CIA / FBI / Army against the evil terrorist conspiracy we've all seen 1000 times. <br /> <br /> But the movie company's MBA has of course recognized that there's a new intellectual approach here. They would lose revenue from the short attention span, so the answer is ...... Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and one crippled conspiracy. They assume that the American public will not be able to relate to a threat to a foreign national (where France is on the map), so it's an American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a film contaminated by the boardroom.
