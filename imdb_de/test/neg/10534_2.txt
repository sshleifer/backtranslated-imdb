Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to the horrible cinema. I was tragically bored with each of them when I realized they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude Van Dames. Has anyone noticed that he is never hit ?! I mean, give me something to root for ... a fiercely competitive fight with a bad guy who's scary. TWO YEARS and he's still filming the same fight scenes. Battle scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can not act. The boring choreography of a Segal film brings his painful lack of acting skills into action. Worse, he is sad but out of shape. Exactly what we need, a fat stiffness that thinks he is a leading man. In all these films, there is not a single iota of film sequences. DO NOT pay attention unless you want to throw away one and a half hours of your life.
