It's certainly a direct video, but the story is not as bad as most other critics think. I like the fact that the hero usually does the wrong thing. <br /> <br /> The hero's reactions and the rebel reactions are human only. The Hopper character actually plays god. That may be the right thing, but you do not like it anyway. In the end, the god-player is condemned to death, and the hero who has spent his own life can live. Pretty moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I've seen is that the earth is doing so well that no moon stabilizes its rotation.
