Sad in every way, this bad apology for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor the hit Warner wanted. This movie and "Robocop 2" are over 20 minutes long and full of embarrassing moments for everyone involved. They prove that Irvin Kershner had no control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery had not been in a hit ever since leaving Bond in 1971, but that did not bring him back at all. "Octopussy" was released a few months before this movie and has easily surpassed it. Imagine - a Roger Moore Bond is not only better than a concurrent release of Connery, but surpasses it (and in comparison to "Never ...") "Octopussy" is at the level of "2001". <br /> <br /> The worst Bond theme song, even worse than "The Man with the Golden Weapon", pointless scenes that drag themselves senselessly (the worst example being the ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES ?!) and the most disgusting collection of are non-talent in relation to the fabled "Bond Girls". Does anyone seriously consider Kim Basinger attractive in this film? There were girls in my high school who could never get a date that looked better than them.

She is the seedling who would become the very impressive "Onatop" who was the best at "GoldenEye". "But that does not mean anything if you're struggling through this movie. <br /> <br /> Casting He as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction that Connery and he should have is Two actors have never been so clumsy - witness the scene where they elude the local authorities, move to their boxers and pretend they're training - I can not imagine another scene in a movie that so fruitless tried to laugh.
