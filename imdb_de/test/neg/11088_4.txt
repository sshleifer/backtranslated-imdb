It's hard to write 10 lines about this movie. There just is not much to say. It is not memorable enough to complete your collection, and I have a considerable number of noirs. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid plays a tough guy here. I do not think about him to play that kind of role, but he's fine. He's a good actor anyway. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is okay, but not memorable. One thing that struck me: the abrupt end. It was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see this under the heading "Hollow Triumph". I never called the movie that way. It was always called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read of a "strained movie noir", etc., you will not believe it. "Tense" is not an exact adjective for this movie.
