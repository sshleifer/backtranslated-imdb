Pretty bad. This movie about a gray (and honestly stupid) old prospector and his dog 'Shep', d. H. Lassie, as well as an annoying child whose name I can not remember at the moment. At the beginning of the film, the old gold seeker DELIBERAL buried himself in some sand, so that the poor dog has to dig it out. Why? Did he hate the dog? Anyway, this idiot somehow managed to beat gold and goes to his partner. But the man has died, and his sloppy partner is glad to help old Jonathan dig gold. The Geezer tries to leave is a dog with the son of the dead man, but not even the lagging mutt wants to stay with this child. There are quaint old preachers (for strange reading, stinking), and the oily guy has done the old (surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. He also poisoned the dog and also tried to kill the boy. I think it's okay that a devilish and crazy Lassie..err ... SHEP does this at the end of the guy, though it's pretty disturbing, which is basically a kiddie movie. There are extremely stereotypical (to the point racial slur) "Native Americans" who speak without verbs (as in "I make bonfires"). And that's pretty much the extent of the cast, because apparently Lassie's salary was too big for anyone else to hire. Somehow boring not very interesting and a bit too dark. In no way a great movie.
