It is said that there are some people who actually see ADMIRE Monograms films. Well - and why not? Monogram Studios lived on a kind of cost-plus basis; Cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscat from time to time. Sure, they are cheap. But let's be honest: they are rude, fast, philistines, vulgar, but exciting. You have no claims at all. They are designed to redirect the audience for one hour at the end of a double bill. What if John Wayne gallops along a street of telephone poles through the Wild West? This is not art but entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie "Flight to Mars". At the beginning, when we meet the characters for the first time, a man could abruptly introduce his female companion without avoiding boring subtlety: "Professor, this is my fiancé and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman, but she loves me I get impatient because I'm always involved in my scientific work, maybe you could steal it, marry it, give her the babies and the house she craves, if necessary, I'll die to make her dreams come true She also likes it a bit rough. "That saves a lot of writing and recording time, does not it? People say that when they say a story is "fast". (This was shot in five days.) Why should we have to point out these things? I mean, what the hell is this, a cheap science fiction movie or Henry James? Actually, this is a particularly well-funded example of a monogram film. For one thing, it's in color. "Cinecolor", to be exact. (You can tell it's not another "color" you'd recognize.) And look at the cast. The female lead is, as is usual with Monogram, to be rejected, but the male leads are definitely on top of the B-list. Cameron Mitchell as a reporter, who had still beaten his step as a male lead, which he never really did when he thought about it. And Arthur Franz as pipe smoker, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And - for science fiction fans - how about this pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! It does not really make sense to describe the plot in detail. The five crew members crash on Mars, where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic to us, except for five figures and small willowherb in short skirts. And they learned English when they heard our programs. American broadcasts, that is, judging from their speech. They are led by an eerie cabal who tries to kidnap the spaceship, build many imitations of it, and colonize the earth. You have no success. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not special. The men go around with some spare sets and wear black costumes with stylized flashes on the chest and scarlet robes that rear up behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The lissome Martian, who falls in love with Arthur Franz, is called Alita, with an Indo-European diminutive attachment, and she already knows what kissing is. but also boring. The story is that of a 1930's Buck Rogers series. As soon as the Earthlings and the Martians meet and it turns out that they have a common language and the Martians have an eerie agenda, that's it. In two hours, even an indifferent scriptwriter could turn it into a story of Nazi spies in World War II do. The plot is made by the numbers, the dialogue has no sparkle, the acting is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> However, enthusiastic supporters of Monogram productions should be pleased about it. Finally, Jean-Luc Goddard, the contrary French egghead, dedicated "A Bout de Soufflé" to the monogram, so they could not have been so bad.
