I thought that would be funny. I did. I do not know what happened. But I think that a lot of the problem unfortunately falls during the casting. I do not know who this boy is, he could be a very nice person, but he was not right for this movie. And the side cast was great, which just makes it more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest, and your mind just starts to fade, but then Keith David starts to talk or Leslie Nielsen or Marion Ross and it's like somebody turns on a light and suddenly you can watch out again and you think it could not be that bad. When they return to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful. The fact that most jokes were basically a fart makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean, it had some fun things, remembering that I laughed a few times, but right now I can not remember why and it was only a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm taking it or letting it rate, but I think most people should just keep it.
