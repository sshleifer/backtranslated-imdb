The plane is a 747 jumbo. The cockpit is located on the upper deck of a 747. In the film, the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. They go to the front of the first class and through doors into the cockpit. What a gaff !!! The front of the First Class cabin has a coat rack for jackets and a TV screen. In addition, the radome is. Before the start a 747 is shown to start the taxi to the runway. At the start, the aircraft shows only two engines. Area 747 has four engines. Who was responsible for the continuity in this film? At the beginning of the flight there are suddenly toilets on the front of the plane - another farce gaff !!! Thereafter, the front of the aircraft becomes the back and vice versa. At that point, I stopped looking. Absolute garbage !!!
