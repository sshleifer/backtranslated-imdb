I saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting. I have seen the IMDb rating and confirmed with 6.8 an above-average film. That's how it went. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard)? a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire Mandy's friend Emmet (Michael Welch) provokes a classmate to show his love for Mandy, leaves the classmate drunk and jumps to death. Nine months pass and Mandy is invited by her teenage friends for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch. three girls and three boys go there! There is a guard Garth (Anson Mount) working on the ranch. On the first night itself, the murders take place ?? one by one, the members of the group are killed. Who is behind the murders? I will not say here to spoil sports? Did I like the movie? NO. After the usual interesting opening? The film turns down with every unfolding of events. At half-time, when the killer is exposed, one loses all interest in the remaining proceedings. There is one last twist in the story to shock viewers, but I shook my head in disgrace and laughed! All this for suspense? Huh ?! Amber Heard plays and plays her role as a shy and conscious girl? Who is aware of her beauty and the desire of men for her? The remaining cast are common? nothing to say. There are so many films of teenage boys and girls going to a remote place and being slowly killed by someone? that I am no longer interested. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine tries to make the movie interesting by using contemporary teen-talk chat with sexual overtones, but he does not let the movie go beyond the ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only and most appealing rescue of the film is the cinematography of Darren Genet? who makes beautiful picture perfect pictures!
