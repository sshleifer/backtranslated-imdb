Rossini once described the work of rival Wagner as "some wonderful moments ... and some terrible quarter-hours". Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described as such. It has many great episodes, but in between there are countless filler episodes. The entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I would say that there are at least 125 fillers or a kind of subplot (I did not bother counting and would not be surprised if that number were actually higher). , <br /> <br /> Some of these filler episodes are really enjoyable, though many are stupid or boring. Nevertheless, the constant excursions continue to decrease after the first few seasons as the plot progresses with a tedious creep for most of the series. The development of the characters is also slowing down, and with the later seasons, the cast has changed quite a bit, leading to ever stifling jokes (especially in the monks, whose ironic features appear mildly humorous, but boring when the jokes go along with it appear repeated). <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. It's just not a great show, like Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example. As something you can see at the end of a hard day, it is beautiful, but it could never be mistaken for high art.
