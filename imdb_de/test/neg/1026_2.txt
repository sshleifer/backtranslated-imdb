Although there is little action and everything that exists is just improvised, it was still a good start for a new director without any financial backing and also a clever move by Andy Warhol to make his cimematical productions more marketable and viewer-friendly. In any case, the story of a street artist relies on showing Joe Bock naked (almost always!). And the creative use of an eye-catching cut will really diminish after the hundredth time, and cutting off the dialogue halfway gets really annoying. This would have been much more entertaining or even dramatic if they had made a documentary about the daily work of a male prostitute or a robber, rather than leaving the actors a meaningless dialogue and dialogue.
