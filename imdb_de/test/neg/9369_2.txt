Usually, I do not write reviews for shows unless I have completely seen them. However, there were so many positive views on the show that I felt it necessary to balance them with some realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I do not think so, but it's true. I see that the show gets a lot of praise, and I honestly can not understand why - this show is so badly played, the dialogue is so terrible and the actions are thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting in that it's a definite litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and perhaps for some these elements are only more important than those that do not work, making the show almost unsurpassable for people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy having fun When you watch a show, cliché anticipate clichés, this can be a fun show if you have that kind of time in your hand. The pilot is a pretty good example of the whole show. If the nonsense saccharine cliche-end does not put you in a stupid shock, this may be a show for you.
