So you saw the Romero movies, yes? And you saw Jacob's ladder, right? And the later Hellraiser films? Okay, let's make a movie out of all three, just jam everything together and make a mess of it sounds like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. Absolutely terrible. Yeah, it's an indie strip that gives a crap? Is this a passport to make filthy excrement? The film tries to build credibility by focusing on interacting with the characters, that's obvious. Unfortunately for the authors, they are not good at character interaction. This is not a night of the living dead; The characters are non-beings who yell at their crazy lines to get caught by the microphones on the set. The dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses so much on interacting with characters, one might think the characters have more to say than "WHAT WE DO" "I do not know" "Well, we have something to do" "Well , What do we do now? "" I DO NOT KNOW. "" We should go. "" Let's just accept our fate. "" No, we have to go. "" GOOD, THEN LEAVE THEM. "" No, maybe we should stay. "<Br / > <br /> This is not an exaggeration, there are stock exchanges in this movie that achieve that level of redundancy and madness. <br /> <br /> The worst part about this movie? Half of it is a dream and does not actually have any Purpose: Nothing in the dream has anything for the rest of the movie.The authors could not decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie, and so they only did both.It's obviously ridiculous, the cheapest trick in this book, and it's insanely offensive, especially since I'm pretty sure they broke off the idea of ​​Jacob's head, which handled the concept a lot more proficiently than these jokers ever could. <br /> <br /> And then there it still the editing.The years in which they saw MTV and Ho Rror video games must have inspired the filmmakers, but it is certainly a sad thing that they did not understand, which has made the choppy editing and disguising of these media in the first place. In this movie, you'll often be confused, not in the good way, like David Lynch, but in a bad "Wait, I thought she was just killed, or, who the hell was that? who is this guy, where did he come from, how did they get here? "kind of way. It is constant and consistently bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a ridiculous rubbish and should only be picked out if you want to throw it in the trash with some friends and laugh about it. <br /> <br /> And finally: As for the "comedy" mentioned in other reviews, all this is unintentional. There is no intentional comedy in this film. It should all be about a big, serious character study, because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horror concept. Unfortunately, her claims do not match her abilities.
