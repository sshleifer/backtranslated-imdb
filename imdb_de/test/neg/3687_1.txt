I have never commented on IMDb here, but when I saw this movie, I can not be quiet. I just set up my account here just because of this horrible movie. In two words, this movie is PURE CRAP. the movie has no meaning at all! Nothing makes sense in this movie. Watching the movie was all the way painful. I do not understand why Val Kilmer has agreed to shoot this movie. He plays a subordinate role as a gang leader, says only a few words, and he has a total of 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I only bought this DVD because of the name Val Kilmer on the box and the interesting pictures bought the cover. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in another report, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself brought the reference to the rating that everyone should give: zero
