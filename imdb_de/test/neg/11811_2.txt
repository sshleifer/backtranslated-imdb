Well, that's the way it should have meant. Mainly because of the ridiculous, stingy use of what the director can hardly call symbolism. It would not be surprising if I found out that this was A) one of Lea Pool Pool Pool's earliest efforts and B) was at least semi-autobiographical. It turns out that A is wrong, although I know nothing about B. I bet, however, that she attended a boarding school and had a pretty terrible same-sex relationship from some people. This is the message that was struck in our ears by this film, and the short film that preceded that whose name I can not remember introduces itself by saying what its name means? Nobody.) The symbols were about as subtle as an all-glass elevator full of adolescent girls who lose a cable and overthrow eighty stories. About a speaker. Honestly, the hawk's cry when Perabo declared she was a bird of prey and jumped off the table? That was ridiculous until the parody. And it was just one of many too many symbols that should show even the stupidest spectators what they wanted. And that was that she had a crappy childhood and felt the need to film about it, including Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, all of us who are going on with our lives. There was nothing subtle, nothing sweet and nothing in this movie. It was poorly rehearsed garbage and the actors could not save Brett Ratneresque over the edge. Sorry, but it was terrible.
