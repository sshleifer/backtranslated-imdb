This was the first feature film for almost everyone involved, including director Teck Tan. Therefore, they deserve credit for their success. But this film was awkward in its direction, preaching in style, exaggerated in its acting and overly politically correct. The plot was everywhere and prevented every aspect from developing well. Gangsters get involved in the story, though I'm not sure what their presence added to the movie, except to make the movie even more unrealistic. They could have been completely omitted, and the film would have been better as a result. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young ethnic Chinese from Malaysia who returns to his homeland after studying in the West. His studies have brought him back with the skills he needs to make his dream of becoming a rock band and take them to the top of the Malaysian charts (a rather youthful premise). The beginning of the film suggests a conflict with his traditional father, but once the gangsters are involved, this part of the story is dropped ado. <br /> <br /> The film seeks to exploit Malaysia's astonishingly diverse ethnic mix Unfortunately, the way these aspects were brought to film seemed either terrible or downright preachy. There is a pretty scene where Malay women do a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot is forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> male leadership was particularly unconvincing. The Malay women's leadership was a notable exception, leaving the most positive mark. The film also has an openly gay character, and although it's a bit of a cartoon, it delivers some of the funniest moments in the movie. But the movie was just a notch over a typical local soap drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is not in the least offensive, has been banned in Malaysia. 3.10
