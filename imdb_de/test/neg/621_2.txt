Making a film based on a true story, especially one as unbelievable and frightening as the 1972 Andean plane crash, is difficult even for the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this seductive and cheap exploitative movie do not even try it! The actual names of the two survivors and the victims of the Uruguayan Air Force plane crash were ALL changed, the crash itself is obviously very slippery staged, and the cannibalism aspect was rendered unnecessary and gorily. Terrifying, it earns a lot of money on both sides of the border. Luckily, he thought, it was graciously forgotten. But the same people behind it later gave us the equally vile GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED! <br /> <br /> This cheap horror exploit blow required the creation of ALIVE some fifteen years later. This movie was a masterpiece. Survival! To put it mildly, it is not.
