Cruel, innocent ... no smoking, drinking or biking, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this a bad biker hit after the biker (exploit). They knew it, we knew it ... Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted ... but they lived on. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10 points. Best Performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY one to really catch the final exploit biker movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They tried to make a living. But Jocelyn Lane (out of two Elvis bath flicks, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is the modern, hot babe with J. Slate fighting for the honor. It's worth seeing, but it's shit. But look at it. Not bikers, non-smokers, non-drinking, "biker" types with hot girls are worth it.
