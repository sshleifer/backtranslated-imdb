I saw this movie about six years ago and recently did it again. If I recall correctly, I did not like it the first time and I appreciated it the second time a little more. <br /> <br /> This movie obviously has a big budget. The effects are mostly first class (except for one or two "impacts") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall look of the show. <br /> <br /> First, the one who has decided that Peter Stormare will act as a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired. As Swede and fan of Peter, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is just stupid, both in terms of the lines and the drama. So ... something must be wrong with the script. I would rather see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to watch them. It's a total mess that lasts over thirty minutes and too few moments to breathe. Moreover, the events that unfold are simply not credible. I'd like to see a much more rational and slimmed down version of this part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the scenes in which space shuttles fly are too action-obsessed. The shuttles maneuver like a few MIGs with no safety clearance as they bounce off ice-sized blocks of ice like ping-pong balls. The director should watch Apollo 13 to learn about spacecraft limitations like these. <br /> <br /> I like the music score because it's dramatic to a degree and makes it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is great. Apart from the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and quite easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With a few minor changes this would have been an 8/10 movie. I am sorry that it is not so.
