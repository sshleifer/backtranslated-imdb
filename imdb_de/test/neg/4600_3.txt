That does not mean that this movie is good. I was really frustrated on many levels. it is a kind of lace from Bukowski. Hey, I read the guy at the university - let's see what Matt Dillon does to him. and I like Matt Dillon. I thought he looked almost like a hank, but mostly just the reddish cheeks. But I have to look after a character, and there just was not much here. I think that time can be cruel for Bukowski, and that bothers me a lot because the writing was fixed in a kind of post-counter cultural time. Hard to sit, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. I ask for very little and have less.
