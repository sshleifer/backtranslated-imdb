Totally brain-dead actioner from the Philippines. This is one of the Filipino films that tried to present themselves as American films in the international market. After a rather boring beginning, the film declines and never disappoints again. It's actually a rip-off of the worst films Chuck Norris ever made: an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by the Soviets who implant a microchip into his brain so he's programmed to be the pope and president of the United States to kill. One of his old buddies (played by Max Thayer, B-movie star) is sent to stop him. Completely ridiculous action scenes, lazy drama (Nick Nicholson's appearance as a wicked Soviet commander is a must!) And an implausible conspiracy make up one of the kindest action images ever shown in public.
