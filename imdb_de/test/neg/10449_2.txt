The plot of this film revolves around this submarine builder, who is a real bastard and wants to launch his new submarine that travels thousands of feet deep. unfortunately he can not. oh yes, and he's following the memories of his parents being eaten by a megalodon as a child. The guy meets a scientist who is pretty hot, and she and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents. Basically, it's like Shark Attack 3, but less depressing. If you do not understand what I mean, listen. The opening credits of the film show "home videos" of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they were killed. In the background plays really sad and depressing piano music. You would expect to see a shark or something and you will do it. Every few seconds, a short shadow of the CGI shark floats, but that's it. I also do not remember a happy expression throughout the movie's running time. Much of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even more boring, and all the characters (including the shark)) die in the end. I thought Sabato would be able to kill the shark and save himself and the girl, but no, they all die and the movie ends with the shark being blown up and the submarine (with Sabatos crushed and burned corpse)) sink into the abyss. If you are a happy person and do not like to be depressed then avoid this movie. If you are the opposite then congratulate that you have found your movie.
