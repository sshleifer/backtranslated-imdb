Well, I have to say, I own this movie and I just like the end. The movie is boring and slow, but the last fight is so funny. Let's just say if the fake bird did not attack the evil main guy, this movie would be a 0 out of 10. The bird, however, makes it a 3. If you're really bored or want to see something terrible, rent this and make one Forward to the last battle
