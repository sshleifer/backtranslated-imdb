Anyone who pays to see Troma movies knows and knows what to expect. Still, I did not think it was possible to make a movie that bad and still be convincing. I just watched to see how much worse it could be before the end. First of all, it's an Indonesian action movie featuring an American protagonist who looks like the bastard son of Taxi, Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He brings in posters of himself disguised like Sly's "Cobra" and even has a purpose-built shooting gallery in Jakarta (with action cutouts of his biggest enemies) even though he's in the CIA and arrived a few days ago. There is a lot of action with rifle games (no muzzle flashes on these M-16s, just sound effects), motorcycles (breaking through walls), karate (where no one has physical contact) and even sex (where all) the actors are ugly). The main presentation of such an epic should be at least reasonably plausible, but not here. The point is that the world's most dangerous drug cartel is looking for a "drug detector". Why do you need it? That's never revealed, why not kill drug button dogs? Does not make sense, but is taken seriously. The actors are to be appreciated because they felt that this film would make them all famous and make an effort to "act". Best line? "Now dance to your grave, you filthy whore!" Best scene? Rambo jumps on a flying helicopter, pulls a machine gun from Baddie's hand, we go, crash, shoot helicopter, if he falls, helicopter blows up, cuts mannequin in water. F ** King genius! If you can not appreciate garbage, do not look at it. If you can, it's great. One last thing, did I mention that it was led by the three Punjabi brothers?
