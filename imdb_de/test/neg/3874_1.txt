This movie had potential. The script was not bad, and it offered an interesting dark atmosphere with suicide, patricism, regret and, as Chris says, "10 years nowhere". It's a sharp contrast to the original MAG7, which was bright and humorous, and even the villain was adorable. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting change in tone, and if they had developed the characters more, I might do that. I liked it. <br /> <br /> But instead they waste too much time on inadvertent (and ridiculous) battle scenes that have been badly edited together. At one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But not many people would notice, as there are already 2 dozen horse trips (I'm not exaggerating) and then we fell asleep already. <br /> <br /> What leads me to my title review. This movie has been cut down in detail because of animal cruelty, so the chance exists (if you decide to look at it) that you will receive the watered-down child version. There is a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull, and suddenly, as the crowd erupts cheerfully, there is no bull, only the matador in an empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I do not know. The scene was more likely. <br /> <br /> Later, there is a cockfighting scene in which the original version of one of the birds is terribly maltreated by a crowd of jubilant Mexicans. That was cut. But we still see enough to get pretty angry. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are horse riddles. One by one, one sees the legs of the horses being dragged and thousands of pounds of horse pushed on the head. In one scene, a horse is thrown, and as it writhes on the ground in paralytic cramps, an explosive goes right under the neck. <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in 1966 when Hollywood just started to regulate animal brutality in the movie. This is probably one of the last moves where you can see it. So, if the stuff floats in your boat, look at it and you'll get a slight thrill. If not, you will either be irritated or bored.
