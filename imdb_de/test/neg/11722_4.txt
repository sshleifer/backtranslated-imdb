I saw this movie for a reason: The slogan is "Upset and you're dead!" Cracking It's not surprising that this stupid horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape comes out of the box, but she laughs at her strange premise and her cast of characters: a human eagle-eyed radar, a powerful man, and a great sexual attraction controlled by a huge head on a chair, who is not happy that his family is being blackmailed by a murderous filth. This looks like a promising mix of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are a miracle of wit and the plot is pretty normal if you ignore the huge head.
