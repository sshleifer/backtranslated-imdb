Bad ambient sound. Much mixing. Loooong senseless scenes. For example: The guy sees an interesting woman in the lobby. You have to stay there and watch as she waits for the site manager to get a package. Says nothing. Starr scary. More mixing and other disturbing ambient noise. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Guy says nothing. The woman looks anxious or at least slightly disturbed, and rightly so. Manager comes back with package. Guy goes with the package in the apartment. <br /> <br /> Another example: The man and his host are sitting around watching TV. More ambient noise and shuffling noises. Wait wait wait Guy goes to bed. If you can go through this movie even more, you can watch it later. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, dialogue, entertainment or a well-designed movie, look elsewhere.
