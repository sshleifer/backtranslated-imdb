If you're like me, watching the original "Benji" phenomenon from afar and seeing the movie for the first time 30 years later, you may be shocked to discover just how awful it is, and it's more mysterious than ever about his popularity in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective, since I tend to have a preference for children's films and for that reason greatly weaken them. On the other hand, I have always hated this dog, a feature of the last few seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a great show, the dog-free early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog who was involved in the screen time. Benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog following him on several daily tours of the city of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring, it would be a good idea to give birth to "Benji" and never drop your remote into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there are any). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip," "Monkey Business," or "Because of Winn-Dixie," the human performers in the cast are extremely weak. "Big Valley's" Peter Breck plays the strict standard father and seems embarrassed at the thought of appearing in such a lame way. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) seems to find "Benji" entertaining, you should consider taking medications. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? ? I am only a child.
