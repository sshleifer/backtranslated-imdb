The humor does not exist in this loser of a movie. Carrot Top plays a surfer dude inventor who pervades his milieu arms for his stupid, useless inventions. Then he helps an old man who collapsed on the side of the road and he inherited a big company. And on and on and past the jealous relatives, the humanization of the company, hostile takeovers, the obligatory love interest. What Carrot Top has achieved is to convince me never to go to his stage shows.
