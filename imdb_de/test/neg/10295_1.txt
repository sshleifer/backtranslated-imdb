The executive producer of the film is none other than the messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the father of the director. I wonder what David's Guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, thought of this production. The hypocrisy here is just as repulsive as the movie itself. It's a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, serial killer of Phoenix and supporter of recreational power, would have loved every minute of it. I doubt many would complain about this movie because of its film art; It's pretty good at this level. But morally, this is the most discouraging movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I think it's the phonicity of the thing that makes me the most sad. Morally Deaf Generation Xers learn a craft and a bit postmodern aesthetic theory at the art school or film school and then get involved in the arts and entertainment industry. and here's the result: a movie that indulges in human suffering, injustice and slaughter. Many of them are witnessing a nine-year-old woman who brutally murdered her whole family by some of the gunmen who ended up riding in the sunset. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS COME <br /> <br /> For whom are such films produced? Narurally, sadists will love that - why should not they? But who else? As I mentioned above, there is really good movie craft here, but good craft can be applied to any topic. Why apply it to such things? The movie is also very exciting, but that's not because of the graphics and rudeness of the violence. It's exciting because it's well-directed and well traded. I am sure that the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock could explain that much better than me. <br /> <br /> So, what has been presented here? And why, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, filthy, even evil place, but should not we contradict ourselves when an "artist" is committed to rubbing our faces in it? Or worse, getting it in the faces of the nine-year-olds who will see it in one way or another on the home DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people will see to it that this movie is not seen by their children. Yes, I know - keep dreaming, Bernon ...
