I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a miniseries. At the end of the last episode, "To Be Continued" was a resentment to all the people who had seen the whole boring, indescribable thing. It ended as it should, so yes, you can blame the series for having no end. The plan was that it would obviously be different if the ratings were higher, but it was a boring show that took too long. People were annoyed that they would not stop when they said it, so they never did. Quite a few comments make the annulment and the end of the audience responsible for the public. If the truth is that this is not the case for this show, it ended the way it was supposed to end, it's just a lousy end.
