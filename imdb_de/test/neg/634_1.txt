* This review may contain spoilers ... or may not. The warning is the same for everyone * <br /> <br /> Dang it. Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all its ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us this. Actually, the plot is nothing that we have not seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, and so on. That means a monster, an animal or a threat lurk in a tight environment that threatens a lot of threats people. In this case, a foreigner in a train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I have to say, when I saw this thing for the first time on the cable, I could not stop laughing. No SCIFI movie had prepared me for that; it was so incredibly pathetic that I could not believe it! The actors are all a set of stereotypes. But since they are not that famous (to say the least), I did not expect much from them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments there, but I think the guy really wanted to find a job. The problem was so-called special effects that were horrible even for SCIFI channel standards. In this model / toy, they believed it was a real train (not to mention the model / toy helicopter, bigger than the car of a train), the Meteor came HORIZONTALL from outer space, the "baby" alien (a sock puppet and I ain ) (no joke), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly ... while they were static; when they "moved" it was terrible, the explosions (the terrorist literally blew up!) And what about the exploding helicopter! How many barrels of gasoline did that thing carry?), crazy mathematics used them (they could not once solve a school problem, right!) ... And I will not talk about the end of the end of the world, at that time I did not know if I should continue to laugh or start crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It is an ideal movie to laugh well, alone or with friends. But be warned! It's so ridiculous on so many levels ... and you need a lot of suspension of unbelief ...
