If you're in the mood for really bad porn without good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, be sure to observe something other than this. Acting is shitty. The "plot" is shitty. They try too hard, and I have been waiting all the time for a good redemptive scene that may make the movie worth seeing. Nope. Stay with the encrypted cable.
