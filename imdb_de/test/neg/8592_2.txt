When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good rally because it was my favorite actor of all time. He does an incredible job, although it's pretty obvious he did not have to live half a finger to get the role working. He's the only good thing, unless you're into explosions and the trash of the American dream work class (which I'm not). <br /> <br /> I do not understand it. How can this movie get away with this naf? The little bit with the little boy who was rescued, I mean, come on! You can not tell me that he would have been rescued without the firefighter wearing goggles (I know for sure that it would have been black in there and you can not see more than a few meters in front of you) and not a respirator ( he would have swallowed after 2 minutes!). This movie was just bad, OK? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ????? <br /> <br /> Excuse me if this is your favorite movie.
