I'm a big fan of "Auntie Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She really was the perfect actress to play this character. <br /> <br /> I heard that Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in "Mame", but it's hard to imagine anyone outdoing Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a great comedian that her comic bits saved her performance in this movie, in which I think she was a failure. Actually, they should have called their vocal part - listening to these songs at a faster pace and with strong voices changing really does make the whole thing happen. <br /> <br /> I just saw the revival of the stage in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame, Harriet Harris - the evil chain smoker at Frasier - played Vera and she was especially good , <br /> <br /> Both would be a good casting for a TV movie on this show. When this production comes to Broadway, they may consider filming it. <br /> <br /> Also, I think Tracy Ullman would be good as Agnes.
