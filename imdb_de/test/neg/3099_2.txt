What is the story, what is on the screen? First, I have to say, do not touch this movie, it's for your good (it's shit). And really, what's the story, in the beginning it seems okay, but after ten minutes everything gets worse. And that's not all, you can barely see what's on the screen, it's always too dark. <br /> <br /> Do not touch.
