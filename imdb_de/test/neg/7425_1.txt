There is something about a movie with bodybuilders that brings me to the screen every time. <br /> <br /> I saw "Pumping Iron II", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk" and even the TV movie "Getting Physical", which had some big names in the sport. They were bearable in their own way (mostly because they introduced Rachel McLish, ROWWR !!). Then I went and watched "Nemesis III: Prey Harder" only on the basis that there were such luminaries as Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. I love the ladies, will always do it, but after that I'm kind of glad I missed the first two "Nemesis" sticks. <br /> <br /> Well, the first one anyway. Most of the material here is physically lifted (and I would guess kicks and screams) of "Nemesis II". In fact, the impression of the evidence presented here seemed somewhat entertaining. <br /> <br /> But even if price and company are flexible and posing, they have little chance of doing anything else (like ACT.)!). In fact, this film is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha ...) in weird narratives, ambiguous characters, and open filmmaking (in both filming and acting). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes sense, but even if there were, there would still be problems - such as making small pieces for women as tall as life like this. What a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course it was written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion? <br /> <br /> Just a star, considering all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev have obviously put into their bodies, NOT the "crafting" work done in the film itself , <br /> <br /> Thank you, ladies.
