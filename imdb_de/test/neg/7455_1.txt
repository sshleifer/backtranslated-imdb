Why can Canada turn into good movies in any genre except in action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train crash. I just could not change the channel, it's pure stupidity that triggers my willpower. It's pretty nice to say that the IMDb of the performers was "credited" with this monstrosity, apparently never working again. It just goes on and on. The movie really has nothing to recommend. If you're looking for bad action movies that you can enjoy laughing, there are a ton of other films that you will not have to burn out your retinas. Get money from the government for funding or I'll never pay taxes again.
