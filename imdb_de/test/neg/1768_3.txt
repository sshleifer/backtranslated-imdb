A bad-tempered sf / horror project that takes itself too seriously and is only imaginable for (a) beautiful Mathilda May, who wanders naked through the chaos and (b) terrible mishaps. It has a few slightly cruel effects and amazing moments and some unintentionally funny scenes, but it's usually a waste of time.
