I started to look at it, but I did not believe in any of the characters. Especially the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress did not work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice, but the rest was only very slow. It was a very superficial movie that made me feel like I was watching a movie rather than a movie. The characters were very "Stagey" and the story was like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac dropped the assistant, I was bored and did not care what happened next. So I turned off. I'm glad I did not pay for it. Did not even laugh or smile. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as "comedy" if they are weird rather than funny. I've finally learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies, which usually proves to be cruel and strange. Now it looks like I have to be a bit more sophisticated when you call it a romantic movie comedy. Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a movie rather than a series in America. I do not understand why America can produce amazingly humorous comedies like Two and a Half Men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but does not seem to make any really funny movies without resorting to toilet humor. This movie was not rough or anything. But it was nothing at all, just a big yawn ...
