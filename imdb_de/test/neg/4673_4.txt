Half of the film consists of flashing lights and a shaky camera. The rest are foreseeable characters (science-science science, authority versus authority, etc.). <br /> <br /> What's the worst aspect of this movie? Is it the cars that are thrown around in the first 5 minutes, is the terrible "Russian" accent of the "cosmonaut", is it the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated Top 40 hits or the "USA save the world"? No. It is the fact that regardless of the "sad" end - there is very little tension in this movie - we basically know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> A good part of this movie: "American components, Russian components: everything made in Taiwan!"
