I suggest that any movie made from the sci-fi channel and then released on DVD was indeed made from such a channel as I would not buy that stuff if I had known that fact. Not that it's all bad, but if you are hidden in the middle of your movie for commercials, it just ruins the flow of that movie. This makes the movie rather boring. This had an interesting story, but the carefree and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the movie, as did most of the bad actors except Dien and Linda Carter. Of course, the story of attacking vampires in South America is not in line with the rules of vampire movies that are not usually seen in any of the vampire movies I've seen lately, with the exception of the Blade trilogy. A group of soldiers are sent into battle, stating that another team is being sent to meet with the team and locate the ex - wife of a soldier ... why she is not just his wife, this part of Military knows Plot really does not go where. Nevertheless, we get an interesting boat trip, some beautiful jungle landscapes and lots of blood. However, this fact does not save the movie from appearing too jarring in its presentation and sometimes looks very boring. I do not know, maybe it was the CGI blood and the smoke and whatever they have to do, though old effects look better and do not cost much more. I mean, cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet hole without CGI. Why can not we now?
