In general, I prefer horror films that crawl me so much. Above all, I'm afraid for the next day or not, not those where people look stupid and are killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The Legend's Chupacabra is a dog-faced, lizard-skin green, gray monster that leaps like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, sticks a string of sharp spikes out of its back and sucks livestock. As in many good and bad horror movies, this movie takes the legend of freedom. It not only attacks people, but also eats their intestines and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate her skin when bullets can not? And why, when the Marines know that armor piercing bullets can hurt it, they separate so that the Chupacabra can take it off one at a time? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also deserve their performance. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was just as bad as the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
