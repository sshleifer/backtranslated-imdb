I saw this movie because every report I read says it's one of the scariest films of the new millennium. I really do not understand what all the hype was about. For one, the dialogue in this film was ridiculously bad ("What if something strange happens?" ... what ????). Acting did not blow my socks off either. It might have been because the script did not give the actors much work to do ... the characters are two-dimensional to me, and I did not bother about them at all. Another thing is that the movie is extremely boring. Extremely. Sure, there are some "jolts" here and there, but for the 112-minute length of the movie, it certainly did not take the time. Most of the movie contains characters who talk about things that had little to do with the storyline. What was the meaning of it? <br /> <br /> To top it off, the movie makes no sense. Yes, I think I understood the intentions of the spirits, but how that fits in with the events that actually occur in the film is unclear to me. In addition, a large part of the film is played in small vignettes, making the story sometimes difficult to follow. And do not even let me start the end. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give credit to Kurosawa for placing some really scary pictures in the movie. There are very scary shots of ghosts and other disturbing images. If you think more about these pictures and explain them in more detail, it would have made the movie much stronger. But they did not do that and instead used more social commentary, which was interesting, but also presented in a bleak way. Yes, it is a news movie. Okay, fun. I just get the message of my criticism out here: Find a better way to spend your free time than to look at it.
