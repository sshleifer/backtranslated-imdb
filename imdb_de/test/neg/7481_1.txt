Nothing that Carson Daly ever said or did on this show ever made me laugh or even smile. I do not understand how this show has survived so many years. <br /> <br /> Even the "funny" band member is like one of the kids in high school who think nobody is good enough to even look at him. Daly and this guy are just arrogant guys. It seems they are not even trying to be funny. <br /> <br /> WONDERFUL FANTASTIC show. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I just can not stress enough how AWFUL is this show. Do not look at it. But if you absolutely have to do it, I recommend you scratch your eyes first and clog your ears with cement.
