Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart play a starring role in a "romantic" drama about a spoiled cook played by Zeta-Jones, who is ultimately worn for her niece when her sister was killed in a car accident comes. While she takes care of family affairs, she is replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> An uncomplicated maudlin story with no chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and he's okay, but not much of anything). Looking at it, I was wondering why anyone would like to see this because Zeta-Jones's character is so unlikely. Come on, she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best, she cooks for her therapist or talks about food. Pooh. I will not use any of the numerous puns that come to my mind. I could not finish it.
