QUESTION: How does a movie deserve two different titles like "The Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The movie is sooooooo bad that the filmmakers could not even decide on a title !!!! <br /> <br /> This film is a mixture of martial arts, death wish vendettas, melodrama, romance and other clich√© film techniques. The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians, led by Agent Simon (William Forsythe). The group is looking for a nefarious, multilingual, pox-colored creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and keeps them hostage in the lawless city of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this movie, and his scene is completely alien to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I've ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. <br /> <br /> Also in this film is Erika Eleniak, who has entered the inner circle of Marco's bizarre world. Erika's character enters into an alliance with Simon. The librarians and Erika become a strong clout against the evil in a movie delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box.
