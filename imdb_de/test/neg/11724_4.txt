Do not get me wrong. I have considerable weakness for the work of Charles Band, both as a producer and as a director. But you must raise an eyebrow if the man who is willing to call his name "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" holds a pseudonym to anything. "Bad Of The Family" is a bit bad, but it is better than expected. Jacqueline Lovell is an absolute talent that deserves more than these types of films. J.W. Perra is also quite funny as a titular monster, though he's pretty easily swallowed up for such a super-intelligent creature. You know, I'm stupid because of course the rest of the movie is so spicy and funny .... <br /> <br /> And with a main character called Lance Bogan? Nice people. We did not know that you Americans know this slang!
