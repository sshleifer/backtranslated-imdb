Airborne is off the cut road from the usual street to the action-action player. He has enough in his tank to keep the whole 90 minutes running, though you have to remember how deep the late 1980s comedian Steve Guttenburg stooped in such a cheap production (and also playing a tough guy! ). The plot is simple, the bad guys have stolen a deadly virus, and Guttenburg and the rest of his goodie buddies are sent to regain cover like AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The cast is good, but Sean Bean has revived his Brit baddie, who gave us a taste of box-office giants like GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
