This is one of the so-called "Hollywood Social Commentary" movies that both ways want to have. And believe me, in this movie both ways are stereotypical and stereotypical. STOP-LOSS is a 21st-century John Wayne film that deals with anti-war sentiment, but clearly concludes, "If you're a MAN in today's society, get together and march with your friends in the War." In many ways, the film was a great sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE as it represented an equally crazy and out-of-control military, a kind of FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza mixed with a Texas Red Neck world of suppressed homosexuality. erotic evidence of masculinity. This film had everything in one scene after the other clich√©d images. Then rebellious military deserter Ryan Phillippe rebels with his best friend's girlfriend, an artificial plot to visit families of dead soldiers, mutilated soldiers in military hospitals, and so forth, and finally address the issue of fleeing to Canada or Mexico.

FULL METAL JACKET MEETS SANDS OF IWO JIMA. But in the end John Wayne rides again! And a Hollywood blockbuster can ultimately hold both sides of the audience in their hands. At least he wants to believe it. When it comes to me, just take me back to the more compelling reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH.
