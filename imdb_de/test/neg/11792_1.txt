Why, oh why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was given to me by a friend on video and I thought, I look at it, it can not be that bad. First, is the drama just awful and we should think that's real? Secondly, this movie obviously attempts to copy the Blair Witch project (Yawning), and does so very badly. So if you want to be scared of your life, I would suggest that a Simpson Halloween Special would be a lot more scary. But if you just want a laugh, maybe the general bullshit of this movie is enough. But overall I would avoid this movie at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before looking at it. the best piece? It's only about an hour and a half, thank goodness.
