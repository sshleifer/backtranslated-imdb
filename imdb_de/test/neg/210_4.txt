One of those movies where there are no big turns and you can pretty much predict what's going to happen. Matt Dillon was great again, but the rest did not matter more than they should. <br /> <br /> At first it was exciting, but in the end it was a bit slow and predictable flicks where the good wins, no matter what. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try it. Personally, I did not think it was worth seeing. The story could have been more interesting, and the director could have done less well by making a happy ending.
