Ru Paul plays a secret agent named Starrbooty. She is working with another Drag Queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and bring her abducted niece back ... or something like that. Seriously-- I had problems concentrating on the plot! The film seems to be directed by someone with heavy ads - fast camera cuts that make it impossible to concentrate on anything. The dialogue is sometimes incomprehensible and if you can hear it, you wish it had remained incomprehensible! The acting is actually pretty okay, with the exception of Ru Paul, who is too embarrassed. The film is also full of disgusting bathroom humor, which is just disgusting and not even funny. After 30 minutes I had to go because I was bored, I was sick and just could not stand it anymore. I'm proud of having something to go through, but this went far beyond my borders! People compare this to the early work of John Waters. I do not agree with you. The work of the water is sick, but good - that's just sick. Avoid.
