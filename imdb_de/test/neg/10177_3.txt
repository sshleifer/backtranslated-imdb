My wife discovered this movie in the hallway in a local video store. On the cover it looked like a sci-fi movie, but when I turned it around, my wife saw that Rebecca St. James was in the movie, realized that it was a Christian movie, and suggested that we would see him. We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "Christian" films have a bad reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we have decided to give a demonstration. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the movie. The score - many of which were orchestrated - was pretty good. Cinematography was also pretty good, considering it's a lower budget movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any virtue in the production of this film was lost in a regrettable screenplay. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO Kidnapping - but half way through the film, the storyline revolves wildly into an evangelistic crusade led by the movie's two main characters. At least the Frank Peretti inspired film "The Visitation" (which itself was a very flawed film) had a final that combined the premise of the film. "Unidentified" does not end anywhere near the starting point, which is a huge flop. <br /> <br /> As with acting? The supportive action ranges from decent to terrible. (Rebecca St. James plays a small role and is passable.) Some of her main characters are sufficiently cast. Unfortunately, her talents are wasted on characters whose personality is so one-dimensional that they are unbelievable. The "protagonists" are anything but; You know that it is bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the movie to be the most annoying. <br /> <br /> One final note on the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be more interesting to Christian than non-Christian readers. In one word it is embarrassing. Other Christian films such as Carmen's "The Champion" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse" have managed to convey a truly uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without calling themselves a preacher or oppressor. In contrast, this movie is a sledgehammer that feels so stubborn and tactless that a non-Christian could have a hard time taking it seriously. I really believe that the filmmaker's heart is in him the right place, and I welcome the effort to create good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not included. If your church is looking for a good Christian movie, think of "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "The Champion" or (if you're Pentecostalist) Robert Duvall's provocative "The Apostle". <br /> <br /> What "Unidentified?" Rent it if you have to, but show it before showing it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
