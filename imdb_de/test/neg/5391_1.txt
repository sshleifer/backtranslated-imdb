Like many others, I bought this movie in my local World Cup in the "Two for $ 11.00" shop. I love cheesy B horror and sci-fi movies, and this definitely fits into this category. Pretty much everything that everyone else has said here is dead. Yes, it was bad, but that was to be expected. The main problem I had with this movie is that it was basically boring. I mean serious yawning Rama. The acting was bad, the costumes (K Mart skeletor outfit around 1982) were inferior and the editing was awful. No continuity. Mr Skeletor eventually dies in a kind of explosion ... er, even though he had several explosions during this movement. I think the last guy just asked for it. Apparently, earlier encounters with this "military" group (coughing) had taken its toll on his horse ... it would change from red to black throughout the entire manure festival. Do yourself a favor for a B-movie and skip it. The only good thing is to add it to my DVD collection now. Hopefully no one will recognize it when they review my film collection. Thumbs down, big time.
