This movie spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. However, the plot and the visual elements are so crazy that they seem more like a showcase for LSD. Plot: Michael's heroic fight as he struggles with his drug addiction while exposed to humiliated humiliation by Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, there is a good message, but it is obscured by the fact that the authors have adopted a rather obsolete PSA idea and have tried to stretch it in 30 minutes. This includes a song sequence that tells you that there are a million reasonable ways to say no. "I can not smoke, I have homework!" <br /> <br /> The authors can not decide what to do with the characters they brought with them free of charge. At first glance, we see that they have to hide from the human characters, but within five minutes, we see them all walking visibly without anyone noticing. Soon they start to interact with people, and the only one who is even disturbed by this fact is not the drug users, but the little sister who talks to her teddy bear (by the way, Pooh). There is also some drug demon floating around. Because you know, pushers do not give drugs to children. He too is ambiguous - though he may be symbolic of Michael's addiction and therefore not seen by other people, he goes a little further and chases little Corey to drug her. I guess he is ... uh ... go on! <br /> <br /> The whole action finally culminates in a frenzied sequence in which Michael is in a seemingly Saturday Carnival of souls. aka a theme park from hell, where the various cartoon characters beat it up and ignored it and so on. For example, Miss Piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits it out. If the authors were not high on writing, I have to recommend them to get high because they can not go crazy. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michaels had highs for two years at this time, which is why this trigger sequence would scare him is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> I realize I'm doing whale-watching in this movie entirely, but in fact I only saw it again because I tracked it down on eBay because it's just a shame to be a bad animated cartoon , The level of unintentional humor is brilliant. Take, for example, this scene - Michael's father races through the fridge for a beer. He notices that many of them are missing, and mentions it to his wife. The ever attentive mother tells him, "Do not worry, you probably just had them drinking last night when they saw football." While we're obviously supposed to learn that Michael drinks beer (in addition to pot and crack), we instead read on and say, Hey kids, it's okay to have chemical dependencies as long as you grow up. above! Scenes like these are worth the tiny price of this movie. Oh yes, and the fact that you say Simon, the chipmunk, "marijuana".
