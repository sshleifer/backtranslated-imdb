If there is a word that I can associate with this film, it is "embarrassing". It must be embarrassing for anyone associated with the film to actually see it in a theater. Everything - the script, the script, the dialogues, the lyrics, the direction - shabby, lousy. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was a kid. I liked it then, especially because it was a fantasy, a superhero movie. It's a not-so-explored genre in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all it takes. Sashi Kapoor seems to be in a hurry to film. I can not understand the reason for casting aliens as Hindi-speaking characters who can not even get the sync right (say nothing about syncing). The script is awful. The processing even more. If you follow the dialogues exactly, you can recognize grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely change the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. <br /> <br /> The biggest embarrassment must be for the censor board. There are a few nip-slip scenes in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can not imagine a metaphor). The director has missed her. The editorial team missed it. And the censor plate missed it, too. So much for the motto "No insult to the exposure". The officers probably fell asleep while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine why Amitabh took on the role. Maybe he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role has hardly anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he could not follow any worse. There are a few heroic scenes that are really worthy. But otherwise they are embarrassingly unbelievable (arrow shooting for example ... with CGI it could probably have been better, but it was '91 ..). Dimple and Sonam are not putting exactly the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor provide an inspired performance that is limited, however. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain (he occasionally laughs the evil laugh). <br /> <br /> On the whole, an interesting concept. Could be much better.
