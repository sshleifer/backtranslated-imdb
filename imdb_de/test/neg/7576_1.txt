One of my colleagues recommended this movie and said it was one of the most frightening movies she has ever seen. I checked it with my girlfriend and we gave up after about 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I had a long conversation with my colleague (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This movie is as original as the newest movie with Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original on the table. The scary parts have been made a thousand times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest mistake is the painfully slow pace of this movie. The periods between the horrors are with meaningless dialogues and much .. nothing wasted. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 Molotov cocktails
