OK, that's horror? I get scared - but I will not be terrible. Black and white is artistic, but too much black is exaggerated. There was enough talk about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ... a lot of it. It has been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done ..... but I hope not. My question is, when will the audience be tired of reliving this crazy dilemma? I think the director thought he was doing something else - killing children. Well, that was done earlier. Well, I think he had to take the shock ... let her kill in the darkest fashion. Okay ..... the audience was shocked ...... become ill .... disgusted ..... stunned. And when I got up, I felt all these things. Was the director successful? Yes! Absolute! These were the things he wanted me to feel and do. What do I do now with the feelings? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the astonishing talent with which Francis Xavier was "talented" ... could he ever consider making films that I say come out of the dark? After watching this movie, I was in the dark, my soul was attacked ... Is that what this craft is all about? There are many such films out there - they make the money I'm told. So what's up with the people who want to see all those shattering pictures? What's going on in this world that people will pay to be appalled? Would I see that again ..... never.
