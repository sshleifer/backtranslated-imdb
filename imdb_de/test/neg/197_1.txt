I was a hippie at the age of 22 in 1965, saw the play five times, had two versions of the music, and read the script many times. Maybe as a separate thing, the movie is fine, but as an acceptance of the play it is terrible. <br /> <br /> First the good. The songs are well sung and the production values ​​are pretty good. The gay implications of Black Boys, White Boys, are cute. The Claude / Berger counter was interesting. Hair is a flowing production, and constant changes are inherent provided the basic mind is maintained. <br /> <br /> The basic spirit, however, was very distorted. It seemed that the producer just wanted to sing certain songs and adapt the story, regardless of what had to do with the original intention of the piece. Claude, Sheila and Hud were introduced as selfish brats who could not look after anyone outside of their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents' party (it's hard to believe she smiled when her parents got hurt) and stole cars repeatedly. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert, where he would certainly get a sunburn, would probably have stepped into the rank and could probably die on this lonely road in Nevada. Have fun. And Hud liked to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. Hippies were not like that, not what the game described, and it's in direct contrast to a love generation. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie begging for money. It was about being self-sufficient outside of the capitalist system and not asking for it. After Berger was jailed for ruining Sheila's party, and Claude offers to rescue some of them, Berger insists on getting a bail instead. There is no better plan to save the rest that beats on Sheila's parents and then hit his own mother. <br /> <br /> "Be In" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted with foolish brides floating around. Even if this is part of his journey, it ruins a beautiful song. I know that they face "Floating In Space" of the army. But again it ruins a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude take a skinny bath, Berger steals her clothes and laughs "it was a funny man," even after he saw that both were very annoyed. A little later Berger does something that no hippie ever does. He beats Claude. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> Then you have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in a beautiful SF spot, with the stars flashing down and maybe working together to create an ingenious duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings in the blazing sun, racing down the street in a convertible (stolen, of course). <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the film in 1979 and I like it even less. I think it would have been possible to make the show reasonably acceptable, but that's not it.
