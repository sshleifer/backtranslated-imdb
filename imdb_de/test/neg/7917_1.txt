I loved All Dogs so much, that I saw the sequel in the theater, and I can not remember being more disappointed with a movie. The story stank worse than after an old manure bag. I mean, come on! How could Carface imagine being avenged on a much larger animal, no matter how angry he was? Plus the portrayal of Satan as CAT?!?! How can you get the cliche? So much for the story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback would not touch it with a 10 foot pole? The animation was absolutely miserable. The colors were all washed out, and I can not count how many times I've been able to see through objects that should be solid. It had to be the worst animation I have ever seen! I usually like animated movies, but not this BOMB!
