If you came here, it's because you've already seen this movie and were curious about what others had to say. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I really do *. And I apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this movie ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I have heard that there is no cure for the retinal hemorrhage reported in every dozen cases. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else, I rented this movie because I thought it was a stupid B-Movie rip-off from Blade. I thought, "sure, I could use a good laugh on a stupid movie." I give the movie designers a positive comment on their "creation": Thank you for removing REC XX / XX / XX from the lower right corner of the screen. I can see that watching this movie was a distraction. <br /> <br /> And I saw the movie * for the record, but did not see it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> Do you know what? I do not write about it anymore. It's just too painful.
