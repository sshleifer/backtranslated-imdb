OK the end of the story is - all the killings were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead. Yeah, I know, Cry Wolf did it and done well, but that's not "Cry Wolf", but "Scream Crap"! Even though the "characters" do not seem to die, we see that they are stabbed (and otherwise killed), even though these "killings" are NOT happening because anyone can see them. Mr. Director, if you want to show people how they are killed, somebody has to see it, if they are not in the camera and the fake person is killed alone, it will not work - and until the very end, I liked some scenes but your end has ruined the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible (especially the boy, who really thinks he has tricked his friends into believing they were playing with his dead grandmothers in the brain). when half-baked (but if you're half-done, you might like the movie), the only reason I gave this movie a 3 is because a) they actually did something b) they were released and c) they shot on film. Yeah, you read that right, they wereted $ 5,000 in footage for this crap (at least). Sadly, if they had recorded DV, they would have had some money for a better cast and another author who would go through the script and do well. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director has done something (as most do not), but HATWE the fact that he comes on IMDFB and talks about how "original" the film is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying a movie, if a friend has it could be a fun movie to borrow.
