I had not heard of Soap Girl, but I saw a poster with a five-star review of Film Threat in front of the theater. I thought, how bad could it be? Well, I found out soon. My God, this movie was awful. The most wooden actor I've ever seen outside of a porn movie. Absolutely agonizing dialogue. I just can not understand how that was done and why someone agreed to be a part of it. And I find it completely unfathomable that this was actually shown in a theater and money was raised for it. How did it happen????? And most importantly, WHAT WAS THE CANDLE THROUGH THE FILM?!?!?!?!?!
