The only reason I looked at this movie was the "early" Kim Bassinger. That and the fact that my TV guide said it was an "exciting tension" and it was rated with three stars. The rating must come from the man who wrote this jerk, because the only tension in this movie was whether or not I would finish it. Robert Culp shows what the "catastrophe" of his career as a police officer must be, which is not even nearly credible. At some point EVERYONE is a suspect, including a frail old woman. If you want to see a badly written, badly directed and malfunctioning movie on purpose ... then do it. In comparison, you can appreciate fine films. I wish I had that hour and thirty-six minutes back.
