Margaret Mitchell turns in her grave every time someone watches this mess. Fine costumes and sets can not even overwhelm the lackluster performances of Joanne Whalley (as the title character) and the ever-dull Timothy Dalton (as Rhett). Even worse than acting - and perhaps partially explained - is the script, which is amazingly clich√©d and predictable. Add a score to this hellishly bad script that will make you falter, and you have a catastrophe I would not want a viewer to hear. SCARLETT is just unbelievably bad, and I can not imagine how it was ever done, much less the video.
