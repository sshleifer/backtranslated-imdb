Some may go for a movie like this, but I certainly did not do it. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He accepts almost the first child offered, a bad choice called Adam. As it turns out, Adam does not have both rudders in the water. Norwell almost immediately caused indescribable stress and uproar. This sobbing story took place with one problem after another, all about Adam's inability and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor such as an adopted child was never explained. On the way, the good doctor managed to attract a woman who took part in the little devil that the little boy handed out. Personally, I think both had a beer less than a six-pack. Bypass this Yawner.
