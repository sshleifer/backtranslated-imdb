That was painful! Recently given away as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this 1977 British-Belgian co-production (could have deceived me, it looks at least ten years older) is quite suspicious and if you make half of it-hour markers, consider yourself trouper. The combination of animation and live action is at best uncomplicated and at worst almost terrible. So, you're wondering why the decision was made to shoot the movie that way, even if the technology was obviously not there. Harris is nothing more than a human prop and the animation is one of the slimmest and most lifeless I've ever seen, with the compulsory 'trippy' moments (especially when the animation of the Brainiac-like subtractor character is involved), the countless ones Cartoons provided features dated immediately from the late sixties. The screenplay by Don Black is a compelling argument for the normally resilient poet to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even very young people get bored. Stick to Jonathan Swift's original novel for adults.
