Regardless of what someone says, it's a b-movie, and the effects are bad. If you're a vampire fanatic, I'd say it's OK, not 10 out of 10, others can not be serious about that. We should consider this as a movie, not as a book, so the effects and characters, as well as the story, are important. The story is good, but she does not wear the movie, no wonder he has a low rating above all. I'm writing this because I saw this movie when I saw some great reviews here on IMDb, but I was very disappointed. Do not get me wrong, I loved the Blade movies and loved the underworld movies, but these characters are not close. The make-up on the vampires is done badly and the effects are worse. that sucks. I might not have been so disappointed if I had not read any reviews here telling me how great it was. The reviewer must have something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think that's great, you do not care about acting or make-up. That's better than a book. 3 out of 10 for an OK story ..
