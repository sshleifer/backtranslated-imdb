Some directors need two and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch needs two and a half hours to compose scenes with "clues" and its typical oddity, but there is no story. No plot No progression of characters (unless you find revealed delusion as "progression"). It astonishes me how every lynch can call garbage "art", but if the eye of the beholder has beauty, then so be it. Lynch's film and TV work in the 1980s was referred to as the "avant-garde" and "alternative." Twenty years later, work like "Mulholland Drive" appears as a 2.5-hour David Lynch masturbation piece. It's embarrassing. I finally saw the movie that takes my worst place. At least the people who spawned "Godzilla" and "Rodan" did not say they were "art."
