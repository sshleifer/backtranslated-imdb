There is only one reason why this movie can be seen. Until silence. He is such a good actor, the movie is not terrible. Uwe Boll, please take up another career. The special effects and actions are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. I can only say that Kevin Smith (An Evening with ...) talked about Tim Burton never reading the Batman comics and it turned out. Uwe Boll must never have played the video games that he constantly shoots movies about. If you both want to know how it's done, go to Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games ever made. Some people may not agree with that, but if you look at the movie, you'll find that ID's guys had a lot to do with Doom. It does not seem like anyone at UBIsoft approached this production.
