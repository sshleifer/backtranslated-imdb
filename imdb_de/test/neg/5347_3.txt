Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects is really amazing. The co-hosts do a good job. I especially enjoy when the "project" comes together. The end result is much better than coming off tape, which is associated with today's mechanical and cosmetic advances. However, I am a little annoyed that the "projects" are the property of the already rich and / or famous. It's too bad that the outdated can afford the company. Let's see, Vince Neill from Motley Crew gets a car for his buddy. Hello! If he (Neill) was a true friend, he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What a joke! Another episode features a seemingly wealthy middle-aged woman getting her 56cc caddy named Betsy done. The husband of over 30 years was behind it. The couple looked like money was not short. Too bad. I think the guys from the lunch bucket like me have to save for the day that will never come. I happen to own a 53 Ford project chip. Will someone pick me up?
