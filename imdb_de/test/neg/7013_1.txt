Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she was in this bad apology for a musical. <br /> <br /> The film features some of the worst choreographies ever associated with the constant threat that Lucy could invade her song with her bourbon voice at any moment. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer engulfs the movie before he can get started, and apart from hard-nosed Lucy fans, no one's likely to care. Bad costumes and kitschy set designs do not help. Further proof that Lucy could do nothing but stupid faces. <br /> <br /> Director: Gene Saks.
