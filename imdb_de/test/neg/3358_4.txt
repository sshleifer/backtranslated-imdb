Below-average blaxpitation action / melodrama, in which the lovely Mrs. Grier plays a private eye threatening her father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker of the original "Assault on Precinct 13"), whose lending business is underway. <br /> <br /> I'll be open - I agree with the few other user comments for this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has a less than satisfying script, a less-than-effective direction, action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best, and one of Mrs. Grier's insignificant minor characters (though D'Urville plays a major supporting role). Martin, also a well known name in Blaxpoitation. I have the feeling that this routine film was put together quickly, just to gain its enormous popularity. <br /> <br /> It was certainly cool to see Stoker again, although Ms. Grier is not as good a role - or a dialogue - as in other films, even though she does what she does best, and the one cheeky , sexy sister on a mission of revenge plays. <br /> <br /> Non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is at least pleasant. <br /> <br /> Mostly recommended for those who want to see everything in the Pam Grier repertoire. <br /> <br /> 4/10
