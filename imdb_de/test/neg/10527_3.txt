This movie was disappointing. After fifteen years, when it came back to my mind by reading some information about Mariel Hemingway, all the regret that I felt about the film came back. While remembering Peter O'Toole, I was fully aware that the female "leadership" (okay, - she was little more than a subject of discussion in the story) was Mrs. Hemingway. I've seen this movie in the days when I wrote movie reviews, and warned people about it, because the stories just did not work, and 15 years of my subconscious, when I tried to put things right, still had no sense for the river The Ideas. <br /> <br /> Part of it may be related to the fact that it looked like the original movie (which was what it was all about) was filmed, an editor came in and tried to figure it out. I do not know if this was a project of a former studio boss and was therefore disassembled by the successor to discredit him or her, or this was a catastrophe of the original script, in which rescue attempts were unsuccessful. The theatrical version just did not work.
