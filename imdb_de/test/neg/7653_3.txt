I saw this movie last night with a group of friends at a Halloween party. I have to say that the sarcastic comments never ended and I have to say that they were well deserved. Although I felt that the direction was well done, the craze in their dialogue is just too much cheese. I think I had about an hour before I even realized that it was about going home. You realize quite quickly that this whole family is pretty quirky and busy, it's just too slow. This movie could easily have taken 45 minutes and would have been much better. The only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine I had put down in the course of the strip. Take the Slasher movies, because at least I know what to expect from them. That was not my thing, too much dark humor, and the subject material of cannibalism was somewhat explicit and crude. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the role as well as he could, and I'll give him props for it, as I usually see him as a drunken rascal or fumbled fighter who wants to kill aliens. <BR /> <br /> Finally, I give this horror / comedy movie a very generous 3 out of 10.
