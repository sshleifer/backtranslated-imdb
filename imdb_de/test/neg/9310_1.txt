I can not stress how bad this movie is. This director has made every cheap, unintelligent attempt to make these people look so "desperate". Why are your clothes so dirty? Why in the world would you make the new Clark Kent play a crack head? You should be closed to movies for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> I'm seriously insulting this fool who wants to act as a real-life actor and lowlifes as a kind of witty joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a spithead? Why are they screaming so much? Why is everyone so mean? Why are these kids so dirty? Nobody would want to be so dirty? Not even a fucking kid. <br /> <br /> You have to grow up and stop making movies.
