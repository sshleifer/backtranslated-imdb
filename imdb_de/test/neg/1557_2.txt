This is a completely forgotten picture. A friend of mine picked it up for $ .50 at a nearby rental property in a bargain. He should have asked for a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot looks like this: A giant monster threatens the earth, and aliens decide that the world's most average human must be selected to save the earth. Thus, a tiny holographic space alien appears in front of a postal worker and tells him that he is "it." <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie, and in that sense, Zarkorr! The intruder fails miserably. The Monster Zarkorr has only a few short moments on the screen, a total of maybe five minutes (with a generous estimate). The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and could be the most interesting character to see, just because it sports a "teeny bopper" stereotype outfit with a playful short pleated skirt , The ultimate fight with the monster is over before you can say, "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over". The next moment, you have to think about whether you have just had a train accident or if someone drew 3 liters of blood from the water. However, although this film has delivered a line that my friends and I repeat and laugh to this day and were about the only bright spot in this otherwise miserable picture. When the actors of "protagonists" are "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them answers the questions with the statement "What are you, a kind of questioner?" It is so absurdly delivered that when you sit with a group of friends (who will not be your friends for long, if you persuaded your friend to look at it), you can actually experience one or two incredulous laughter. <br /> <br /> Even though this is not a manos or eegah (it's not bad enough to be classically bad), this movie will still bore you down with its horrible dialogues, unimaginative characters, and non-existent special effects 100. <br /> <br /> 1,5 / 10
