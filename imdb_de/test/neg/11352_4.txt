"You can survive everything". Everything but a stupid horror movie. The director could not even decide if he wanted a demon or just a serial killer. You can not have both. It's as if Michael Moore is trying to eat his cake and eat him (or 1500 cakes in his case) by making his special charlatan mark of "documentary comedies": they're supposed to be so weird and crazy , and yet you should treat them as truth-driven, earth-shaking, punchy documentaries. Some genres can not be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Anything can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere." (Translation: This is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) This does not sound so much like some "wise men" found on a Chinese fortune cookie paper, but rather the credo every bad horror director. We get this nonsense of a statement that served us early as a preparation / justification of the absurd buffoons. <br /> <br /> "My phone is not working!" Well, of course not. There is a far greater chance that Sean Penn's brain (after decades of catathaphic apathy) will start working than a horror film phone does. The bleakest and most predictable horror cliché of the past decade. Why do you even say it? We KNOW that help will never come through a phone call, so you might as well not mention terrible stupidities. The last 50 horror movies I've seen use this plotter. It will be embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "You always have to expect the unexpected." The last turn was quite surprising, I will give them so much ... However there is a lot of nonsense on the way there. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the thoughtful traps that the heroine builds up at the speed of a drug use lab rat - in the cold, wet and almost completely dark conditions. I just love the horror movie realism ... <br /> <br /> If a bloodthirsty demon tries to be funny (shshshing his victims), then you know your horror movie enjoyment is in doubt. The less was said about the old Geezer "cracking smart", the better ... Another stupid cliché, which is served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director. What are the chances of being attacked by your husband and then by an evil demon - the same day? "Expect the unexpected". You might as well have been squeezed into an event surviving a plane crash, and then another, where she encounters extraterrestrials trying to examine her ... <br /> <br /> The fast-forward -Button needed a temple or shrine built in his picture.
