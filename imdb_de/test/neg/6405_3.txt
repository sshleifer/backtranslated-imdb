One would think that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. And sure, it's an interesting topic - can a person be possessed by something marginal than a simple number so that they completely lose contact with reality and become hopelessly delusional and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someday somebody will make a movie about it. This has unfortunately nothing to do with the above, no matter what the trailer (or even the movie itself) you want to believe. I want to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. It does not make sense. A gimmick. A catch for unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> Well, what's the movie about? A dog catcher (Carrey) obsessed by a cheesy Noir detective book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. There. Sure, the character in the book - Detective Fingerling (sighs) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey herself is obsessed and begins to see the number everywhere. But it's just upholstery and completely irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all 23 references and have the main character (s) of cheese or something, and you have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that the whole "23" style was written in waay after the story was already completed, rejected and sent to rewrites. <br /> <br /> Which would be OK .. I guess .. if the The movie was not boring, boring and boring. Half of the film is told for Chrissakes. You do not see the movie, you hear Jim Carrey telling the movie. About a quarter of Carrey begins to read the book, and from that dreadful cliche we are forced to "intersect" "real" scenes from the dog catcher's life (where nothing happens) with a narrated, artistic film noir-ish "scenes in which They either giggle or just remain depressed. It's like the "Sin City" of a poor man with all the violence told by Carrey and shown in slow motion. <br/> <br /> <br /> This is a simple case where a C-movie script is somehow filmed with an A-movie cast. Probably because of the "number 23" hook, for which I think that sounds fascinating enough on paper guarantee the premium Hollywood treatment. However, since it is - as already mentioned - the number 23 and the cheese production in Switzerland, you can feel nothing but betrayed. I give "Fingerling - The Movie" 3 out of 10 because I think it did not offend my intelligence as much as "Forsaken" or made me suicidal, like "Battlefield Earth", and the bottom of the scale has to be reserved for such abominations his. But do not worry, that's still a pretty lousy movie.
