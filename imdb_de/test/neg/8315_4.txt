Hello everyone, oh, boy ... This is a Lulu. There is really bad background music whenever you can press it. There are three bad guys who, I think, are the stars. They beat up people, hacking people and bumping trucks and bulldozers into people. Ordinary stuff. <br /> <br /> The woman she sent on mission can not move her mouth when she speaks. It's like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own doll. She walks as if balancing an egg on her head. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe is for the men in the leisure style of the 70s and for the female lead role, who is supposed to be a good nurse, blaha. The woman with a bad Novocain mouth wears red. Maybe a silk dress or maybe just a too big poplin windbreaker. <br /> <br /> I really liked the end, though it did not make much sense. It lets us assess what happened earlier in the movie. <br /> <br /> The police are okay. Some bad, others good, except for two all stupid. The two Hellen could have worked in Hollywood again. <br /> <br /> The movie starts interesting enough and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy in the diner who gives the star a free hamburger does a good job. He is like a character actor from the 40s. Great voice. <br /> <br /> This is a little too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could only have had a few lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> Her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
