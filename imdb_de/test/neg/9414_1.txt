I had no great hopes for this. Before I saw it, the story called "stereotype". <br /> <br /> I mean ... come on! The plot line about the innocent androids is so stupid that the people who created it are immoral and they decide to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep because I was so bored. It's very rare that movies bored me so much that I fell asleep while I slept. The third time I forced myself to look at it, just to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I had the distinct impression that those in charge of this mess were trying to endure all the cool / neat things of other scifi / action movies and put them together for a kick-ass movie! They took the Android / robot, lots of action, thin storyline, stereotypical characters and a big fight at the end and threw it together. Unfortunately, the movie is shitty. The acting is so wood that you could build a house out of it, the plot / plot is absolutely ridiculous, the camera work and the editing are terrible, the direction is not there, and to top it off, everything is so clich√©d and ridiculous annoys you only the hell. <br /> <br /> I felt like I could spend some time making it a bit more creative, like cutting my fingernails or growing the grass.
