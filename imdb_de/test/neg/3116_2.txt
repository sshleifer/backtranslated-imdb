Firstly, I do not see how the film is on a "best" list or how it won prizes. Compared to La Pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. There were so many things missing on so many different levels in this film, but I can not quite explain why I did not like it that much. The lead actor was annoying, I felt I never knew what was going on and I was bored !! Although this should be a worthwhile change in the life that Pierre started, I wanted it to end ... as soon as possible. Why did it have to be his sister and cousin? Pooh. And why did Thibault get dirty? He just became bipolar. And was it me too, or did I miss the whole purpose of the black man? Who were all these people playing music in the big cellar of the big warehouse? Why did they have all this weird equipment and weapons and all the extra spaces people could live in? I'm serious about that, but does Incest often happen in French culture? European culture? I learned about culture for 5 years and heard nothing about it!
