The comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version is far too short. <br /> <br /> The casting is uninspired and the play of wood. One has the impression that the director did not read the book, therefore the characters did not understand. Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous, but his unintentional stupidity, brilliantly captured by Redgrave (in the 1995 version), is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> The Musgrove sisters are so unlikely they do not understand why Wentworth or anyone else gives them a second look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is free of emotions. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root were able to convey the depth of emotion they felt with their body language and facial expressions. In that case, it's hard to understand that Anne has been regretting for years, unless you've read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship. <br /> <In the scene where Wentworth has breakfast with Anne and Mary, it seems to the beholder, as Mary thinks, they are only light acquaintances. In the 1995 version, when Wentworth comes in (the first time he has seen her in years), the tension is great. Wentworth is hit in waves by Wentworth while Anne is almost overcome. <br /> <br /> In this version, while wooing Wentworth Lousia, it's as if he's really invested and the undercurrents are missing. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger over Anne. He flaunts his ad in front of Anne as if to say, "See what you have given up, I do not need or want you anymore." <br /> <br /> Still, it still makes fun for him to suffer The scene in which he asks his sister and the admiral to take Anne home. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels Anna's shock that he would not care if he were tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that he is still interested. In this version, he just goes on with Lousia, as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The key scene in which Anne talks to Harville about who loves the longest man or woman is totally botched. The actors recite only lines without emotional investment. When Anne reads Wentworth's letter, it's like reading a grocery list. <br /> <br /> Compare this with the 1995 version, where viewers feel Annes enjoy their second chance. We are with her as she reads the letter. The director has both actors read the letter and you both hear their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne first disbelieves and then turns into joy. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because they had to explain to the viewer what is happening. The 1995 version did not have to be explained, we knew and were happy for the characters. The only thing that has this production in their favor is that they kept the Mrs. Smith subplot intact, while the 1995 version did not. <br /> <br The 1995 version, however, contained part of Austen's original end. The scene in which Wentworth is instructed by the admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot want to move back to their house after their marriage (which he and Mrs. Croft rent). <br /> <br /> This is a production that must be avoided at all costs.
