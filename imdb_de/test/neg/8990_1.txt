This fantasy was absolute garbage. I thought Michael Moore had entered the market with ridiculous anti-government films, but this was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain that it is driven by tabloid journalism. This film is the greatest fantasy of a left-wing people brought to life on the big screen. Anyone a little to the right of such rabid Bush Bashers should be appalled that he ever had to get funding. I'm sure it will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It is hard to believe that these days, when crazy Muslims blew up innocent commuters, there is somebody in Britain who thinks Great Britain should surrender to the war on terrorism. I guess it's not the country that I admired almost alone against the Nazis almost 70 years ago. All the best Neville Chamberlain and the wretched appeasement policy!
