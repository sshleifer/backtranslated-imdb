MGM Hodgepodge by Jimmy Durante celebrating a big party for everyone in Hollywood. No big stars appear - we get the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I did not recognize anyone else - they were probably unknowns (for a good reason). The movie contains annoyingly listless jokes and some really awful songs and choreographies. The only things that save this from total catastrophe are Laurel & Hardy's "fight" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful colored Disney cartoon called "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost. Otherwise, the movie is a colossal hole. There is no director - what does that tell you?
