Ok, where should I start? I can not believe how many good reviews I read here. I looked at it (year 2004) and I had to fight not to press the stop button. I decided to continue only because of all the good reviews I have read. After seeing it, I felt it my duty to inform the world. At first, the movie seems to begin as if it never starts. The action will be performed 30 minutes before the end of the movie. The viewer wonders, "When will it start?" Never call it a "revenge movie" because revenge begins only after more than half of the movie has passed. In addition, the film tries to make you believe that this is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I'm sorry if I showed only half of the dusty country roads, and a crooked sign on a sign did not quite convince me, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. So, add this to randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have a crappy movie (I have nothing against gays, there was no reason for that). The only good part was the first chase, good director, considering it was 1979, and another good part is how he kills the last man. Basically, I recommend watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes, and you'll enjoy yourself much more than sitting in the middle of all these things, which can make you stick your own eyes out. Do not say I did not warn you.
