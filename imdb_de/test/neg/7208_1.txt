Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time refers to the perspective of the one who looks at time. (Or so I've heard) In other words, this movie feels like more than an hour and is changing. Even with a fast-forward (and you'll reach for the fast forward button), it's tapping somewhere around eternity. <br /> <br /> If you're familiar with Lionsgate's own version of Project Greenlight (buy a home movie here, but make a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror area of ​​your local Wal-Mart) will not be surprised that the entertainment value is complete and completely missing. <br /> <br /> The line reading (I refuse to call it drama) is uniquely horrible. This is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of slit. The camera work is a drunken father filming vacation movie quality, and while the special effects are okay, the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scar in the nude scene. <br /> <br /> The story is awful, the sets are from a haunted Halloween by ADHD high school students and once again the line reading (remember that this does not do more than sink to the bottom of a pool, is floating), does not disturb only words. Avoid.
