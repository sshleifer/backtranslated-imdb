I checked it for free in the library and still feel attacked. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually there, but only in five scenes of almost 5 minutes, and even these are quite painful to watch. The rest of the movie is so bad that you spend most of your time hoping it will end soon, but only if you're one of those people who have to end a movie when they start it. Everyone else will just turn it off. Do not worry, you will not miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming you've been tempted to watch this because their name is plastered on the case) are essentially just the slogans of other characters like this dialog: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny, please." Tell me what is going on. "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I do not know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" What does that mean you do not know? "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I do not know - it has something to do with my dad. "<br / > <br /> Lisa - "What do you mean with your dad?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know - he's crazy or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry, Lisa. I do not know. "<br /> <br /> (Moments later) Danny -" Some army colleague of my father's ... "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" What do you mean by army buddies? "<Br / > <br /> Do you understand what I mean? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Just say no.
