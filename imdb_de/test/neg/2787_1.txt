Some teenagers go to an old, deserted farmhouse left by their dead grandfather to one of them, unaware that there had been murders several decades ago, because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest thought better to sell his soul? The grandson of the man and his friends are used as the next victim for reasons that are never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, the black guy with a white girlfriend, and the two lesbians have to fight with three killer scarecrows. But, do not be cheated like I was, that's not as fun as it sounds. Most of the time it's just a chatter to complain about ball kicks, dope tuxes and the lead actor who complains never to know his parents. The camera work is disgusting and shaky, maybe in some scenes with a handheld camcorder, which may be a good thing, as the scarecrows look like they came from a kid's party, and apparently they could only hire two people for the three to play scarecrows! Some of the best movies I've ever seen were these low-budget independent horror movies, but these are just pathetic. The cast and crew were apparently just a group of people who knew each other, had never acted before and had no intention of acting again. They had a few thousand dollars (I can not believe that this movie cost $ 130,000) make) and a weekend of free time on the hands - even the lesbian skinny dipping scene is lame. <br /> <br /> I find it amusing that there is a sequel to this film from this letter, which has not even bothered to add IMDb. <br /> <br /> * out ****, and I only rate it that high, just for the skinny scene, no matter how lame it is.
