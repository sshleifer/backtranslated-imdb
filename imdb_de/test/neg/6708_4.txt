This movie starts with that scary song that gave me a few shivers, like the song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! It immediately sets the mood! The episode also shows what to expect! We are made aware that there is a spirit! The secret of this spirit holds this movie together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it is hard to understand! The ideas behind the plot are very interesting! Only the way we are told is far too abstract! I understand that the director believed that he had to keep the puzzle as long as possible! The problem is that when certain things are revealed, you will never get a satisfactory explanation! The motives of the important characters are omitted and some questions raised in the film are not answered at all! Since we do not learn enough about the characters, it becomes difficult to take care of them! And as a result, you lose interest! Only a few frights and a turn save this movie from total failure! The twist is interesting, but not a real shocker! The experienced spectator will see it coming! Some critics complain that this movie is too much like "Ringu" and is not original at all! Well, it's true that some of the effects and anxiety are borrowed from this movie! But there is a big difference! The tension in "Ringu" was mainly based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters are killed !! In "Ryeong" ("Ringu" -like), the twist is used as a scary effect to accompany another crazy twist! "Ryeong" strongly depends on a complex structured action and turn that does not contain enough fear to arouse your interest! Simply put, this is not a scary movie!
