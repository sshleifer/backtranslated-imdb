I think the company that made this movie wanted people to think about the Conan movies, but for those who made that movie, unfortunately, it does. You'll think, man, the Conan movies were pretty cool ... this is totally boring and shit. The story, who cares? It will not help you to like this movie more or less as it just looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, does not look as if he belonged to this, why he has agreed to play the role, is not me. Well, probably for the money. I love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is simple and terrible.
