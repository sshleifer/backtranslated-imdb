This movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses Gabriel's horn to open the sky and pull the good angelic dogs out of Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad and eventually eats a living rat. <br /> <br /> We got this movie with a pizza for free. You get what you pay for.
