Friz Freleng's "Snafuperman" is one of the less private snafu shorts. A warning about the importance of studying your field manual, "Snafuperman" indicates that it is a bit awkward. The story of Technical Fairy, First Class, turning Snafu into a superhuman one to help him recognize the fallacy of his ways is predictable and gruff. Freleng's earlier snafu short "Rumors" had burst with ideas and laughter, but here the director is overwhelmed with a rather boring subject and strives to make an entertaining short film out of it. Snafuperman himself seems to be tugging at a length of about three minutes and feels, in contrast to the best cartoons in the series, in the first place like an educational film and second in entertainment. Despite being eliminated faster than the usual Warner cartoons, the Snafu shorts maintained a surprisingly high standard. "Snafuperman" reflects the quality you can expect from a less talented bunch of creative minds.
