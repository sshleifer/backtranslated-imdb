This is an old, dark house movie. A young couple crawls into a strange mansion allegedly led by Satan, where they are run into each other by an ill-equipped crew: a distressed lady, a monkey, a monkey man, a dwarf, various looking people, and for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero has to conduct a "Price Is Right" contest, where seven levels of seven illuminated footprints have to be climbed. hence the title. For my taste it is too much of the same. The crawling in the hallways of the fun houses is amusing for a while and then repeats itself. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy, who do the same on two reels, it's not really funny. It is also not scary and was obviously not intended: the budget is too absurd. For most movies in this genre, the comedy is reconciled with a real threat, and usually two - one that the characters believe is real, and another that it's a cover for. The cover here is not to be taken seriously and not what is covered. A few moments of fun come out of the mix, but it's a lot of fun. The novel on which the film is based was a thriller, and I think it could and should have been played directly.
