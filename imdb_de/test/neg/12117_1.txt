Every night with Jonathan Ross means to me now his joke, first harassing and annoying a 78-year-old man by phone with carefully selected words. He then suggests he and Russell burn the house and have him masturbate while apologizing for obscene phone calls with him. Confused! And illegal. For a really big laugh, should he try next time with someone he knows well, like his boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would it amuse him if someone had done it to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've probably seen less than 30 minutes of BBC's Star Man Ross's chat show because I find it so disgusting by the guests I saw were OK - probably the most, that had ever appeared, OK for everything I know. As a chat show it seems to be rather poor? What's so talkative about asking Tory boss David Cameron on this TV show if he's ever masturbating on photographs of Margaret Thatcher? He chatted with Gwyneth Paltrow, simply asking her if she wanted to fuck him. Rosss Yob's mentality was finally debunked with the above revelations, and I thought I would take this opportunity to warn the few decent people in the world who might not know how disgusting this man is, and of him and keep it away - unless you believe that all comedy should be "nervous", ie obscene / empty. We are not all the same here, though the BBC and Channel 4 throw all standards overboard. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross and his colleague Russell Brand made a series of deliberate sexual obscene telephone calls to Andrew Sachs. Answering Machine (Manuel von Fawlty Towers), as intended, against Sachs's request on the BBC's national radio and then tried to get Sachs' granddaughter to burn the evidence in case they were prosecuted. A considerable number of people here (probably most of them are not BBC royalties) found it funny and / or the national scandal was outstripped, but many people still seemed right, and 42,851 finally complained to the BBC about the Incident. Many unjust media jesters and others giggled that these 42,851 had never heard of the radio program (and never wanted to) - they probably also believe their argument to be an event like the Holocaust because relatively few people complained to the media back then We should now be appalled because we were not there. The two BBC producers involved in the broadcast thought it was a "very funny and brilliant" comedy. Only two people at the time complained about Brand's radio program - which unfortunately only indicated the moral level of its 400,000 weekly listeners with the help of BBC's expertise. The highly moral BBC has tried to use them as Milder in the later OFCOM investigation. Roll over Aristotle, tell the news to Lord Reith! Sachs's agent complained to the BBC, but was ignored by them until a national Tory newspaper hit the story. The punishment for any ordinary pervert would normally be dismissal and prosecution, maybe even a jail, but while Brand and the boss of BBC Radio 2 were both eventually called to resign, Ross received the 12-week leave from the BBC boss (I suppose that he first asked Ross for permission to pair Rosse's £ 1,500,000 salary to prevent him from complaining about revisiting the program in 2009 before his contract expires to think of more dirt and / or insulting jokes that his 4,000,000 viewers could admire - but at least he could boast to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up, some people think his position will be unsustainable, and he I think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he comes back unbowed and gets new energy with filled vitriol (Update 2 3:01:09: I've just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series - the "biggest cock-up" - to use his reference sentence - it continues to allow this deterrent law criminal to take the public money like that.) But Who knows: Maybe the British film and TV industry in the future has comforted him with the moral stance of 42.851 and showered him with prizes, and he becomes a sir for his services to the perversion of the perverts in government. At least I hope these two crazy deviants sign up for other perverted commercial television and radio stations and stay there, so I will not pay to ignore the law and spit out illegal obscenities in the future. In 2009, OFCOM imposed fines for £ 150,000 on television for this "sad" affair - thanks to Ross for offering to pay! Not. <br /> <br /> To the apologists: Get a life / sense of humor / sense of proportion! It is not the end of the world to have a pair of talentless perverts as heroes, and there are many more important things to worry about in this world, such as the price of real cheese! Conclusion: Family man Dross: a comedy that seems genius to millions of people (especially themselves), just a nasty obscene phone caller who passes an obscene pay packet from one obscene multimedia company to another. So much for our society of political correctness and respect! As you have guessed, it is not and will never be for the rich and famous, but only for the poor. Conclusion: BBC: Stumble blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate and Phonegate. Now Rossgate. I hope the next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks comedy should always be a challenge and push boundaries, that is to say, attacks are not questioned or offended by my opinion of this law-breaking pervert, his perverted programs, and his current perverted employers.
