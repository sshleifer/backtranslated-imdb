This failed exercise in satire or a commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy if I find a cheap alternative to sell unwanted companies. It's so bad, honestly. I see it as a kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to see the carnage, then this movie is a gem. To be honest, Kelsey Grammar's character has a line that almost works, but not quite. Aside from that, everything in this film seeks to be enlightening, but misses the target by about the distance between Earth and the next pair of colliding galaxies. Usually I can appreciate a book or a movie where the protagonist suffers from a kind of existential anxiety, but the fear presented here is so incredible and exaggerated, and the movie does not even address the nonsense it does represents in a valuable way. If you are familiar with the term "vomit word", you may get a picture of the cinematography. Oh, and the narrative structure is ill-conceived, overbearing and amateurish. It fails both in terms of style and content. If you really hate someone, invite him to a double film for this movie and "The Terror of Tiny Town," a 1930s western, and set him with the eyes of a "A Clockwork Orange" style. However, this is likely to violate a provision of the Geneva Conventions.
