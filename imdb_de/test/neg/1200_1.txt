<br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Louis Gossett Jr. was ready to appear in this movie. Everything about this step feels artificial, forced and invented. The air sequences are flat. The enemy figures seem like puppets. This is just a bad excuse for a movie. At least Top Gun had air sequences that looked good (the outdoor shots anyway). But the songs of Queen are cool. Rent in the middle instead.
