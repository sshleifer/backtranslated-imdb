I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy mocking them in the company of my friends. We are all pretty good at it. Let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> At first it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they catch him, but he escapes in this big, old shot. There is this singer whom we believe died, only she has not, unless there are several who all act the same and look the same. Cue Burt Reynolds comes in and questions the singer. He looks like he has just walked out of the Walker, Texas Ranger set in this movie, and is damned confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, only he does not ... And the worst part is that there is not enough dialogue or action that is not about killing people or making fun of this movie !! And do not mess with the random chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it was about breaking the old power structure in Eastern Europe. We did not know where we were, all the accents were apparently "Eastern European" and what did Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe do there anyway? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to tell people about what I thought about this movie and get my money back, but since I got it as a special (just $ 0.99), I decided against it , What I want to know, though, is how the director filmed this damn movie and what the "stars" thought when they signed.
