I lived alongside the author in 1980, when he moved to Portland with two of his high school buds from Downer's Grove, Illinois. He seemed to be a normal guy, though he had many artistic pretensions. Within a few years, he and Phil and a few others jumped into the post-punk music scene of Portland, and a band that definitely did not go anywhere, even though it got a lot of action, including a meeting with Courtney Love in their day in Portland groupie. He seemed to think that his musical prospects were good enough to move to San Francisco, then New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> I was surprised to hear that he got a publishing house in 1995 after the band crashed and burned. The name of Courtney Love seemed to be the hit. I have no idea how the movie was made, especially with this cast, but I doubt if Gus Van Sant was involved. Anyway, the reviewers seem to be unsure if the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so I would simply say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent man who wants to be a writer or an artist or something, but Not. I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without amphetamines.
