I was looking forward to watching this movie since I loved the David Lynch version. On my first attempt to see it, I fell asleep. Nothing happened. The next night I tried to see the rest and again I fell asleep! There has never been anything in this film that could hold anyone's interest. The only time it got any more exciting was when I tried Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk containing bonus material. It was needless to say that it was not hard for me to go through the torture, to see more of Dune (2000). Here are the low points: The drama was bad, the action was in slow motion, the sets were cheap and the direction seemed pathetic, and the CGI effects were childish dune, save money or rent the 1984 version.
