I think it's been two years since I saw the movie, and it's still the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for tax purposes. So after all this time I finally spilled my belly;) And now IMDb says I have to fill in 10 lines of comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you have to specify at least 10 lines in your comment edit window (or use the option BACK if this is not a new window). "<br /> <br /> Please have nothing more to say ... <br /> <br /> We are sorry English.
