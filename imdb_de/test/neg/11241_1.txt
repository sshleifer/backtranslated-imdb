The first time I saw this was when I was on a date and she thought it was a great movie. I did not do that. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw the last night on TV. It's still shit. <br /> <br /> As a love story, that's shit. When Julia portrayed a street hooker, this is disgusting. For me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough cover for her. She was not tortured, tortured, angered, starved or anything else. Her "Hooker" character was as flawed as comparing a cubic zirconia to a diamond. The two just do not fit together, no matter what they look like. <br /> <br /> The ONLY cast that I thought was worth were the two bitchy saleswomen who were superbly staffed. They did such a good job that I hated them for the few seconds they were on the screen. They had a real definition for the supporting roles. OK, so the movie was not completely garbage. The two ignorant shop assistants rescued the film. Apart from these two shop assistants, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just crap. Either everyone was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialogues in the movie, except that he just complimented Julia Roberts or Richard Gere kissing a donkey. <br /> <br /> This was a movie about how to walk around In high-heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people look at you and people working in hotels sting as if they just had a baseball bat in their hands Face hit. <br /> <br /> In reality, the women The women dressed in Beverly Hills up to the Ninth are more hookers and prostitutes, but since they do not wear the loud Madonna jewelery or patent leather boots, they can look at the others that do that. <br /> <The hotel staff was extremely sad, and anyone with a real character had less than a minute of screen time. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to romantic films, comedies, dramas and even prostitutes who face wealthy clients every day hoping their lives will be perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is about Jul ia Roberts is PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine. She is still in her possession, still telling her how to behave, how to move, what to wear, what to say where and what to do. He's more in control than a street pimp, but the Disney / Buena Vista people make it easier to swallow. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere had a black man with a golden tooth and an AK- In his movie, instead of a briefcase, he would talk about how a woman has to fight to escape hard prostitution. The same story, different characters will have a very different view. Oh yes, change the white man for a black man or an Asian or Spaniard, let the land deal switch to a deal with guns or narcotics and the whole concept of the romantic comedy is thrown away. <br /> <br /> For me, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with bows and bows. <br /> <br /> I did not think I did not like it 15 years ago, when I did not understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that I can see past the pretty decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story of how to control a woman as long as you have the resources and the income. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general as well as for me TV screen. <br /> <br /> Do I hate it? Yes. Is it sucking? Yes, would I recommend it to you? NO ... well, maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be published? We will see. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, that's all for now.
