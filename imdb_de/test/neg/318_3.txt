My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago when she was here for the Thanksgiving visit. I rarely laughed so much. This is a typical low budget horror movie with stupid special effects, a lesser plot and even worse acting. But do you really expect a classic if Linnea Quigley gets a top-notch? I did not think. <br /> <br /> Since this movie has some entertainment value, I give it 3 out of 10 points.
