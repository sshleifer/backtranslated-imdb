It may have been exciting for an audience in 1946, but the film is now a bit boring. It was hard for me to get through it, and it was very predictable: I mean, we know from the beginning that Welles is the Nazi war criminal, and I appreciate if he gets caught and ends up being properly punished. <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing. It is sad that Welles has made only three featured films in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
