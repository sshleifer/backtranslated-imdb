Closet Land is a nasty job with outstanding actors. In the film, nothing more (or less) happens than the endless abuse of an attractive female prisoner by a sadistic police officer. The setting is minimalist. This can be seen as soft-core S & M porn, as the drama does not contain any reference points such as time, location and political context. Since what happens is cut off in a futuristic fantasy environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified because they are warned against the evils of a totalitarian government. However, since there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come back disturbed and have not learned anything the place? This torture exists in the world? That the abuse of prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land is reminiscent of works such as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both works are by skilled artists whose works had a historical context and a profound meaning. This work is amateurish and the dialogue is sophomoric. A clear thumb down.
