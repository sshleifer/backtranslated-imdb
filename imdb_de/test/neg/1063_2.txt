... said the continuity announcer, as TACTICAL ASSAULT is about to be broadcast. After watching the first two minutes, I thought Rutger might want to get a new agent. After watching the next ten minutes, I thought Rutger might want to retire to save a potential audience from further performances. <br /> <br /> Yeah, that's a really horrible movie. I did not expect much, and why, when the name Rutget Hauer appears in the credits, but within seconds of the opening title that marked the USSR bombing of NATO fighters in Bosnia, I realized that I was having three months Inedible turkey would be fed after Christmas. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail is missing. NATO aircraft bearing USSR markings were informed that Hauer's character spent six years in an Iraqi prison, which would trigger the 1997 stance. Which NATO bombed the Serbs in 1997! I think the producers did not believe the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did. The producers probably also hoped that the audience would not notice the lack of continuity, such as dog battles with Iraqi jets that suddenly turned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms, but I did. Even foreign characters would take off in the F-16 when they arrive at the base, where the jet has changed into a Mig built in the Soviet Union. Oh, and if you expect a stupid action movie, you're only half right, because it's stupid, but most of the storyline is about a BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot. I give the producers some credit (maybe a word is too strong for a word), because after seeing plans with hellish nannies, cops from hell, and roommates from hell, we now have a fighter pilot from hell who Every occupation of the 20th century means the century has shown in an action drawn by hell, whereby perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT was the worst movie of the lot
