May 2: Someone clicked 11 NO and then went on to make 15 more comments on my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> As I write I still feel like the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a big problem with giggling, but I try to calm down. (It's pretty hard to write when your nose spills snot and your mouth throws sporadic spit on the keyboard.) A couple of young women who have just returned from vacation travel by shuttle bus. A few young people join them. But the bus is not a taxi service, but a hijacking vehicle. (Do not giggle!) The driver was part of an organized "white slavery" that kidnaps young women from airports for five years. (Do not laugh.) Five years at the same airport without the police or even the FBI ever getting wind of it. (No chuckles, please.) Obviously, dozens of women disappear in the same places for years in the same place - and yet no one notices a trend. Is the FBI incompetent? The world of "Shuttle" seems to consist of three types of people: easy-to-hijack blondes, silent / comatose / invisible FBI agents, and all-powerful psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blondes with tattooed hind dogs). <br /> <br /> The driver was barely alive during this one mission, and he did this - I repeat - for five years without being killed or losing any of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Do I have to mention it? We all know that movie psychos have immortal DNA. You can stab them, hit them repeatedly against the walls of a bus, gently stroke them with a hammer, stab nine-inch nails in the ears ... Hell, you could put a hand grenade in the mouth of an average Hollywood psycho, and he would still escape with small scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even a little demon, just a normal Hollywood psychologist with better survival skills than the biggest, meanest cockroach. <br /> <br /> The Basic Sketch: A man loses all his fingers in a stupid scene. (A magical bus that reads thoughts and obeys!) The passengers try to escape. They fail. They are hurt. They sulk. They fight. They try to escape. They fail. They are hurt. They fight. They try to escape. They fail. They are hurt. They try to escape. They fail. They try to escape. The kidnappers manage to wrest the gun from the driver! Unfortunately, they do not kill him because the Golden Hollywood Rule of Gandhi pacifism prohibits them. (No chuckles) One of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied at the Rob Zombie / John Travolta School for Over-Acting & Silly Mugging. He threatens rape. Later, one of the men hits him with a crowbar about a dozen times ... very hard. Only seconds later he regains consciousness. Yes, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He's killed a little later. (No idea how to do it! He should not be killing.) The kidnappers argue. They try to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, the psychos are too godlike in their power not to recapture their prey. The game starts all over again: the passengers try to escape. They fail. They sulk. They stare into the void. They are hurt. They try to escape. They fail. You get hurt ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I believe a numb, highly disoriented, intoxicated snail would have escaped these Nincompoop kidnappers with ease. There were so many possibilities. At some point, these chubby psychos (remember: five years!) Even send one of the abductees to a grocery store! She leaves a message to the police. Yes, you guessed it: This fictional, fairy-tale US city has no police. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought the movie could not be foolish - not even when Luc Besson and Brian De Palma teamed up to help with the script - it does. The girls are kidnapped to be sent to a remote island (?). This is accomplished by being transported as cargo. Apparently this fictional America has no FBI, no police - and no borderline habits. However, there are immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. A blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. Why is it that victims in these stupid thrillers NEVER try to kill their immortal opponents when they are lying on the ground and injured? I think I answered for yourself: you are immortal! Why should she bother, she must have thought ... <br /> <br /> Why was one blonde gassed to death and the other nested alive (complete with a litter box and the funniest photo ever since) Demi Moore's primary school pictures)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed the fairer, but that's just me. Was her tattoo so ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I do not care? Why should I look for logic in a film created by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Besides, how can I even think clearly if I laugh so hard half the time ?! Of course, this is a horror / thriller of the 21st century. The cell phone is not working ... Maybe this invincible gang controls not only the FBI, the police and the customs, but also satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Do I have to spell it? There are far easier ways to kidnap people. And much smarter people, who should make films. Give an idiot a camera, and he'll lay down an egg every time ... Those kind of answers where the eternal puzzle came first: the egg or the bird-plagued director.
