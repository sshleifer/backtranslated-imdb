Just a few words: It is a good thing that George A Romero is still with us, because if he were dead, he would be forced to vote against the people who made this political satire. I actually agree with these people match. Yes, there are zombies in there and they have a good reason to come out of the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them gets the Doctor of Startrek Voyager ready. That's about as scary as it gets, folks. If you are looking for a horror movie, I suggest you keep looking. And if you're looking for a funny political satire, you're in the wrong place, and not just because this series is called Masters of Horror. But do not let me stop you: maybe you'll see something I've missed. Chances are you're wasting your time, just like me. Let's just say I prefer my zombie movies to the zombies that are right in front of the camera.
