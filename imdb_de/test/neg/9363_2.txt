<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations for low budget art house movies. I also know that John Sayles has a kind of appearance about him, this earthy, intellectual anti-Hollywood atmosphere, Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers, and Atom Egoyan, who made him a darling of critics right from the start. <br /> But that's not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just is not. <br /> <br /> It meanders. It has too many characters. His tone is uneven, his point of view is confused, acting is everywhere on the board, from naturalistic to exaggerated. It stays for a long time with little characters we do not care about and cuts off from tense scenes only when things get good. <br /> <br /> It misses the target. <br /> <br /> The worst mistake in the movie is that the two things that come closest to a protagonist, Marly by Edie Falco and Desiree by Angela Bassett, in characters who have no drive. Marly is an apathetic drunk, imbued with her own laziness. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain. If the worldviews of your two main characters are summed up with the terms "I do not care" and "I want to leave here," why would the audience give you a rat patience? <br /> <br /> I To put it simply: Sayles writes funny dialogues. He is very adept at creating a scene. The problem is that these scenes go nowhere. There is no backbone in the movie. No drive The movie does not arouse any of the characters' interest. In my opinion he is also preaching that the big guy has devoured the little guy. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a high quality "little" movie, read David Lynch's "Straight Story". Give this over.
