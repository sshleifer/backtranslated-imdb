Technically, I was a Van Damme fan or I was. This movie is so bad that I hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes. Do not be fooled by the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II), I had high hopes for this, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), man ... was I wrong ?! All the action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero, but I think we will not see that soon, as our hero is always there, I mean, for Christ's sake, we're in 2008, and she insist on making these disappointing films at all levels. Why ??!!! Do yourself a favor, skip it .. seriously.
