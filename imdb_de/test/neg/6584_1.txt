The polar express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, contact and who framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER THE FILM TITLE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews in this film were almost unanimous and said that this is an instant classic for the holidays. Ebert & Roeper give two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave him a full four stars! Wow ... OK ... I have to see that! But wait ... the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm NOT interested in seeing that anymore. <br /> <br /> "Are you coming?" says the train conductor to the boy in The Polar Express. The boy hesitates initially, and the train begins its journey without him. The boy changes his mind soon and jumps in just in time. <br /> <br /> Well, most of you have probably decided not to get on this train and wait for the TV train or rental express (hee hee, I'm so funny and smart). I, on the other hand, was like the boy who was skeptical at first, but then jumped on to see what the fuss was about. <br /> <br /> I wasted only ten and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful that it was not even funny. There is no story. There is no reward. You are sitting through this series of events wondering if there is a sense of all this? It would be one thing if the scenes were entertaining ... but they are not. <br /> <br /> This film contains no emotion, no soul, no blurring of plausibility and above all: every fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about what these characters look like for a second. To say that this is the same technology (movement, I am sorry, "PERFORMANCE" recording), was made from the Gollum, is really a pity because Gollum was credible !!! Photorealism simply can not translate well in this medium. They use animations. Why do not you make the characters more expressive? Or why not just film with real actors? You CAN certainly have. We as humans know only too well how we walk, talk and interact with things. To see too little convincing on the screen is not impressive. Convincing caricatures are all the more credible, as The Incredibles has proven. The result of The Polar Express is now as if they were taking bodies of dead children and turning them into dolls. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? We can see that on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so terrible! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there is a scene where the boy picks up a girl's ticket because she got up and left. He wants to give it to her, but you sit there and go "why ??!" Just leave it ... it's coming back! Of course he loses the ticket and "adventure" follows. And then there's a boy who's in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can not come and join the other kids? And then there's this annoying "all knowing" kid with the voice of a 35-year-old. It's all so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh and there are songs! A girl walks in the back of the train where the lonely child is. He sings a song for himself. And then she interrupts and joins in! They finish the song as they hold hands and look each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very embarrassing. I will not even go into the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance on the train. "Stay hot! Stay hot!" The one scene with Tom Hanks on his knees, arms outstretched, must be one of the most memorable BAD scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I will just kill myself. I have to watch something shitty to clean the pallet. Yeah ... shit is better than the Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The only thing that trains do, it does not matter where you go, what counts is the decision to move on." <br /> <br /> Do not climb in that direction. I chose you for the love of God! This is just another movie from a children's book that stretches incredibly thin into the movie form. It happened with the Grinch and the cat in the hat and these were also terrible. But who can blame them? I'll bet if I took the book "The Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food" and made a movie out of it, it probably would be boring too. But at least ... there is a story and a point about what The Polar Express lacks so much.
