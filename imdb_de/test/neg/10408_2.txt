Whoever thought of sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Although it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a meaningless action and can be used as a cure for insomnia. I have not even bothered to look at Iron Eagle III, but when I look at Rating R, I think it's more violent than in the last two movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the craziest sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the ever-adorable "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill the role of Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick from the First Iron Eagle). But wait (here comes a possible spoiler) ..... Was not Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The authors must have been scorned for a story, so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest of all Iron Eagle movies. Why is it necessary for filmmakers to make sequences unsightly films? (eg films of the police academy). I have always liked the work of Gossett Jr. in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope this was the last installment of the Iron Eagles. let it rest in peace.
