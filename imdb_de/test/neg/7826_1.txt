The story is incoherent and poorly written. We get threads and a possible catch in act one just to see it disappear. If the author had taken the trouble to read his work carefully, it would have been obvious that the original problem of Madsden's character and the meeting with the "bad" girl indicated that there was an uneasy alliance between them when trying to to solve his problem br /> The problem goes nowhere. The relationship is nowhere. And in no relationship is there sexual tension. Nobody digs anyone and nobody is appealing. Writing and governing is ridiculous. You can feel someone battling the mess and shift the focus of the story to some excitement. There is nothing. The writer / director is simply a beginner whose confused efforts somehow became a movie. From simple mistakes like "... they took Polaroids ..." - in Japan in 2007? Insulting mistakes like nudity for eroticism, this movie is an insult. You can not make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And by putting "Madsden" on the talent list, the producers believed they were successful. He barely acts. Asia is certainly ... and the result is a heroin-like panto. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
