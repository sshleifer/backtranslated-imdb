Lucio Fulci, a director not well known for his subtlety, tries in Touch of Death, a televised film about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho that seduces and murders rich widows, unwisely black humor its gambling debts pay. <br /> <br /> Beginning with a wonderfully bloody scene in which the deadly Lothario discards his last victim with a chainsaw, crusher and hungry pigs, Touch of Death starts off promisingly, but Fulci soon loses control of the procedures, introducing a weird one Negotiating with a mysterious copycat killer and some weird comic scenes. There are a few more graphic murders that are extremely violent and cruel in true fulci fashion, but even the high level of bloodshed does not stop this being one of Fulci's lesser efforts. Like me For many other films, an understandable storyline is not high on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities that more than amazed me: why did not Lester dispose of all of his victims with the dissecting method you saw at the beginning? Why are all his victims either hairy or disfigured? What the hell is this end? <br /> <br /> Fulci is considered by many to be one of the greats of horror cinema. I do not understand his popularity and feel that most of his films I have seen so far are generally lacking in decent narrative as well as technical skills. Touch of Death does not change my opinion.
