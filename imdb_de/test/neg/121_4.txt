Isaac Florentine has shot some of the best western martial arts action films of all time. The US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are action classics. It can be said that Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always varied, creative and harsh affairs, with some of the best action sequences an action fan can hope for. In particular, he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, a talented actor and action-performer one could hope for. This also applies to Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately the Shepherd does not live up to its abilities. <br /> <br /> There's no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better here than he did years ago, especially in combat, in (for almost no reason) in a jail cell, and in the last showdown with Scott but looks him in the eye. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just does not care about anything throughout the movie. And this is the main actor. <br /> <br /> There are other dubious aspects of the movie, in terms of script and appearance, but the main problem is that you absolutely can not empathize with the heroes of the movie. As I know, we all wanted this movie to be as special as it could have been. There are some good tracks, mostly the action scenes themselves. This movie had a great director and action choreographer and a fantastic opponent for JCVD. This could be the one who brought the experienced action star to the action-action stakes of the ball. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this did not happen.
