I was really ready to see it when two of the best movie critics called this movie a "laughter uprising". But the movie turned out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> It is recommended that you watch the movie at home, but you can not ignore the shortcomings and deficiencies 1 The rocket scene was totally stupid. <br /> <br /> 2. The couple of Katrina Kaif and Govinda looked terrible. (He's 49 and she's only 24 ... more than twice her age) 3. Salman's comedy is less acting and more exaggerating. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs are good, but interrupt the tempo of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes were purposely tried by the filmmakers to be funny, and 6. Poor and flawed story. <br /> <br /> However, there are few advantages. 1. Govinda. Great individual performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Kattrina Kaif. Looks and Acting improves with every movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Rajpal Yadav's Don sequences. Although little used, but funny. <br /> <br /> So 4 good points, 6 bad ... this gets 4/10.
