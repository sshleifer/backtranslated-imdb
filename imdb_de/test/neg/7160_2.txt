This movie was strongly recommended by a friend and as I am a big fan of Brando, I ordered this movie from Harrods and waited anxiously for him to arrive. I was rarely so disappointed with a movie. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the movie was just unbearable. You can never like or care for any of the characters (except maybe Brando). The acting was alright. History, what story? Maybe that's the point. It's after all war, but I have seen far better war films. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so boring that I was constantly looking at my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Please do not waste your time and money. May I add that this is the first user comment I've written. I just had to spread my feelings about this movie & 2, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you have not seen them yet, please take the time to do so. And Amadeus MUST be in 2.35: 1 widescreen
