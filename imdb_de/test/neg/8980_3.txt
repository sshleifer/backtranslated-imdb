Trekkies is really not a movie about the Star Trek fandom. It's a freak show about these Star Trek fans who have no sense of reality. As a freak show, it's good. However, it is a mistake to think that this movie gives an insight into the Star Trek fans. Most Star Trek fans are afraid of what this film shows.
