I saw Grande Ecole at its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I entered and if I had any idea, I would not have come. This is the most challenging movie I have seen in a long time. It tries to be provocative, but deep with its full-gender, homosexual sex scenes - it does not succeed! It is nothing but a bad excuse to show naked people on the big screen. 4.10
