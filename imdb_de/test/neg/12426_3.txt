What can I say about such a bad movie? The people who made this movie did not even try to make the monster look realistic. You never see more than your head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement, unless it opens its mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roar is the best part. In many places in the movie it sounds just like a TIE fighter flying over! I could not believe it when I heard it for the first time and had to rewind several times to make it seep into it. Aside from the awesome-looking monster and the noises it does, there's nothing more to this film than a few crazy attacks scenes and the crazy Scot who attacks the kids trying to spend an intimate moment in his castle. Nevertheless, it is understandable if you like this kind of garbage. I know i do ....
