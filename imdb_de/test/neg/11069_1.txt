I've recently seen a number of cave films, and this movie has managed to put together the worst aspects of this movie. The cave survey or the monster they face is barely noticed while the characters are cliched (spiritual type, leader with a recent tragedy, etc.) and the end was only weak. It really annoyed me that the director constantly shook the camera or showed almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I read that this movie gave a real account of caving, and I imagine the caves are dark. Almost half of the movie showed the house home. I really enjoyed the "descent", which was better for my money, showing tighter cave performance situations, better monsters and a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** Spoiler ****** <br /> The monster is a guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed so he can grow up in the caves. He seems to have developed a great power and speed, but why is he never addressed? Perhaps the same force that emptied the torch's batteries caused it, but during the movie, when someone is killed, one has the impression that there is something big with claws that rip up every victim (see how much Blood splashes the walls!), But in the end it's just a guy with a fur and a mask? I would be prepared to overlook this when high levels of tension are reached, but this was hardly the case. Then he rapes the last remaining caver and roll credits ... Almost absurdly bad, I thought. Sometimes a movie is so bad that you can appreciate it and maybe laugh, but this movie is not easy either. <br /> <br /> You saw it, you can not see it unnoticed!
