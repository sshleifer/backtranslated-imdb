Why did the Italians make the best films in the 50s and 60s, and then only made zombie and cannibal films in the 70s and 80s? Probably because art films have not made money. Unlike Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and "exploited" by Italians, The Cannibal Movie is a purely Italian creation conceived as a Mondo exploitation showcase that should earn as much money as possible (no artistic integrity) who are in the way here). Eaten Alive came during the heyday of the Cannibal Movie. The director Umberto Lenzi had not yet made his move; His genre classic Cannibal Ferox was still a year away. <br /> <br /> While plotting (read: demolished) by Ruggero Deodato's groundbreaking cannibal classic, Cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) receives a message from The Police has received an 8mm film from her sister. It has disappeared in Africa and it is believed that the tribal ritual depicted in the film has something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, professor for Somethingoranother, says that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) started a Jonestown-style cult in New Guinea. There is the sister. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) who leads her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And do not you know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> One sentence should be succinct: if you've seen Cannibal Movie, you've seen them all, mainly because these movies are shamelessly stolen from each other (Lenzi copied the Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie and upgraded it to create Cannibal Ferox, Deodato copied parts of it for Hit and Run). And because they all have the same material, they all share the same characteristics: terrible photography, boring scenery, terrible synchronization, overclocking and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Genre fans will have a ball as everyone is a genre veteran. Rassimov and Kerman organize a landscape competition. Agren exists only to be naked, raped or in danger. Much annoyance for all the sick out there. The cannibals, who actually seem to be native cannibals, have lunch and are disguised as human flesh. In the great tradition of Cannibal Movies, every creature shown on the screen is usually killed shortly thereafter. All in all, not a really good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths who find these excrements entertaining. I know that I did it.
