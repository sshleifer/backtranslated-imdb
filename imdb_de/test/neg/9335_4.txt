Only when I look at the interesting facts, I learned that the original producer / star of the film Tyrone Power died during its creation. This undoubtedly explains why everyone on the screen seems to focus on other things whose symptom occurs in a very early scene with a battle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know if you painted a wall until you're bored? Well, that's the kind of expression the combatants have on their face when they swing their swords in a most unconvincing way. His people are not happy about it. You can not really blame them, because there are few things in the world that are more beautiful than this Israeli motek, though the Israeli women here all look like Cherie Blair! Today's Israel is also very cosmopolitan. The majority of Israelis were born outside the country. However, this would have been the case a few thousand years ago, where everyone is talking with European and American accents. Dance sequence that one must have seen to be believed (and no, that is not praise). We have a climax in which The heavily surplus Israelis must defend themselves against an Egyptian army that can not read a map, otherwise they would have known that there was one canyon in front of them. I do not understand that - though the Egyptians, blinded by the sun, charge ten minutes on the Israelis, never realizing that they are bumping into a gaping ravine! Is not that something illogical? It is also a revealing mistake, since the horses, wagons and men who fall into the canyon are obviously miniature figures. Anyway, the movie ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon, or God, if you have an idiotic enemy who does not see a ravine or wave a sword, as if painting a wall?
