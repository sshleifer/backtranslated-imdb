Did Vanessa Redgrave take Mogadon while filming? It was like reading from an autocue. I have seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or was it all part of the character? Whatever, it was very annoying, I always wanted to shake the screen to hurry up. I read the book a long time ago and I did not like it much, except that Septimus' Descent into Madness was very well done - but I do not think Rupert Graves showed it very well, his acting was all superficial. The connection between his life and Clarissa has not worked out very well either, but I suspect the attempt is to show the sacrifice soldiers made to enable people like Clarissa to continue their weak lives. The movie is very shitty and has no real unity. I found terrible.
