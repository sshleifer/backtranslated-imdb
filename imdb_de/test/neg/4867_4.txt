It all looked very promising. An aspiring adviser to the president has been surrounded by a series of murders when he was told that a conspiracy is taking place in the White House. It honors the distinguished Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. Few people have a good word to say about it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really took some depth. They can pick up on the idea that the president is left with his ideas, and some members of the government want him dead to stop the implementation of those ideas. Conrad just seems to want the country to be governed in his own way and not like the elected leader. <br /> <br /> However, the action scenes had some logical gaps - the sewers and elevators already mentioned and the rather arbitrary assassination method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. The "distraction" of her father, my father's president, was ridiculous - that would make the president ten when that happened. Even worse was her predictable final scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> You could have made a provocative, inventive political thriller, but either squeezed it or failed. They could have gone to the city with special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved so much more in general. This was barely worth the Â£ 1 it cost me.
