I've always thought that MacBeth is the most accessible of Shakespeare's Great Period games. Compact, focused and violent, it should have been the game most suited for screen customization. However, I'm not aware that the story is really well portrayed - the best effort was Orson Welles' energetic shoestring version. To the list of MacBotches we must add the efforts of Connery / Baxendale. <br /> <br /> (It seems that it was not a "movie adaptation") but a TV version released after Luhrman's Romeo as a theatrical version + Juliet and Branagh's Hamlet. That may explain a few bugs, but do not apologize.) <br /> <br /> It starts well, with a vivid battle sequence where pleasing gruesome witches watch. Poor old Gray Malkin and Paddock are cut out of the opening scene, but they are not alone for long. Quickly comes the bloody Sargent and his account of the battle, the betrayal of Thane by Cawdor, the hapless Master of the Tiger, even MacBeth's meeting with Duncan when he's invested as Cawdor. All of these had virtues that plead like angelic sparkles against the dark damnation of their sending, but they have been sent off. These are not the only cuts. This is MacBeth in a hurry. <br /> <br /> From the opening fight, we are hit right into MacBeth's encounter with the witches, which is well done. Brian Blessed curiously directed the fun sequences and he's having fun with the special effects as MacBeth and Banquo are told about their fates. Jason Connery as MacBeth is awkward, obviously unsure what to do from the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is able to make his lines natural and easy. A few minutes after Connery's murmur, the viewer felt the urge to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the title role. No wonder MacBeth felt like killing him. <br /> <br /> These first few minutes mark the climax of the film. From there we move to Helen Baxendale and receive her husband's message. She is as lost as Connery and has refused the beard he is allowed to hide behind him. Your "unsex me here" call of evil is embarrassing and not disturbing. There are reasonably smart accents - MacBeth's "We'll keep talking" is not a sign of hesitation over his wife's evil ambition, but his attempt to calm her down as he throws her onto the bed. <br /> <br /> The leads are the strongest. Connery's method is to stare glassily across the screen while he murmurs his monologues via voice-over. Baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. An attempt to do something interesting with "Is This a Dagger" - the fantastic dagger is a shadow thrown from a cross on an altar - falls due to the poor delivery of Connery and the sluggish alignment that is holding down production all the way, flat off. We escort Lady MacBeth back to the murder chamber where she can stab the revived Duncan, but the effect is weird and not dramatic. <br /> <br /> Big scenes are botched - Banquo's performance at the festival is made obscure by attempts to blend the subjective rendering of MacBeth's delusion with what his surroundings see or do not see. The second meeting with the witches is even less coherent and the prophetic visions are confusing. Timing seems to be an issue here - the Banquo Banquet is the centerpiece of the game, but the movie quickly comes to a close and gives it an unbalanced feel, and there's no room for the intricacies of the puzzles that MacBeth appreciates or for his descent into madness, to convince. Another key cut is the scene in which Malcolm tests MacDuff and MacDuff learns of the murder of his family. This robs him of most of the emotional power - and the character of a big screen time. He is a virtual stranger when he shows up to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> A point to try. MacTavish's Banquo deserves one more. The first few minutes will win one more. But that's all. From then on, it's sound and anger, blah blah blah.
