This music is totally out of touch with the movie and occasionally pops up as a Wagnerian bombast and Lone Ranger that does not exist otherwise. There is no action outside the two principles. It would have been an excellent student movie. The Russian soldiers are only role models who try to act. The constant interruptions with wow-explosive camera angles and monochrome clips of parts were pretty annoying, but that's just a personal feeling. The story is no worse than others, actually no worse than most, and completely ignores logic, reason and reality. At least no one walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without getting hit. The top three villains were campy.
