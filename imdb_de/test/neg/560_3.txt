The young spinner, who does not associate with women of his age and is eyed by the gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into his apartment on a rainy day. She is nervous and too polite to hide her own sexual insecurities. She is very pleased when the boy goes home in her guest room ... but not so happy when he sneaks out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was drawn to these sad sack roles, we'll probably never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles and about as far from a commercial drama as you could possibly get, this creepy material attracted not only Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static at best). The narrative seems to be almost a sexual reversal of "The Collector", a brand that has sold film rights but does not turn out to be a good idea. Even the best sequence of the movie (Dennis, who buys a prostitute to please her prisoner) does not quite come out, with Sandy both sick and outraged (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is a pretty good boy who uses this frumpy, pasty, sick woman just for her comfortable digs, but he's too shy of Altman's with strategically placed towels and flesh-colored underwear (Altman was obviously not ready) for a mature picture Adult topics at this point). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; She does not chatter here mindlessly, she thinks before she speaks, and she is worrisome in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a shame, with an obvious slippage in mental deterioration that seems to be happening off the screen. Therefore, the abrupt finale is irritating and the overall results are lukewarm. * 1/2 of ****
