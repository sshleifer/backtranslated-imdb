Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric Hollywood tactics to seemingly evoke a positive movie reaction. Here, this film fails consistently, especially because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repelled and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and essentially forced me to keep watching. Torture in and of itself is cruel. Even the sounds that come from a room where someone is being tortured are cruel. But obviously the creators of this stinker of a movie believed that this was not enough. It had to go far beyond what was needed, and it simply and effectively ruined the film's chances of setting a valid point. Because of this, this movie was nothing but self-fulfilling. Five Fingers also has the status of a B-movie solely through its indulgence in the manipulation of time. In other words, the present is shown to us and then the past is revealed in snippets. This is a bit of a twist of the normal Hollywood manipulation of the time. While the viewer is usually shown on page 95 in a 100-page script as the beginning of the movie and the rest of the strip essentially explains the end, Five Fingers is dedicated to flashing back, which becomes quite exhausting at the end of the movie. Overall, Five Fingers made me feel stupid because I saw the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to emphasize this point. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney did not turn up in the end as a kind of torture superhero. This film is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, thoughtless fools.
