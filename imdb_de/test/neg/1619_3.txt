That might not have been so terribly bad, if not the absolutely awful acting of Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad that it was not even funny! His character was used in the film, but why they chose this guy is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high quality Chinese movies ... I could suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" ... "The Story of Qui Ju" .... "Red Sorghum". ..... <br /> <br /> Everything but that! I was surprised how many people really rated it! Really ... the spectacle of this Wallace loser is so bad that it overshadows the other good parts of this movie. This was agreed by all 6 of us who watched the movie last night. <br /> <br /> Stay clear of this garbage ...
