Two little girls make a friendship. One tries to convince the other that she is a witch. The other is a pushover that bends down to the will of the witch. The film continues to move through the senseless interaction between the two little girls, with many dramatic cuts as they raise "shocking" questions. You know, the kind, sweet little kids should not ask, like, "How do you make a deal with the devil?" Oooh ... scary. <br /> <br /> In the end, the pushover is tired of being controlled by his witty friend. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But until that happens, you do not care. <br /> <br /> I imagine this movie could have been frightening for a very religious Mexican movie star of the 1960s, but he does not even consider it an enchanting relic. It just keeps on going. It is boring. It is futile. It is not visible. <br /> <br /> There are many here who have many good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other works and, of course, the common denominator that everyone says about meaningless films: "Ah, cinematography is wonderful!" These reviewers probably have a point. But for those who have found this film without any prior knowledge, who are not interested in their "photography", "atmosphere" or whatever else - for those viewers who are just a * good * movie, who will entertain her for an hour and a half, do you a favor, folks: <br /> <br /> Skip it.
