In this follow-up to The Naked Civil Servant, we see the last years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is crisp again (well, who else could play the part?) And his role, which he inhabits until disappearing. For me, Hurt Crisp and I have always found it very difficult to take the man himself, because Hurt was more than he himself. His masterly achievement. His peer is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's longtime friend and confidant. Unfortunately, the film has little to recommend outside of the performances. To be sure that the film does the details right. The film, filmed in and around New York, looks and feels like New York and its surroundings, but is dramatic in its kind of laziness. It's a smart conversation with people who are funny and try to come to terms with the world as it is (regretting some ill-chosen words about AIDS), and addressing the weaknesses that the old age came up against. The man Quentin is always interesting, but his depicted life is really not the case. I am disappointed with the movie. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I only wish he would be better served with this movie about his life.
