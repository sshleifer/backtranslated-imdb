Edge of Madness is a story about a nineteenth-century woman being hand-picked by a dirty Scot who can not hold his penis in his pants. He happens to have a younger brother who is against rape and kills him, but constantly says it was an accident. That drives his wife crazy, she goes insane and she takes the case because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said before, these kinds of things have been done before. This is more "artistic" because it's Canadian and it's an indie production made with lesser-known actors (except a Lassie kid, yes, he's there). I do not know if that was Oscar bait, but it sure was boringly boring. And this is based on a 40-page short story. Half of this short story is integrated into this movie, and I'm glad. Otherwise I would be bored to death. Unfortunately, I had to watch it in my mediabundament class and had an assignment to do so. Read the short story and compare and compare the movie with the story. Boring. <br /> <br /> You know, it's harder to answer film questions if you do not like the movie. I hope this is the last kind of job I and my class get. Annie Herron was totally hot, she had a nice soft butt and I liked the naked parts of her in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for boring, Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality ..plus nudity.
