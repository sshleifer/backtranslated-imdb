A bunch of medical student yuppies meet in their spare time to hook on the electrical cables and die. Then they stand around and count the time before brain death, then begin with resuscitation and heart massage and bring each other to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this movie should say everything. FLATLINERS is like the group GHOST. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old, dead buddies. What better way to do that than get a bunch of medical students killed for five minutes and then bring you back to life. The rest of the film has the foreseeable relationship problems, plus the predictable "GEE MAYBE, IF WE CAN KILL ANYONE ELSE, ONE THOSE DAYS, IF ONE REMAINS!" Oh, that movie should have been called BRAIN DEAD the characters were presented as medical students, made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign correspondence school to graduate, the only thing that did not make this movie laugh was that they did not put their fingers in sockets, to "die." This movie would have been a great THREE STOOGES comedy.
