Yes, it's your typical direct video action movie. And of course they do their best to change it, but miraculously fail. Snipes delivers his absolutely mild performance, which he always does. Colloca proves that you do not need talent to play in a movie, just sex appeal. The worst thing is that it did not cover my bad movie basics, namely: 1 ?? Cheap-looking villains. 2 ?? Perfectly coordinated one-liners. 3 ?? Intense chases with massive explosions. 4 ?? The hero comes together with the hot chick. 5 ?? A variety of naked or sparsely clothed women without reason. OK, so I lied, it covers it, but it does it terribly.
