I found this movie preachy and unrealistic. It's trying to be a movie that shows how kids fight the system, but it does not even offer a positive solution. I think I did not really care for the kids. I can fully understand what their problems were, and I know how bad the condition of the schools is, but I found their solution and dealing with the outside world a large group of nuisances. If this appears on TV, do not waste time. Watch the short circuit for the 235th time again.
