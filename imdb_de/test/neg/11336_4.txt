This series, which was developed for Televisión Española (TVE), is essentially a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, which are mainly seen from the eyes of the youngest son Historical events, such as the student uprising in May 1968 in France , the decaying Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism, and others that were specifically related to Spanish life at that moment, could be considered as simple events compiling characteristic weaknesses that are so noticeable in this type of entertainment do. <br /> <br /> Usually treated in a light vein, though not lacking in certain moments that could be considered dramatic, the series seems to target those people of about fifty who can remember those times, because anyone who chooses to be younger either ignores such events or deals with other things. <br /> <br /> The best thing to say about this series is Ana Duato's role as the mother of three children: she plays the role of the total housewife of the time really well and manifests this peculiar Spanish affinity, especially in women it is palpable to let her whole thinking and action be carried away by the impulse of her heart without resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little, except that he is not as usual in other TV series his usual stereotypical hard cop. In fact, you should not trust him as an actor on anything that is not a television series. His resources are too limited. His role as father of the working class house is not bad. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended for other audiences, even for Spanish-speaking people in Latin America: The issues are too relatable with a particular point in Spanish contemporary history, so if the viewer did not live here at the time he will miss most references. It is even likely that certain situations that cause a few Spanish smiles will not mean anything to other viewers.
