Before we saw this movie (at a screening the director herself attended), we were informed that the short film award was won by Galway Film Fleadh. Surely this result will give hope to filmmakers, everyone can do better! <br /> <br /> How can anyone not notice the blatant rip-off of Donnie Darko? I will never know. The film is pure Drivel, the drama box, the dialogue ridiculous & the end just! The only consolation we enjoyed after seeing this garbage was a loud comment on how horrible it was, in front of the director! Yes, that was mean, but liberating! <br /> <br /> At least the Irish movie can not go lower!
