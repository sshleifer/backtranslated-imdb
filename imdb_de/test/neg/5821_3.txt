I saw this movie at our Crossroads film festival, and I was looking forward to it because it was filmed in Mississippi and starred with Karen Black. I was deeply disappointed with the awkward script that never flowed, and the apparent shortcomings of the actors and directors in understanding something about the culture they were trying to portray. How did Lee and Greif become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two has the girl fucked under the tree? It was unclear. And in Hollywood, there seems to be a law on southern accents, and rarely does one hear something approaching the everyday sounds of the South from afar. Dialogue is so often the case with actors. Aleksa was particularly fond of "New York's streets," in "emotional" scenes, and no one sounded mississippi. Walt Goggins' character should have come from the city of Morgan, but Louisiana does not sound like a mix of new Orleans and Cajun accents. The other disturbing point seemed to be the writer's desire to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual needs in them. Before experiencing a firestorm and being accused of homophobia, I have enjoyed many gay love films, in particular "punks", "when love comes" and "b-monkey". But this seemed to be the desire of a man of all young men. Well, Tennessee Williams has already populated this soil and done a lot better. So I wonder if the Coen brothers can kill regional accents and culture in movies in Minnesota and Mississippi, why can not anyone else? What a waste of my time.
