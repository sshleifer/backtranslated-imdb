The movie version of 'Rising Damp' was released two years after the end of the TV series. Like many fans, I was due at the cinema's opening. I came away bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not spend a lot of time writing the script; Most of these are ideas from old episodes. At the time of the movie release, the series "Rising Damp" was still regularly aired on I.T.V. So the public was asked to pay for something they had already seen. At least the "On The Buses" movies had original scripts. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Richard Beckinsale had died the year before, so they eliminated the character of "Alan" as a mark of respect and replaced the art student. "John 'played by Christopher Strauli from' Only When I Laugh 'It just was not the same thing. <br /> <br /> As another poster shows, Rigby's pension did not look anything like the one used in the show and was bigger and cleaner overall. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original "Casino Royale," a movie with surreal humor. "Rising Damp" also has its share on fantasy sequences in the 'Walter Mitty' style, such as the parody 'Saturday Night Fever', but personally, I found it terribly out of place, a case of 'superfluous pudding'. <br /> <br /> On the plus side Leonard Rossiter is as grand as ever, like the dodgy 'Rigsby', as well as Frances De La Tour as 'Ruth' and Don Warrington as 'Philip' It's just a shame that the film is not worthy of their talents In 1984, he was dubbed by ITV as a tribute, with his last scene showing As Rigsby is depressed at the foot of the stairs, it is removed for the sake of good taste.
