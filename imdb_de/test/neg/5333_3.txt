This "documentary" does not shed any light on what it would be like to be behind the scenes during the Hard Knock Life tour. Granted, I was not there, but when I watch this movie I do not feel like I am. And for a movie like this, that's not exactly a compliment. All the time, when I saw it, all I could think was, "What are you leaving out?" When it's all over, the only rappers you think you have any insight into is DMX, and that's mainly because he only talks about his dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
