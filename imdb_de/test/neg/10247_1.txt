This image was released in cinemas on June 6, 1980, with Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Scribe as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz, and Dorothy Stratton with Playmate of the Year. The picture begins with the infinite field of police looking for criminals. There, a ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spaceship. Join Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to find out who the unknown ship belongs to. If they fail, they call Captain Comelius, who instructs his crew to fight back. Enter the beautiful Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, who is a robot. Now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was a stupid plan and that's one of the reasons why I do not get into Sci-Fi. If you're interested in sci-fi, you would have noticed that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica, which aired in cinemas in 1978. Many of the doorbells that you hear in this film came from another sci-fi movie aired in 1966 titled Star Trek. Well, for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is beautiful in her one piece. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should never have been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents were also wasted. Alone in the picture I give this movie a weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars, even if she did not deserve to be put in such a trash movie.
