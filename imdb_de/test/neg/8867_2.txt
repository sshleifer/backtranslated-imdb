It is painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" never saw such brilliant parodies as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is awful and the actors too. They would not know if they were slapped in their faces, as I liked to do, while they saw all this garbage heap. The movie is stupid and has no humor. I'm sure I could make a better movie with my friends. For me, it's amazing that a movie can fail so much. Not a single clever or funny line. No trace of intelligence behind it. It's a pathetic movie, and I'd like to meet the person who really likes this movie. Yuck!
