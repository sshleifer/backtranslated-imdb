Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized. As usual, the plot is gossamer, from 1-foot dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and tracks larger than they are to an inexplicable science that uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs at bay and poultry transporters whose chickens are big enough in cages are dogs (I've seen chicken carts, they're all in cages the size of shoe boxes). And all in the first 15 minutes of this catastrophe of a movie. All the male actors are fools (the thought of a Grizzly loosening in the desert and dropping items constantly to give the Raptor a slight killer), and the female actors all look as if they came from a modeling set for Fredrick's of Hollywood. The Raptor itself is the worst since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they have a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the "Motion" shots. If you want a good movie running in MST3K style, this is gold. If you want competent filmmaking and good acting, do not watch a Roger Corman movie. Acting gets a 4 out of 10, some of the players at this level have tried. Story gets 2 out of 10 and reads like a drunken storytelling session that's going badly. Special effects get a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
