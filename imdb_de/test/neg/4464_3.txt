In this desperate and utterly stupid attempt to keep Hammer's Dracula franchise alive, though he has long lost most of his power, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in swinging London in 1972. Exactly one hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy Van Helsing, an occult disciple named Johnny Alucard (gets it? Get it?), Gathers his extravagant friends in an abandoned church, including Van Helsing's granddaughter Jessica, and performs a satanic ritual, the Dracula revived in a smoke veil. Dracula's only mission is to confuse the entire Van Helsing Line. Jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this. This is probably the only movie from the 70's that is outrageously exceeded in trying to look like a movie from the 70s! Considering that the previous six Dracula films were all filmed in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson really wants to emphasize the fact that we are now in the 20th century. That's why he stuffs his movie with unbearable hippie characters, heinous 70s fashion trends and terrible 70s music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem to be hopelessly lost in this environment, and their performances unfortunately show it. The opening sequence (flashback) and the showdown climax are pretty enjoyable, but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary. The biggest elements in this film series have always been Dracula's dark castles and exciting carriage races, and obviously all this is missing. Fortunately for the fans, Hammer Studios Contemporary has released other films that focus on much better vampires ("The Vampire Lovers", "The Twins of Evil", "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires"). Not recommended.
