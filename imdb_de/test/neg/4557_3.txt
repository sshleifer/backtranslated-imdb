Another stinker from the PM Entertainment group, and fortunately one of their last. <br /> <br/> Firetrap is virtually a very cost-effective remake of 'The Towering Inferno' As some efforts are made - in 'Firetrap' there is no effort - Stars Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, really has all the acting skills of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here and that says something, the rest is just a lot of hopeless when you make the boat out of different daily soaps. The special effects are just garbage. Shots that show the burning building from the ground are among the worst I've ever seen. The fire looks like someone has scribbled an orange pin on the front of the camera. In addition, there is no character for whom you actually take root - they all hate and hope they all die before the 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing - The red pegs are well signposted Someone else mentioned that in advance, but "The scene where the janitor flooded a burning fire with his broom ... funny or the same janitor Those scenes were winking? I doubt it somehow. <br /> <br /> The one good point and just a good point was that there was quite a bit of action among the daily ones I did not recommend soap drama that kept my attention. - See The Towering Inferno instead. <br /> <br /> 3/10
