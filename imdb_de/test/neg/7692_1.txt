I want to know how the director is able to stand in front of people in the industry after making this film. The work was so bad, we do not know how the cinema goes. Saudi companies like Rutana and others do not support Yang. Filmmaker in KSA like the United Arab Emirates. We hope the film industry in Saudi Arabia will prosper in the future. But without such interference, idiots and idiots bring bad movies into the reputation of cinema in Saudi Arabia is like the Roman and Iranian cinema. At the same time, please make simple experimental movies in Saudi Arabia like Abdullah Alayaf and others to the Dream of a good movie industry to attend world festivals outside the stupid interventions of big companies
