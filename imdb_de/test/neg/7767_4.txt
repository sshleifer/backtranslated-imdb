I did not expect much from the movie, so I'm not too disappointed. Carrie looked ugly, Mr. Big had stained his brows with crayons, and Samantha did not say he was f ***. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's kid was annoying when he was in too many scenes - the title could easily have been "SATC: Parents' Night Out". The camera angles were just not that good, especially with Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> A black woman was thrown, whose character has no real exit, and too few appearances by gay men, who seemed to be thrown out of purpose anyway. Samantha's back and forth from LA stifled the story flow, especially when she comes to Fashion Week and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have been made in a hurry because it could have been good, but scenes were only faded in to show off different outfits or give viewers the chance to jump back into the show, without much to do history of the movie.
