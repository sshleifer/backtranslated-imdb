This was done for God in 2004, what happened to our state-of-the-art special effects? What happened to our Roughs on the edge, but still good actors? The actors in this movie were unbelievably horrible, there were one or two who were not bad, but the rest, big thumbs down. Could not bear to listen to the poorly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell wrote this script? Please never write again! Special effects? Do not even let me start with the special effects. In fact, they might come up with better than totally false looking green balls of light in the eye sockets. It looks so old and ... honestly! Even the easiest to create a real look. The teeth looked so foolish and stupid that I almost wiped a tear from my eye. Come on, I can not believe that this has even been shown to the public!
