This movie was probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. A friend of mine grabbed it in the video store off the shelf and almost forced me to look at it, an action that we both deeply regret. Ehh ... where should I start? The writing, the drama, the quality? Everything sucked. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the worst fonts ever shown in a movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought he could ever be in the movies. Obvious dialogues like "How are you?" ... "Not so great, Doc" (right after an attempted exorcism of a male daughter and his wife's suicide attempt.) Of course he was not that great.) Score, kinda weird. If not terribly written, planned and obvious. The general plot of the film, the writing and the way of working, terrible. It was as if the writers could do nothing better than write some fucking dialogues and insert as many sex and nudity scenes as they could by chance. The almost-good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porn than a movie. Oh yes, and they never did the deed. <br /> <br /> The acting? Dreadful. x100. I think the only good actor was the short Spaniard who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written terribly. The worst acting? Presumably Paul Kappellas, whose play with crappy music, a gun, and a half-naked, bluish-white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable. He even messed up his own death scene, which would be easy to nail. Although most others' acting was terrible too. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters also contributed to the overall overall power of the film. There were just enough characters, so that almost half of the characters died, the same number of people were owned at one point and the remaining characters could not be counted on one hand. Like ... 50 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What is the culmination of the exorcism films that are taking place in a stable anyway?
