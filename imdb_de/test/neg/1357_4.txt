I'm sorry, but I can not quite agree with some comments on this terrible piece of shit. English is not my native language, since I'm a German citizen, so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammar or something * gg I can not understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3 Are you kidding me? This movie has absolutely no meaning, not even an appearance of good acting ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at the comments on The Da Vinci Code, which - I think - had almost the same rating, I had to hit my head on the table because I saw 00 tailor right after sacrilege, and oh my god, there are worlds between them. The majority of the posters on this board tear apart each hyped film, while this crime of filmmaking scores 6.3 and Helge is called a genius. Of course he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinion is the fact that German is not your native language and you just ignore it - or rather not see the pile of crap put in the sentences. OK, I have to admit that some scenes are funny, but all in all, a 6.3 for my compatriot is just too much;)
