Sorry, but Jacqueline Hyde (you know? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) has some of the worst aspects of this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion from a grandfather she never knew she had. Guess who? Yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over body and mind - yes, this Mr. Hyde! <br /> <br /> Despite some beautiful skin scenes, this movie does not register feelings or emotions other than uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> As poor Jackie tries, she just can not keep away Granddaddy's special formula and the result is one and a half hours of wasted time.
