Can someone help me please, I missed the last moments and I do not want to pay any money to watch the whole movie again. I arrived right where they are in the railroad, and she says, "What about the drink now?" and smiles. What happens after that? Is there more dialogue or action? Surely it does not just end there? I was a bit bored in the movie and always hoped that it would get better. I love Kristen Scott Thomas. Does anyone remember the UK television series in which she was about nuns? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was brilliant Madonna eats your heart out! All others were indeed a bit predictable, it was a "Spot a Star Cast". The end surprised me. I really thought she had burned her boats.
