I used to love the bill because of their great scripts and characters, but lately I get the feeling that it has turned into an emotional kind of soap. If you look at billboard advertisements now, you'll see either of the officers embracing / kissing or having something to do with friendships, while advertising on the bill a long time ago had something to do with crime. This proves that it has changed a lot, from an absolutely amazing police drama to an average television soap. When I see it, I feel I'm looking at a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say, I still like the bill because I'm interested in policing and things like that, but I really miss the size The Bill had. I want to rate it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit that it was totally ruined by the people who took the bill. <br /> <br /> As far as the script and the characters are concerned, they both mostly went downhill. The big characters are now gone (although there are still some left, I think), and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything, because they are definitely not, they just lack the tough looks, personalities, and script lines. All the old characters used to be there earlier because most of the new characters are currently associated with stupid relationships and family difficulties. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Bill is one of the few police broadcasts currently on TV. It will always be a bit scary, but as I say, it has lost much of its uniqueness (if that right spelling) and would now be classified as a terrible, unreal TV soap. <br /> <br /> It is recommended to keep a good laugh about the stupidity of the police involved - 2/10
