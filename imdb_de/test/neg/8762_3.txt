There is not much to say about this film unless it is probably the worst part of the early flood of zombie movies (I may be watching another, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month ends is). For all the stars that John Carradine intends to build with them an army in the service of the Third Reich, not much is done of them! James Baskett (Uncle Remus of SONG OF THE SUTH [1946]) plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's servant. The black comic Mantan Moreland embodies his "fraidy cat" chauffeur role of KING OF THE ZOMBIES (1941), as well as the exotic named Madame Sul-Te-Wan as the housekeeper of Carradine. Unfortunately for Carradine, his highest performance? the zombification of his wife? brings him all sorts of difficulties: not only does her relatives come to his remote home / lab to ask for her sudden death (which means he has to fake a funeral service!), but she actually turns out to be disobedient and outraged, after all "convincing". her colleagues zombies to rise against their master !! Cowboy star Bob Steele (still known for his play in THE BIG SLEEP by Howard Hawks [1946]), who plays a US secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff, is also involved! Fortunately, director Sekely would be much happier with his next genre attempt, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (1962).
