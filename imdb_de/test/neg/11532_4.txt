I thought that this is a good predictable movie. There were some good stunts that gave the story a lot of suspense and excitement. However, you had to suspend your credibility several times for the conspiracy to work. For example, while piloting the undercarriage manually, the pilots lost their transfer cable, clutches, and wiring harness, fortunately finding a replacement car with caribbeans aboard the aircraft. According to the story of drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault, the alarm system in the vault would be disabled when the system was reactivated (I can not imagine why), according to Daltry, the battery-powered drill could not pierce the vault On the ceiling, however, they happened to have a hydraulic drill with hoses and connections for the equally comfortable starting points in the aircraft's hydraulic aircraft system above the vault. Since the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how this can be achieved without influencing the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. If you accept this for action, it will take a few minutes for a small hole to be drilled through the top of the vault (tension can penetrate it before the FED gets there to check the false alarm), but from the moment you hit it Vault The door closed, and before the FEDs had run the few yards to the second security door, they had cut a miner's hole in the roof of the vault, big enough to pass. One can accept all theses and other discrepancies for the sake of a good yarn. What spoiled the film for me, however, was that it seemed to have been an attempt by scriptwriters to discuss what had until then been a fairly predictable ending to the two heroes killed (if one can refer to testicles as heroes) Ketchum & Brooks one was hurled from a 747 to 10,000 feet, and the other, who slides down the cable between the two aircraft, manages to dislodge the villain Daltry with one hand, the cable carrying the weight of a full-grown man, with an air pressure of several hundred miles an hour, which pressed him and let him fall to his death. And yet, in the next sequence, without any kind of explanation (no matter how weak or implausible), they miraculously survived 10,000 feet and had time to initiate a complicated scam to get the money. The only comment on survival for Sophie was that her brother is a bad shot. Do not expect an Oscar nomination for this one.
