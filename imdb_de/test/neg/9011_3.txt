This film has a pretty decent premise - a cruel role in sci-fi films, most spectacularly in "Alien" - and some decent "he-man" performances by the male cast. The wife of the obsessed astronaut is the weak link in the ensemble to me - she does not seem to know what to do with her face in many of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame director Corman. <br /> <br /> Given a reasonable budget for props and special effects, and a more focused and coherent video game, "Blood Beast" could be pretty decent. But the inherent cheapness of production design and the continuity flaws and gaffs undermine the process. Every time I saw the comatose astronaut standing on a "bench" across the width of an ironing board, I chuckled, probably not the emotion the crew wanted to evoke. And the monster's costume needed serious work; Fern-covered parrots are simply not scary or convincing. <br /> <br /> Still, the premise was strong enough to hold me in the end, just to see how the plan resolved, and the alien's motives were sufficiently ambiguous. At first, I could somehow regard it as a mystery. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had some clout, along with the development of the conspiracy, in which the alien claimed to have absorbed some of the dead person's personality. <br /> <br /> It's Corman. It's cheap, quick and easily observable if you do not think too hard or expect too much. What else needs to be said?
