The director is cute, as is his co-director Shira Geffen, but her movie is shit. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: "Am√©lie" meets "Breaking the waves" meets "Pauline on the beach". You go away and want to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you will receive a suicide author, a neurotic actress and an illegally immigrant social worker with a heart of gold. It feels like more than a really touching story is hidden in the script, but at par, it's a truckload of wasted story lines and sentimental bullshit. Hard to sit, as it is.
