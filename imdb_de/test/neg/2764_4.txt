Someone should teach the people who made this film that there is a difference between "presenting multiple turns" and "fooling the audience." They even use hypnosis as a tool to hide the storylines. Whenever they can not get into or out of a scene, they just say "they're regressing into their past now," or "they're getting out of it now," and they think that explains everything. This movie is a dishonest trick and will become a real fiasco in the last 20 minutes. (* 1/2)
