Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of Mexican cinema, a rare achievement today. <br /> <br /> It's presumptuous: we want it to be deep, just because one scene is out of focus, another is pseudo-surreal, another is playing with the tradition of the laughing and crying faces of Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes, the edition is fragmented and everything is so serious. <br /> <br /> It has a weak writing: the main thing The story is hardly developing, so there are three more, smaller, unnecessary stories in it. They are only good for letting the movie last longer. <br /> <br /> Most acting is bad. A real feat, considering that many of the most famous Mexican actors have been cast. <br /> <br /> There is an abuse of unnecessary bad language. To the point that the character of Paloma, symbolizing the dreams of a child's freedom, uses them throughout. <br /> <br /> It's homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the saddest and most punished depiction of a transsexual I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very boring. I envied the people who had left the theater before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it has been done better in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
