Some films are so badly made that they are only seen for the crisis factor. The disciples made me flinch so much that it made me uncomfortable. I looked at everything in disbelief, what I looked at, nobody knew how bad it was during the shoot? Mix the most pounded performances of most wood actors. An abysmal screenplay was that every commentary from all the "actors" sounded as if it came from the same character and the hurried cut that was trying to force the movie tempo. All this combined into a movie that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing back. Avoid at all costs.
