Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness had a vivid sense of description that made this book amazing. As I read this book, I had every scene in my head and knew what each character looked like. This book had many parts and when I read the book, it seemed like the puzzle was over. After reading Heat of Darkness, I saw the movie, which was a mistake. The movie has cut out so many essential parts. In the novel, for example, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to come to him to fix his boat. This was a great source of futility. In the movie, this part was just left out. The film added more parts that were useless and made no sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz grabbed the monkey's neck and killed him. What was the purpose of this scene except that the audience regrets the monkey? It's as if the scriptwriter did not read the entire book and put only the parts he read into the movie. If I had not read the novel before watching the movie, I would have been completely confused. The book was amazing and it really is a classic in American literature, but the film could have been defiantly nominated for the worst picture of the Razzie Awards.
