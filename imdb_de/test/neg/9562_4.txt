The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely a dog meat dog that kills a gangster because he shows signs of weakness because he is held accountable. I have no problem with the human side being portrayed by Gansters, but Bugsy is heading too far towards softer, weird men. The movie is fun, but it's just light entertainment and not a biography of a man who, though exciting, is extremely dangerous and scary. The places and the era are very well represented and the topics very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
