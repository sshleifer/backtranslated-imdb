I have just watched this movie. I liked the soundtrack. I first saw the trailer and was great, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell them. But the movie is almost terrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then ... like almost all new movies it bubbles up. I have no idea why the child died? It's a clich√©, every Nigga movie has to have a child to kill, and everyone has to become good after his death. I do not understand what the connection is with the movie ... And so predictable, you know the end in the first few minutes. Nothing new in this movie. I saw that you got the same idea, but also ... something new ... this is something like 'Honey', but it is not a small difference. If you have no other way to watch this movie, but be sure, the last option you choose is. And the choreography is worst than anything before. This is not a must see with certainty ...
