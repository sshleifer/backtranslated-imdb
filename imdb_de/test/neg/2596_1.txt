It's a shame that so many people "love" Family Guy because it's easily one of the worst shows on TV. There are many points that need to be addressed here. <br /> <br /> The Flashbacks: Well, in Season 1 and 2, which I think are exceptional, the flashbacks were quite common and actually related to the theme of the plot and were even funny. Now, as of the fourth season, the flashbacks are even more open and have nothing to do with the plot, are not funny and really long, boring and meaningless. Family Guy thinks that the long drag scene that leads nowhere is funny when really bad writing is done. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a baby that sounds British. How funny can that be? It is not. His character is so unstable that it is unbelievable. Remember the early season when Stewie was all about world domination and the death of Lois. Well, he just has scenes that are awkwardly gay with Brian. From world domination to being gay = bad writing. <br /> <br /> References: How do you manage to make bad references to TV shows or events of the 80s? Well, they only use the same old garbage again. You know, in 20 years, Family Guy will hopefully be canceled by then. If they still joke about shows from the 80s, this will be even more irrelevant than before. Because will have forgotten. I still wonder why they can not just write good episodes with good jokes. <br /> <br /> Voice Acting: My God, the voices in this series are so bad. Seth McFarlene should only focus on his shitty episode and stop making voices. All the extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes all sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people making ALL votes. A few of them speak 15-20 characters ... all sound very different. But why can not Family Guy do that? Oh, right, it's a fucking show. <br /> <br /> The stuttering: Usually by Peter, Stewie, Brian and all the other extras, whenever they talk or get insulted by something, they have to stutter their sentences to try it. Laugh cheap. I can not believe that Family Guy can not even speak normally to make people laugh at their "jokes". <br /> <br /> Offense: OK, short and easy, Family Guy tries to break through the barrier and be cutting edge, but really they fall flat every time. Look at the South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible Actions: The actions and storylines are just garbage. The Simpsons have started their 20th season. STILL have better plans than Family Guy. A total of about 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and drag scenes that have no relevance. <br /> <br /> Popularity Many small children have Stewie shirts and think that they are so funny when they do not even get the horribly written sex jokes. They just say, "Oh, ha ha, Stewie!" if they do not even get it. Family Guy was canceled twice and brought back by DVD sales, how sad is that? They were canceled the first time after season 2 or 3, and I really think that was it. These episodes were great at the time, they should stay on a high note. <br/> <br /> Draw and Drop Scenes There are scenes that take way too long. One just aired last Sunday, Peter went into an executive bathroom, where the intro of Jurassic Park was imitated for about 2 minutes, and the plot of this episode is also stolen from a Seinfeld episode. Also, a scene where Chris works in a shop and talks to the clerk for about 5 minutes about a movie that also shows stuttering. THE CHICKEN FIGHTS are so stupid, 3 of them, each longer than the last. useless, uncomplicated writing, believing that people enjoy long scenes of repetitive fighting, between a CHICKEN and a chicken. Now, every time someone falls down, and by the way, NO FAMILY GUY FAN CAN THESEN THAT every time they fall down, they end up in a fraction of a second and ALWAYS land them with their arms over their backs to make them look weird It has been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh dear, everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny, if it's just a really bad gag. They even went to the trouble of giving him singing scenes (which are very poor) and founding the WHOLE episodes around them. They did the same thing to other characters like the doctor I know he had an episode around. <br /> <br /> The Simpsons Well, here's not much explanation needed. There is so much evidence that a family man stole Simpson's jokes. As a family man is just a Simpsons of a poor man. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I've forgotten some important points somewhere, but I'm sure that's enough to prove that the family man is a really terribly written TV show. Everyone seems to love if he really should see Simpson's, Seinfeld and Frasier.
