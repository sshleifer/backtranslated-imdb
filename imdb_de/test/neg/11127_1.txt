OK, if you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you like to mock movies, then you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can be really too painful to see that. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The obsessive crypto-oculist sneaks a huge box of chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently he does not have to explain it to Customs or even mention that he's bringing it aboard a living animal - "No, really 'It's a research kit, the air holes are just a coincidence'). Some dipsticks he'd hired to open the box found he had paid a lot of money, maybe there was something to steal. Once the HOLZKRATE is open, the Chupacabra breaks through the STEEL BARS inside and makes a deadly raid. Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> By accident, a Marshall (I suppose an American Marshall because he was in the Gulf War, not some guy named Marshall) is on board looking for money in the vault the ship has disappeared. He poses as an insurance agent ("Lady, I'm the best insurance you have ..."). Other dazzling characters are the Captain (John Rhys-Davies and his first dignity is the first victim of the film), his Ta Bo instructor daughter (Giggle - Tae-Bo), an annoying old stuck lady with a small dog. What should feeding a cat (guess WHAT does it eat ...?) and an unbelievably unpleasant gigolo that might have been credible in a 1964 movie, not something newer. Most of the acting was really bad, and the characters were just there, so you can laugh hysterically when they die. <br /> <br /> Overall - SCREAMINGLY bad. Bad on many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What??? The bullets do not even make Chupacabra wince, but the Tae-Bo bimbo can beat and deter him. Hey sci-fi channel, desperate for scripts or what?
