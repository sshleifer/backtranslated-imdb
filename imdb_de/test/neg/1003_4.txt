This narrative of the upper class, experiencing and reviving in its high-class misery, is like a contemporary mid-summer version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here, in the face of adversity, people behave in a terribly civilized way. A well-attended London lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that his wife not only has an affair with the local gentry, but also killed the housekeeper's husband in an accident. He pukes, but otherwise his stiff upper lip hardly spoils. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park" (this is his directorial debut) has a novel by Nigel Balchin, he's pretty weird, although I'm not sure How much of the comedy is intended. It's like a return to British 1940s movies, in which characters behave like characters in books or plays rather than real people. However, not everything is bad. Wilkinson is great, even if you never believe in him as a person, while Emily Watson (the adulteress) and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high-class guy) both cover the cracks in the material well. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard the ear is, it's always good for the eye.
