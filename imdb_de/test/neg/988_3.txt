As a history lover I rented this movie because of the topic. The idea of ​​Ellis Island's turn-of-the-century experience, which focuses on a small group, is intriguing. Unfortunately the movie is canceled. Much of the story is just boring. not much happens over long distances. The director uses silly pictures (offered in the form of daydream sequences) to break the glacier slip, instead colliding with the film's authentic look and feel. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end, we do not care about them as much as we should. It's a shame that this was not what it could have been. I still want to see a good movie about the American immigration experience, but it is not.
