Lame B-Horror, who takes himself too seriously in the face of his subject, is concerned with an aging old love that has become a creature of the night by a lodger who has rented a room from her. If the lodger is killed, Mama has to go out to feed herself. This leads to a family burden and also attracts attention from the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this movie should have been THE JOY. This did not work, though there were some mild gore and flaky creature make-up effects to keep the amount of B movies happy. I have seen worse, but I would not recommend it - 4.5 / 10.
