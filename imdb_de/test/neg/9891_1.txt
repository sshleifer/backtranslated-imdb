This garbage resembled the novel as well as a slice of cucumber. The filmmakers took the Alamo section out of the book, made a movie out of it, and said it was based on the book. Hah! I wonder what they did to get Mr. Michener to support this piece of lint? It was just another Davy Crockett, a flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, a 13-day glory collection of poppies. I almost started digging for the Mexicans just to finish the damned thing. And what was the scene where Stacey Keach tried to make James Bowie look at the knife? The sexual innuendo he used was youthful and unnecessary. They could have used the movie they had wasted on this stupidity for a real dialogue. This show was embarrassing for Hollywood. Or can these clowns be embarrassing?
