Legend has it that at the 2006 Gala Hollywood premiere: A Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes after the movie, Rock Hudson said, "Would anyone please tell me what this movie is about?" Well, I beat Rock by 19 minutes and 59 seconds. This movie made absolutely no sense. Who were these people? Where were these people? What were the rules of the game Quintet? Are there any rules for the quintet? Have Robert Altman and his comrades worked the film? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed this? Maybe the old man saw Fast Eddie Zardoz and thought, "Well, if Connery gets involved in a futuristic movie that makes no sense, I can too." Maybe the good is at the bottom of the tailoring and all we see is the incoherent stuff. Have all actors kept their individual funny hats? You have never seen such bizarre-looking hats in one place in your life. Quintet just confirms what I've always thought: If Altman is good, he's great, but if he's bad, he does stuff like Quintet
