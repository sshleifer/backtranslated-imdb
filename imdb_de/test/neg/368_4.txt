Some spoilers **** A Soap has wonderful moments to recommend. When Charlotte and Veronica come close to intimacy, this is a beautiful, reserved, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not sure if the movie's curious stop and start structure is due to its being originally digested in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is the rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course she has to be portrayed as a sex worker (what else), scattered, impractical, absurdly rude / girly, totally hopeless when it comes to dressing and can not enter into any interpersonal ties in the world. Also, she has always been shown with two days of beard growth (for bizarre reasons) to emphasize how dry her life is. And she's waiting for a sex reassignment surgery when she seems to have done nothing to push her transition. In fact, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone who is in the midst of transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of people from outside who are not really associated with Transpeople. The fetishization of GRS surgery through the film is a way to objectify people in transition. Not impressed by this aspect of the movie in the least. At least, why not let the character play by someone who is really transgendered ... I thought the male actor playing Veronica is okay, but not better. Much better was the woman Charlotte portrayed, a very complex figure full of energy, self-hatred, desire, and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go to a woman's bar in two seconds and find her. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica, but rather as an abstract notion of someone with male / female features (a gentle touch, but with a good punch), not a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often irritating and moving, but that does not mean that an already stereotyped minority needs to be further clarified in the process. <br /> <br /> This film also proves that the Danes are miserable dancers For such a promising premise (better executed in a movie like "Different For Girls"), the final movie is a flop.
