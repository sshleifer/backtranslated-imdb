The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA is similar to a Duran Duran music video featuring classical music. This is the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> "In terms of what Theo?" <br /> <br /> Regarding everything, but most of all excitement. I doubt there ever was a slower, slower movie than this one. Okay, it's a European art-house movie, so I did not expect Charles Bronson to crush hordes of villains. Nevertheless, I expected something substantial, if not an actual conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visits Venice. Gustav visits Venice and rides in a gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out of his hotel window and when it's exciting, Gustav has a flashback <br /> <br /> Bad enough if this is the whole movie it would be worse, because Gustav notices a pretty young teenager. So you have a middle-aged academic man who feels like a teenager he's seen, an old queen is obsessed by a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I do not think so either, and thanks for being a Yawning Festival instead of a shabby precursor to gay porn. <br /> <br /> I notice that many people who praise this film have tried to intellectualize it. In my view, I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious, claiming that the only subtext I could relate to was Gustav's physical and mental disintegration, but he was not caused by the wild beauty of the teenage boy's boring and pompous movie
