This is one of those harmless and easy entertaining little movies that are eager to like them more. But like so many others, the material is not strong enough to fill a few hours successfully. <br /> <br /> The pitch is promising: Three drag queens take a bus through the outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They face great difficulties - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real difficulty lies in the dialogue. The clues are good (although Pearce's continued camping becomes boring), but the One-Liner and Epithets feel compelled to casually throw them away. Characters should not laugh at their own gags. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Elliott also feels the need to amass the gratifyingly inappropriate shots of flamboyant drag costumes against the desert backgrounds like cheap make-up. For a movie about self-confidence and self-esteem everything seems to be very uncertain.
