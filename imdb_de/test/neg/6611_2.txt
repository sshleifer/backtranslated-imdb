If the screenwriter withdraws from the project just days before the premiere of the film and demands that his name be removed from the credits, you know that this is not good. <br /> <br /> The books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have great potential for a living fantasy film? "Geralt de Rivia is a sorcerer, his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world, but not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything is good." But that did not matter, as a low-budget Polish film crew with little or no recognition for Sapkowski's work decided to turn it into a thirteen-part miniseries. The two-hour movie is a by-product of their actions to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> In this case, it's not hard to say why people call this movie bad. Plot (incoherent, crammed with too many stories), drama (below average, with the exception of Zebrowski), dialogue (boring), cut (choppy), special effects (intolerable) and choreography (bad) all add up to the film's overall bad experience. Only the soundtrack of Grzegorz Ciechowski brings out the beauty of the world of "Wiedzmin", which was never brought to the screen. Even the grandiose flora and fauna of Poland (where a part of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was filmed), a crucial element in almost every fantasy movie, has not been fully exploited. The more I think about this dead loss, the more words I run out of. At least it is a comfort to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", since then has only made a film (also in Germany). <br /> <br /> At the moment we have first-class fantasy stories and a fantastic computer role-playing game (published in 2007), which refers to the Wiedzmin books. But I am sure that someday the Wiedzmin saga will provide justice, and we will soon be treated to an equally good movie adaptation.
