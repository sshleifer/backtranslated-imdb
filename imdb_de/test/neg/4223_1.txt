"The Danish Bladerunner" is printed in bold on the box. Are you kidding me?! This movie is an absolute resistance. When I'm thirsty and take a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the VCR so I miss nothing. Not this time. I actually looked long and hard in the fridge just so I did not have to go back. Why the hell is not there a science fiction scriptwriter who has the slightest idea how computers work? It's incredible. One of the premises of the movie is that our hero (who is a hacker) has a small computer assistant to help him (the Microsoft Office paper clip has finally become established in the future). If he loses the assistant in the movie, he is helpless and can not enter a computer. HE IS A HACKER! It's like saying that you can not drive your car unless you have your lucky "cap". I will not even go into the lightning effect if he gets electric shocks ...
