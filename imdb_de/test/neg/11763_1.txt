35 years after production, Castro still rules. Unfortunately, we scratch our heads and wonder how the darkly played maniac, played by Jack Palance, who wanted to chew the landscape, made it to 1960. I stumbled back recently and was amused to notice the incomparable pages of Sid Haig and "B". Film favorite Paul (Untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously well behind his prime when he led this stupidity. Some of the lines are classic and have "Did he really say so?" The other thing that I've just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialogue) are really outstanding - the only first-rate elements of the entire production. So do not look at anything to learn about history or acting, but if you fancy looking at this as a jerk, bring the beers with you and have fun.
