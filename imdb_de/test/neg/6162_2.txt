They say David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this film. That sounds about right. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and saw Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it says that Saddam Hussein was not as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw lived in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He pretended to be French the whole time. He reveals to his wife that he is actually an American. For some reason, this is a shattering revelation to her, though she always talks about her husband's American accent. Your son, remember, he was born in France and never knew his father was American. He speaks perfect American English without a hint of French accent. This is just one of several powerful storylines in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main part of the movie is a flashback to Tommy's youth in New York in the 70s, when he explains to his wife why he did that in France. His best friend was Pappas, a retarded adult who was terribly played by Robin Williams. I assume that Duchovny thinks that "retarded" is somebody who is just stupid, because sometimes Pappas drops only slowly, while at other times he only appears as Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits in with his tired improvisational play, although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow. Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leoni, is a peckish, desperate nurse about her husband's recent death. Leoni does a good job, but she smokes mainly and shouts at Tommy, which is not all that important. The script did not give her much work. Tommy also makes friends with a lady (who he calls "Lady"), who is in prison, and offers him advice through her prison window (this house of detention is called "House of D" for short, hence the title). Tommy has no qualms about shouting his personal problems out loud on a city street, so this jailed criminal can give him advice, and he does so often without worry. <br /> <br /> I do not want to bore you with the good of the whole synopsis of the movie, but there are many storylines in this film that are too hard to handle, but turn out to be bad. Really bad. Really bad. At the end of this train crash, the script becomes grainier and grainier and ends with a ridiculously crappy ending. <br /> <br /> Critics rightly and rightly tore "House of D". I can not believe that some people really like this movie. It's a painful movie that I can sit down to and feel weak afterwards - not because of the emotions, but because of how awful he was.
