This movie is based on the series Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero)! It's in a different environment than the animated movie Streetfighter! This film is all about Ryu, who is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! There were no other characters from the video game used (which I could discover)! The fighting scenes were fine, but nothing really spectacular! And there were not many of them! This is strange for me! Is Streetfighter not a fight? Streetfighter, the animated film (1994), is far superior to this film. It tries to be more than it really is! The use of "Hada Power" and other supernatural elements has nothing to do with the abilities of the characters in the video game! And in that case, that's a bad thing! The story is so boring that you do not care what happens. The action is considerably weakened! Why? And what happened to the other characters from the video game? Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are the characters with their special skills! This film is all about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
