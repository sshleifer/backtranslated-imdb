Komodo Vs. Cobra begins as "One Planet" environmental activist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hired Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Par√©) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, initially reluctant to join Stoddard The island is a top secret military research base, but soon changes its mind when a lot of money is offered. Together with television reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey) they stalk the island and find that the military has financed illegal DNA gene experiments that have led to huge Komodo Dragon & King Cobra that have eaten almost all other creatures. Stoddard & Co are next on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Co-writing & directing the ever-dreadful Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym Jay Andrews, that's just awful, it's just hard to sit by & being Even worse than the usual trash "creature features" the sci-fi channel has the nerve if it is possible. The script is terrible, predictable and extremely boring. Some giant monsters are created by scientists playing with DNA, a group of humans are locked up with these monsters and must try to be eaten. That's it, that's the whole action of Komodo against Cobra, maybe this tried to rip AVP off: Alien Vs. Predator (2004) titled, but all 'vs.' A bit of garbage is thirty seconds between the two titular beasts at the very end, boring and certainly a big letdown for anyone hoping to get fed up on monster porridge. The characters are bad, the dialogue is awful, the tempo is slow, the story is predictable, the stereotype is gone and the whole movie is just lazy with a lazy script that incorrectly states that both Komodo Dragon and Cobra Amphibians are who they are not. Damn, Komodo Vs. Cobra is not even worth looking out for unwanted laughter because it's so boring and hardly anything happens, though the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the Cobra beach is quite funny for the wrong reasons , <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski continue to get jobs as director? He is probably the worst director currently working. How else can he enjoy filming movies in beautiful locations with semi-decent squads and still producing such a terrible movie? I think it was cut to get a PG or its TV show because every time someone swears it's masked by a Parrot squeal! There is no violence and violence, and the monster scenes are slack, people just stand there, the monsters just stand there and hiss or roar and that's it. The CGI computer effects are terrible, this is really a poor stuff that just looks awful. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 450,000, it looks as cheap as it was, the Hawaiian locations are nice to look at, but that's about it. The drama is bad from an uninterested acting actor. <br /> <br /> Komodo Vs. Cobra is an absolutely horrible sci-fi channel 'Creature Feature' by Jim Wynorski, movies are not getting much worse.
