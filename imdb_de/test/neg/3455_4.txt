(Attention: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> At some point, a post-apocalyptic movie will be created that does not stink. Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not about this movie, though I have to acknowledge it for the try. Kevin Costner plays someone who is just called a "postman". Actually, he is not a postman, but only a wanderer with a mule in the desert of West America, which is devastated by an unspecified disaster. He trades in isolated villages by playing Shakespeare. Suddenly, a pack of bandits, the Holnists, the self-proclaimed warlords of the West, descend upon a village where Costner is visiting, and their evil leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton), invades Costner. After much misery and numerous efforts to break Costner's mind, he escapes and thus ends a longer section of the film, which could have been told in a three-minute flashback better. <br /> <br /> We finally get to the major requirement: The escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail van and brings the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get something to eat under the pretext of a postman. Some villagers, led by the young Ford (Larenz Tate), want to take part in this post message that does not go well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself an ignorant and unwilling leader of a gang of postmen at war with the Holnists. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​The Postmen vs. The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. The Holnists depend on their livelihoods to isolate the villages they plunder from each other; The Holnists can destroy a village, but can not fight against all their victims. In order to unite, the villages must communicate with each other, and a functioning mail system would therefore be a big step to pull the Holnists out of business. So it makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem becomes medieval on our heroic letter carriers. Unfortunately, Bethlehem's ultimate defeat is not the result of uniting the villages against him, but your old standby stereotype, the one-on-one brawl between him and Costner. There is also no real attempt by the communities to use the post office to solve their problems together. All the mails seem to be the standard "Hi, Aunt Debbie", which is played for maximum sentimental value. THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. Now, I'm not deliberately trying to ruin movies for myself by thinking about what's going to happen next. But we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I only knew what would happen next, whether I wanted to know it or not. After a lion is prominently presented with eating humans, a holistic bandit looking for the escaped Costner ventures out into the bushes after a noise and we are then "shocked" when the lion eats it. A few unauthorized villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings some famous last words before he is shot, much to my surprise. A covered statue is revealed to show exactly what everyone knew she would be there: Costner bent down to fetch a letter from a cute kid we'd seen earlier in the movie. A man tells Bethlehem that I can not take my wife with me. Bethlehem passes the unsuspecting guy, though he is the only person in the theater who is unaware. <br /> <br /> But it's a racy, loud sentiment that truly undoes THE POSTMAN. The worst performer is Olivia Williams, who plays Costner's lover Abby. She pours her heart into the material and does her best to make it sound natural and sincere. She tries so hard, it breaks the heart. But nobody would ever have been able to make the lines, "I have a present for you, Postman ... you're giving out hope, like candy in your pocket," listening to something other than the syrup that they are. Another example is the scene in which a mounted Costner thunders past a little boy, ignoring his offered letter, just turning around, staring at him for five minutes and then thundering to fetch the letter. Why did not Costner pick it up the first time? No real reason; It is just a trick that tries and fails to give us a sense of joy by thwarting the child's hopes and then restoring them. Schmaltz and predictability unite at the end when the statue of the postman is revealed. I thought, "Please do not tell me they are showing the statue and then going back to the scene with the cute kid, which is certainly too saccharine, even for this movie too obvious." Then the music swelled and we actually confined ourselves to the dreaded little boy who smiles as his letter is washed away to his first-born aunt, and I held my head in my hands and thought, "Someone is going to shoot me." It felt like I'd pounded thirty pounds of apple pie into my throat. <br /> <br /> Gene. Bethlehem is a humanized villain as normal. Your default post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest, hardiest S.O.B. In the valley. Bethlehem is a bit of nothing inside of a man trying to feel important by bouncing on others. Although this sacrifices some threat, Bethlehem is somewhat credible, as most villains do. Unfortunately, Will Patton has done too much. And though we are told early on that Bethlehem has completely destroyed its last challenger in close combat within five seconds, the actual martial arts of Bethlehem at the end of the film are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty good otherwise. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As I said, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does sincere and credible work. James Newton Howard's score is proficient, though he falls short of the epic standards the film was intended for. But it is not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of ****.
