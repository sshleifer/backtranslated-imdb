My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show officially sucks a lot. For me CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100. I do not know, in the other CSIs you come across the episode you see. But in this case, you just can not get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so this show is not worth watching in my opinion. I know that people have different opinions, and I respect that, but for me this CSI is not good enough. So if you like excitement, real acting / performance, good action, directing, character development / engagement and overall good show, I suggest you check out CSI Miami.
