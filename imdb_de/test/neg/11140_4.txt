Yes, it is garbage. For anyone who likes experimental cinema (like me), it could be interesting to see Lowlifes chattering for almost two hours and doing nothing, but it gets very painful to realize that you've actually paid for it. This is probably one of the films you love for its utter emptiness and nihilism. However, I accept it for its shock, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
