If you like watching movies because they are pretty, you should agree with this movie. If you like to watch movies that start with a good thing that's trying to catch a bad guy, then let's go over the motives of each movie throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the movie, I still did not know why Stargher killed the women this way. If you set up such a ritual serial killer, it would be nice to know where the rituals came from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer, which was not the best, but at least it was explained why he killed the girls. They also pointed to a dark background for Vaughn 's character, but did not explain it, did not really say why Lopez' s child psychologist was so much better suited to the task than the rest of the interviewees, who did not explain much about the child 's problem, etc If the rest of the story is convincing, I do not care about details of how Stargher bought all of the fancy electronic devices and underground chambers, or why the FBI did not verify whether it owned one other property or had access to remote places while They were waiting to see if the killer's whole thing would work, but I'd like to have a feel for what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie if he kills in such a complex manner.
