That's a parody. That is, there are no characters as such, they are all pure stereotypes, and the movie depends entirely on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a lot of real fools. If one assumes that all dialogues are absurd, the fun lapses. <br /> <br /> You see, there is American Pie 2, my beloved teenage movie. It contains many real original characters. Maybe the jokes are tasteless, but all people have a kind of life. For example, they feel embarrassed when something embarrassing happens. That makes the jokes themselves funny! <br /> <br /> Not so in this movie: Every scene is clearly arranged as a parody, so there are no characters at all, so there is really no room for sympathy. If you know the original films, you know whole scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me was not boring, where in fact the comments of some teenagers were in the cinema where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Ah, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very brief performance of Melissa Joan Hart in one scene. Sigh. It's just too cool, it can not be real. Hmm, worth a whole movie?
