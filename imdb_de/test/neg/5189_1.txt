About 20 minutes after this lame apology for a movie, I realized he reminded me of one of those annoying people who always tell lame jokes or do extremely funny things because they find it funny and try to entertain everyone. <br /> <br /> This film is charged with Traci Lords in the lead role, she is not as bad as an actress, but her lines are not funny and they are not the STAR. <br /> <br /> Acting is some of the most frightening I've ever seen except Lords, the girl Casey plays, and maybe the Colonel, who seems strangely out of place. I can not imagine why a retired military colonel wants to found a SNOWBOARDING ACADEMY. Is this even available? <br /> <br /> The budget would have better seduced these women into doing a full-length porn feature. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has 3.5 points, "Frostbite" has 2.7 points. I am amazed that these two films are within a 1.0 of each other, FGF is "The Godfather" compared to this garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
