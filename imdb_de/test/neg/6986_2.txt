Don Wilson plays the lead role as a cop who likes the occasional virtual reality fighting game, but it goes awry when the people behind the game take virtual reality to a new level by making real people out of the video game Main opponent of the video game and begins to kill people. Now is the only man who can beat the guy, Don Wilson, who is now falling in love with the cybersex model. In all that was considered, my biggest mess was understanding whether the people brought in from the land of virtual reality were robots, humans, cyborgs, or just an unknown computer program. It does not matter, since all this is just an excuse to watch one of the worst actor dialogues, as if he's running a deli. Don Wilson's total lack of charisma is the movie's biggest mistake, since one guy just does not like it, he's too good-natured, his voice is too high and does not look very impressive in the action sequences. What spares me this boring party before my lowest rating is Athenia Massey, who looks very hot in high cut outfits and occasionally stretches naked. Also on board are Loren Avedon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the main voice of evil, but their efforts are in vain, as they are all obscured by Wilson's very bad acting. Another mistake that is the film's biggest mistake is lack of action as we are asked to follow the story's evolution. Apart from Massey's nudity and possibly unintentional amusements due to ridiculously unconvincing acting, there is really nothing interesting. This also applies to the courses of action in which choreographed flat, badly directed and any possible excitement is completely withdrawn. That makes practically unsurpassable. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bath)
