As Ben Elton once remarked, nothing works faster than the comedy. Steve Martin's newest offering - "The Pink Panther 2" - has recently been reopened for bad reviews and dreary cash advances, while Mike Myer's "The Love Guru" has apparently gained few admirers. <br /> <br /> 1970, it was Jerry Lewis who felt the pain of rejection (ironically, does his character in this movie have a funny twist if anyone uses that word in his presence) when "Which Way to the Front? " has driven him off the big screen for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> In this World War II comedy, he plays "Brendan Byers 111", the richest man in the world who wants to join the army, his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored), but is rejected because he is not medically fit. Then he decides to start his own privately funded army and recruit other 4-F members. <br /> <br /> Equipped with ridiculous uniforms similar to those of 'International Rescue' in 'Thunderbirds', they go to training. Some good visual gags here. When firing rocket launchers, they look pleased with themselves until they learn they've just destroyed a Texaco oil station! Brendan wants to learn German and plays a longplayer entitled "Songs To Mein Kampf By". When this army sits down to eat instead of being in a torn hall, they are in an opulent room adorned with a chandelier. John Wood is very funny as' Finkel ', Byers' ever -so english butler. His best scene is when he blackmails a mafia-style gangster to teach Byers' brigade to kill. The script is not by Jerry himself, but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of a series of episodes of The Monkees. "Front" often has the look and feel of a TV sitcom, and sometimes you almost expect to hear a laugh track. Where it goes awry is over in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces one of the Nazi Commander in Chief, and after the Germans were ordered to retire from the front, she is implicated in killing Hitler (and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight!). As commander Jerry delivers such a staging that he can not resist the description. He gives Brian Blessed a chance for his money in the "loudest man alive". It is a relief when the credits appear. <br /> <br /> Maybe the timing was just wrong - it was not a good idea to release a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict raged. Or the audience just had enough of Jerry (this beard probably did not help!). What he needed here was a good producer, someone who picked him up and said, "That gag stinks, throw him out!" "Do not lift the bridge, lower the river" is a masterpiece compared to this picture. <br /> <br /> By the 1970s, the new comedy icons Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, and Monty Python were fresher, more biting, and in Allen's case replaced by more human comedy, Jerry's slapstick. It would not be until 1982 that he would celebrate something of a successful comeback - like the cocky talk show presenter 'Jerry Langford' in Martin Scorcese's brilliant 'The King Of Comedy'.
