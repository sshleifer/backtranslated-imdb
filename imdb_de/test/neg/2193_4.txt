Now I've seen two films by director Chen Kaige, a very good one (goodbye my concubine) and this bad one, The Assassin. Both films show important events in Chinese history, FMC in the 20th century and TA the first union of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC was successful with memorable characters, great cinematographs, compelling sets, good acting and an interesting story. The Assassin fails on almost every level (okay, the sets are great, the cinematography is good and the few fight scenes are pretty exciting). But ... the pathos. Call me a cynic, but too much is too much. If you thought that "Saving Private Ryan" was too pathetic, be aware that you are getting sick here. The dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem like political statements, this picture is not subtle or entertaining. The film is dominated by its own splendor. I'm really surprised that The Assassin gets so many votes on imdb. 4.10
