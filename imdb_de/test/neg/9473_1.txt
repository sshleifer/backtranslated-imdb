I saw Roger Moore sniffing the scenes that needed to run or train. He was a James Bond who wanted to sit in a bar and tell stories with his British knights. Nothing against older people in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a frail-looking 58-year-old man fighting on the wings of planes, hanging on a train, swimming in a marsh with crocodiles, etc.? Apart from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, dull and feeble-minded, the fact that a frail Oldster was preoccupied with many death-defying stunts made it much easier to laugh at James Bond. In 1983, Roger Moore looked significantly older, and he has not been able to fight with younger men for a long time. I saw this movie in the theater, and the laughter was very often. Any credibility built up by James Bond had disappeared into OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his colleagues. Another drawback was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was one half of the axis of evil. Jordan has helped make the whole concept even more ridiculous. And the Russian general was a total shit. OCTOPUSSY is better suited as a comedy parody, much like SPIES LIKE US. <br /> <br /> Even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes made in many other films by better actors. Take EMPEROR OF THE NORTH (1972), where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine struggled up and down the train, making him look exciting and real. Roger Moore had a thin, weak body in 1983 and yet his stunt double was clearly a younger, taller, more athletic and muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. That made his fight scenes just more comedic. The Moore Stunts looked like the old low budget Chop Socky Kung Fu movies, especially in the bad editing. The director seemed to be trying to improve the bad drama and the bad stunts by providing several views of the same stunt. This only emphasizes the differences between Moore and his stunt double. The fact that the train scenes were shot with Moore in a studio was evident from the lighting when Moore was in the recording, compared to the outside shots of the stunt double in a real move. Although many Bond films have to be the worst in handling their stunt fights. You can usually see clearly that the Bond actor is not really fighting. Overall, OCTOPUSSY is among the worst movies ever made, and one of the worst of the worst Bond films.
