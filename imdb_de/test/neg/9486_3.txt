This movie was fine. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for the obvious), who are sent against their will to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that. <br /> <br /> Two French guys (who looked a bit inbred) start talking to them and arousing interest, Blah blah blah, it's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what's going on between them In addition, the twins meet a French FABULOUS model because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world, they make bffs with the model and spend a fun montage shopping in the City Lights Yes, I honestly can not I think that might mean something, but it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment." Overall, this movie was Can I really identify with two girls who are devastated when they hear that they are going to Paris? "Yes, really?" Besides, the jokes were not really funny, but I saw the whole movie So be entertaining The fact that it plays in Paris has probably been watching me.
