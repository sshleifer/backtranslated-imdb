Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are long gone. Runteldat shows a man who immediately tries to play the sympathy card of his plight, but takes responsibility for it whenever he believes it benefits his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life his best days were behind him: his half-witty show was dead in the water after the emigration of his co-star and until today he faces a career as a voice actor and terrible action movies. <br /> <br /> One has the impression that this concert film was not meant to reinforce Lawrence's career after his humiliation, but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by trying what was left to save in a miserable way and somehow turn it into something to be proud of, a crucial moment in which he proved to be "deserving". Unfortunately, the concert is nothing but a pebbly Martin, incoherently trying to be funny, causing pathos, and claiming that he does not care about hardcore at all. The sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way in which he is resting on sad pettiness makes you wish he kicked himself on stage only to his underwear, swinging a gun around and just replay it There is no real insight into his performance at all. As the childish title says, Martin tries to make his ultimate moment of truth his own and fails miserably. It would have been better to wait for the E! Real Hollywood story, instead of running on stage and making an idiot for the second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film - or better, job career - is that Martin did not do it. I do not think about it. What should this movie prove? Unfortunately, his fame was fugitive, he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now he can only piggyback on Will Smith or a Pixar production. You might as well call this concert "tombstone" because that's the way it is. Martin Lawrence dies here on stage, and that could make an interesting career. Now? Only a miserable side note in the story.
