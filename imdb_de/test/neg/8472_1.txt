I've spent almost ninety minutes through this horrible movie waiting for a revelation about dance or ghost or inspiration or something, and I've given up! What did the filmmakers own? This is an old woman with limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill in a story without a dot, we get some stuff about the other people in their fight, their help for burros and of course their ten cats! Do not see this movie And have nothing left to do with someone who loved it - they have no idea. There are fascinating people in the world who tell wonderful stories and share insights - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I took to this film say that they forgive me - but that they will never stop fooling me about it.
