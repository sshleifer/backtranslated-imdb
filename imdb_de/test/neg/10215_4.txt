Mind you, it should not be, but it is. As a little bit I saw this movie in the theater (a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is that we were the only ones in the theater and I did not really like it. I've darkened the rest, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> A bad movie comparable to the greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman". "No Holds Barred" is a high-stakes movie world of pro wrestling. Maybe the stakes are not too high ... and frankly I feel dirty calling these people "professionals". And really, except in the first scene, there is no wrestling to talk about. So I think the movie is about the marginally low world of amateurish brawling. Sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the champion of WWF. (Do not let it be said that Hulk Hogan was typography, this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that has truly exceeded the bounds of his talents). Basically, he plays himself, but with a wardrobe that is blacker and bluer than the red and yellow ones of the Hulkster. He also has this gesture that he makes. It's a bit like the unclear devil character that people make at rock concerts, except that they're holding your thumb in the air and curling your index finger. My friend claimed that he should look like an "R". Convince yourself. If that looks like an "R", then Mars needs women. But still. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his over-reacting detector, obviously plays Fritz on TV, a TV-Exec with his slightly homoerotic heart that brings Rip, who is accidentally taller than Elvis, into his network. He will have none of this (and leaves the office with a triumphant gesture to no one except the camera), and so follows the movie Fuller trying to raise the ratings and reach Rip. He does this when he creates his brilliantly titled "Battle of the Hard Guys". Marketing genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> From the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fighting scenes (everything is played as if wrestling were very real and deadly serious) to over-frequent shots of Hulk in nothing but underwear, this movie has it all expected from a stupid movie. It is reckless, not too strenuous for the mind, violent, and includes the phrase "What is that smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> A classic for all time.
