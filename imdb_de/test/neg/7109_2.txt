As a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I was really looking forward to this "documentary". I also got excited when I read rave reviews from the country's critics. That should have typed me. <br /> <br /> The movie is just boring and obviously extremely overrated. You do not even see Dietrich. She is in the background and discusses her films and this video. She does almost nothing, but complains about everything. What a boredom! <br /> <br /> The filmmaker, Maximilian Schell, is constantly complaining and asking her to be in front of the camera ... all without success. She refuses to cooperate again and again. After a while it gets so exhausting. Why should Schell continue this project with her attitude? He should have told the prima donna to "push it". No matter what you read, do not waste your time doing it.
