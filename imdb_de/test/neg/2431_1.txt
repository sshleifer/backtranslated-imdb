This show is not good in my opinion, then I have not enjoyed a Disney Channel cartoon yet. Apart from "The Proud Family", because this is a normal female teenager. This show is very similar to how I find Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to make the movie into a cartoon because the film was excellent and the cartoon is horrible. The Disney Channel was fine, before all those stupid cartoons like Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the Series, American Dragon Jake Long, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better if they had come to PlayHouse Disney! With regard to this special show, Kuzko will never leave school, just as Dave The Barbarian's parents will never return home and Brandy And Mr. Whiskers will never leave the jungle.
