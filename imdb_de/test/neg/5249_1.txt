This movie is painful. That's probably the best way to describe it. There are 93 minutes of your life that you can never get back. Well, actually it's more than 86 minutes, because there's no way someone wants to put the credits in that stinking pile of dog feces. You can tell right away that the movie is from the producer of "Mortal Kombat" because of his dull and annoying techno soundtrack. This will deplete the few ridiculously beautiful moments this movie can offer you. The rest is exhausted by the totally uninteresting and annoying characters, the acting skills of the "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" (including the Miscast Christopher Lambert) and the non-existent director. Did I leave something out? Of course I have. Let's not forget the suicidal script, with a monotonous (??) funny dialogue. Oh, and let's talk about how they embarrassed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. The costumes and weapons (were those huge pizza cutters that I saw all the time?!?!) Are just stupid, so I can best describe them. And the last doer of the night is the always terrible CGI. When will filmmakers learn that CGI is shit? When will we see the wonderful effects of the 80s? Probably never, but movies like this one and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" make us wish they brought them back. Finally, avoid this movie like Freddie Prinze's latest film, Jr. If you like the films of Freddie Prinze, Jr., then you deserve to enjoy this terrible apology for filmmaking.
