I could not spoil that piece of crap if I wanted to. After seeing Dark Harvest 1, I thought, "This must be the worst movie ever made," then I saw Dark Harvest 2 and that made 1 a little better. Then I saw or tried Dark Harvest 3. The only thing I have to say is "when does this end?" Very bad acting and really bad special effects. The only good thing about this movie was the boob shot. Do not waste your time with this bitch ... And now I have to write 3 more lines to convey this. I wanted to sing a song, but I can not think of anything now. But the movie eventually ended (though there was an end that might mean they will do another)
