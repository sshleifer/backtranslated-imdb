(Contains really bad spoilers) What can I say ... It's a really horrible and horrible movie !!. Too much CGI and special effects .... you could say how wrong the ridiculous baby is !! Please At least "Dungeons and Dragons" look at what another horrible bunch of TRASH is. Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons better !!! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this garbage !! I would also say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably as stupid as "Son of the Mask". "BabyGeniuses 2 was just as fake as" Son of the Mask "and also contains way too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes ... that was a BAD REALLY BAD film .... please avoid it just ... do not recommend it to anyone ... please be just too ridiculous .... does not make any sense and a really bad act .. The baby, who looked at his father, was only lame!
