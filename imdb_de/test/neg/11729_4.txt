Shady plot, dubious script, almost everything indeed. The most convincing performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not save this pointless and unpleasant movie. The director's implicit request to viewers is not only to expose unbelief, but to suspend judgment. It is probably intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments, they are little. These kinds of things have been done better by many others. Do not go out of your way to see it.
