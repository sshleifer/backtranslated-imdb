There are several well-known actors in this film that I usually like, so at least I had little expectation when I lent it to DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I've had some snacks in the last half hour and somehow I ended up in the kitchen instead of going to the TV. The plays, in which the music was pretty bad and did not convince any of the atmosphere of the movie, were very convincing. Practically all scenes had this "just a movie" feeling, I just sat there and waited for the director to "CUT!" followed by the crew, who talk a little about the scene before moving on to the next one. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is gangster, most characters are tough and mob-like. The problem here is that the whole thing is bad. The boy's attitude is so bad that it just feels like a joke. The constant guitar-treble soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere, but playing the same track for the 18th time simply adds to the already strong feeling that the whole thing is just a fake. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just a really bad script, maybe it was just badly executed. I am not a film critic. Actually, I find it rare to see something that is REALLY GOOD, but that was just bad, no matter how objectively and indulgently I try to be. NOT to be recommended, not even as a rent!
