I love Hedy Lamarr. I think she was underrated as an actress in the 1940s. She was the Nastassja Kinski of that time, and critics did not take her seriously. Having said all this, this movie is boring. When I saw it for the first time, I was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in the story but also in make-up and costumes. Hedy's make-up changes from shot to shot. So does hair length and style. Reason: This thing had so many authors and so many stops and starts, it's amazing that they ever released it. Her "Lady of the Tropics" started to film AFTER the beginning of this movie, but was released before "I Take This Woman". In fact, it was then known in Hollywood as "I Re-Take This Woman". That should tell you something. I'm also a fan of Spencer Tracy, but here he is WUNDER. I've read in several movie stories that he absolutely despised Hedy Lamarr, which is obvious in the movie. NO pharmacy. The story moves from role to role and eventually just stumbles off strangely. I can not recommend that at all.
