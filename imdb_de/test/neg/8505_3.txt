I like gay movies where the characters are not stereotypically gay, and that attracted me to this movie, the lead actor and the lead actor. That's the only reason why I give this movie one more star than it deserves (though not because of its acting in the movie, let me tell you). Many people complain about the cinematography, but the film's camcorder feel added some "underground" quality to me, and there are a few scenes, usually around the sunset or sunrise, and between the moves that make up every movie Make the screen blush. <br /> <br /> But the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I got the second half of the movie through a soundtrack of another movie), you have to wait nearly twenty minutes for a dialogue and then it's awkward and unprofessionally. The theme of graffiti could have made this movie great if it had been gracefully exploited and the art itself would have been more intriguing, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, there is no peak; It was not really a conspiracy. The movie just crawls back into its shell of silence and dies. An unforgettable movie.
