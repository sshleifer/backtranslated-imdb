Not a good movie. Sure, it does contain action, but the effects are not great for a movie from '08. Shot effects are downright terrible. Acting is "meh" <br /> <br /> It's nothing but Far Cry, except for names and the basics of the story (genetically enhanced super-soldiers who go amuck). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the attitude is completely different (tropical island in the Pacific in the game, island in the North American America in the movie). <br /> <br /> I loved to play Far crying. I loved the story and the setting. I hated the movie.
