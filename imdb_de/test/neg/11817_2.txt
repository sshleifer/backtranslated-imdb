This is a fucking movie. Like so many "women in chains" films, this film is also full of lesbianism. Unlike most previous films that strongly suggest this, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA, a horny female jailer, shows a terrible skin that suffers from showering and sex with one of the inmates. For the early 70s, this is definitely a softcore porn movie - a style like GIRLS WONE GOOD TO PRISON! It's also a terrible rip-off of THE DEFIANT ONES, though in this case two hot women who hate each other chained to each other in flight. While the original film is considered a classic, this can only be considered as a classic example of bad taste. That's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap - cheaper thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black prisoner with an attitude" - a lady who was hired and sent to prison on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionist. When they escape, they can not stand and have conflicting goals. However, since these are clich√©s, it's no surprise how the movie ends - both become friends (gag me).
