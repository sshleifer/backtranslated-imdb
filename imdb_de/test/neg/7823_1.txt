Not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the cinema. I'm talking about how big productions invest so much money in things that are actually boring and do not talk about ridiculous. With the millions who made them to make a movie like this, because I do not think the actors here would actually work for nothing or for a modest sum. Imagine how many good independent films you could make, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. It's just to demolish you, but nobody, just the majority of teens who are willing to watch an Ashton Kutcher movie just because they're fans of it. I also do not really know how anyone with common sense can actually work in this kind of movie. If you actually look at it in perspective, the actors have the same quality of this movie. I think I should not be surprised, I could not have expected more.
