"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981 during the height of the Slasher movie. At the beginning of the year, fans were patting "My Bloody Valentine's Day", "Just before Dawn", "Friday the 13th Part 2" and "The Burning" and the theaters still anticipated spins like "Halloween II". The Prowler "and" Happy Birthday to Me. "I've seen all these films, and of all the popular Slashern from 1981," Graduation Day "is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What" Graduation Day "means is an exercise in poor and low-budget filmmaking with bad acting, bad writing, pointless characters, pointless scenes, unnecessary nudity, cheesy dialogue, and an intersection of experimentation that did not work so well, and who could be the classic disco music of the 80s Forgetting years playing throughout the movie (the music of the opening scene is only competing with the music of a chase scene), but if you rent a movie like this one, you should be aware that this information is included in this movie Why is not "Graduation Day" considered classics like "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," "A Nightmare on Elm Street," "My Bloody Valentine's Day," "The Burning," or "Prom Night?" Why Seek n fans still after these films, but ignore this without caution? <br /> <br /> Where Slasher films have to be successful is especially in tune with other areas. There is nothing worse than a slow slasher, and "Graduation Day" is moving quite slowly. The most annoying part is that there are many ways to speed things up; There are numerous pointless characters that are introduced and never given the opportunity to be a suspect in the murders or to be victims. There's a sloppy teacher, a stressed-out rector, a cunning secretary, a stupid school guard, an unsuspecting detective, an alcoholic stepfather, a mindless grandmother, and a mother still mourning. All of these characters could have a motive to kill, or have a reason to be killed, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story is still focused on them and sometimes called entire scenes, just to filter out their character. But for what? <br /> <br /> What astonishes me about Graduation Day and its small fan base is that people are no longer enthusiastic about the death scenes. Fans rave about death scenes like the raft massacre in "The Burning", the death of the washing machine in "My Bloody Valentine", the kabob death in "Happy Birthday to Me", the upside down death in "Friday the 13th Part 3 "and the hot tub in" Halloween II "and even the bonnet in" Madman. "But where is the respect for some truly unique (though cheesy) deaths on" Graduation Day. "A victim is impaled with a fencing sword directly through the jugular while another throws this sword at them like a spear.The best death involves spikes under a landing mat.Why are these deaths in the genre not as famous as the deaths in more popular Slasher films? <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day "is eager to be a great and unique movie, but there is only one element of logic and tempo missing, which really ruins the whole experience - it's not the worst of its kind (try" Do not go in the Woods ... Alo ne ") and there is a bit of tension, and it delivers exactly what fans are looking for (blood, blood, nudity, sex) and nostalgia), but" Graduation Day "will not be remembered as one of the greatest Slasher films ever stay. It's not a budget issue - almost all slashers have a low budget - but it's a matter of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. That's all there is to filmmaking ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of hardcore slasher. General horror fans may be a little bored, and people who are not at all interested in horror should make a clear decision. It's not the worst Slasher movie ever made, but it's still far from the best.
