As a writing teacher, there are two things my students can never use: "Then I woke up," and "Then I was run over by a truck." I'll add, "Then I'll have a bump on my head." I find it totally unfair to use these tricks to mask a lack of imagination. The whole question of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and craftsmanship, but in this film they could not or did not want that. I'm not saying it's completely worthless, but it's so predictable, except for the stupid ending. There are even gangsters going to the police to get help from this man. They should have done it immediately. It's just a memorable horror / sci-fi movie that has nothing new to offer.
