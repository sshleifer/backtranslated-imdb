It is hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey produced this piece of garbage. The show could not even keep a candle to cooking shows of the past, including Emeril Lagasse since Ainsley Harriott hosted a horrible cooking show, I've seen, at least, Ainsley Harriott has a few good moments and a style that has no style at all. The TV play is over the top and the credits are so bad that I get sick. Now I enjoy cooking shows that have a cool sense of style, but that's absolutely none of it <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
