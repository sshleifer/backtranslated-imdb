I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The entire movie was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we did not get up and did not go beyond the first clue as to what the film really was about (which is still hard to pin down because it was such a ridiculous story ... blood, Courage and violence seemed to be the only real issue), but we always hoped that something redeeming would be around the corner. Unfortunately, there was nothing, because there was nothing useful! We, along with many other people in the audience, left the theater mumbling "that was disgusting," "what a waste of time," "I should have gone," "where was the comedy," that was pathetic, etc. It actually got us, the audience, to express our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off.The only thing that was earned in the movie was the costuming and acting skills of almost everyone in the movie simply no action that was not worthy of their talents, I rate this with a 1 because there is no 0. I can not quite understand how anyone could rate that higher than a 0!
