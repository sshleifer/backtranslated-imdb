I'm sorry, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can not believe that after they did the first part of the series, they got a budget to do another. Not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary movie I've ever seen and laughed to the end (actually I can not believe we've seen it to the end), but I think it's up to you That we could not do it I do not quite believe it.
