Nice pictures, propaganda and history as a toy. The ingredients of this film are good, interesting, but with many shadows. Politically, all shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. He is the silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker and teacher of much of North America. The movie is just Superman. The delicate outline of the ideas is crushed. The subtle birth of the essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is the basic tool to create a good picture of American realities. The end, triumph and forgery, romance and hero, is the suicide of a story that may be great with more wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray spot. For someone who has not heard anything about Jefferson, the movie is a good start. For the others - disillusionment. It's like the precious silk of a tailor. But the tailor is fascinated by silk and the clothes are just an ordinary stuff. So a sad experience. Beauty cuts and boring lakes, patriotic lessons and the rapture of expectation. A film that has to impress. And the ashes of a story that could be great.
