Suburban children meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. He is also meaner and stronger. Nevertheless, the majority of the drama is just as bad as the first one. Sometimes the characters say things that make no sense and do not convince. I made a mistake to look sober. You will probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-). If you have not stopped loving clowns after the first movie, you will definitely find it after the second ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Problem children and their spectators are on their way to a camp Forest . And what a coincidence, her car broke off in the middle of the forest and .... at night? That's just her luck. They find a house and one was shot, one of the observers stays behind (why I do not know) and the rest finally finds another house. This house is home to a voodoo priestess ..... but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. Who is it then Well, you look at the movie better and find out for yourself ...
