... I usually hate puns, but this seems to be the only fitting summary for "Barnyard". I suppose I'm not the first. I am sure that many, MANY comments focus on the stupidity of bulls with udders. That disturbed me in any case. But there is much more wrong with this film than a basic lack of knowledge about the functioning of mammals. If I were a parent, I would personally be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end showdown with the coyotes. (Although it had at least a little bit to do for me.) And from a conventional screenwriting standpoint, you could expect the coyotes to play a bigger role in conflict (Gee - you have a "widow" cow ... maybe her "husband" killed by coyotes? no ... there is a stupid explanation.) And what kind of farm is that? Otis vows to protect all animals from harm, but there seems to be no danger to humans. They refer to the fact that the farmer is vegan, but why he breeds pigs? In all animal stories for kids - Babe, Charlotte's Web, you name it ... the reality of farm life is at least touched. Maybe our friendly farmer will run some kind of rescue (there's an indication, but it's never explained). But all the farmer gets in return is the misuse of a horse in a scene that's meant to be funny but left me seriously asked if he would be buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. And what is the deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like the gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without a ball gag. <br /> <br /> Add some really horrible attempts in emotional scenes, an almost complete lack of laughter and THOSE UDDERS, and you have the Worst Children's movie I've ever seen. In general, I'm just posting on IMDb to highlight a movie that is not so well known that it does not pop the # 2 box-office hit. But this movie upset me. It took place in my local theater, a room that could be used to show something of value. There was a lot of good family entertainment this summer - in fact, at least two more children's films were playing in the same multiplex. But I can not see anything like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can cheat families with an extra $ 30. At least I had a free ticket. <br /> <br /> I know that this 35-year-old movie is not for me. But there is no excuse for such a lazy, horrible children's movie like "Barnyard" in the age of Pixar. I was bored with the "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly did not annoy me like "Barnyard". "Shark Tale" was a weak attempt at street hipness, but had a lot to laugh about. You could turn on Nickelodeon anytime of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent. Therefore, they should be ashamed if they put their name on this garbage. <br /> <br /> I am I gave him a 2 out of 10 points just because Pip The Mouse was sporadically amusing and Maria Bamford as a peasant woman had a few amusing lines. Well, not the farmer's wife. Another farmer. They did not really explain who she was. You have not explained much. Especially not why Sam Elliot - the man's ultimate man - had an udder down there. Creepy.
