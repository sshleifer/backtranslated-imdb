Let me first say that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and have read to steal this book and steal this urine test. Am also an even bigger Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was a discreet garbage dump that made a very PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director has made Abbie Hoffman interesting in this film. They despised Stew Albert as a cartoon actor without intellect, the man was a professor at Berkley for Christsakes. Ok, they did a horrible casting job for Anita Hoffman, a horror casting for the Jerry Rubin character. I'm just guessing that the movie does not fit with the news flashes I've seen of Abbie or the books he's written. The movie just did not fit and annoyed me. Oh yes, and that's the absolute worst voice I've ever heard from Richard Nixon. This is one of the few films I've ever rented and I could not stand, because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and his discriminated Yippies band, and this movie was just done badly. And it hurt me that when people watch a movie about the Yippies now, they see a terrible adaptation and do not get a real sense of reality. Instead, they get a hollywoodized Palanthra out of crap. <br /> <br />
