I really wanted to see this movie - I found the plot really unique and fascinating. A police officer (Andy Garcia) has a son who dies and needs a bone marrow replacement to live. The only match is a convicted serial killer who flees the prison. To save his son, he has to track down the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the movie. Keaton is sometimes a great actor, but here he is pretty boring. It's exaggerated to the point where you just have to stop caring. Garcia is better, but it's too hard for a movie that is not up to date. Barbet Schroeder (once a promising director with films like "Barfly," which represented almost nothing on the American market) is good enough - I really thought the script was the culprit here ... it's just a big mess br /> <br /> The film eventually wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a flawed script. What should be an exciting and thought provoking movie is just a Hollywood action-dud.
