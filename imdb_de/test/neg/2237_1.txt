I watched the movie because my friend raved about how much he wanted to see him and how his friends were and loved him. So I arrived with a neutral attitude and did not really expect the worst. Unfortunately, I got that. I could write a 15-page paper about why this is the worst movie I've ever seen. But to your advantage, I will point out the pros and the infinite supply of disadvantages. At the beginning the acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved a laugh and some exciting scenes. Unfortunately, good action, a bit of humor and excitement are the points where the good points end. The whole beginning story could have been great. The family of a Jewish girl is slaughtered, she hides, later encounters the man responsible for her pain, and then meanders a great plan for revenge. Sounds very good. But the movie would not be so "satisfying" for the Americans and Jews who crave Nazi blood. I have no problem with World War II films or killing Nazis. I have seen Defiance and I like it a lot. However, it is the way our would-be heroes kill. I'll give you an excellent example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie radiates. Our Hoodlum gang attacks a German unit and kills everyone except one sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to divulge information about another German unit. If he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers, they hit his head with a baseball bat, cheer and curse like a football match. They took the Nazi's head off! Now let's look at the hypocrisy in this scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers are ambushed and captured by the enemy. The same scenario follows, and the American commander would rather die than betray his comrades. The enemy beats his head with many celebrations. This would make an audience angry if this scene were in a movie. This American soldier was a hero for defying his men, and these barbarians brutally killed him! What about the Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves to die the cruelest possible death, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same to the Jews. Do you see the hypocrisy? With the celebration of the slaughterers of the Nazis, we put ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Big Hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis are making a propaganda film about a German sniper killing nearly 300 American soldiers. Towards the end of the film, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts giggle with joy as they see an American soldier being shot out of a window and falling into a well. The Nazis cheer as a soldier soldier to the sniper. This is to make the American viewers of this scene angry. These evil Nazis laugh at the death of our brave men! Well, the irony is, have not we done that the whole time we see Inglorious Basterds do it? Laughing at the pain of others just because they were "the bad guys". How would we feel if the Native Americans somehow made a hit movie by bloodying the American settlers? Or what if Blacks made a movie that glorified the Nat Turner Rebellion? OK enough about the hypocritical defects. <br /> <br /> I summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating. 1) There were admirable characters throughout the movie. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in her gunshot wound because he suspects she betrayed him. He is the good guy? 2) Scenes were drawn much longer than necessary. 3) Brad Pitts southern, supposedly Tennessee accent is HORRIBLE and extremely annoying throughout the turn. I'll stop now, since I'm at 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the population does not seem to think anymore, it just wants blood. And that's why this movie was rated so high. I recommend this film for the ignorant or if you are Jewish and just want to see a nice "fantasy justice". When I finally got out of the cinema, I felt like I had been scalped (or wished I wanted it that way, that I had not had mental rape for over 2 hours).
