** IMPORTANT SPOILERS ** To see only for the action sequences, not the story or action in it "Nature Unleashed: Fire" has one of the longest and most agonizing ends of modern film history. We have the fearless ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, who is driving this trio of hysterical motorcyclists to bring an explosive smoke mine shaft to safety in all areas! This during a raging forest fire! Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of nature, does not seem to realize that a mine shaft that seeps with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place when all the woods surrounding it are on fire! <br /> <*** SPOILERS FROM THAT POINT UP *** All of this started some time ago, when Ranger Jake, in an effort not to save that on the ball-miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "The Sherd", him slipped his fingers and drop to death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! Although we were curious who set the forest fires on fire for the first half of the film, it was no surprise that Tiny was the culprit! As you would expect in movies like this, Tiny seemed to be made of tempered steel, in which nothing that had ever happened to him could stop fire explosions and spits, the mad miner. <br /> <br /> or Resurrection, Ranger Jake participated in the rescue of motorcyclists Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen, Melanie Lewis, Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in the forest and burning fire everywhere. If you have the usual knowledge - Marcus - among the bikers, it does not run as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted. Marcus is not only annoyed with humble Chris for doing something stupid, he jumps his bike over a five-foot-high pile of wood, but the guy breaks his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to lift Chris out of the air before the fires devour him and his fellow riders! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie Ranger Jake blaming himself, Boner for Boner trying to save himself and the bikers caught and lost in the forest! All this ends with Jake's ingenious idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft, while the Rescue Party is only a few feet away from saving them, if only they had stayed and in the open, where the rescue team could find them. <br /> <br /> Even though it was supposed to be the life of the party or the movie, Tiny, despite all his efforts to be another indestructible super villain, emerged as a man who spent too much time in the sun. Tiny's make-up was so disgusting that he looked like he was throwing a glass of spaghetti over his head instead of letting it burn crispy. Ranger Jake was either very naïve or retarded, because he was so excited about the dangerous Tiny that he always tried to save the raging psycho who never hid his feelings, what he had for the game with the rules Forest Ranger in mind , In fact, Ranger actually urged Jake Tiny to assist both him and the bikers by showing him how incompetent he was trying to save her. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so smart, but because Tiny was so brainless despite his indestructibility!
