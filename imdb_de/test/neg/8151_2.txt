I got two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to buy this piece of horse manure. I paid a dollar on the local DVD exchange and want my money back. I have some good movies (at least I think they're good) that have never seen the inside of a video library. After seeing that, I'm really offended. Light years that are worse than anything I've ever seen, I can not recommend as a ticklish joke. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh, it makes you angry. How did this horrible movie find some kind of distribution? I can only believe that it was self-distributed, as the amateur DVD authoring would suspect. To get rid of the producers of this "movie", it's obvious that you have no talent for it.
