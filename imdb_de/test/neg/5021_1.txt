"Inuyasha" was terrible. This show was unbelievably exaggerated, but this is nothing more than a boring bunch of anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and lifeless, the story is boring and endless. I think it could have been interesting if it was written better, but it seems that the authors of the series have more intentions to fight Inuyasha and his stupid friends with some monsters and then with Kikyou and Kagome and many circles around it Thing to cry. The script is cheesy and stupid and the animation is bad. The character design is very ugly. I do not know why everyone loves it, everyone has the same face! Big eyes, tiny noses, a line like the mouth and the typical anime haircuts. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and stupid. This must be one of the most overrated animation shows ever made.
