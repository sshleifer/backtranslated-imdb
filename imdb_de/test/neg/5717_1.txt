Corny and some really bad acting, but for a Golan Globe movie that is about the same level. I saw this movie in 1985 mainly because I liked sword and magic movies (what did I think of that?). Arnold plays a high lord and tries to ensure that an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world. Brigitte Nielsen is the title character who was Sly's girl at the time and a pretty bad actress for women who can not trade in B films on a low budget. Brigitte cooks it when Sonya and Arnold of wood act as Lord Kalidor. There is also Sandahl Bergman (who was Valeria in the original Conan movie). Here she plays the evil Queen Gedren, an obvious camp for her Conan role. And then one of the most irritating children actor (ernie reyes) as Prince Tarn, who would have had to be beaten and sent to bed. What an irritating abomination. Some of the sword fights are not that bad, but the music is really shitty. Special effects are cheap and look very 1970s, like the explosion of the castle of the evil queen at the height of the film. <br /> <br /> All in all a very low film, but film lovers may like it for its lack of action.
