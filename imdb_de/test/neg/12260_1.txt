I do not understand why this movie was released. It looked like something you show your comrades after borrowing their mother's handycam in 1987. I'm Australian and working for a video store in the UK and thought that this would be an Australian movie made it to our store, it can not be all bad ... boy, I was wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good commentary about this movie, they either lie or the creators of the movie. <br /> <br /> The picture was bad, the sound was terrible and the acting, oh the acting, it was the BADEST that played in the HISTORY OF THE FILM. <br /> <br /> It makes me feel embarrassed and insulted that they used the word "Aussie" in the title, because I'm proud to be Australian, and this movie can be seen in other countries and can be used by people give wrong idea. <br /> <br /> Please, those who read this and saw this movie should take the time to find other Australian films because you could choose one of them, and it would be better than this one. <br /> <br I could have made a better movie if I had taken a camera but filmed mine. But I ate the movie and waited for it to go through my body. Then I threw what came out on the TV, no insult. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!
