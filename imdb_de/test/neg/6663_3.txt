While traveling by train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​erroneously gets off in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. She notes earlier that a weird lonely dot soldier (Jim van der Woude) who does not speak her language is the only person in the area and that this was the last move on this route. The man houses them in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them. <br/> <br/> "De Wisselwachter" is an over-the-top boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere. I like Off-Hollywood movies, but this story is too absurd and has no message at the end. The sexual tension between the two main characters is funny at the moment, but too repetitive. I saw this movie in an old VHS and the picture is too dark; I do not know if on DVD the image of better quality would be. In the end I was absolutely disappointed in this feature. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The Man of the Line")
