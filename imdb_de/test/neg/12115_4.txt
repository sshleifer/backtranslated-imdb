A childish plot made a lame Hollywood movie, terrible acting, kitschy dialogue and not quite "falling" sex scenes. This is another great softcore parody! I really enjoyed this movie! Sure, the spectacle is terrible, but that part of the fun! The plot is ridiculous, but some things have to be sacrificed if the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. And because it's just softcore (no penetration), the sex scenes were a bit bland. But it's like the great god of soft-core dirt that Russ Meyers said, "Who really cares what goes under the waist?" I do not know if I agree with Mr. Meyers on this, but the hell ... the streak kept me talking for an hour and a half. I give a C +, it would be a solid B if they could look more girls out to look like Russ Meyer's actresses. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
