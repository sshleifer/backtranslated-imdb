Although the story is good and the depictions show what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization issues. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would therefore be very careful when buying a DVD of the film, without looking for the problem. <br /> <br /> I would also follow the recommended classifications of censors, especially with regard to language and drug use. <br /> <br /> This film could become a silent classic cops movie, and with the above warnings I can recommend it to potential viewers
