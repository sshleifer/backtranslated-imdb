* Warning: 1 tiny insufficient spoiler * You're right. This was not a bridge from Madison County. Once the lonely wife and Richard Gere checked into the big, empty hotel, it was a foregone conclusion that something fun would happen. The question is: how will it happen? The answer is a stupid story that is not worth going through. In a supposed bonding experience they get drunk and clean the cupboard of old cans. (That was my spoiler.) And the next day they put them back. LOL It was NOT all that arresting. I am an old married woman like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with Richard Gere. LOL. , , It had this advantage. You go away and go, oh brother. , , Even I could have written something more credible. I think my life is not as boring as I thought, if I could spit out a romance with Richard Gere. LOL! And this friend inherited this completely contemporary, probably computer-generated mansion, half of which rests in the sea, from her grandmother who had built it after the Civil War ??? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and this was WAY after the Civil War? And yes, where was the email? In which alternate universe do these people live? I never want to watch another movie that looks like we have no emails, no Facebook and no SMS. And OK, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to sending messages over the phone, but I do not ask you to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just falls into their lives without calling first.
