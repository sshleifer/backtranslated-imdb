While this film might be considered a good attempt at comedy, it's not what the previews made of it. The first half consists of typical Robin Williams stand-up material, though he really did not give many votes. he was always great at the one-liners and met the punchlines ... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program used in the choice. That's where Network 3 comes in ... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth told, and the evil company wants to silence her ** Spoiler ** Your friend even helps them, though not the case is painted ... this film could have been of political brilliance (perhaps with sorcering in the reign), but lacks a stew made by too many cooks
