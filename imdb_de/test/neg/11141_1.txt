This is an absolute drivel effect that should shake and tickle the mindset of the 60s. The drama is entirely made of wood and consists mainly of ad-libbing, which causes the sub-standard actors to dribble repeatedly the first thing they can imagine. <br /> <br /> The end result is that a poorly written piece is read by people who have no idea and do not care. The only exception is the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro), who spends the movie in nude stupor (either stoned or the only one in the play who can act!) Please do not think I do not understand Warhol - that's plain and simple a stinker who should never have made it out of film lessons.
