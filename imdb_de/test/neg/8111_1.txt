I have loved the novels and short stories of Stephen King for many years and, like most reviewers, have been repeatedly disappointed by the film's adaptations to his printed works. Some notable exceptions are Stand By Me from The Body, Carrie from the eponymous novel, and The Shawshank Redemption from Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption. This movie is by far the worst thing ever done with Stephen King's name. It's no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much broken all ties with it. I think the thing that worried me the worst about this poorly-placed, cheaply filmed and awfully disturbed piece of rubbish is that they had the audacity to COMPLETELY change the bottom line. !
