Personally, I have seen it because of Lea Thompson's performance and I did not really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly I saw him to the end. <br /> <br /> Honestly - it's just one of the saga-like stories and is not particularly original or entertaining, but strangely enough, it only keeps you on TV. My opinion on Will Of The Own would be much better if there was no point I just do not understand. <br /> <br /> There is a lovely and really delicate scene in which Lea Thompson's character runs The street that holds a baby in her arms, the snow falls, she is cold, scared and has no place to stay, she knows not what she should do next. And then, about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she leaves the same child without warning to begin the career she dreamed of. <br /> <br /> I just do not get it - I do not see how it's possible for her to do that, it was the opposite of everything she's done in her life so far, everything she did, aimed at the survival of this child. After this character flip, I just could not enjoy the rest of the movie.
