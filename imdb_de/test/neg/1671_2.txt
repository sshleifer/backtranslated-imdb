What a really moronic movie, all I can say is that the writer has to love magical mushrooms and LSD as this must be the result of one of his "travels". Okay, that's very weird, but hey, I'm sure in the end there's a perfectly good explanation for all this ... Just to be disappointed, um, no 'There is no explanation at all and the turn at the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the movie you probably have the same expression as if you were in a queue paying for your purchases, and the dealer told you that this will be $ 11.95. There are so many factors in this film that are not clear, and I think it leaves the viewer's imagination in a totally bizarre way. Do not get me wrong I like funny movies, 'The Cell' could easily be described as weird and twisted, but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie (despite the cast of J-Lo, whom I disliked the maximum, even that did not manage to influence my opinion). This is not one of those movies, and I think you should consider the characters of those who praise this movie. I can tell you that they are probably the kind of people who would go to an art exhibition, see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board, and say, "Oooooh, what a masterpiece, the artist has really come up with a unique way, the eternity "In fact, it's just bird droppings on a board. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, the last piece stays in the back of your mind. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading!
