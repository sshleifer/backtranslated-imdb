This is based on Michael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander performed well, but did not look like Michael. I have the feeling that Michael was portrayed as a stupid person I do not believe (although he sometimes trusted the wrong people). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when she made Michael look white. I think Latoya should be portrayed here, she was always portrayed with her brother in the 80s. I never thought that one of the side occupations looked like her colleagues. There were things that were inaccurate. Lisa-Marie Presley's son looked 4 in the wedding scene, though he was not yet two when Lisa and Michael got married. Even when Michael tells his mother Katherine that he and Debbie are to marry when she carries his child, it was Katherine's idea that the two marry.
