I'm sorry, but I can not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they found "Ethan Mao". I have seen a better acting, character and action development in porn! WARNING: I will give away a key element for the "plot". After Ethan has kept his family hostage overnight, he lets his vile, wicked, hated stepmother go to the bank - ALONE !!! - to get the jewel of his deceased mother, which he desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the police! Wow ... what a twist! I could not see that at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was that it lasted less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Pure, unadulterated garbage!
