I actually saw THE EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a double film in the early 1980s (I can not remember the other film) when I was in my midst. The movie is bad, damn bad. Embarrassingly bad. The effects are cruel (you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor). There is absolutely nothing scary about it. In fact, I laughed at the whole movie. <br /> <br /> History has been trying to make this big building a climax when we finally want to see who is responsible for all the evil, and we see the greasy Victor Buono, who is as scary as one overcrowded twinkie. Seriously, what did you think? Buono, a villain in the Batman TV series, is one of the most vicious actors ever seen on the big screen, and I just can not imagine anyone scared of him. The evil is almost forgotten now (for good reasons), but it's actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see that turkey again, just to see how this black girl got through with an invisible force with this very visible cable the room is being pulled.
