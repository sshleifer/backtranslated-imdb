It's easy to tell early in this movie what exactly will happen and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who is on vacation. This was done at the end of the ultra-nazi-seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra-American survivors and brunettes all deserved to die. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the others of the time, does it and the viewer knows that. There is no mystery or tension. People argue, but for the prejudices of the time, everything is so predictable, it's ridiculous. The five people encounter two wild young characters and go crazy. Everyone is crazy, so the director-writing team can justify his Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the guy attracts the blonde who really is not much to see and ignores a super hot brunette that would make any heterosexual man go crazy. It should be remembered that in the seventies films should appeal to women rather than men. <br /> <br /> Totally crap and totally depressing.
