Asia Argento has never made a movie (as far as I know, this includes the movie directed by her own dad Dario), in which she does not show all her anatomy at some point. Sure, in the most boring opening dialogue scene of all time, poor Madsen has her in his office and right there, reminding us that even though her hair is up, she can still stick her fingers in her crotch, but does in such a random "what "Do I really see that?" The DVD box, the packaging, makes this movie look like a Femme Fatale movie, so you're always waiting for it to turn into a sleek and minimalist killer. No such luck. She is verbose, hung up aging a lot, and worse, she has no credible physical flexibility skills. Her accented English would be cool if she did not just try to be as affected and talk like a 12-year-old. How about this plot? A feeble-minded but nymphomaniac woman is suddenly driven to kill while she's already having another affair and holding a cheap drug deal ... huh? What? Does anyone in this movie have the motivation to do anything other than buy a hamster? The script seems to be designed to keep everyone talking about the same things over and over again (I expected the worst to appear as a producer putting money in just to have some time on screen) - there are Nothing The obvious flaws of Asia's character, which deliver what the DVD cover promises at any point in the movie, are lost. She is weak ... but she knows how to kill. she hurls a lot. She hurls naked, she is half dressed, she even flings in the clothes of a dead woman. She is very limp and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would have been a great name for this movie ... and a take in which Asia was powerless would have been a better portrayal ... there are actually footage of their airplane eating !!! What is it about? <br /> <br /> The end makes 0 sense - everyone is just annoying in his intention and in the execution of all goals. The wife of Lester does not save a REAL REVENGE (bringing someone to Bad Karoeke is life threatening, but not really valid). Absolutely misleading key art ... yes, we know that Asia has lost the baby fat of their firstborn, but really, a whole movie that seems to be interesting enough to make a movie about a passively aggressive chick , It's not worth it. See point of no return instead.
