"Black Friday" has made this action so much better, which is why you remember it and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten potboiler. "Shed No Tears" was his working title and it would have been a better title as he was a thoroughly malicious character for most of the film. Philip Bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in traffic accident. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) was involved in some experimental animal surgery - she brought her back from the dead. His colleagues urge him to try his operation on Phillip, who has passed away. While operating, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, gets on the electric chair and there is a transmigration of the soul. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul of Panino. He is a changed person, he is rude to his family and starts to stay in Panino's old houses. He takes over Wolf's old gang - under the name of Philip Bennett, he's also Wolf's former girlfriend of romance - who smells a rat. Bennett, as Wolf, is determined to increase the score and begins to eliminate his enemies. Body, including the girlfriend and a police officer, rushing up, then his own family begins to fall victim to these "bad dream" movies - you always feel disappointed. This movie would have been better if he had stayed as Panino in the character and could have put a final shot. Eleanor, his fianc√©e, would have been sadder, but wiser with his brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, had a great career, especially in B movies. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
