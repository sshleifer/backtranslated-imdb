THE QUICKIE (1 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Pretty poor movie ... an old-fashioned story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit and pass on his empire to his incompetent son. Of course it will not be easy for someone in this job or job to just stop ... so a contract about his life will be over. After a big party, an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I suppose will * never * play anything but TV movies or low-budget direct-to-video trash) is called to the scene. Our "hero" makes a passport to her ... offers her big money for a "quickie" ... she declines his offer even though she needs the money ... but she still stays overnight anyway ... too after being brutally harassed by the overzealous son, who believes he was sent to kill his father. Pooh. The story goes on and on ... You can see every "turn" and "turn" a mile away. A funny soundtrack from a group called "The Tiger Lillies" will drive most people crazy ... but I thought there would be some kind of cool track towards the end. Or maybe I was just upset because I realized the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
