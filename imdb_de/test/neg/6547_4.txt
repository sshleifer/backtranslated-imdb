It was the first action movie that was banned in the Hollywood action style of the USSR. It's not even close to the Hollywood action films of that time. The plot is childish, the direction is so-so. This film was successful because it was his first time in Russia. Although I've seen it a lot, I have to admit that it was kind of naive and I did not like it. This is not the best example of a Russian action movie. This is just the first experience.
