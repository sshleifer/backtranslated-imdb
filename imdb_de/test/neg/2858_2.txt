I was really disappointed after seeing Pinocchio's revenge the other day. I had the good impression it was going to be bad, but I did not think it would be as bad as it turned out. A wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an attorney's eight-year-old daughter. From there it is a murderous way for all who are in the way between the doll and the little girl. We have already seen films like this, d. H. The Child's Play series, which by the way is far better. However, it was nice to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both have previously worked under Kevin Tenney. In any case, I encourage viewers to see "Night Of The Demons" and the original "Witchboard". These are titles that bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
