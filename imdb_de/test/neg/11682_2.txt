Hmmm, no patch on the original from Shaw Brothers. The fights are average and look very clunky. The plot is as expected from a 70s kung fu movie, confusing and stupid. Silly voices for women, with English accents for men baptized. I switched that off early and I love martial arts flicks. Get the original, it's so much better than this average movie, do not be fooled, I bought the wrong movie. I just started commenting, I only do foreign films and martial arts films. I hope you do not waste time seeing this, it's only for the fierce fans of the 70s Kung Fu.
