I'll repeat - what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there anything new inside? I do not know who wrote that. But I think this guy has seen all the Hollywood children's family movies ever made ... all the scenes and difficulties you can see everywhere. Why do you guys make these films? Children like adults? They like money-gold cars ... and they are positive? You are lucky ... and of course emotions ... without it being possible. o the young actors - wow :-). I like it when the camera focuses on their beautiful faces? What a crap ... there are 90% better children's films than this! This is not a creative or funny movie. That's just nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
