I start filming the movie first. If you take Abbott and Costello out of the cast, you have a badly colored film, stiff cardboard from the casting department, a poorly-synchronized sound (especially during song!), And annoying dialogues (such as the "Mr. Dinklepuss ") infinitum). Obviously, a studio hacker thought he could pay off on Disney's CLASSIC presentation of "Mickey and the Beanstalk," but the audience at the time was either gullible (unlikely) or in a dual feature (more likely). Even children should feel offended when shown this movie. A total amount of celluloid. Now to the play of Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott always played the straight man, and by all accounts the nicer person was on the set. On the radio, his character was usually the smooth, quick-spoken speaker, and he was especially jolly when he flooded the lines and corrected the mistakes due to his speed. In the movies he still plays the straight man, but is more of a cheater. Not that he is bad, but this character was perfectly played by Groucho Marx. The true travesty of the duo in the film is Lou Costello. He was funny again on the radio. He played a character a bit slower than Abbott, but not too much slower! He also had a sense of the lines and made me laugh if he complained about Abbott's mistake. In the movie, I do not know if it was his choice or not, but in the movies his character becomes a seedy personification of Stan Laurel, which in turn was made even more modest by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? He was funny on the radio when he was a smarta, but here he becomes a childish figure who looks like he's puking in every shot. This characterization is shown in every movie they do, and only affect the reputation they have had on the radio. What remains of her film career is a bad (very, very bad) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of roaming the stick casting.
