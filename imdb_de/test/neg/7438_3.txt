This movie is a good example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a good movie at any cost. Only with this movie is it a near miss. It seems to be all right for Robocop 2 to be a worthy successor to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (of course apart from the victims) returns and does its best. Too bad that a trite script and an incompetent director are neutralizing their efforts. Irvin Kershner could have been the ideal companion for George Lucas to lead the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner there is not much to ruin in Lucas' charmless film series. A worthy follower of a classic like Robocop would have needed either Paul Verhoeven or a director who had enough bubble to get himself a picture. Kershner does not know how to do anything (Lucas hired him for it) and he is certainly not Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> So what we get here is a movie that goes through all the steps to replicate the first movie, but without the freshness, humor or courage of the original. Kershner probably believed that he could outbid Verhoeven by more violence and unnecessary violence, but instead reveals how much he has done as a director instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's too bad, because everything was there to make this classic a classic. As mentioned earlier, the actors do their best, but Phill Tippet delivers groundbreaking stop-motion effects. The story of Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie, contains some great ideas. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to realize the full potential.
