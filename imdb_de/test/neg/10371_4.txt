*** SLIGHT SPOILERS *** This episode of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline slightly and implements some new elements. First, a new puppeteer is founded. Second, the puppets will be fine in this sequel. Finally, it also introduces some scifi / fantasy elements. <br /> <br /> A new tenant of the notorious Bay hotel, his girlfriend, her psychic friend and his psychic friend stumble over Andre Toulon's puppet suitcase. They also learn about a demon from another dimension, who blames Toulon for stealing the secret to animate the inanimate. So, Sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a bunch of godless creatures that look like earless gremlins. Then it's up to the puppet troop to take care of the interdimensional threat that tries to kill new friends there. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, this film is also characterized by continuity issues. How were the dolls put back in the trunk? How come that no one remembers the last bit of Killng in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why should a contractor work on a building with a history of mass murder? All these and many more questions are not answered ... never. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this film is acting. It's actually pretty good. The actors record it with an unusual enthusiasm, which is especially true for a series of full moon Nonames. Teresa Hill was particularly impressive, like the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was a bearable protagonist. But Cameron was too annoying for the stomach. Thank God, he dies before the end of the half. <br /> <br /> The dolls are there usual animated egos. With some improvements too. There the emotions (especially Jester) are much more human due to the sounds they have been given. Blade's Hiss, Pinhead's Grunts and Six-Shooter's Snicker have been improved and sound much better. The stop-motion animation is at best average, especially the totems. They do not seem to move as fluently as the previous part of the series. Even the Sutekh costume is absolutely out of reach. How should we be afraid of a creature that looks so humorous? <br /> <br /> The story seems to be a little sovereign for the show. I think Charlie Band wanted to focus on a younger population. The violence weakened in this film also seems to be the same. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that this movie can not stay with many people. It does not have the violence against Gorewhores. The language is a bit cleaner. However, it is too violent and too hard for the little ones. Therefore, the film receives low ratings. I have to say that the usual reviews are mostly fair.
