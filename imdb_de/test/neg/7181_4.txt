If this is Commander Hamilton's best movie, I'm not curious about the others. <br /> <br /> The best tools of a movie actor are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotions, he closes his eyelids for five or six seconds while his feelings behind them remain unknown. Lousy Acting Technique. <br /> <br /> Stormare sometimes also twitches when he fires a gun, turns his head away, and keeps his eyes together. Watch carefully. James Bond can easily rest in such a competition. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting supporting performances from other actors, but not enough to hang a whole movie. The cinematography looks good and makes the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara looks cold. Maybe Hamilton carries his own climate. <br /> <br /> Here are some good action sequences. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen is the villain who turns the hero into a big pill. James Bond's jokes may not be very good, but at least he does not look constipated all the time. <br /> <br /> A positive point for the movie is that the psychotic, distorted and vicious hatred of Guillou from Israel books has been left out. What is held is the adoration of a noble, heroic PLO he shows in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of dictator Khaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe, since Khaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years. And at the end of the film, Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will you use this gift? Hamilton does not care. <br /> <br /> We are a long way from "For Whom the Bell Tolls". <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books sell well worldwide, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, bleeeeaaahhhh.
