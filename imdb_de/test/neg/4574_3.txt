The year is still three weeks away, but if there's not a terrible turkey by then, Passion Of The Mind may be the winner of my worst movie of the year. An interesting idea that was poorly implemented. And badly acted in this regard. Demi Moore is very good at curling her lips and smoking cigarettes, but is that all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Did Ligitt and Myers or one of the other bad guys in nicotine invest some of their illegal profits in this production? It is confusing, stupid, and moves in the desperate past of an arthritic earthworm. I gave him a 3rd Should be a 2! <br /> <br />
