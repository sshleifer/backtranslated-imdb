This can be anything you need to know to decide if you want to see this. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes it seems to know that and makes fun of how bad it is. It adapts clichés to clichés and gets even worse as it involves a few moments that are bad enough to be funny. You could enjoy it. Otherwise, prepare yourself for serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
