Obviously tailored vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seems that the studios were hoping that he could play a tough cop and not look like he was forever 16 (he can not). The heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve Phillippe as bookends, but if they're not on the screen, Phillippe Flounder; His flat acting style has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical good policeman / bad cop from the late 20th century with a ridiculously predictable storyline and dialogue emerging from the 1970s TV cops, such as The Streets of San Francisco.

Statham's character announces that he has given up on nicotine and caffeine - something this film urgently needed. <br /> <br /> A truly memorable moment: Ryan Phillippe explains the Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It's just something I got on the way.
