I think if you like snowboarding, you can enjoy some beautiful scenery and some nice tricks. But that's all the movie has to offer. The plot does not exist, and jokes that may have been in the movie were not funny even on the sympathy level. I did not like the characters either, the lead actor (Adam Grimes) tried his best and for such a comedy that does not have to be much, but when surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope of doing well , But I should not be too hard on them, for all I know, that they could have great abilities, but with a script that I could have written in ten minutes, the skills they had were out of fear for that Hidden in this movie. My advice is not to look, I wish I had never done it!
