When Las Vegas came out, a review described this show as a "quote of a harmless louse." Needless to say, I think after seeing about a dozen episodes, this description is correct for the money. A selection of handsome boys and swirling model types play a series of thin paper stories, all the while trying to pretend they're serious business people. One-dimensional characters pursue one-dimensional stories in a one-dimensional environment. That sums up Vegas pretty well. I still occasionally check to see if the show is trying to develop and take something seriously, but unfortunately without success. So far.
