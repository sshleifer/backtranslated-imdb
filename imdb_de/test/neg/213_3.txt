OK, I thought the trailer was pretty good, so I was hopeful for this movie and besides, I was sure there were no less than 6 in my books. However, I was annoyed for half an hour in the story ... Especially where normal films are good, this film has reached its low point. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The guy everyone wants to help cares so much that other people hurt themselves in the middle of the hustle and bustle, that he addresses his colleagues to save a tramp, and then locks himself up in one of the armored trucks. Not only that, he is constantly trying to attract the attention of others, which causes him to put more people at risk and a long story short. The result is that he is responsible not only for the tramp's death, but also for a police officer who is shot and kidnapped by his younger brother ... oh and all 5 of his colleagues who died in shame. <br /> <br /> But in the end he's HAPPY because he came halfway to his senses. What if all of his colleagues were dead now instead of sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This movie tried to be so politically correct that I get sick! A good story ruined. It's a pity.
