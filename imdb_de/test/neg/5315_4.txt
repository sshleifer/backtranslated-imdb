In 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld made a film that was on the list of the best critics by the time the year's retrospectives were printed in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and there was lead star John Travolta his second big hit in the years after Pulp Fiction put him in front of the paparazzi's glasses. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on the Wise Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to break into the film business. On the one hand I was completely captivated by the different characters and the crisp dialogue of the original. When I heard that there would be a sequel, I seemed to forego my usual shudder when a studio tries to warm up a good idea over ten years later. The sequel, also based on a novel by Leonard, will be directed this time by F. Gary Gray, whose Italian job in 2003 was one of the highest-earning films of the year. With the cast now expanding with Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn, and James Woods, you've got all the makings to secure the success of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990s. This time we pick up as Chili (Travolta) leaves the movie business after being disappointed both by himself and by the industry for taking part in a sequel to his successful first film. To a lesser extent thanks to his friend Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune of his death, Chili decides to deal with the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This leads first to the famous Viper Club, where Chili meets the singing sensation of Linda Moon (Christina Milian), who can play songs like Whitney Houston (ie Whitney Houston) as the leader of a rising trio of sugar). Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn), who, with his all too obvious gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), wants to make sure that Linda meets the last five years of her contract, even if Chili is put on ice. With the future of Linda, Chili is an interesting network that includes a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), the Russian mob, the police, Aerosmith's vocalist Steven Tyler and a whole lot of angry weapon. Woo-Wheee! That sounds exciting. Why was not it? Be Cool tries too hard to be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has no heart and no soul. Instead, Be Cool feels as if it were staged by a producer of Saturday Night Live, as there are individual scenes or skits that do not span a whole movie. Take, for example, the scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, while Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced and should have landed on the floor of the cutting room. Instead, it's tied up between two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with every real boost. The Aerosmith concert and The Rock's journey to a shoe store are also prime examples of individual moments that in their entirety are not a great movie. But those are not the only issues with the sequel - which could probably be renamed Product Placement, with a lot of 2-way and Diet Pepsi's that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chili's serious looks. The story contains almost all imaginable stereotypes and everyone has just enough time to become offensive or embarrassing. Whether it's the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle type that has a movie poster with Sylvester Stallone's rhinestone on the wall - none of the characters offer us everything we've not seen often and in much better movies. After the magic of the first movie has almost disappeared, we end up with an inferior product, which is the second movie in the last six months (Ocean's 13 is the other) movie that no actor would have for a public audition. Be cool was a big disappointment. I wanted it to be the Get Shorty of the new millennium, and I ended up with a movie in which the outtakes must have been a gas, but the experience brought me with a stinker.
