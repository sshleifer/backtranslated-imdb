This is absolutely nothing with the WWF and the "Attitude Era" of the WWF. I have always been an avid WWF fan and have never looked at the competition. Well, I regret the day I wanted the WWF to take responsibility. At least the WCW would try something new and radical all the time, rather than pretending to mask the actual intentions of the show. This also applies to the ECW. The WWF was always about Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant and other old wrestlers, and the "Attitude Era" came only to the radical ideas of competition. The WWE is the same trash as before the Attitude era, which was just depressed and demoralized. The wrestlers are terrible, the separation of the brand is insane and the storylines and specifications are not available. The WWE is so bad that it is not even a former shell of itself, suddenly pushing characters and wrestlers into the main event and preserving creative barriers. Sure, the show shakes the brains of sweet, innocent and slightly brainwashed kids and meager, lousy, pariah, dumb people of the internet wrestling community who actually believe the company is good for everything. Anyone who shakes himself and rests on the idea that this show and this product are good, can go straight to hell.
