If this is the best thing in Finnish cinema at the moment, I would say that these huge tax dollars spent on supporting "culture" have been terribly wasted here. Paha Maa is the worst example of a Finnish "European movie" for a large audience. I'm sure they wanted everything to be state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time. The result is crap. <br /> <br /> In short: - The story is overbearing, naive and unbelievable. The same applies to the characters. I can imagine that they are brainstorming about a movie in which "everything goes to hell" and people get hurt and feel really bad because Finnish people are so notoriously depressed and feel themselves -estimated is so bad, "which causes us to ... <br /> <br /> - The film is full of stereotypes, mostly about" the Finnish mentality. "The way in which it deals with people's problems and circumventing their causes could come directly from a regular women's magazine or from a cheap Bull psychology self-help book. ("We feel so bad inside!") I'm sure they've seen some Kaurism√§ki to find out what People like his films, have completely misunderstood him and had a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of sex for no other artistic purpose than maybe S ozialpornographie. It's a crying shame they threw here in Tolstoy. It's just a sign to try to be smart. And not to be. <br /> <br /> - I think the worst mistake, however, is the total lack of foresight and depth. The film is highly unoriginal. It is also frustrating to watch endless pouting and suffering without real revelation. I can go through this kind of mind if the movie is funny or a complicated joke or, better still, something sublime like in from Trier's Breaking the Waves. There were none of these in Paha Maa, in fact, at some point I started to laugh because the turn of events was too predictable, exaggerated and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Who does this crap? And who likes that? I hope you pretend.
