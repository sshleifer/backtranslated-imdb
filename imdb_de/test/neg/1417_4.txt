I saw a movie show last night. I had high expectations, but I was definitely disappointed. Within five minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. He becomes president for the first 40 minutes. So there is all this aspect of the film. The first half hour is funny. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. It is less a comedy and more of a thriller / drama / love story ... which is pointless. The movie is nowhere to go and stays a good 30 minutes. Here and there something laughs, but the consistently funny part is at the beginning and only the beginning. At one point, the biggest cheer I heard in the audience was when a person in the crowd shouted "Booooo" during a very confusing emotional scene. Williams offers a great performance that matches his comedic style. Walken also plays a strong supporting role, as only he can. I think the only character underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, it's funny to see him downgrading to a PG-13 rating. Overall, I would not pay the movie. After all, I saw it for free and even I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid and from there it goes downhill. The movie does not really fit into a category. Halfway through the movie, it's no more than a one-hour comedy specialty. 4.5 / 10
