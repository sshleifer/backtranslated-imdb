Perhaps the worst of the "Nemesis" movies (and that says a lot!), This mess contains so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you've seen both, even if you've just endured that entry. Even worse are two insane cyborgs that have absolutely no entertainment value. In other words, they fit in perfectly with this endlessly boring film mistake.
