Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a rip-off of "Roseanne"? Just look at the characters from the two families Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba). the blonde older bombshell (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) married to an idiot (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart) and the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And then, of course, the biggest similarity is Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough love-mother, without giving her the same endearing features that Roseanne had. Or they may have made them too gentle, because Reba Hart seems to waver between being mean and timid (hence Van's line to his wife Cheyenne: "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And cute and worry with little transition in between. Roseanne at least managed to understand that she was cruel to be friendly, because she was always mean and sarcastic and whenever she tried to open it was hard for her. As volatile as Reba's character is, it's hard to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters were not completely demolished by "Roseanne", nothing could have saved the show from being subordinate to the plot area. The authors try to give substance to the show, but they really can not take those stupid jokes off long enough to be effective. And you better believe that the jokes are crazy. It's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks every joke is funny. Occasionally they come out with something weird (I'm not saying I did not laugh about a few episodes), but these gems are too few and far apart to make "Reba" funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious prints of "Roseanne", subpar plots and sub-sub-par humor. The show could be a bit better if it replaces all the actors, especially Reba herself, who has more community-theater quality than primary-time sitcom quality. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10 points just to make good jokes.
