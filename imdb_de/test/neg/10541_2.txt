Yes, a long time ago it became a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Well, it's more like an airport mixed up with a junior high school, but there are a lot of men running around in orange overalls, so I think it's like a jail. Not really. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is sent to prison, he stands in a row and moves to another line so he can talk to his friend as if he's at the security checkpoint at the airport. Then, too long, he and his friend throw punches and smack around with a few security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. If you attack a corrections officer in a federal prison, you will be shot on the spot. Yes, Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he hit his second shot. Oh, and there are people wearing hats and bandanas, and so on. In prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> At most high schools in America you can not dress like that. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ja Rule, I must say that the person who has probably enjoyed his performance More than anyone else in the world, including Ja Rule himself, had to be 50 cents. Just before I saw this movie, I saw one of those shows on television about the biggest celebrity feuds of all time, and like number 7 or 8, that rivalry between fifty cents that had really lived the bat life, and Ja Rule. Who Did not Have Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could imagine was that 50 Cent laughed his ass. Ja Rule looks like an unpredictable nine-year-old every time he appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, return to the overview. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover. He agrees to be sentenced to prison for him to get behind the criminal organization. He was sentenced to five years, and this old line between determination and stupidity disappears immediately. After that, nothing else is important in the film, it becomes a meaningless sequence of action sequences, most of which are not even well choreographed. Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of "New Alcatraz" in one place, accidentally freeing all inmates. And what do you do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without as much as a basket. They had a ball, but that does not matter. The scene is so stupid that they might as well have played hopscotch. <br /> <br /> So, a guy is sentenced to the first person ever executed in Alcatraz 'State of the Art execution chamber, apparently not for stealing $ 200 million in gold, but not telling where he's hiding was after he was caught. <br /> <br /> Hey, good thinking, people. If you do not get any information from someone, kill them. This is a great way to know the truth! So a gang breaks into prison planning to stop the execution and get the place of $ 200 million for itself. Oh, and the $ 200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they have thought in advance how difficult it could be to turn that currency into an exchangeable currency. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of the guard in jail. He's a tough Vato who thinks he's a hardcore cholo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I once saw this comedian talking about people in California who all talk harshly when they call each other and their homes and all sorts of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, says the comedian, and they say, "Oh my God, people live there, it's like a total hut!" <br /> <br /> Best of all, when the United States Supreme Court Justice comes and this man tells her that her men can not carry their rifles in his jail: "I do not care if she's a colonel Court of the United States is! " This woman could crush him like a grape and he believes he is responsible. Ha. <br /> <br /> And by the way, the judge of the Supreme Court, taken hostage in the movie, tells the bad guy she's 53. This is one year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene in the movie is in prison, where Ja Rule is beaten in jail like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian girl. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I work for the company that made this film (which is why I looked at it) and I still have nothing positive to say except, of course, for this one scene in which Yes, Rule was beaten up by this Asian girl. <br /> <br /> So read my review of Malena and you'll do it As much as I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, Ebert wrote something in his review of this movie that I agreed with as well as Anything else he has ever written: At the MPAA, they congratulated themselves on a good day at work when they rated "Half Past Dead" PG-13 after giving an "R" to the anti-gun movie "Bowling for Columbine." , "<br /> <br /> Way to go guys
