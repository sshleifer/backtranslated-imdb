I saw this selfish "effort" to achieve a movie with "epic" status in the company of several native Russian family members. Five people have given five different reactions, from Mikhalkov's worship to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of "Canal +" money, some of it in his (and other) bags and handed the project over to a number of film students. I counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. It is impossible for the same director to be responsible for these different scenes. Compare these for yourself: <br /> <br /> · Cadets who polish shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · Station scene (farewell to Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panoramic shots. <br /> <br /> · Ormond speaks through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · First try on the Grand Duke and later tracking of scenes so Andrei sings again in Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing Sequence <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than Superman. Later she learns of his transfer and comes in a minute through Moscow to say goodbye to Andrei. <br /> <br /> The Russian natives felt the impression of Russian life as a "caricature" and not as a story. They called it "tourist postcard" Russia. <br /> <br /> They were all proud that a Russian director / producer / fixer managed to break into the "big time" and waste over $ 30 million on others people's money while you might Slightly stick in the local bags during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to think, you've seen Russia watch this movie. Have a coffee before you go.
