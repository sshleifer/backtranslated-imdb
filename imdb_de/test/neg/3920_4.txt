Cheap, badly traded and unimaginatively judged, Flight to Mars is still entertaining, even if it runs against Mars. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three elderly gentleman, Cameron Mitchell as a newspaper man and a scientist / obvious love interest) who "man" the ship. The spaceship arrives there and finds that there are very human-like Martians living there, making technological advances that would make the earth blush, but in the subterranean cities of Martians (here some caves and some rooms), not everything is rosy. The Martians are a dying planet, and one faction wants the earthlings to just repair the ship at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on Earth, and another faction wants to talk about peace and see if they can not land convince them to give them a living space. The special effects are quite lame, even for 50-year sci-fi standards, with a slow-moving rocket ship, pastel / neon alien garment, in which the women wear shorts that would blush many (except men, of course), and a little less is offered. Cameron Mitchell is a journalist and sympathetic, if not different. Ite Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts, but adds little spectacle. The rest of the cast consists of some older science fiction veterans like Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum doing their job. This is not a first-class science fiction film from the Golden Age, but it is very good to see and pulls out quickly.
