I was not very excited to even see this movie, but a group of us decided to see it on the opening night. I wanted to get up and go out and try to get my money back in this movie after 20 minutes. I found the movie very boring, uninteresting, and in many ways, including "gaming," not true. I tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie when I saw one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was scarier than this movie. The sad attempt to drag a gothic girl, a retired businessman, a 15-year-old geek and a random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad act. Then they try to bring in a very horrible love scene in which the main character kisses another girl after rescuing her 10 minutes after the murder of his girlfriend. The theater was fully occupied when the movie came to an end. Slightly more than half of the people had left before the end of the film. If you feel like spending only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... get ready to be cheated.
