Ignore the extreme voices about "House of Wax", never a "1" or a "10". I will try to help those who are thinking of seeing "House of Wax" or those who have seen it on the basis of the devotee and feel betrayed. The trailer makes this movie look very promising what trailer should do. There is only one thing about trailers: if the producers can not put together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it's a pretty sure thing that the movie is a heavy celebration. But a good trailer just tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you any idea of ​​the overall package. Here a little research can be valuable. <br /> <br /> "House of Wax" plays Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to her Canadian compatriot Sarah Polley or her hopeless Rose McGowen) and was led by a previously known music video artist as Jaume in his feature film debut , These are not good signs, but if you're like me, ignore them and watch the work of production designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of Ghost Ship. Once again, Walken's work is so eye-catching that it looks like 90% of the movie's $ 30 million budget is spent on production design. The remainder went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she had to endure throughout the film (fingers cut off, lips taped, tied and much teased). Incidentally, Cuthbert looks much heavier than in "The Girl Next Door", about a big pig, who has no weight problem. Which means they have little left over to pay the rest of the cast and the crew. And judging by what was on screen could actually be true. It looks like everyone else has donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Whether inexperience or jealousy because of the wage differences, the contributions of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are unfortunately less than zero. Inexperienced Steven Window DP work was about as horrible as you are likely to see and work in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert "Pearl Harbor" here), they manage to get the most of the To take away added value from the production design group. Instead of watching the sets, Window filmed those things in low-light conditions and a jerky zoom camera. Negran compounded the problem with a crazy number of confusing cuts. Bad light, an ADD-like camera and flood cutting are what you use to hide cheap and shitty production design. Not what is needed when the film is the only strength of the film are its expensive and detailed sets. Chan Hayes wrote the script, and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is called author, except for the title and the use of wax figures, there is absolutely no similarity. One salvation is that the film does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parodied (insert "Van Helsing" here). The murders are laughable, too extreme to be eerie or even uncanny for anyone over six years old. The audience was particularly nervous when a high-profile hotel owner made her home-like face rummage with a steel bar, even though her earlier half-baked striptease was the only really scary thing in the movie. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert put his finger through a grid and was cut off from the evil. <br /> <br /> The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a wax museum that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, twins, and plenty of roadkill (where Cuthbert can bathe). All of this is said to be happening somewhere in rural Florida, though it certainly looks like Paul Hogan's land from the many hills (attention-grabbers - the Gulf Coast is not known for its hilly terrain). The script was supposed to show the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or in post-production most of the dialogue that concerned this was cut off. Since what's left over the double connection makes no sense and leads nowhere, you wonder why not even the boredom has been reduced to a minimum Heads who realize in the middle of production that they had the ingredients for a first-class horror classic - even with the existing cast. What she saw in their faces was the chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a wax city. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is naturally close to nature and almost invariably an illusion of reality. Here they had the ready opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the city creates the illusion of reality from afar, but reveals itself as a very stylized wax production up close. Of course, they would have needed to find a visionary director and a DP to bring it to a successful conclusion, but everything else was there to do that.
