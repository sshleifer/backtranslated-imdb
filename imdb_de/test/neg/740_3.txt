(This could have a spoiler.) <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was okay. The music was good and I wanted to forgive this bizarre dream sequence, but the lack of looks in the main character and all the other characters did not interest me in the rest of the movie. (I know, completely vain.) The music in the beginning was spirited and fitting, I thought for a pliable gothic novel. But come on! Saxophone music for a movie from the early 19th century? It absolutely did not fit. This movie was totally boring and if you want to see a good historical movie or an austen then do not hire Northanger Abbey! I give 30%. 30% = a faulty grade!
