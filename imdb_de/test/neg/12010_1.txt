Did the first travesty really make money? This is another sequel (according to the ideas of OTHER STAKEOUT) that nobody has asked for. But we got it anyway. The sequel, like its predecessor, is completely brain dead. It's also pretty disgusting (do you remember the dinner scene?) To think that I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck, and Warden. Did you need the money that much?
