This is one of those films with great potential. Brilliant actor, a debut of a very interesting director and a haunting "survivor" plot. <br /> <br /> But it does not work at all: The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of the Namibian desert is also evident in the images as a merciless environment. And then there is the acting. Quite alright. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts". <br /> <br /> Then the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Novels Bohringer. And the plot. Why on earth is Levring choosing Lear for his game? The whole idea of ​​making Shakespeare articulate her despair and inner longings does not work. It seems to be a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies are due to the choice of "Lear". You just have to fit into the script of Levring and Oscar winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And the sex. It takes about three days, then more or less all the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easy way out if you need a crisis in a conspiracy. Janet McTeer's part is completely different, mainly because of this ridiculous idea. The sex drops the action immediately. Instead, they could have focused on the dialogue. There must have been a conversation between all the characters, but we mostly see them talking in smaller groups. However, her conversation is as dead as "Lear" and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The King Is Alive" is still not the worst Danish Dogme '95 movie. But compared to Lone Scherfig's recent "Dogge '95" films "Italiensk for begyndere", this one fails very well here. It is not a good movie. It's a bad one. But it is beautiful.
