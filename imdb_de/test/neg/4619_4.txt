This is not a great movie. The film is a cliché, and in many places it's a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels to the original film are striking, but with the added improbability that the telekenetic forces are innate. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I did not like the movie because it went by at least a few hours ... But these were accepted as if you were reading a modest book on a long train journey. This book would not be great literature, but would record one for a while and be forgotten shortly thereafter, as it fits in with the many other cliché books. Also, the movie was fine as long as it lasted but may be forgotten. At least that's what I think. I can not remember much now !!
