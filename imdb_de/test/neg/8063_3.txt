I bought this thing that was used in a "clearance bin" of a video game store. I wanted to have this guilty feeling when I observed that something too warning is too intense to observe; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty when I see a "Forbidden Movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox does not work because it's so clumsy and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show the "shocking" stitches, chops, slices - you only see the consequences. (They show a chest hook in detail). The special effects are just fine. Nothing here that tells you anything about violence is real. The "cannibals" are obviously poor people from Central / South America, disguised as savages of the jungle and commanded to be mean. These people were obviously in the picture to get some money or food or both. Again ... just not convincing. <br /> <br /> As everyone else has said, there are some real killings of animals here. That's the extent of realism. For me it was more shocking than any gutting, scalp hacking or castration, and even then the dead of animals are not that bloody - maybe just sad.
