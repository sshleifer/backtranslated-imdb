After looking at it for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. It's a clich√© movie with a stupid setup. I'm a big fan of thief movies, but this one does not deliver anything new, smart or special. It's about an insider raid that went bad, because "hot head-bad guy" gets an ass and of course "do goody-bad guy" goes on a moral journey. The reason why it is stupid and not believable is. If you've gone so far as to kill a bum, why not just kill the one standing between you and 43 million. They had forty-five minutes to save the money and stage a robbery that no one in their minds hesitated to shoot Mr. Do Goody. In that case, he's a guy they've known for a few days ... I sped forward from the middle, but I repressed it and boy, I regret it
