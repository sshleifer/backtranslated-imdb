I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but I was sent away because I heard the movie was a stinker. It is. Fowles wrote the script and I could follow it well, even though I read the novel over thirty years ago. The soundtrack is abominable - shocking, jangling and totally inappropriate - breaks any attempt at riddles or mood in the movie. I suspect that the director has a lot to blame for, as even Michael Caine is terrible and he did some excellent work in ALFIE a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> The one from the book is not translated well on the screen. I would like to see someone doing this remake.
