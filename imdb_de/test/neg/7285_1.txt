I'm sorry to say that, but I did not enjoy this movie at all. It was just too boring. So boring that I could not see the rest. It's not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate those stupid days because those days are not what they used to be. The movies that Disney recently released are really shit! I miss the old days when they produced good movies like The Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really terrible. I did my best to be interested in this movie, but I just could not. I do not think I can recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones I mentioned above.
