Like the two previous "Mad Max" films, "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" is no exception to violence and strange conspiracy. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he has to destroy the master blaster and make the kids "tomorrow's land". This is generally a spoiled movie with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane pigs and odd characters. I was very bored to see everything, and it offered me nothing. I did not feel inspired after watching this movie. The only decent thing about this film was the extremely strange characters that appeared in different ways throughout the movie. It's too funny for me and it was way too boring.
