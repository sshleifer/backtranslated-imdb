This movie was horrible ... How can anyone even believe that this movie was like the "good old days" when Tim Thomerson was not even there. And to make matters worse, they used excerpts from old Trancer films. That's just awful. NO Trancer movie is complete without Tim Thomerson. I love fullmoon movies and I have been watching them since I was 4 years old. I went through everything they did, and this movie almost made me lose it. Now I have a few lines to fill, so I'll keep going. Her way of breeding new trance is completely stupid and sending Jack back in time. What happened to the TCL chamber? And finally! What happened at the end of Trancers 5, where Lina says and I quote, "Jack gave me something special" AND she and other broad eyes on her stomach. I do not know ... maybe there's a BABY in there. There were so many other places to go but full moon S'd the bed
