This movie has no storyline, no good acting, frankly, it has nothing, the same songs are always playing terrible acting and if you actually sit there and see the whole thing and enjoy it, something is wrong with you. I wish I could award this 0 out of 10, but I can not, so it must be a 1 that is generous! ice-t is not even a good rapper and worse in acting, every part of the movie is garbage, I got this movie on DVD, not knowing what he had for Â£ 1.99, and thought I would have made a bargain. I then looked at the IMDb review and did not consider it, but after seeing it, I realized that the DVD I bought was a complete waste of time, money, and electricity. If you have this movie, you can sell it to two people who do not know about it or burn it!
