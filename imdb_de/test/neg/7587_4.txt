I generally do not value easy attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita no perd el Tren" can not do very well for me. The story is good: a middle-aged woman, who still looks good, finds a new love. The attempts to make this movie as a romantic comedy, but were only occasionally a little strange. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has cleverly demonstrated that she is a serious actress in shows like "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv) and "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra" can from Kant "(qv) and" El Embrujo de Shanghai "(qv), but the powers they have had over the years have given her a lot of triviality, both for cinema and for television one of José Coronado's saying: absolutely capable of delivering serious achievements, María Barranco certainly belongs in this grouping. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I had the feeling that I would be really happy if I had a new development seeing this movie in a serious tone would allow the actors to really show their performing abilities.The strange thing is that it should be made with the same lead actors.Wanted talent in a pretty stupid movie that indeed is very promising could be.
