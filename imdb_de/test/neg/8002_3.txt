Mockney is coming to Brighton. Despite a poor reception in the British press and state-funded British cinema, it was more likely that we would get something from Graham Greene's filthy, hard-nosed London-by-the-Sea /> <br /> It does not strive first. Characters who come directly from their clone and crimp followers reproduce the Guy Ritchie types. The format is more like a British television series than a movie (Brighton is a goldmine in the background, wasted with plastic work in the studio). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in search of a good performance from Famke Janssen ... She's a little smart for this company, and her brand of insensitivity on big screens is more likely to be blockbusters like Deep Rising , As far as acting is concerned (even a role!), The search continues. Circus is boring. 3.10
