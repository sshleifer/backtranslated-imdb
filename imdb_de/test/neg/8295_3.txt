Some of the secondary actors are really trying. And camera shots in the desert are very nice. Otherwise this movie is awful. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character Harvey is an amateur scriptwriter. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes a psychiatric institution. Is the point of this movie that amateur scriptwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do everything in his power to read his script and turn it into a movie, even if it means taking a film crew hostage. Make amateur scriptwriters ... Grovel? Maybe they will. <br /> <br /> The setup of the movie is way too long. We only get far into the second half to the point of history. The first half darts and flutters between different characters. <br /> <br /> "Shoot or Be Shot" is touted as a comedy but I thought it was weird. Dialog does not contain a subtext. None of the characters believes as real people. It's all stick figures doing "action" in a way that resembles comic characters. In fact, the film is basically an adult cartoon: stupid, crazy, crazy. I can understand why some actors are in this movie. They need the money or the commitment. But what do insiders do that Shatner and Harry Hamlin do here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is that the best he can do? Is Hamlin so desperate for money? He was once a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Even though the story is a satire, it's more like a horror of amateur scriptwriters. Maybe that was not the intention. But that's the way the movie can be interpreted. As such, the script was very, very poorly written.
