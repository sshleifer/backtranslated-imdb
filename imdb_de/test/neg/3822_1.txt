Any horror movie that employs Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) And kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits should immediately be viewed with suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a drunken guide (by the way, his James Earl Jones voice is hysterical, I do not know if he wants to be funny, but I laughed about it). Unfortunately, his role was also every five minutes. Other reasons for suspicion and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony from Buffy & Angel, I had to look her up to see what I remember, but she's going to be half naked!), Marcus The Noteboo (Not Another Teen Movie) fills up a comedy role that is really not needed in a horror movie, unless it's meant as a parody. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (brother of Bill Murray & Pete from Dharma) & Greg plays Shapiro, the guy who shoots the gonzo video with the two cute girls. On a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour," the two male protagonists meet with several other people who walk on stones and have to leave the boat. So now they are all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain. <br /> <br /> After the real story of Victor Crowley was told (his makeup looked like Sloth of The Goonies), we found out that he is dead (Well, you do not come back when you're dating After the old man was attacked, even though Mary has pulled her gun and has a clear shot, it takes more than 30 seconds before Marybeth actually shoots at a man who chops an old man with a hatchet apart. Is she stupid? That's 29 seconds too long! In terms of the plot, there is really no (I do not classify undead psychos as an action, sorry) and the tempo is really bad too. You've got a murder, some of them have run away, some light relief, then some slow dialogues before you start the cycle again. After an extremely long scene examining a rickety bush with a raccoon in it, Victor appears (with some kind of power tool) and kills the dark-haired porn girl, he also manages to cut the guide in half with a shovel ? Once Misty stays on her own to look for Ben, I feel it was obvious she would be the next to die (I was right, but you can not see it). <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Rain does NOT extinguish burning gas, OK? Idiots! Obviously Marcus was close to death after the two near misses in the cemetery and Ben was injured with the thorn on his foot, but they managed to find a boat after impaling Victor on the thorn. <br /> <br /> Water from something unseen, he tries to save her, then suddenly Victor pulls her into the boat and screams and the movie ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Yes, just like that. No idea if Ben was dead (he seemed to miss an arm) and no idea if Marybeth would survive and what happened to Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible end and no doubt my verbal attack on the filmmakers has erased the last review. So much for the freedom of expression, how?
