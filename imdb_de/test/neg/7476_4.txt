Again, we get a mix of themes well covered in so many previous films. The good and the bad son story, courtesy East of Eden. The American naval hero story, which does not consider itself one because of their knowledge. And the grieving woman who may fall in love with another man's story. The fact that these stories are omnipresent is not a big problem. Because theoretically they could still be better represented and treated. This time, however, no luck, since all three threads ultimately remain the same. <br /> <br /> Since the evil son can never really speak to his father, the conflict is never properly resolved. Apart from the father, who began to appreciate the evil son thanks to his renovation of the kitchen of the grieving woman. Well, how satisfying is that. <br /> <br /> Next, the surprisingly returning Marine who suspects his wife of the infidelity conflict is never resolved. Because he never really speaks with the man under suspicion, namely with his own brother. So we have another easy end here. <br /> <br /> And finally, the hypocrisy theme of American military heredity, in which the Navy is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirty war, he should not actually be referred to as one of his own standards, the third issue it will be alright Because the movie ends right when he can talk to his wife for the first time about what he's been through. Where the real story would actually start at this point, namely his recovery process, what it would look like and how he would finally face the family for which he had big blame. All this, all the really interesting parts are ignored and ignored. <br /> <br /> Although the film is worth knowing, it is serious, and I mean seriously, disappointment, I would still give it points for the impressive cast. Although no film should use Maguire for a voice-over, because that belongs to Spiderman. Above all, an adult Gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he has awakened as a young and aspiring actor. So much so that I really would like to entrust him with a really deep and demanding lead role of the right profile. <br /> <br /> Although the cast really seems to do what they can, I consider this movie to be totally forgotten. A flat and ultimately overbearing, completely unsatisfactory tear press. Message du jour to the writers: We already know the wounds, see the host of Vietnam films. They want to earn something, show us a credible healing.
