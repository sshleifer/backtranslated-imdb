This series takes a classic story and makes it garbage. Robin is somehow confused by an elk man in the forest and is involved with all sorts of Druidry and almost satanic episodes. History is more about avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. That's hard to see. And to top it all off, they kill Robin at the end of the second series and replace him with another actor. Some people may like this show as a fantasy show, but it's NOT a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight Prince John and the sheriff in Prince Richard's name, and if you want Robin to feed the poor and oppressed, check out the classic series or the latest from the BBC.
