It really surprised me that someone needed so much time to judge such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had something true. The Partisan "AF" was launched in 1943 when two communist pilots of the Croatian Ustashi AF and their observers defected in Breguet 19 and Potez 33. The plane saw some action in the fight against bombs and bombing, but did not last long. One crew was killed and the other survived. The pilot was later killed flying with a Spitfire Vc. The real partisan squadrons were formed when the RAF separated two of their (Yugoslav) squadrons Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc, which were occupied by pilots of the former Yugoslav Air Force, and they provided Tito's troops on the island of Vis. Even these were never active in air-to-air activity, but exclusively for ground support. So the movie was a huge cow dung, to say the least, and the lowest point for his otherwise not so bad director. At some point in the filming of the film's final sequence, I witnessed dozens of German aircraft being destroyed at the Mostar military airfield (Yugoslav 522 coaches also used in the flight sequences). The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scotch, which was elaborately served by the film crew, was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie that was often joked by contemporary audiences.
