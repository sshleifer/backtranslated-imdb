Wow, that's really stereotypical, terrible garbage. I'm sorry for anyone who wasted their money to see this. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I did not laugh during the entire movie. I just can not believe they would do such a horrible movie br /> <br /> I'll be more careful now when I see late night movies. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I'm not saying that it's the worst movie there is (though it could be), but I do not think I saw anything so stupid and unpleasant in my life. It makes the Scary Movie series intelligent. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would give it a 0 if she would let me
