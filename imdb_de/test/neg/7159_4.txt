This transfigured Discovery Channel documentary, part of the biblical study, part of the treasure hunt, all abused, is well anchored on television, but turns out to be a feature film. At the first glance at the cheesy-looking cover art you can raise doubts about the integrity of this serious topic. This is shown in the first case, in which the search for Jesus' tomb is referred to a generic action script that looks more like National Treasure or Tomb Raider than after informed debate and investigation into the historic tomb. This is the devious way in which the whole process turns. <br /> <br /> A more curious child than a worthy explorer, Simcha Jacobovici's explorations have a timid effect on himself while his research is manipulative. With all the fascinating revelations that this filmmaker tries to convey to audiences through supposed evidence, a flood of repeated testimonies that repeat the same research and insights over and over again prove that Jesus' lost tomb has very little information to support the bloated when also offers enchanting statements. What this means is a very frustrating attempt to knock the audience over the head with the same little factual evidence to support the authenticity of this tomb, which ironically distracts it. While many of these mini-coffins have been tirelessly linked to support the theory of Jesus of Nazareth, this research abandons a well-rounded approach to continuously pursue the unique obsession of this romanticized archaeologist. There may be impressive facts that help shed light on many of the traditional dogmatic beliefs that were essentially held by Christians, but essentially the project only worked as a scapegoat that was funded at one time, as the Da Vinci Code everything was the rage. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cheesy cover art was right. Despite my appreciation for the documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus picks up on an ever-interesting subject and transforms it into an overlong and unparalleled geriatric adventure hunt that replaces the uninspired motivations behind this team with all relevance and sanctity. By the time these tomb robbers have completed their explorations because they are reluctant to cease research due to social demands, viewers feel as though the director were trying to set this mystery, whether it was there at first or not. There are some really powerful moments in which the halls of history unobtrusively march through this documentary, but all the decoding, explorations, and theorizing of the world left this misguided vanity in an unpleasant, apathetic response.
