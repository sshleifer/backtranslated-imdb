This movie is not even good enough for the $ 1 container in the supermarket. <br /> <br /> I only bought it because Terrence Howard was there. I think he could not be too picky at this time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was hard to sit through. It seemed they were reaching for straws with an act. The "boys evening" had to be the most boring one I've ever seen. In a minute they talk and the next one recites poems? Even the arguments were hard to follow. Most actors lacked any depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they were doing with this one, but they certainly missed the mark.
