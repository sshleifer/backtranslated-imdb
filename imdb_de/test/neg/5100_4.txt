River Queen tries to pack a complicated, comprehensive historical narrative in less than two hours. There are some breathtaking fighting scenes and the Wanganui scenery is beautifully captured. However, the film suffered from some bad evidence - especially Samantha Morton (Sarah) did not look convincing. There seemed to be an indecision about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif thrown by fate, or as a strong, determined character with a clear view of her destiny. Kiefer Sutherland's character - Private Doyle - seemed pointless and largely incomprehensible. Keifer's Irish Brog needs a little polishing. Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (as Sarah's son "Boy") were round and believable. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of River Queen seemed particularly compressed and rushed. It seemed like they had decided that they had to tie all the loose ends 120 minutes ago. For example, How in the world did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I was open with this movie. I had not read or heard much besides the problematic production. What I experienced was a mish-mash of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed, but ultimately disappointing.
