The comments left for this show are much funnier than the show itself and they are all true. I feel the same way as I am very disappointed with how far Rick Mercer has fallen when he did great things for 22 minutes at This Hour Has, but now he's just clowning around, going places and talking to people. He's doing some stuff in the studio about things going on in the news, but they're never funny, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. The biggest part of his show is that he goes somewhere to talk to people, for example he goes to a rodeo this week and the video pieces make everyone funny faces and act scared of the wild horses etc. He used to be funny since leaving This hour has become 22 minutes less funny and the show is no longer funny. Now that Air Farce is out of the air (thank god, thank God!), Mercer and that hour has 22 minutes for the ax, just old, predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny anymore. It's really sad to think that Rick Mercer was the funniest man on Canadian television!
