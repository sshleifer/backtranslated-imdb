The story is quite vivid, but for the readers quite decent and reasonably interesting. The movie was absolutely terrible. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. I cried all the time because I knew I could never get my time back. Do not see this movie If so, bring a pistol with a bullet and some bullets when you go out with friends. I'm sorry for everyone involved with this movie. I am also sorry for all who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. If your mother forces you to watch, kill her. Hahahahaha! See! I am now a psycho !!!! IKWTCBS has turned me into a psycho !!!!
