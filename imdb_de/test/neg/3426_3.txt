A very highly played, smooth, unconventional reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> You got into the topic, "because it's modern, it has to be played up, smooth, etc." trap. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" has made this idea much more successful, but I really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes (Time vs. Nervous Film). <br /> <Just because this is a "modern" retelling does not mean the movie must look like a magazine ad or something to do with drugs or weapons. <br /> <br /> If the cuts were so Macbeth would be a much more powerful movie. Read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary a few questions. Skip the movie. Or not, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> Excuse the super long review. IMDb forced me to.
