When does a movie get so bad that it's good? Darkhunters captivates with its fearlessness and is a shining example of the cinematography of C ** P. It alone deserves some kind of prize. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the age-old battle of heaven and hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest differently as a flock of cats, a hooded Grim Reaper character with a face of flickering flames resembling an electric coal fire, a Philip Marlowe-like with a serious bath manicure and a psychologist who seems to be released from Kwik-Save on the day. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are fighting for the soul of a recently deceased teacher who walks through most of the film in a foggy field and, strangely enough, a boarding kennel in an attempt to escape his pursuers. <br /> <br /> The plot is thinner than a dieter's sandwich, with no character development and no tension. Acting is ridiculous, comparable to a school game - though that would be insulting to many educational institutions. And the dialogue ... oh, how my pages hurt! The unoccupied souls of the dead are referred to as the "unwanted cucumbers of life" by the Flame Luminosity Demon. You wonder if hell really is a McDonald's. <br /> <br /> But it's strangely compelling that you're watching to see how bad it can get - with just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time for inadvertent giggling.
