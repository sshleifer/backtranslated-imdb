No serious spoilers, but some very small ones. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the popular Asian horror wave, concerns a husband and wife who decide that they agree and decide to adopt a child. The child, in the garden of the family as usual The dead tree eventually disappears when the couple finally has their own child and the tree above seems to have a grudge against the family itself. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The movie moves at a snail's pace and is recorded over 80 minutes with 80 minutes of material. It's essentially a skinny family drama with a spooky tree, and there's little fear, just footage of the tree with strange murmur sounds playing over the top. The idea that the tree is the mother of the child is quite original, but it is not fully exploited. This type of "acacia" is different from much of the new wave that it belongs to: films like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and milkless ideas until they're red in the face. <br /> <br /> The movie is starting to run towards the end; The realization of the fate of the child and the actions of the parents, however, not only dampen the past curiosity of history, but also show themselves in the processing of such machine guns, which are difficult to grasp. The last sequence is certainly scary, but it does not feel too late. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie does not feel so much like a ring cash-in, but with the "movie renaissance" that is Korea at the moment I could not help but believe this movie so much more could have been.
