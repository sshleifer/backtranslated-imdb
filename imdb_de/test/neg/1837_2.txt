First, this movie works by being bothered. I really do not like seeing all those scenes where people are being cut alive, etc. The weird erotic introduction gives you a sense of necrophiliac milieu. For me personally this is a bit ... amazing. But the movie really works in this regard, and it's thought to be scary, so I give it credit. Yes, a few points for these scalpels and ... well, damn disturbing idea to get hung up alive. <br /> <br /> But what's missing from this film is an interesting plot, characterization or real surprises. The whole teenage flick horror genre is usually very simple and predictable. Many 'tense' moments, creepy guys who are crazy, and the big question of all: is the friend the murderer? This film fits into the category "Scream" and countless others, which originated in the 90's. Well, I will not ruin it for you, but it's not really interesting who the killer is. We'll find out who's halfway there ... and from there, the movie flings on and tries to fill some time ... pretty boring, to say the least. I looked a little at the clock in this movie. <br /> <br /> The lead actress is great as usual, but the carboard acting box she's put into makes one moan in pain is a detective who everyone thinks is crazy, but she's the one who really knows what's going on. And the cops? Ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes disturbing, and above all, boring and boring ... It's like an American film company taking a flight to Germany to make a film to make it a stranger ..... hmmm ... .. or have you? <br /> <br />
