You know, I really have a problem with movie lists. I read Maxim Magazine some time ago and they had a list of the top 50 B-Movies of all time. And of course, if I know myself, I have to go through everything and look at all of them and write reviews. So check out reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I have H.O.T.S. Recently in the video library and recognized it from Maxim's list of the 50 biggest B-movies, I decided to rent it and give it a try. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B movies, so I already knew it would be shit. <br /> <br /> Given the nature of the film, I can not say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure, as it is nothing more than a T & A movie of the late 70s, and he never suggests anything. The only place where it deviates far from its destination is in a torn subplot involving a few ex-cons who stole a lot of stolen money in the house, which is the self-named H.O.T.S. move in, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. Although the rest of the movie is so, this subplot is completely redundant and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a few rival sisterhoods at the popular FU, which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sisterhood until the denials make their own to get back at them the snobs in the other. This new sorority, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals (sealing the seal is another that is not really in the film, and the meaning of that name receives little attention) given a seal runs around here and there in the film). <br /> <br /> That sounds funny, but in fact there was a scene that I was pretty impressed with in this movie. One shot that impressed me, I should say. Around the middle of the movie, one of the girls in Pi, the rival student, pours alcohol into the punch and she pours herself into a glass and drinks it. Strangely enough, what she does while drinking this alcohol reminds me of something that Charlie Chaplin would do that really lightened the movie. Obviously, nothing in this film is as good as anything Chaplin has ever done, but this attitude alone raised my score for the film from 2 to 4. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, the movie is just what you expect a lot of people were running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes (I liked it, like the end of the game, removing a piece for everything) was one of the ideas of the GIRLS. Riiiiiiiiight ??), and not much is put into many other things. For example, there is a scene at the beginning of the movie in which a couple of Pi girls hot sauce in the refreshments of a H.O.T.S. Party, accidentally got into a stressful photo (the girl who took the picture did not know she had photographed it at the time), though the photo later did not appear in the film for any reason. <br /> <br /> I've seen such films before, it's a bit like Gator Bait, but without the violence and the Rednecks and Coffy was not far away. Even Barb Wire is pretty much the same, but with a bigger budget and more silicone. Fortunately, Maxim's 50 B-movie list contains only a few comedies, for while these cheesy teenage T & A films are occasionally entertained as bad movies with the occasional half-naked scene, after listening to H.O.T.S. I think I've decided that I like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies. I'd rather see how many terrible actors are scared than to be funny.
