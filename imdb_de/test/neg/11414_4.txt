I'm really surprised to see all the positive reviews for this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not like I do not like 'this kind of movies'. <br /> <br /> While I enjoy a thoughtless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the "Dogma" movies or "real-life-as-it-is" movies as well, IF they are well done. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special effects, no fancy locations. Just a good story, combined with excellent acting and the result is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Does Nine Lives have dramatic camera angles, special effects and fancy locations? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: By no means. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is thrilled with the acting performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can do anything you want, but if history and dialogue are not believable, action immediately falls on its back. And that's exactly what Nine Lives does. <br /> <br /> Even at the sight of Nine Lives, I did not even feel that I was watching real people having a real conversation. I felt that I was watching actors trying to act as "real characters" while saying things that a "real person" would never say in the circumstances, but there are a few dialogue snippets below. If you believe that reading ten lines of a (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience LISTEN TO HERE. If you want a good laugh, read on. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. You want examples? Many of those in "Nine Lives". <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE1: <br /> <br /> Imagine this. Couple visit their dirty rich friends in their new villa. Woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I could get used to it (the expensive house). Man: Not. Woman: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of it - we are who we are. <br /> <br /> She likes the sound of it? Her husband acts like a jerk, but she likes that. Then an elderly couple walks past them with their hands. This is what the woman with: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. You have experienced so much. Everything shared. I love you. <br /> <br /> Are you like children after school? And then the most used clich√© lines you've ever heard? Graduation with "I love you"? She says that while her husband is an idiot for her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. If anything, that kind of dialogue made me strangle some of the characters in the movie to utter these terrible, horrible things younger daughter at a funeral. Dad: I did not know that Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's for the strength. Mom: Life is fleeting. LAUGHING father and daughter BURST OUT. <br /> <br /> Yeah, this one-liner breaks me up every time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on and on .... <br /> <br /> How about the camera work? Do not even go there. "Boring" would be a compliment. It should act as "realistic"; Instead, one misses half of the actors' facial expressions (the only thing left to see in this film), while half the time the camera is aimed at the back or side of a human rather than the face. Well, do not say I did not warn you! It's a good movie you can borrow if you want to make a date or something during the movie, because you do not care if the movie plays after the first five minutes or not. <br /> <br /> Overestimated and more boring than watching grass, it sums it up somehow.
