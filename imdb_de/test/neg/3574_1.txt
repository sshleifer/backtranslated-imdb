I recently borrowed this movie on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice as I'm from the North of England (Bradford) as well as interested in filming. However, it soon turned out that this film apparently lacked a decent level of development. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and history lacked substance. The topic could be an interesting basis for a movie. The delivery, however, seemed naive and out of focus. <br /> <br /> The end felt like it judged the characters - punishment and reward where the filmmakers felt necessary. This felt a bit awkward and stupid and seemed to contradict the "realism" used in the shooting style. For me, the movie dealt with the characters and topics rather cumbersome and awkward. It felt as if the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story, and made every effort to make anything but fit. <br /> <br /> Another point that I feel strongly about is the watered-down Ken Loach's feeling the movie had. I find it rather angry that British film financiers can not recognize that British films involve more than "bitter realism". It has almost become a safe option. The film is an endlessly beautiful playground for imaginative ideas and is not used by British feature film producers. There are many talents here in the UK. It is unfortunate that most of these people either make 100% music videos and commercials or go to America. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been shortened to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-time TV drama.
