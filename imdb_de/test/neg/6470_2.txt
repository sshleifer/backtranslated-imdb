"It's as if this city has the power to suck the brain right out of its head." -Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl who is bored in her over-average town. It is boring until a woman is abducted and she finds what she considers to be the whereabouts of the poor lady. Well, with the help of her precious cat "D.C." and an inappropriate FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) has to find her. <br /> <br /> That Darn Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty stupid and it has humor, which is often pretty flat. However, there are some talents. Doug E. Doug was good at cool runnings. His performance as `Senga` was really funny. Here he is wasted as a limping FBI agent. He has a good scene when he imitates the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most understanding parent who has ever lived. This poor guy has crushed his expensive cigar, is arrested for picking up his own cat, and is abused by his sneaky wife, and STILL does not get mad at his daughter because she has caused all his problems. I wish my old man would be like that. The only really good performance is Christina Ricci's. She was entertaining like the always annoying Patti, but her occasionally very bad dialogues affect her performance. You may also recognize Peter Boyle (The Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old lady of Wings and Cliff of Cheers, in this movie. This is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really can not recommend the 1997 act Darn Cat. Some kids (under 8 years old) may like it a bit, but everyone else should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good movie by Christina Ricci, I recommend the values ​​of Addams Family, The opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If you're looking for a fun family movie, try Snow Day instead. <br /> <br />
