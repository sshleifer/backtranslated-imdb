This is just one of those films that can not justify much of what happens. These people go for a hike: the young girl wants to take pictures of animals. There are really no piranhas, but I think the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. In any case, there are many animals and there is a lot of driving. There is a considerable anti-weapon rifle, but we all know where that leads. Towards the end there is a lot of action and a rape. Someone has to pay, and they do. It would have been nice to have a few piranhas to fill it out somehow. There were many monkeys. If you fast forward through the blunt spots, you have just under five minutes.
