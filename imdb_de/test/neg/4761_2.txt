This movie is just garbage. I have to say, I'm an expert on garbage films. I reserve the rating "1" for movies that are garbage, but funny, but this movie is just boring and certainly not funny in a weird way, but shitty in a fucking way. It will be a "2" so that you can distinguish between those out there and those who will make you laugh and those who let you fall asleep. There are scenes in this film in which the actors look at something, their expressions start to wonder, and big eyes and sagging jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at will be deeply intriguing cabinet or even more desert. It must be damn terrible for me to go out, let me tell you, I went out and also a lot of people.
