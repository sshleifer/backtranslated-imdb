Tom is about to get into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey falls and flies away with his snack. Not so happy that his Sarnie was stolen right under his nose, Tom sets off on his way, determined to get his mousy bit. <br /> <br /> As much as I love Tom and Jerry, I have to say that this is a bit of a stinker: the story is pretty trivial; it introduces a poorly designed peripheral character that lacks charm; and it whips the old "dress up the cartoon character as a woman" gag to death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "Flirty Birdy" rivals "Fraidy Cat" and "Mouse in Manhattan" for the title's weakest Tom and Jerry caper so far.
