Yes that's true. This movie is a terrible piece of ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski's books in Poland think the same. The truth is that Polish cinematic art can not afford fantasy films. It's a shame to compare "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian", for example. I hope nobody outside Poland will ever see this nightmare.
