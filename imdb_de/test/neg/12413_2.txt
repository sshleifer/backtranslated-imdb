Not really much about this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car at the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang, who takes his chances with a very pretty lady ruined, offered him a job, he returns to her place, refuses, the police asks him to accept ya !!! What turns out is a very annoying little movie in which the hero does not really do much and a cycling group that can kill, and for some reason, the police can not commit a crime on them. I'm not sure why the cyclist did what she did in the end, but hey, it's a bad movie, you always get scenes that make little sense. I'm still trying to figure out if I got it wrong when they said the hero of the play was a stunt car driver. You might have said Stock Car Rider because why a stunt racer would race and I would not think it would be so unusual for a stunt car to crash. The actors are bad and all bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is somehow incompetent ... really, this movie is not full of kicks, but it's the boxes.
