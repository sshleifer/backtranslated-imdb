OK, so I recently collected a lot of Vipco and Hardgore titles on DVD and I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing ones. A recent movie compared to other titles in the Hardgore catalog was a direct DVD release. I have always been interested in the myth el chokeberry since I saw a documentary about it as a teenager. but this movie is a horrible disappointment turned on sticky dv. the action and the acting are terrible. It took me three times to go through this movie. While cheap horror movies of the 80s and 90s are good for their cheap budget and comedy, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> First, check out some other titles in the Hardgore series, Boneyard, for example, is older, but much better.
