I hate a movie that has no end. I do not care how good or bad the rest is, I do not want to be left without a conclusion. Such shows should insist on a disclaimer. Something like: The movie you are watching now either has no end or is so ambiguous that it is not unique. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene we left is that Dee and Dominic are a bit in a row, and he says, almost regretfully, I thought it could not be him because the fingers are either a girl's or a child's. THEN IT ENDS! Well, the smoking gun is in the hands of the Dee-son, so what about Dominic's daughter? I actually thought we could discover it was her! Anyway, if you do not like conclusive movies, I would avoid them. Otherwise, I generally liked the movie.
