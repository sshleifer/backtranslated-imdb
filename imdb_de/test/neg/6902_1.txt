I can not find any redeeming value for this movie. It seems to be loosely based on the mindset of the Lion King. Father is killed, the son can not replenish his shoes and tries to run away, etc. etc. The only difference (apart from being in a barnyard instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard tries to get things with the club revive music. They try to be cool. The problem is that it's really not cool. It's like "this guy". Everyone knows at least one of the "older" men who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd to make a futile attempt to cling to their youth. They try to be cool, but they are not. That's this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of your life, do not let it stop you.
