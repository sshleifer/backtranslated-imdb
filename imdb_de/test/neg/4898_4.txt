The ingenious Australian comic genius Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and occasionally uncomfortable comedy, which was ripped from its release after just a few days. The drunken Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson accidentally detonates an Arab potentate at the UN and is sent to his tiny country as a punishment as a coup in the palace puts a new leader (the American soap star Thaao Penghlis) on the throne. With the reluctant help of Lady Edna Everage (both played by Humphries), Sir Les almost accidentally thwarted a new leader's plan to spread a deadly, disgusting, AIDS-like virus in the Western world. Joan Rivers has a cameo appearance as a female president of the United States. On her desk stands "President Rivers"! Extremely bad taste mingles with slapstick and Humphries' usual devastating satire in a movie that's more fun in its many funny parts than taken together. Lady Edna's TV fans might be confused by the presence of another Madge Allsop, who is saddened to miss Emily Perry's wonderful, shabby comedy magic in the role. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by the crazy Max man himself, George Miller. For die-hard humphries fans like myself, essential. Everyone else, watch out.
