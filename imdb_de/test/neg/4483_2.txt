OK, let's start with the good: beautiful landscape, Channing Tatum is easy to see, Amanda Seyfried has beautiful hair, that's it. How much of this movie went into the editing room? Probably the plot, plot, good dialogue and point. Terrible spectacle, terrible dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my girlfriend, who always cries in films, has reached the part that should cause tears, and she laughed so hard that we thought she was crying! The film seems to take a sting on too many subjects - war, loss, autism, cancer - but fails to treat a topic satisfactorily.
