First of all, I'm upset, there's no choice of "0" out of 10. <br /> <br /> I was bored tonight, and as I leaf through the canals, I see Dr. Dean. Chopper. Since nothing else works, I decide to look at it and expect it to be just another fucking horror movie with a plan similar to Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> Man was I wrong ... dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever look like it won numerous Academy Awards. May I remind you, Cabin Fever contains a scene in which a little boy starting a roundhouse from a porch says "pancakes !!" screams, figures leaving their dying friend in a small hut to bleed to death, and Shawn of Boy Meets The world accidentally fingers a hole in a girl's thigh. <br /> <br /> Dr. So Chopper was needless to mention that he was a big, stinking bunch of O-Mist. It was not even a funny crap. It reminded me of a horror movie I had to do in the 8th grade, called "The Campout." Apart from the fact that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before shooting), better actors, acts, bloody scenes and camerawork. I had hoped to get some laughs out of a badly made horror movie, but instead I could only watch in amazement as I thought, "Was this done by eighth grade?". <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the events and the various little subplots were jumbled and made no sense, and the blood and violence were very low. I liked how that died from a small puncture wound, people died instantly, and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knives ... If you're making a horror movie, at least give the killer an insane killing device. <br /> <br /> What the hell was the point of the students ignoring their promises? A great way to bring some scenes of girls with their bras, even if they have no relevance to the story. And I have to say, my favorite line was when the blonde to Dr. Chopper said, "I want to introduce you to someone ... my inner slut." Her "inner bitch" then reaches for a garbage can, she throws her. Chopper, misses her and sits back in front of the killer. <br /> <br /> Wow ... that was a long thing, but I felt I had to express my feelings about how absolutely this "movie" is awful. I know everyone has their own opinion, but if someone rates this movie higher than a 2, he should be shot to hell ... <br /> <br /> ... seriously.
