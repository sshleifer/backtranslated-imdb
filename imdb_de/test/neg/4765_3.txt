Bob Clampett's "The Hep Cat" is a decidedly average cartoon that is remarkable just because it's the first color of Looney Tune (previously Looney tunes were all black and white while Merrie Melodies were in color) , The story of a singing, dancing cat courting a cat lady, and a dog's attempts to catch the cat, "The Hep Cat" lack the typical energy and speed of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett does not have much to do. Warren Foster's script is embarrassingly thin, and while he's been spinning straw to gold with other cartoons, Clampett fails with 'The Hep Cat'. It's often said by Clampett that you can not confuse your cartoons with other people, and it's generally true, but "The Hep Cat" is an exception. Clampett genius is there to see a bit, such as the chase scene where the cat stops to ask the dog, "Hey, are you following me?". When the dog confirms, the cat simply says "Oh" and the persecution continues immediately. Unfortunately, only a little of such brilliance can be seen here. "The Hep Cat" is a bitter disappointment. We all have spare days and this was clearly one of Clampetts!
