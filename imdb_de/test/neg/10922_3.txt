This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed the name of William Shatner on the cover. It's about this little kid who's constantly being grabbed by his classmates. As he rambles through the streets in search of old ladies, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called Playground, where he makes friends with some pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil 'Pimp has to choose his homies. It looks like it was done with Macromedia. It's not shit, it's just the kind of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to in recent years. The humor is not very good, I did not find any of it funny.
