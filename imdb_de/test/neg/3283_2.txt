If you have not seen "The War at Home," let me tell you what you missed. It's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality, which in the 60s could only have been nervous and funny. Where America has grown in its acceptance of race, sexual preference, religion, etc., this show seems to argue with this progress. It is a step backwards in America's development. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the show's constant jokes is that the WHITE daughter is with a BLACK child from school together. This is obviously weird because you can not see that kind of relationship in any mall in America. I've lived in small towns and big cities, so do not give me any red apologies. This is not just the joke, but the father, who is allegedly not a racist, finds this disturbing and keeps asking his daughter to part with her boyfriend, who argues that he sounds "like a racist, but he is just stupid ". <br /> <br /> If that's not enough, a second joke is that one of the sons, who will soon be metro-sexual, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. The audience learns again and again that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced, so he constantly avoids his son and may fear that his son will beat him, since all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men who can do that. They control their will. The father always accepts his son once per show, but in the following episode he usually avoids it. <br /> <br /> The show can only heal in my eyes if it is constantly exposed To open these "unnatural occurrences in life", open your father's eyes a bit, but that may be too much - and besides, with such jokes, I'm sure we'll have merriment in episodes like "Episode" 13, "Father Votes Against Women", and Episode 14, "My Muslim Neighbor Is A Terrorist". <br /> <br /> Please drop this show, FOX. We live in a different world than the one in which your leaders grew up.
