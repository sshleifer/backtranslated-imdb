Most reviews for this movie were pretty accurate. It's an hour and a half of wasting time after a couple of very pretty high school students complain and cry about life. There are about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no scary or exciting moments. Our actress is treated like butt and seems to be completely satisfied with her position. The main characters, these sons of the ipsmith, are a wanderer for young pop culture clothing stores. You can not get in touch with them, the hell you can barely understand them. The story is full of self, and when it finally comes to the final battle, it's nothing more than a volleyball game that does not take long enough to make up for this warped script that was raped by the OC.
