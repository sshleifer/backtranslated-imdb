Aksar is a terrible movie. The script, the story, the drama are just ridiculous. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, that's as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer unbelievable and unsurprisingly bad acting. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, moody and angry woman. She looks good, but has no acting talent. The film has a hit called "Jhalak Diklaja", composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I could never understand the hype surrounding this song because I did not like it very much, even though it is catchy. The film is supposed to be a thriller, but looks like a comic thanks to the terrible directing and the writing. Avoid this cheapo at all costs.
