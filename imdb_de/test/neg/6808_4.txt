Warning, spoiler ahead (though I doubt anyone has seen that yet) <br /> <br /> The movie starts off pretty well, but halfway it falls apart and becomes a stupid, sugary, predictable and unrealistic one "Harmony Romance" chaos. I mean, it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the marriage of the main characters, but these problems are never solved but simply forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically, once she decides to have a baby behind his back (without asking), all her problems magically disappear without a trace or explanation. Considering what had happened up to that point, it would have been much more logical if the marriage had broken apart and not been made a joke and the stereotype of "having a baby will change everything". <br /> <br /> The two main characters' Families and Neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional and seem to have no real purpose if they do not irritate the viewer, and mysteriously disappear from the movie once the 'Harmony Moments' begin. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I have to rip this movie, but in light of the start I would have expected something more. 4/10 for me.
