I saw Gomeda in the cinema in my city. My friend took me away and I was really curious what it would look like. Well, I have to say this movie was not a horror, maybe we can say it's "fantastic experiments" ... OK, I'm going anyway ... But there were a lot of shooting, drama, drama and theater problems Storytelling. I can understand that the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. OK The direction of this film was not bad, I often understand as bleak as the plot. And there are no powerful Gothic scenes. As a horror movie, he really fails, do not worry and it's pretty messy and boring. Some people say 'Gomeda' is an art film, but I could not see a ridiculous, horrible and rundown art film like this one. So how can we say it's an art movie? Just funny!
