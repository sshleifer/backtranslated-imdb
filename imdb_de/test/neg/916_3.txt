Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really do not know. As far as the longer version is concerned, it's pretty much about me really liking Tatyana Ali and playing Alicia with her. <br /> <br /> Now does Tatyana Ali really bother with this movie? I have to say it's one of the better, and she's developing into a pretty decent actress. I'm really looking forward to seeing them in action when better material becomes available. <br /> <br /> After this movie was said it was terrible - and my rating is based on: 1 star for not being the worst movie I have ever seen, 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali and 1 star because he did not think that he deserves only 2 stars, but there are worse movies. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule should stay with me, not my favorite rapper, to say the least, but some people seem to like him - and if he's trapped there, I'd be happy if he does not pollute the drama scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah man, Marcellus Wallace, what are you doing here? You used to be a cool man. Just because Michael Caine is an incredibly brilliant actor who has worked in so many terrible and good movies, you do not have to copy him to Ving. <br /> <br /> The rest of the semi-major names in the cast: It's alright, there are bills that need to be paid, and we have to do all things that we're not temporarily proud of. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It's so grossly flawed, it's pretty hard to know where to start. It's more like a series of scenes being played together, just as the director said, "We have to say that and we have to say that". There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or in it. To say the least, the story changes were too obvious, and it was predictable what would happen all the time. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell: Reallynotgood
