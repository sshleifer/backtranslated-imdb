As other reviewers have noted, this movie is a mix of (stolen) stories that we've seen before. Specifically, this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter, which is inserted in Mad Max. Remove the cigar from Clint and replace it with a cigarette. Take off his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle and voil√† an updated drifter. In this movie, the "hero" is even more obviously a "redeemer" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers a wound on his left side, and his entry into the city is preceded by a plea for the "salvation" of the surviving citizens. I saw the movie on a hot, wet morning. Sleep was impossible and at 4:30 in the morning there was nothing else on TV. So the movie has served its purpose. The film is unoriginal, with characters that are almost comic cartoons, but still entertaining ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
