You can see that if the movie is not directed by his brother, that's the best he can do. And sad to say that his best just does not cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very bizarre horror movie. If you're in the right mood, it's a real bang. In the wrong mood it is known that people have violently quit their relatives, so please be careful. Clint Howard Stars (Does Clint Howard really represent anything?) "Evil" "psychotic" "bizarre" (yes, all in quotes, he's not quite one of these, but he's getting closer) Ice cream man torturing local kids with bomb blasts that really melt and ice that is crushed people and dogs in them. Ick. Anyway, the plot is just an excuse to show that ... well, that's ... um, well, it's a plot. Oh wait, I know! It's an excuse to show off all the Cameros of loser actors! There are Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) As policemen who track the elusive man with ice. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket employee. <br /> <br /> Even better are some of the bizarre tricks of the movie. I really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the group's unfortunate "fat" kid, they have this one kid wearing a padding under his clothes. And the whole premise that everyone would take ice cream scoops from an ice cream man. Who buys ice cream from the ice cream man? Then there is the entire psychiatric ward scene, in which Jan Michael Vincent's spectacle ranges from mild interest to boredom over the state of consciousness. These are the bulls who also scour the ice cream man's place for clues, but complete the ice cream cart (where, of course, the various bodies and the like are kept). Well, better luck next time. <br /> <br /> Howard himself exaggerates as if he's making people in two cities see and hear him. It's just stupid. And it's fun to laugh in the fine tradition of the Pumaman or Gymkata. You will have a good laugh with the right sense for HUMOR. I love that. <br /> <br />
