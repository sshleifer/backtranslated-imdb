Sometimes it's hard to gauge how bad a movie made in Italy or Spain really is, because all use the same stable as 9-10 ESL-trained voice actors to provide the English votes for release in the US. And in the translation, things are always lost anyway - dialogues, character traits, and plot elements written for the expectations of European audiences may not match our American notions of humor, hip, and drama. I can imagine that the team responsible for translating the soundtrack of this movie into English had about three days to do it from start to finish. Probably each of them earned a installment for his used Fiat. In other words, pure hacking, thrown away in one or two takes and never checked or repeated by someone with a proper ear for the American language. <br /> <br /> If you look at "Devil Fish", I can imagine that If an Italian saw this in your native language, you might find a slightly amusing piece of fluff. You would laugh at the "jokes" and the amusing drunks, you would wheeze on the monster and the villains of the bad guys and you would puke the attractive couple of Peter and not quite Daryll Hannah couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of looking for Clues about a man-eating monster that has already killed one of his friends. <br /> <br /> But since the screaming voice and pewter dialogue keeps us Americans out of the movie experience, we can not help but notice that the editorial team had serious attention deficit syndrome that no one on the big screen is really as much as To project a shot, namely the stated reason for the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense that the action sequences have the effect of a cereal bowl full of cooked oatmeal and the director, screenwriter and producer really hate women. <br /> <br /> Do not think about buying or lending out this movie - just watch one of several beers on Cable TV on Saturday afternoon, or with the help and protection of Mike and the bots on MST3K.
