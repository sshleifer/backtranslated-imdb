Small town sheriffs, high school students, fake rock music and a few crazy rockers who kill, well, no reason, this movie is essentially a remake of "The Giant Gila Monster" - except without the Gila Monster. Naturally. <br /> <br /> Well, anyone who has actually seen "Giant Gila Monster" knows it's one of the worst films ever, often so slow that it's not even funny. And I can not believe that "Giant Gila Monster" had such a reputation until 1967 that young directors would only be interested in a sequel, not to mention a remake. Can someone please explain to me why this movie was made ?! Incidentally, the dance sequence is historically interesting, even though it's about three years old. but also that is spoiled, it goes on ... and on ... and ... continue ...
