An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag (note: I would like to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a movie together, talking about angry cheekbones!). The soundtrack was not terrible either. <br /> <br /> But acting - even by professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon - was terrible, the direction worse (perhaps contributing to the former), the dialogue chimpanzee-like, and the camera barely works bearable. Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "Oy-Vey" scale. I do not know where that was filmed, but if I dared to guess, it would be either an open-air museum or one of those imitation villages, where everything is a bit too well-kept to do more than the "real old west". Okay, it was filmed with the budget of a college kid. That is, I could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned mistakes. But all taken together and generous, I could not award more than three stars.
