I made it about halfway through this movie and at that point, I realized that I do not care how it ended. It's basically a naughty teen comedy I just saw because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually well-suited as an incredibly cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​the movie (or the first half) of the movie, since I do not know - or do not care - how the second half goes, this was done mostly in 9 to 5, and a Comparison between the two shows how thoroughly Tingle is wrong. You need to feel that things are getting out of control so you feel that events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters that interest you, and they do not. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.
