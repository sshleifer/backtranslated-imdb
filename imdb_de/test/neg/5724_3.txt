... if dubbed into another language. Let's be honest: neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And in view of the battle lines that they are supposed to utter, this is a loose, easy situation. Any kind of voice-over is certainly an improvement (and it is at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor point. Acting is bad. The accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen could not use her sword to fight its way out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully clear when compared to the flowing movement of the child (who undoubtedly has undergone a martial arts training) and the athleticism shown by Sandahl Bergman - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some visuals are nice, I have to admit that. The dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. Mostly, however, the plaster is too obvious. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not worth seeing. Even "Conan the Destroyer" is better than this (if only marginally). I would much rather have seen Bergman than Red Sonja, as she should have been originally, but I doubt that would have saved this movie - alright. <br /> <br /> 3/10
