There were so many reasons why this movie could be great. I give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. She's extremely hot in this movie and that's why I decided to even watch him. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Amazing villain and I always look forward to seeing him in movies (even at home alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan For all Aussies and poms out there, this is a rare treat. Former Neighbors stars of the 80s who are dressed in drug costumes. <br /> <br /> However, neither these things nor the fact that the film is about the drug / rave culture has made this film even remotely interesting. The script was boring, the appearances normal and despite the scenes with J.D and every scene with Sienna, I found everything about this movie quite fitting. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
