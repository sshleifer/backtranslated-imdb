If you're a Stooges fan, avoid it at all costs! My basic question is, as the veteran comedy soldiers who were Moe and Larry, why did they insist on continuing the show when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, apparently had no interest in giving them serious writers and writers do experienced comedy directors teach? This movie runs like someone giving a pale imitation of the trio, and you can see how hard Moe and Larry are working to make every piece of slapstick relevant. Despite his vaudeville background, Joe De Rita is not a substitute for Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If Moe and Larry had to choose it, they could have just shut down the store and enjoyed their retirement years. Leave us fans with better memories of much better movies that they had previously made. Let them always laugh, is the motto of the comedy and always stop when you're up. Therefore, Seinfeld leaves the sitcom from the top instead of standing up for the inevitable decline.
