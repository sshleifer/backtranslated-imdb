A trainer who used to be good, but had to move to a new area to move away from what he once did; a team without hope; the star player having a quarrel with the coach; the co-trainer with alcohol problem, the little guy who gets kicked around and makes the profit basket; the whole city against the carriage (all but the main actress). It's the old story - straight from the British comic books, where a team of pointy flares and fatties play and win the Brazilians' football. <br /> <br /> This film, well put together, is full of clichés. The only part I could not predict was when the star player at the town meeting suddenly decided to join the coach. There was never a reason given. It seemed a very strange thing to see that so far everything went his way. Maybe he was just sorry for the poor guy. Gene Hackman plays a locker room, Popey Doyle. I am sure that an actor of Dennis Hoppers caliber has found nothing special in his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey. All in all, a movie full of clichés that might have been done much better than it was.
