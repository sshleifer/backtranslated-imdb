The problem with this movie is that it tries to compile a movie with more than 6 hours in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too compulsive, unclear and too easy to think about. <br /> <br /> The only plus is the beginning. It explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just hocus-pocus, put together. It has the potential to be a great movie like LOTR if it is not forced in just two hours. <br /> <br /> The acting does not convince too much. OK, not everything is bad. But most of them are. Special effects are stupid and look like they were made ten years earlier (although the 1st monster is pretty good). Overall, for the reasons described above, I give four out of ten points.
