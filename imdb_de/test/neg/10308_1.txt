Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. Usually, I'm proud to enjoy every movie, no matter how bad, but that was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can leave the terrible plot and dialogue behind as you mute it, the more terrifying camera work and lousy special effects make this film a real horror. If you think about it, because you're a Sandra Bullock fanatic, you do not need to bother, as she has less than ten minutes of screen time and her acting is absolutely cruel. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced by baboons that would do a better job, at least then we would not have to listen to the dreadful dialogue.
