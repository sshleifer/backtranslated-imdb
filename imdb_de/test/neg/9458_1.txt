Ah yes, it is another retelling of the classic: "Sociopathic murder doctor creates Mrs. Frankenstein and falls in love". <br /> <br /> From the same director who brought you timeless classics like "10,000 maniacs" (no, not the group) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" movie is screaming for MST3K treatment. The medical assistant even has overtones by Torgo from the classic "Manos: The Hands Of Fate". I do not know if the graphics, false-looking acts of violence or frequent dialogues without dialogues could scare off the crew. <br /> <br /> The main reasons to fight through this movie are: for the hysterical "hypnotic scene", the ridiculously serious ending and the lowest production values. I looked at all the credits after this movie. For the same reasons you tend to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident. That and the sheer genius of the ending theme sounds like a watered-down "My Favorite Things" played on a toy piano. Goblin is not.
