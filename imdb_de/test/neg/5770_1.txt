And believe me, that's a pretty amazing achievement. Take "Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove", change the killer from a pirate to a prospector, change his obsession with buried treasures into old gold and his color from deep red to deep green. You now have "Miner's Massacre". The problem is, at least "Jolly Roger" was entertaining enough - albeit in such a bad way - that you could watch it for the whole two hours. There is no scene with murder and no bizarre murders. I can not tell you how many times I've lost interest in "Miner's Massacre" and started washing dishes or cleaning the flat. And the end is absolutely stupid. The 49er guy just pops out of nowhere by chance to kill the local sheriff while the lead actor and the actress are sitting screaming in the sheriff's cruiser. A really horrible movie.
