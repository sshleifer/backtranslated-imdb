The main character Pharaon has suffered in the pre-film past a loss of wife and child. He deals with it by simply shutting down emotionally. Too long a movie, too much time spent on Pharaoh's expressionless face, too much "street time" (one of the episodes of television: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) nonsensically trivial - actions without reason or emotion. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship is based on sex (this film may give a new meaning to the phrase "unfounded sex"); Domino and Pharaoh's mother are the two characters who show some emotion, but not much. For all the characters in this film, it's hard to say: Is it indifferent acting, indifferent writing, or just indifferent characters represented by good writing and good acting. Characters in this movie do not talk to anyone; It is no wonder that they are emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre, as it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
