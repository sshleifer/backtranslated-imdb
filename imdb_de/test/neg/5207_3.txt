I'm a big horror fan, and I bought this movie with all the hype it got on the message boards. Well, I want to tell you that I do not know who triggered the whole hype, but let me address a few things. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is "not" a lot of things. It's NOT scary, NOT exciting, NOT overly bloody, NOT overly sick (except for a graduation) NOT rated nicely .... ALONE. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that a couple flees to a small island in Greece because they have done a bit of mischief in London. We do not even know what they did, but it is believed that they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** <br /> <br /> The male leadership strangely kills a few people from his perversion of "cleaning the island of perverts". The murders are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects are shitty. <br /> <br /> There's a part in raping a goat because his wife does not give it in the morning, but even that happens without worrying about how it's shot. <br /> <br /> End of the spoiler <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, it's all about the one thing that is not completely predictable. I especially enjoyed it when the "shepherd" rushes at the man. Anyway, if you can rent this and have 2 hours left, go ahead. It's nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
