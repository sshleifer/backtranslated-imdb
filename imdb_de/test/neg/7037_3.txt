Although I have rarely flown myself, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film has increased the precious laugh in aviation cinema. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does the captain carry out the ground checks? Why is he even measuring the oil level in the engines? With only 15 minutes throughput in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY does the captain kick the airplane tire? Strange pressure test. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All large, western, twin-engine jets built since the 1980s have a crew of 2 persons. Now try to guess how old the movie script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter can fly next to the crippled airliner. Must be quick ... and the words of the captain to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are indeed funny! <br /> <br /> 5. With elevator sets locked, it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. This happens, for example, when an aircraft moves slower than the stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. The elevators have hydraulic actuators. After colliding with the business plane, it would most likely have severed the hydraulic lines and rendered them unusable for steering, but they would NOT fix them in a specific position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the back galley was a stupid idea. It should show that only gentlemen ask about the fire extinguisher and fight the fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do so? the flight attendant. <br /> <br /> 8. At the time of the collision, the elevators of the aircraft would have been in a neutral position. The movie could have ended here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. In reality, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain use an ax to cut open the cabin housing to investigate the damage behind it? I thought it was the task of the flight engineer to do technical tests before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. There is no free space in every plane. At least commercial aircraft can not afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on ... but I laughed hysterically at how the screenwriters imagine air crashes! Woooohooo! Most air crashes happen in such a short amount of time that you simply can not make 90-minute moves. But you can always fill 90 minutes with insane and crazy crap, regardless of genre.
