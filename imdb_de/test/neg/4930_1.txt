This is about as stupid as it gets. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always act exactly contrary to what a healthy person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in "Scary Movie" in which Carmen Electra flees from the murderer. There are two signs, one with the inscription "to safety", the other one "to sure to death" (I recite from memory). <br /> <br /> And as in Scary Movie, the characters always run in the direction of "Safe Death." <br /> <br /> Why oh, why did the girl make the fire in the bank and keep the door? Did she prefer to die in the fire instead of being killed by the guy? Why, oh why, after cutting and overpowering the driver, they put him on the seat and let him be watched by the wounded guy rather than just shoot him or at least turn him off. He ran over her boyfriend and killed him a minute before, but they have scruples? Why, oh, why a hundred things more ... <br /> <br /> If this movie was a street, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so far-fetched that sometimes it is physically injured. <br /> <br /> Mercilessly add exaggerated "actors" and a small budget, and here's what you get. Looking at the rating and the comments, I feel like these people have seen a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing really missing is the notorious red toolbox of "While She Was Out" - a movie that resembles unrealistic storyline and stupid behavior of the characters.
