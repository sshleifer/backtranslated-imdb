I'm trying to find something valuable here. The best I can find is that Truffaut wanted to make a movie boring, painful, pueril, annoying, illogical and brainless than the experience of being in love. If that was his goal, then he was successful, but the solution to his practice is really an eye-catcher. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that screams for a parody: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve with those of features in a landscape. All I could think of was "glacier", "ice floe", "two lonely fishermen carrying an army supplement on a frozen lake in Minnesota." Buffoon's Theory of Climatic Determinism. The tropics are portrayed as paradise and things get colder the colder they get. Hell is the Calvinist French Switzerland. That was funny.
