When THE PUFFY CHAIR calls to you, beware of the soft, colorful cushions. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a friend-and-friend couple who have a hard time with their relationship. One night there is an argument. To reconcile, Josh asks Emily to come on a road trip to his father's house, where Josh plans to deliver a purple LazyBoy chair for his father's birthday. Emily accepts and on the way, they see Josh's flying brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking guy who has more to do with people's lives than with his own contact between Josh and Emily, and a bitter sense of The Puffy Chair (at first it is very dingy and falls apart until Josh "convinces" the original owner to renovate it). Rhett quickly realizes that the cause of all the problems of Emily and Josh is the LazyBoy and sets him a torch one night ... <br /> <br /> And that's the last thing we hear from the chair, though it's many are minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big theme is that the title of the movie is The Puffy Chair, if not the chair is the center of attention. It is the condemned relationship between Josh and Emily and how the road trip seals their feelings for each other. Once the chair is destroyed, it will never be mentioned again, even though it will arrive on his father's birthday without a birthday present. Josh does not mention the chair or his father. There is no connection between life and these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why is there no connection at the end? Bad script. <br /> <br /> The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother Jay Duplass is not only the director, but also the cameraman (and not a very good one). Almost every scene has a rapid enlargement of the characters, which become grainy and blurry before the camera's autofocus catches up and justifies itself. Initially, this was picturesque and artistic, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> The drama in the movie is accessible and entertaining. All the actors have done a good job. But the poor production quality, the stiffened end and the lack of coherence of the title caused too many problems for this film.
