Do people appreciate this movie because it's a foreign war movie? <br /> <br /> For me it's nothing but a bad German Hollywood war movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on so many levels. To mention that it is mentioned at all along with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The fighting sequences are pitiful, the dialogue and the cruel action. This so-called group of "Storm Troopers" is a regular in the Wermacht. No SS troops. There is so much wrong with this movie that it is sad. Bad editing, bad acting. It's all there. <br /> <br /> The movie goes on and on, as if the audience has to suffer as the soldiers do. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that the film had a budget of $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> For really? Where was it spent? In the fake railcar sequences? In the pathetic "special effects"? <br/> <br /> As a World War II history lover and a fan of World War II, I found this film a serious disappointment. "(No World War II movie, but still excellent.) <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it.
