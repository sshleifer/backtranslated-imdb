It's hard to imagine how Dan Brown's thrilling novel "Angels and Demons" looks just as bad as this movie version. Here are ten reasons why the movie was a failure. Please do not continue reading because of the spoilers, unless you have already seen the movie. (1) There was no love affair between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra in the film. Worse, there was not even chemistry between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking locations in Rome described in the novel were not visually translated into the film. I know that director Ron Howard had trouble shooting in the field. However, there are better photographed depictions of Rome on the History Channel than in this film, where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock footage. The large works of art described in the novel were only briefly presented in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the "Ecstasy of St. Teresa" was only seen for a short time, and the relief West Ponente on Vatican Square was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The filmmaker portrayed the deceased Pope, who actually resembled his beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly fictional and does not resemble a true pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was deleted from the script. <br /> <br /> (5) There were numerous instances where the lines of the dialogue were inaudible due to background noise. Faces of characters were not visible due to the shadow and chiaroscuro movie lighting. This technique worked in "The Godfather" movies, but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The College of Cardinals was a rather colorful crew with one of the voters talking in a southern flair. This guy would have been more at home on a ranch in Texas than in the Sistine Chapel. (8) The crucial relationship between the Camerlengo and the late Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the science vs. Religion and the relevance of the Illuminati for the conspiracy against the church. (9) In the novel, Hassassin's character was a memorable villain. In the film, the role of this assassin was a villain cut out of cardboard. <br /> <br /> (10) Overall, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel Langdon makes an impossible fall from the sky in the sky of the Tiber. In Ron Howard's film, the film landed itself in the Tiber.
