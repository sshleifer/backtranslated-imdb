I'm giving this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there's a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this kid and his buddies carry out their investigations like total idiots. They assume that there are spirits from the beginning, and if they find rational explanations behind the experiences, they must be drug use and screaming to admit it. But beyond that, the entire format of the show is incredibly annoying. Although many of them appear as scripts, the college-educated children who form the cast can barely speak English but still insist on using "big" words that they obviously do not understand. And the chief investigator Ryan's ridiculously self-important voiceover just lets me throw the TV through the window. (and he looks stoned all the time). In short, this group makes TAPS guys on Ghost Hunters look like MIT scientists!
