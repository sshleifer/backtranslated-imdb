<br /> <br /> After the joke and liveliness of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this movie to shine, but it was as bloated and deceived as the hard-rock stars it parodied. The tempo dragged on, and an overly long hallucination sequence did not help, the characters were flat and immortal, and Art Bergmann is not a Jello Biafra. I had to choke myself to stay awake.
