The first 2/3 of this film was not dissimilar to the American mummy movies of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were sentenced to death. One became an Aztec mummy whose mission was to preserve the sacred treasure and his love. And the lady was born again today, and the mummy, of course, was attracted to her. So far this is all the typical mummy movie ... although a bit slower and darker than the American versions. Oh, and of course the Aztec mummy looked really crappy. <br /> <br /> However, there is a super villain in this standard but boring movie. Why? I do not know - it sure did not make sense to have one. It seems that this villain wants the treasure, and he manages to mesmerize the lady and let her show where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to build an army of nuclear robots, Dummy! But first he has to build a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy was unstoppable so far. <br /> <br /> You must see these "human robots" as they look like a giant lump Robot by Flash Gordon and other series BUT they have a rubber head of a supposedly dead man in them! They look really weird and see the conclusion that if there's a huge fight between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot, it's worth sitting through the rest of the boring movie. Both fight in super-slow motion, as if they were immersed in toffee ... and this in such a nonsensical and stupid way, that they have to make a giggle - not a thrill. All in all, the movie is terribly boring and a jumbled mess - especially at the end. But it's a must for bad movie fans - it's bad, but unintentionally funny and great when you look at it with friends and laugh.
