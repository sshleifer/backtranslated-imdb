If movies that bring to life characters of virtual reality and that are either male, tough guys, or female feasting eyes sound good to you, then this movie may not be a total waste of films. It is needless to say that the overwhelming majority of people will perceive this as absolute boredom, with little acting talent and even less as a screenplay. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
