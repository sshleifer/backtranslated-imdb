and I still do not know where this movie is going? I really mean, what's this movie about? Is it about showing Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? Is it about showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord, he plays the role of Ramirez in the Highlands? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was so much sand used so little? Where was there so much table-knocking? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese he used to do archery with? Does he realize that the man was Japanese? Why was no credible apology given to Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, be it from French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), Bayou from Louisiana (Universal soldier) or a French mother raised in Indochina (I can not even go to the Remember name of this movie)? Can someone explain that?
