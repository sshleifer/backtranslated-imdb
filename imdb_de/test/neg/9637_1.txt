After seeing Stop Loss, I'm disappointed in Hollywood that he made such a stinker. Gone are the days of fame in the 1940s movies, when you were proud to be an American. He fights the wickedness that demands conquest abroad and death at home. What's left is the dribbling of the foam on the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men returning home from the war. One descends into the insane madness and culminates in his death. The main protagonist leaves his country in a time of war and at the same time destroys the relationship of his best friends to his fianc√©e. The third is truly the hero of the story. He has decided to continue the fight that came to our coast nearly eight years ago. What makes this movie bad is not acting, but the premise behind it. We believe that decorated soldiers are indeed haters of our country. Desertion is comparable to betrayal in a time of war, and the lead actor flirts throughout the movie. This paradox is intended to weaken the audience's reaction to the central plot of the film. We can not find fault with King because he wears medals, but his actions not only deserve it, but scream for it. He is not an antihero. To accept the film, the audience must accept the correctness of desertion, as the story paints King as nothing more than a hero. I can not accept that because it's like calling the sky yellow on a clear blue day. In addition, the hero is piled up for the real hero, the man who resumes his land and continues to serve him. I would recommend this stinker only to someone who needs convincing of the decay of Hollywood, as he is a clear example. No wonder it was bad at the box office.
