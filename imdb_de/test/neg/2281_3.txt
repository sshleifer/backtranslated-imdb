After the numbers Oscar-hungry biopic about the late, great singer Ray Charles. There is one - just one - great scene in * Ray *. She appears during a flashback to Charles' youth after the boy is completely blind. He runs into the house, which he shares with his mother, stumbles over a chair and stretches out on the floor. He cries for his mother; In keeping with their philosophy that a person should "stand on their own two feet," she silently and thoughtfully looks from the kitchen to see if the boy can draw on his own resources. The boy has grown up to the challenge. He has found with his ears and memory a kettle on a hearth, a nearby hearth, the grass blowing in the wind in front of a window and the crawling of a cricket on the plank floor. <br /> <br /> The movie stops here; it expands; it breathes - if only for 40 seconds. The scene is a much needed break from the otherwise loud movie by Taylor Hackford. By "loud" I do not mean the music, which of course is outstanding. I'm referring to the sound effects (big BOOM !, standing in front of another flashback) and the dishonest dialogue ("I'm talking to you as a friend, Ray," etc.). On the optical side, Hackford is equally and senselessly eye-catching: sepia color filter over the camera lenses during the flashbacks; Whirl-dervish 360s from the camera crane etc. etc. All modern amenities. What a horrible movie style is shown in * Ray *! - an overly general style for "important" films from the last decade or so (Scorsese * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to this film). These gimmicks are used to disguise the clich√©-torn script. Some of us will not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Some of us are also reluctant to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as more than great mimicry. Admittedly, Foxx resembles Ray Charles scary: He walks like Charles, talks like Charles and even shrugs like Charles. The imitation of the singer by Foxx during a live performance is technically perfect. I do not have to scold Mr. Foxx for his Oscar. he deserves it. (It was a pretty weak field anyway.) But one wonders if Foxx really understands Charles. The actor reaches a great moment when he insists on trying out the blow his bandmates are spiking: he registers, if only for a brief moment, a loathing for the injustice of being blind and a life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize the struggle between Charles between the bright salvation of music and the forgetting of heroin with its blindness as a battleground between these two compulsions. But the damned film just will not take his time: he jumps from triumph to triumph and never really stops to get a glimpse of the man. You have to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension; you have to deliver the drama FOR the movie. In other words, you have to imagine a better movie than this. <br /> <br /> In his glorious conclusion * Ray * introduces some great ideas for a movie: then he starts the "Chitlin Circuit"; his brave musical innovations for the label Atlantic; the problem of his heroin addiction; the inevitable artistic compromises that come with overwhelming success; The importance of the man for the civil rights struggle (touches in the movie for about 3 minutes screen time) and much more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on one of these elements. Two and a half hours, when one man overcomes a change of adversarial after another, can make a good feeling, but such a film is not necessarily a great work of art. This kind of approach certainly does not provide a deeper insight into the theme of the film - and should not insight be the actual goal of such a film? If I had wanted a laundry list of Ray Charles's accomplishments, I would have just let him google. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars - the extra 2 stars exclusively for the music.
