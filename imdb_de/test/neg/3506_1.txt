*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I have seen in recent years "The Village". An insult to anyone of any intelligence. Badly written and invented amazingly. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles, talks like these characters. Not at all. When it comes to saying that "we all have a bit of bigotry in us," he does the obvious. Not only was his point a base, but every character in the movie was amazingly stupid. The jacking scene almost got me to go out, along with the rescue, and oh, let's not forget the WHITE of DUTY Rookie COP picking up a black bat and ... I could go on and on. Terrible, just awful.
