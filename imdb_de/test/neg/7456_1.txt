I ... I do not know where to start. Dragon Hunt is perhaps the worst movie in film history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than that, as it was deliberately bad. Showgirls? No, it had Kitschwert and was technically a well-made movie. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then he vomits it and feeds it to a homeless man. It's a kind of travesty. <br /> <br /> Acting, if you can even call it that, is crude. It does not have the charm of an improvised drama, so a script has to be written, but it is presented with an almost spiteful tone of bad quality. Several lines were delivered in such a way that the actors (or basically the people on the screen) regretted the connection to this film or were thinking of a particularly witty Saturday Night Live joke that they had previously seen the camera. I could write three paragraphs about the quality of acting in this movie, but you and I do not want to hear it. <br /> <br /> The make-up and the special effects (which is the only good thing with most films) were ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous I can not remember it, stuck a Mohawk on his head. Yes, stuck to his head. And you can see that it is also glued on. If you look at the spot where he meets his pock-marked skull, you can see a plastic strip that is different from the false eyelashes. Fortunately, he is pretty much the only example of makeup no-nos in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible character development, to put it mildly. The women, who are treated by the allegedly benevolent, volatile brothers strangely rough (and I mean, they are really pushed around), are not only ugly, but ... pant ... they do not know what they are doing! In one scene, they turn on their apparent lovers, join the even uglier villain and then snort Coke. Apparently, they managed to get hold of some really good cocaine because they started shaking and laughing EVERYTHING before it all went into their noses. Great timing girls! They also carry some really awful stuff, clothes that are only in the late 80's and early 90's. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie, this movie, this waste of film that I should say, is also a waste of time. If you watch it, it will hurt you, and you will not only have to expose your beliefs, but also your entire brain. If you want to be stoned with your friends and have some good laughs, look to see if you can get this movie (you'll probably need to download it). Otherwise, you should not think about it. I hope I was helpful.
