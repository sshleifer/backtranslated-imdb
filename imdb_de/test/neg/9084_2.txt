Director J. Lee Thompson unites again with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action movie. In fact, this is probably the most brutal movie by Bronson (a performance for a man who has appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight, and Chato's Land). But brutality is not good for a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. Otherwise, if you took away his brutality, the movie would have little interest. <br /> <br /> The story is about a retired hitman (Bronson) who lives a comfortable life on a Caribbean island. He is persuaded to retire to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has fought in various South American hellholes. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are rewarded with some graphic torture scenes to show us what a bad piece he is. These topics are really serious. Torture continues in the oppressive Latin American dictatorships, and people of everyday life endure heinously painful experiences just because they hold an unpopular viewpoint. But the evil that men do - despite their dignified attitude - does not really worry about the plight of these poor people. It's only to give Charles Bronson an excuse to blow away some nasty scumbags. It's just an exploitative actioner who deals with real questions. The torture sequences make you, the viewer, look like a dirty, sickly voyeur, more like someone who enjoys watching "snuff" movies. The script is full of terrible dialogues, including excessive descriptions of torture. The evil that people do not do to explore their disturbing ideas serves them as entertainment and challenges us to enjoy them. Sorry, but that's just wrong.
