It seems to be an exciting prospect, a modern-dressed "Othello" starring Christopher Eccleston, who was so awfully good at "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jew", and Eamonn Walker, who gave so much intensity and introspection to his central role on "Oz." One would think that both are natural Shakespearians, but both performers light themselves: Walker's Othello is a pretty keksfreudiger part of the role, with a whispering delivery, which has little influence; and Eccleston shocks it terribly, as Iago almost forcibly winks into the camera. It's likely that he was spurred on by his director, whose floristic approach might have worked better with the Elizabethan language, but which seems a hideous, presumptuous choice for this modernized script. And the script itself is less disappointing than being modern than it is obvious? It's as if Andrew Davies sketched the famous storyline and then wrote everything that came to mind first. All in all a failure. 4 out of 10.
