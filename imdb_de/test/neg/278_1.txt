This was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( Sucks, because I was really looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> All the spins were crap. They were ALL flashbacks !!! <br /> What's Yes, it must be surprising for the audience to be stunned, but if you go away, it's the cops, what's the point? /> <br /> Also, the main robbery was anyway One Bag Snatch! One could not see the team working with its full misleading and brilliant potential, there was not even a good robbery in this movie, they were all rubbish, including the break thing of this French idiot to get through the lasers ... that's easy, if they are put together after that! Plus, this stuff has already been done in at least one other movie ... and then it was stupid too ... <br /> <br /> There's no reason HALF up to half of the 12 or 11 in this movie What difference does half of the cast really make to the result of this film? Half the SCENES do not even have to be there! <br /> <br /> The first one was noble. That was cheap! And the whole team loses credibility. Especially Ocean himself, because he has depressed the Bennett.
