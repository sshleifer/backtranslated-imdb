Mom starts at night in the middle of nowhere, which looks like a wooden building in the desert. A truck picks up and an angry father pushes out his sloppy daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves her there, but she's not alone, as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from close range , Virginia tries to talk, but as she grinds a cigarette out of her leopard print, Nestor grabs her neck with her high-heeled boots and pulls her into the darkness. Then Nestor tears open her top, turns into a monster and eats her inside. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that confuses Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and the LAPD, or at least this is the message a local television reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) tells his viewers. Clay lives happily with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and therefore his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a free space, which she decides for the "blind" dark sunglasses Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily, she accidentally strikes Nestor's sunglasses, indicating that he has strange colored eyes. Then Nestor turns back into a monster and bites Emily, who turns her into a carnivorous monster, just like him. Nestor takes Emily out to train her. They find a suitable homeless person (Rory VanSaint), murder him and eat him, but Emily's son Clay has witnessed the whole thing and has to decide if he does what his mum is right Now it happens to be a grotesque, bloodsucking and carnivorous monster! <br /> <br /> Edited, written & directed by Patrick Rand. I thought Mom was a pretty horrible movie. If you look at the other comments on the IMDb & Genre list, it seems many think that Mom is a horror for comedy. Well, I can tell you now that I have not seen any comedic elements in Mom because there are none, unless they are very subtle. The only thing I can assume is that in the actual situation that Mom is presenting, people see a comedy that it's an old lady turning into a carnivorous monster with the predictable problems and emotional fears which she causes her son to find out. There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humor, or anything that seems funny in the movie itself. As far as I could see, it is played absolutely straight during the entire 90-minute runtime. Since there is no comedy in Mom, that must be a lot of horror, right? Wrong, Mom sucks and painfully slow to see, especially after the first thirty minutes when Nestor turns into a monster a couple of times, bites Emily and shows her how to look for food and clay. Until then, Mom was moving at a pretty decent pace, had some special make-up effects and was interested in me. Unfortunately, Mom walks for an hour, which is basically the emotional crap that Emily's Son suffered, the later collapse of his marriage and he torn between the love of his mother and the fact that she is a carnivorous monster. This part of the movie is unbelievably slow, boring, and boring like rinsing water, even if he's got the nerve to resort to a clich√©d role reversal scenario in which Clay asks his mother to go to her room and stay there, the door close behind her and push her away & put poles over her window so she can not escape from her room. Mom's script completely ignores the origins of the monsters, and we ask that you simply accept that this thing exists, without giving a single reason why we should do it, no matter how silly an explanation would have been. I think a background for the monster would have helped. Technically, Mom looks easy and cheap, though I can not say it's bad. It's very average, with nothing particularly impressive or something that I could make fun of over time. The special make-up effects of the monster are fine, but they are used in very fast flashes, blinking and you will miss them. Do not be fooled by any original video box graphics like I was, the monster is only three times maximum in it and all of them are in tempo within the first thirty minutes. There is not much thrill either, a severed arm, a short bowel meal, a burnt body and a human arm drill are all we get. The acting is fine, but please Mr. Brion James, what is this dodgy accent !? At least James had the good sense to know he was in a mess, and reasonably he decided to get killed early in the process. All others are nobles. The black lieutenant, who was also a black police officer in the Fright Night (1985), can but recognize him from Die Hard 2 (1990), he made in the same year Mom & Die Hard 2?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! All in all, there's nothing that I can really recommend to Mom as a horror movie, and in my view, it's certainly not a comedy. Very poor, very disappointing and once again I have been cheated of fantastic video box artwork with many stills of cool-looking monsters. To avoid in any case.
