Actually, nothing was funny about this monstrosity !! This movie was an absolute abomination. The absurdities in this movie have almost made me vomit! I think that the people responsible for this film have benefited from their audiences. They took a relatively decent set of films (I said decently, not good !!) and totally devastated them by trying to put money in their pockets. The production of an airplane! was a way for Hollywood to catch up on this crappy movie. The worst part is that either nobody recognized the film's insincere events in 1979 (like Concorde's door, which appears at some ungodly heights, or Patroni, who shoots a flare weapon out of the window at Mach 2, a NUCLEAR WARHEAD !?!?!? .... what did you think ??) were totally unrealistic or they just did not care! I think it's the last of the two. The authors and directors of this "movie" have, if you want to call it that, really tried to suck dry the airport dynasty with this crap!
