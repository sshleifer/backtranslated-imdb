I saw this movie on video recently and found myself during this uninspired snooze party. First and foremost, one of my biggest favorite games is when movies like this are called horror movies. It is a thriller! Do it right, it has no monsters or anything supernatural. It's just a movie about a twisted serial killer (Actually, there's a very small body count, so it's more of a serial torture movie and he teased me well.) The basic requirement of a man who lures teens into his home The horror in online chat rooms would have make a great movie, but we only see him luring a couple of teen girls through the internet at the beginning of the movie. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective and gets emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly switches from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat-and-mouse game between the incredibly boring detective and the psychopathic Captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks, by Dee Snider, Writer / Producer / Twisted Sister frontman to be played appropriately. The occasional attempts of meaningful poetic one-liners about the positive effects of Snider's pain and the like are ridiculous. When he tries to get people to sign these opinions through this film, he miserably fails and makes them (unintentionally) easy. The direction of John Pieplow (whose only previous director Jurassic Women was to let me speak the title) was uninspired, and there was something wrong with the cut, resulting in the film being completely disconnected from some scenes Plot, unless the script is flawed (which is quite possible). This film is a totally unsuccessful attempt by a thriller to go through a horror movie whose only accomplishment stifled me at the sight of some graphic body piercings. If you see it in your video library, you're not wasting your money, but if you need a laugh at night and stranded land is on cable, you can see it too. 3 out of 10
