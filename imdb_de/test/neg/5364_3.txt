I'm a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters. When this show first came out, I decided to give it a try. I could hardly go through an episode. The show is so obviously staged. I mean, come on, every single episode involves someone who is obsessed or a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another big mistake is that these guys never expose anything. When I see Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to refute it, and if they can not, it's evidence. In this show, they find a voice or video evidence, and they very quickly call it a ghost. This completely destroys their credibility, unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters who actually know what they are doing. Honestly, if you're interested in the paranormal and want to see a show about it, check out Ghost Hunters.
