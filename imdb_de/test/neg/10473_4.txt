I really do not know if that should be science fiction or horror. It was confusing, to say the least. What really upset me, however, was the lack of story development between the characters. <br /> <br /> The sheriff's 17-year-old daughter (Bruce Boxleitner) (Clara Bryant) is with him during the summer. She does not spend 30 seconds on the screen at the same time. <br /> <br /> The hot Indian (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) seems to be in the lead for the sheriff, but she does not spend time with each other <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) is dead and she had more acting skills than the other two. <br /> <br /> The bad developer of Native Americans is an over-the-top story, but I personally like that evil developers get them while living in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed here was the creature. It was original. I've never seen anything like this and I'm a newbie to new creatures.
