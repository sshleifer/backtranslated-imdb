There's nothing to say except I want my time back, this movie has taken me. I am not racist against Latinos. I am half Brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It makes no sense. These kids just go around and do nothing. They are not even good for skating. The whole time I'm just waiting for something to happen! but it does NOTHING happens throughout the movie. Did I mention that they suck while skating. I could do a movie called "Beat Up Rockers," and the whole premise will be to get rid of poser idiot punks like those kids. I will not even deal with it, this movie is shit. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it, so that another poor soul does not make the same mistake.
