I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays a victim of cerebral palsy, a friend of a ten-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging in China fly away in a balloon, and so on, coping with a dull existence. I admit that I've been rousing through one of the scenes where they share friendship and simple joys while playing soulful piano music in the background. Okay, three or four of those scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, it was fourteen. But I looked at most of them.
