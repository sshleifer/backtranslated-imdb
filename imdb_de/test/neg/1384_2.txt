Much has been done about Carlos Mencia's theft of material from other comics. Heck, even before Joe Rogan collapsed on stage with him, I knew that Carlos Mensteala was taking material from Cosby and Kinison and a number of other people. <br /> <br /> To reinforce the crime of his theft, he once again told comic geniuses BADLY jokes. <br /> <br /> And that's a crime he perpetuates on this show. I'm sure the writers in the series have to share some of the guilt - it's hard to joke day after day ... but that's why people get so damned paid for it! These serial authors need to return to their day jobs, where they turn over burgers, or whatever they've done, before opting for a career of intellectual theft. <br /> <br /> Not to say he steals all his stuff. You realize when he's made a joke on himself, when what you see surpasses the terrible and gets straight into the realm of the terrible bad. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people bisexual Ten-year-olds call him a genius in his show. They'll one day grow up, Carlos, and if they do, they'll dry out and blow up.
