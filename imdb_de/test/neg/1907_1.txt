Interferencia starts as an unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana and dating her. Soon after, Martin reads a local newspaper and sees the front page about the murder of a prostitute and thinks back to what he has heard. Martin trusts his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker), but they do not believe him. Shortly thereafter, the same thing happens again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and their death are mentioned in the newspapers. Martin decides that he must find the murderer and put an end to his murderous rush, but who is it? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production, apparently in just eight days (why so long?) with a budget of over $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi. I can not believe some of the glowing comments that Interferencia has made to the IMDb. Out of 195 user reviews while writing these 113, you rate that bunch of crap 10 out of 10, I'm sorry, but there's no way anyone will give this movie a literally perfect score of 10 out of 10. When a score for a movie is set to IMDb. That's it. I honestly do not believe that if you showed the average person of Interferencia that well over 100 of them would classify the movie as absolutely perfect, not on Earth at all. The user comments are also amazingly positive, all from IMDb users who have commented on just one movie. The one user (except me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave him a reason of 1 in 10, which sounds pretty correct. Everyone has a right to an opinion, but I'd bet my life on most of these positive comments being from fake accounts that have been overcrowding that piece of crap. Where should I start? How on earth can I adequately describe how bad Interferencia is? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies through its terrible twists, while most twists turn an action upside down and change the perspective of everything that has happened so far, in a clever and relevant way, and real surprises here in Interferencia that destroy the twists The first half of the film & makes it completely pointless in a way that "did not happen" and the twist is handled so badly that you ask more questions than answer. What made Martin crazy? Why did he introduce himself to the phone calls? Why did he imagine a murderer? Why did he introduce himself to the newspaper headlines? There is no explanation for Martin's behavior during the first hour of the movie. There is only this absurd revelation that it was all in his head and that's it, that's all there is. Then there's a conspiracy on Martin's missing wife and lover before Martin begins, inexplicably, killing his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interferencia is so bad, it's so boring, it's so poorly written and thought-out that I honestly can not think of anything positive. I'm sorry, but that's how I feel. Interferencia is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen and is both conceptual and technically a mess. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb, Interferencia was hot in only eight days. Honestly, it does not feel like it at all. No, it feels more like it was shot in five days! The whole movie is a stain, Interferencia probably has the worst night shooting I've ever seen. It's as if no attempt was made to illuminate the scenes, it's as if the creators have just walked into a dark room or basement or whatever & just turn the scene, regardless of whether you could see something , The scenes shown outdoors during the day have this grisly, unnatural, blue-green tint for no apparent reason, which only looks stupid and becomes increasingly irritating. This strange tint is not repeated indoors, so they are pretty shocking and eye-catching. There is no real horror or fear, in fact I would say that Interferencia is more a thriller than a horror. As far as it is bloody, there are two decapitated heads in a refrigerator, a knife is in someone's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb, this budget had a budget of about $ 3,000, making Interferencia one of the most important low budget movies ever released commercially? Some people think that just because a movie has a low budget, all reasonable viewing standards should go out the window and we should accept any old crap, wrong! To watch this on DVD, you still have to pay good money. I personally believe we have the right to expect a good product. If this can be published and praised as being Oscar-worthy, we can all release our camcorder footage (including embarrassing karaoke material and scenes of total blackness when we forgot to remove the lens cap) and at the next Cannes Film Festival Win top prizes! The acting is awful, although the female lead Virginia Lustig is actually pretty sexy and eases the last twenty minutes as she offers a good deal. <br /> <br /> Interferencia is an absolutely terrible movie Do not be fooled by all the false positives. There is no way anyone who is not involved or has some sort of agenda can score 9 or 10 out of 10. An amateurish mess that's really terrible to sit through. I'm sorry, but that's how I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you have been warned!
