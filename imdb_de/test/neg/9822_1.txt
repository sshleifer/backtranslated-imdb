Where do we start with such an offer? I almost said film, but that would take a step too far. The only trouble with this movie is that it's a hell-ending marriage, between nothing and nonsense, nonsense and balderdash. These films should contain a physiological health warning so as not to offend the mind to believe that all good filmmakers have left the planet and their resources have been passed on to the fools who made this classic piece of rubbish out of trash as if it were the planet Sister-in-law "League of Extraordinary Twaddle". They are neither science-fiction nor facts, entertained or thought-provoking, humorous or difficult, but lie in a twilight zone without any equipment that makes people give up their precious time, sitting in a dark room and generally enlightened, to be busier or happy in the end. If we could award Turkey points for such films, this would be a turnip, as we would go through the turkey, ham, potatoes, sprouts, gravy, and all the other ornaments before we reach bottom.
