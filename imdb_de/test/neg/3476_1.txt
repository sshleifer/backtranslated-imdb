I have just seen a preview of the movie. It was not a masterpiece of documentary film. The film is totally involved in its theme and can not make critical comments on Ms. Faye. The only restful quality of the film was the use of puppets trying to structure a kind of narrative. However, the scariest experiences occurred when the credits rolled. The audience rose and applauded. The 21st-century Americans are still attracted to freak shows like moths to the flames. The narrative of the misunderstood monster gets pretty tired.
