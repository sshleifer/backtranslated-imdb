An art student in Rome is obsessed ... or something. She has the dream to be nailed to a cross and Satan herself rapes her. He owns her (I think) and makes her addicted to sex. That's all I could take and I switched it off. <br /> <br /> A meaningless "exorcist" rip. I caught on cable in the 80s and was horrified ... and not in a good way! This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, but turns into a sex movie that is disguised as a horror movie. There are tons of senseless female nudity, and the lead actress has to humiliate more than once. We see her raped by Satan (a hot-looking man), masturbating and coming to her own father ... I have to give her points for the courage. Add to that the bad synchronization, the editing (the rape scene seems to cut a bit), bad drama and a story that makes virtually no sense. The one troubling sequence (she gets nailed to the cross) ALMOST works, but the lousy "special effects" ruin her. This is one of the few horror movies that was so bad that I stopped looking. Skip it.
