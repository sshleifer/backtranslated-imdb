those people who told me, "this movie is good" - they are tasty! This movie is for an audience that has no problem seeing everything (especially tough guys, guns, car chases, and car chases) movie with "The Inside Man". I'm tired of copying and pasting movies. And I'm dissatisfied, but what can I do? Fans of this kind of movies are much more .... If you want to watch good movie of this kind, I recommend you "lucky number slevin". I do not mean, I just do not like this movie. (weak actor, weak script, weak action). Probably someone else will like it. Many people - many tastes. "CHAOS" IS HOWEVER!
