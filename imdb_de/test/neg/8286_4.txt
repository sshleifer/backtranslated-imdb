The next stop on our journey through the calendar scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All these seniors, who are just standing in front of possibilities and are ready to go into the real world and become adults. But if they can make it to the end without messing around with the campus madman who runs around and robs the students with his fencing sword ... Yes, it all comes from a high school track star who dies dead during a race One year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy to graduate from a blood clot. The trainer holds the blame in his rundown positions in the shop class, while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later ... All these characters are prime candidates for "Serial Slasher of the Year" and you just have to do it through this movie to the end to find out who did it. "Graduation Day" is fun, though it's by no means literally original, and there are not many memorable evenings, but there's plenty to keep you entertained. Like Linnea Quigley, who messes up the music teacher and a common, 30-year-old actor who plays teen, and of course ... Roller Disco! Must love this crap! They can do a lot worse than "Graduation Day", children ...
