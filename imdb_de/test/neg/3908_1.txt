About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video store to see something. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, and so we got it. When we got home and started to see it, we realized what an absolute crap it was! A beer can float in space? A guy taking a dump in a toilet? A guy with a mechanical tail who tries to excite a woman by saying, "Whiz, Whiz!"? WTF !!! The stupidest, stupidest, most retarded, horribly crumpled piece of rubbish ever exposed to my eyes. My friend and I still refer to it as the worst movie we have ever seen. Only another movie has come close to crappiness (and that would be the stupid Jackie Chan movie "The Medalion"). If you have ever seen this piece of garbage on the shelf of your video library, do the following: 1. Take it off the shelf and throw it to the floor. 2. Step on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Set it on fire in a closed facility (bathroom stall). 4. Finally, take it to your local hazardous waste disposal site immediately for proper handling.
