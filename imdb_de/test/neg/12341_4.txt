Director Michael Ritchie and the second documentary drama "The Candidate" by Robert Redford are a political satire that still appears fresh and factual. So it is a pity that 'Downhill Racer', which was made shortly before, is so contrasting. The music is ugly and the perhaps innovative ski sequences are now standard in sports television broadcasting. The world of skiing seems strangely amateurish (probably in light of the time the movie was filmed, but it's hard to relate to today's world of work), and the theme of Americans in Europe seems to be traveling more and more easily at a time , Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot that focuses on the arrogant but enigmatic hero. Unfortunately, it is a bleak idea of ​​Redford that gives us little insight into his concerns or motivations. And a character movie without much character is never a good choice. I expected a lot, but unfortunately this is a boring movie.
