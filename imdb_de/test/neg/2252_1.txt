I purposely did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I saw it, because I wanted to see it and wanted to make my own decision. I have been a big fan of QT in the past. I think we can all agree that he made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overwhelmed by his own mystery and disappears on his own foundation. This "movie" proves that. It consists of a few scenes of Basterds at work. Instead, it usually consists of long, boring, boring conversations between people, where you realize after a while that you are not sharing. It takes a long time and lacks the great sparkling dialogue that QT has been responsible for in the past. The entire film is anti-climactic. There are no tensions - what will happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that you just do not care when it happens. Honestly, people do not believe the hype. This is a very boring movie and you will miss nothing if you do not see it.
