I thought this movie would be good. It was absolutely not the case, despite the Oscar winning actor. I may have laughed once, and I've never heard anyone laugh in the theater. The pancake make-up of Renee Zellweger was very unpleasant. Everyone seems to be trying so hard in this movie that he ran around as a faux by slapstick, but did not pull it off. I think the movie may have sounded good in development, but something has been lost in translation. Were the roaring 20s really like that? I do not think so. Everything looks a bit artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The movie is in sepia tones, just like any other movie that takes place in the 1920's or 30's. There is simply not so much originality here.
