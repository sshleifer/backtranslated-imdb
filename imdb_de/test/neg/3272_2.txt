This movie has one of the worst main characters ever. I say that because he is the hero when, in my opinion, everything he does throughout the movie disturbs people's lives and causes problems. He can not do anything right, but the movie makes him look like a cool guy everyone should look up to. He has tantrums at all wrong times, he has all the wrong attitudes to things that ultimately make people angry and kill people, he is too curious, too intrusive, too macho and also when he makes all the wrong decisions and has none common sense. <br /> <br /> It's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the wife and son he left years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he thinks of her son. However, all sorts of things happen that make this story full of crime, drama, and twists. It's done for television, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty entertaining anyway. Johnny Depp is very young in this case and has a horrible haircut from the 80s. He's chewing gum and throwing a football around for about 5 minutes, and that's all we can see from him. <br /> <br /> For outdated reasons, the obsolete VHS version of this article costs $ 40 in online auctions. It just has to be for Johnny Depp collectors. It can not be the conspiracy. It could not be. <br /> <br />
