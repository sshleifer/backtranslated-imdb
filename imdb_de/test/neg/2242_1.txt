This movie is not worth a declining review, it just made me not see the next Tarantino movie. And I loved Tarantino's movies. <br /> <br /> Not artistic, not entertaining, not funny, not funny, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this movie had been Tarantino's first, it would have been his last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino needs to get himself under control, otherwise his next movie will be meaningless, boring and uncool dialogue for 3 hours. It seems he has fallen in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> Once you have finished your popcorn, there is no reason to sit in a theater.
