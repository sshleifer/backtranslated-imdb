This is really the worst movie I have ever seen. From the beginning, the film goes downhill with its cheesy music score, bad plays and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B-movie that's terrible. After reading some of the good reviews, I thought I would stay open-minded and watch it. But all bad reviews were right. I absolutely can not understand how someone might like it. I'm a big science fiction fan and that was a lot more than I could swallow. Definitely do a favor and switch to another movie. There are many other better films that deal with this topic. YOU WERE WARNED.
