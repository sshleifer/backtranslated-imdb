When I first looked at the back of this movie, it seemed like me and my friends were looking forward to 82 memorable minutes. And it was definitely memorable. Puckoon was a kind of movie in which you keep wondering how this is possible. How was it possible that it even appeared on DVD? Of all the films available in the video rental that night, we might have picked the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing amuses me a bit in this movie. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story with suggestions from the main character? Of all the stupid things that can totally ruin a movie, this is now my favorite. The character Foggerty, the village idiot, played by Nickolas Grace, is the most annoying character since they started making films in color. If there's a single movie you definitely should not see this year, please let him be Puckoon, because I do not think it can be any worse. I still wonder if maybe this was the worst way I spent my money.
