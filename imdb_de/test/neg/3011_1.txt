Keys to the VIP is just another terrible TV show that you can and will see on this station. The show is awesome with guys who claim to be real players competing against each other (there are two of them in each episode), in stupid games where they try to get girls in a bar to talk to them To get girl numbers and so on. The jurors are four more who claim to be experienced artists, but they look like huge D-bags, just like the participants. The show is not funny at all and not even interesting. It's just boring how these guys try to convince us which great players they are (they talk more about the four judges than I do about the participants). In the shows I watched, nothing funny happened and the shows are obviously manipulated. Do you really think they invited all these people to the club, got them to sign and tape releases while these guys were doing the same stupid games with them? It's not reality at all, it's just stupid, it's likely to be picked up even during the day. Someone else here wrote how he knew someone on the show, and it was all wrong. Yeah, that's obvious, it's a fake show and even with actors it's still not funny. One of the worst shows I have ever seen.
