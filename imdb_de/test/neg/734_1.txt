Every now and then a movie happens by chance, which makes you doubt your reason. We've just studied the novel "Northanger Abbey" at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unadorned garbage with the BBC adaptation. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it really is. Want to kill yourself? The film is NOTHING like the book, for example, the subtly evil characters seem to have become transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a goblin on acid while Isabella plays the bitch. Catherine, the main character, is the depressingly dumbest and most irritating actress on God's Earth (she looks like a coffee-addicted man, her eyes are like basketballs), while Mr. Tilney looks like a retired porn stunt doppelganger. The plot is completely out of control at certain points in the film. I do not know what the hell the director thought, as for no reason a 7 year old black boy we've never met, the main character is out of the abbey and starts to cycle in front of her. Yes that's true. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherine's "fantasies" in which she is carried around by an ogre in a cathedral. Northanger Abbey is essentially visual euthanasia. So if you want to assassinate your boss or something like that, the BBC has basically found a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a pretty ridiculously bad movie. Just look at it when you're in a cushioned cell.
