I saw this series out of curiosity and wanted to see with all this modern technology if it could do that at all, with Cecil B. DeMille's classic 1956 epic with Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course I was disappointed. Yes, they had all the biblical characters correctly, but they did not give us any of the spectacular theater scenes you were interested in during the first movie. If you have a miniseries, you'll need to have some "rivoting" scenes drowning "Burning Bush," "RED RED Sea," "Pharoh's Armies," "Sethi's Pyramids." Today's technology is scaled-up in blockbuster movies like "The Lord of the Rings" or the Matrix. Obviously, they did not want to leave a LASTING impression of "faith and sacrifice" that is urgently needed in these difficult times.
