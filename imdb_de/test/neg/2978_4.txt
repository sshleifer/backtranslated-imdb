Well, I have to admit that this movie occasionally made me laugh. OK, but that does not make it a good movie. Most characters are terrible stereotypes and really unconvincing. Not all give great acting, but some really try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: She changes her eating habits from one conversation to another, during a conversation she does not drink alcohol, the next she is allergic to champagne, she feels too good for most people (actually she is) still with the "perfect" fit in terms of appearance and refusing to give a chance to some "more realistic" guys, and so on ... The end is very cheesy, though I like one of the last scenes when all finally come stop talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath. Shopping is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughs (mostly because it's about sex and relationships, I suppose) and maybe a short entertainment program. Still, the whole picture is a big stereotype and nothing is really special.
