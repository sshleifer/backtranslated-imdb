At my local video rental store, they have a special place for Two Girls and a Guy. It is really a long joke. The clerk lets you rent it for free. They value their customers too much so they can waste their hard-earned money on it. <br /> <br /> I was extremely surprised that people gave this film a good rating. Maybe someone can explain that to me. (Or maybe the positive comments were jokes, did the people involved in the movie write them, maybe the mother of the director / writer?). Maybe I've just seen so many good movies that this movie failed in comparison.
