Blake Edwards's legendary fiasco seems pointless after only 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle has landed, Star !, Oh! What a Lovely War !, and Edwards' Pink Panther Movies, Darling Lili never attacks the viewer; The air sequences, the music numbers, the romance, the comedy and the espionage are all Hum. When should the viewer condemn? This catastrophe varies in tone, it never decides what it wants to be, and it seems like a parody, but it is pathetic and roughly square. In the worst sense old-fashioned, the audience understandably remained in droves. It is terrible. James Garner would be a huge improvement over Hudson, which is all cardboard, and he does not connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson do not seem to have been let in the joke and appear with fake seriousness. Blake Edwards' SOB is not much more than OK, but it is the only good thing Darling Lili has ever produced. The expensive and professional look of Darling Lili makes what's wasted on everything even harder to carry. To quote Paramount boss Robert Evans, "$ 24 million worth of film and no picture".
