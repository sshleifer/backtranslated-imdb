OK, if I was in the rental business and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three dollars for the rental, I would say no. The plot was not plausible. I have come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves can not act. Sometimes it can be painful to watch (though my wife thinks he is cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is usually great) was even a bit disappointing when the crooked cop. On the positive side, the plot (because it is far-fetched) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
