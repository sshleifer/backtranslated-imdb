Usual horrible movie ... I will not bother you because of the resume. Just put The Core, Armageddon, a nasty planner and one or two Solve-All Nukes together this way. Seriously, nuances in these types of films are more useful than Swiss army knives: <br /> <br /> the Great is approaching? Nuke a few places and it's over ... A tornado wants to destroy "inserting important name of city here"? Nuke "Add another important city here" ... A volcano erupts? Nuke it! An atomic bomb is nearby? Nuke it! Coffee is cold? Nuke it! You did not like Transformers? Nuke himself, but I can not say that this will fix things ... <br /> <br /> How many more movies can be made in the end before copying each other? I doubt there are many things left to blow up with a nuke ...
