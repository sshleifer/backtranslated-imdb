I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway. I mention this for two reasons to prove that I am not an idiot giving only bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread of falling in love with a woman of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know that Pretty Woman is a chick movie, but you can not avoid them all, they'll catch you sometime. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible, horrible, gruesome things; first, it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to a dancer's. One can say with absolutely good friends that the leg warmers giggle a lot and borrow each other. You see the prostitute in the reality of Pretty Woman, and this is a street runner. The prostitute we are talking about here has a great life, she is healthy, if she only occasionally whimpers to explain her plight. My feeling is that this "Happy Hooker" protagonist is much tastier than an almost realistic character, which raises the question for me if you're shooting a movie about a type of person, but too frightened to see that player with his qualities to adorn this role familiar, then why? If I make a movie about a cook but do not want him cooking or talking about food or wearing a white hat, why make a movie about a cook? By jumping off and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer, history misses the point altogether and never wonders about any of the moral or social issues she might have, what a police officer really is lame about. <br /> <br /> Secondly, "Pretty Woman" offends the romance itself. Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere, has no idea how to seduce or romanticize this "lady" who gets along without his plastic lover, especially when You are an idiot in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve injecting cash in one way or another, even if he meets them for the first time, it's the Lotus Esprit Turbo that does all the work. Here diamonds are there limousines, money money, where is the charm? Where is the charisma, please do not mention this attempt on the piano. <br /> <br /> Girls who like this movie will also be girls who prefer shopping than most. Guys who like this movie will not even realize that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as he probably will not get registered. More importantly, anyone who hates this movie hates "Thieves Highway," a wonderful story whose part is based on the same theme. <br /> <br /> I'll finish a song: <br /> <br /> Pretty woman walking the street Pretty woman, the kind I would like to treat Pretty woman, I do not believe you You are not the truth No one could spend as much as you mercy <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, do not forgive me. Pretty woman, I could not help seeing Pretty Woman, and you look pretty, as it can be, you have as much imagination as I do. <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, buy a while Pretty woman, talk Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yes, yes, yes Pretty woman, look in my direction Pretty woman, say you stay with me me ... and i pay you .. i will treat you right
