This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a thriller with a pretty ridiculous ending. I have seen this movie in the hope of the best and found something really bad instead. The movie played two actors that I really like, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Sure, they had decent chemistry together, but for what? The premise of the film was initially poor and the execution only made it worse. <br/> <br /> Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense is related to multiple personality disorders. This will give you an indication of where the movie is going and what the murderer's identity is. At the beginning of the film, she receives an unexpected visit from her father. This was done in the 1990s, when the bad daddy in Hollywood was the thing. This is a further indication of the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who comes into Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah is so poorly done and so unconvincing that one wonders how it was shot at all. And there is a sequence in which the two should know each other, who are so sad that they do not seem to belong here. I would admit that there was a sex scene that is very hot. Still, weird things happen when he arrives, comic packets arrive, things fall off the wall that could kill Sarah, incidents that say things are not normal anymore. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was poorly designed, the editing is sometimes erratic and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the entire orchestral music played in the background. A more subtle score would have been better. I have to say, no matter how bad the end was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that order. It is sad that she has never received first-class material in her career. She is this rare combination of talent and beauty.
