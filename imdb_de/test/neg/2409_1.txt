If you've tried to make a bad movie, you could not make it worse than this. I can not imagine anyone paying good money to see trash in a theater. The thing that really appeals to you is to be intrigued when you look at it all, just to see how bad it gets. The redemptive facet of this film was to see the words "The End".
