Let me begin with a personal note as a film and TV enthusiast, more for the joy of life: I love what James Woods can and did, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at this terrible, wretched, stinking "True Crime" -Assay. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this film has apparently never talked to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are junkies, but as thieves they have a very short career. Really successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not take "junk" or drugs before the score. <br /> <br /> The James Woods character met this paradigm at the beginning of this film and then the script fell completely apart. He's turning into an insane, alcoholic lunatic ... a nice job for a high-spirited guy like Woods, but maybe not the least believable. Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people in this movie are beautiful, selfish, drug addicted, narcissistic losers. They could not score real in the real world, in the real world where a tall, fleshy guard defeating a living child with living hell (as in the early scenes of this "dog"), keeps him depressed and indefatigable , Always. <br /> <br /> How many ways have I found to hate this movie? Lots. Even totally vulgar people - like most stealth thieves and junkies - have more vocabulary than these cretins. And the rip-off scenes with the neo-Nazi bikers? Puhlease. All rednecks are not neo-Nazis, and those who are neo-Nazi speed dealers are not that stupid !! <br /> <br /> This film earned two films because Natasha Wagner in her role as Rose and For Melanie Griffith still has "the special", or at least she had it for this brutal and offensive stupid movie. I do not sing for some reason to extol real criminals, but the reality of these criminal guys in this horrible movie is that they're all dead or in prison from Act 2, Scene 1. Make time better than this ... Thing ... and I hate zombies.
