The plot in this movie is very thin and there is not much acting. Val Kilmer - I do not know why he agreed to shoot this film - plays a minor role as a gang leader. In short, the movie is boring. <br /> <br /> A guy resembling a professor of archeology and religion is exploring an underground area of ​​Moscow related to railway construction and the Bolshevik Revolution. An ecclesiastical tragedy in this story makes exploration "spiritual" and spirits of a malicious intent pursue the underground ruins. A friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the subway and hires some Russian guides. The entire film is based on this plot and contains many repeated shots of the ground as well as some camera effects. similar to "Day Watch", "Night Watch" etc.
