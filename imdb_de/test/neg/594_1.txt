Do not waste your money or your time. Terrible movie. Bad spectacle, plot everywhere. Really really bad acting. Man, this movie is just bad. I turned it off after 7 minutes. The script is bad, the direction is bad, it seems to me that a high school group has teamed up to make a project for their acting class. Yes, that's so bad. Acting is not convincing at all, though I've only seen 7 minutes of it. How this movie came on DVD is incomprehensible to me. <br /> <br /> It should have been left in the editing room. I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, I will not do that next time :-)
