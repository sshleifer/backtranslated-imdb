There is nothing particularly unique or interesting about this run of the mill's low-sci-fi strip. Regardless of their origin (the film is loosely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and overall themes of this film are by no means remarkable or original, science is weak at best and the film fails because of the plot. The action begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and although the main plot does not really get going until after the ship has landed, most of the most interesting scenes take place along the way. Unfortunately, once our interplanetary travelers begin to rely on their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculation about cosmology and the meaning of life and everything that is interesting about the film, a very coherent conspiracy over Martyr revolutionaries and environmental problems very convincing deception maneuvers. <br /> <br /> Also the production quality of the film is not particularly remarkable. It is passable. And most of the acting is OK, albeit slowly. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a sympathetic character. I think the best quality of this film is the fashion sense from my point of view. The Martians have very nice outfits! If this movie had any meaning, it might have been more interesting. Well.
