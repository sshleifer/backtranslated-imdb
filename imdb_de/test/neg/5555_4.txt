Some may remember when they see the movie Juno, in which Ellen Page Daro praises Argentos Suspiria, her favorite horror film. Jason Bateman's character then asks if she's ever seen a movie by Herschel Gordon Lewis, and he has a movie copy (I forget what's going to be forgotten at the moment) and she shows her. When I saw Juno, I saw Suspiria and some Argento movies, but not Lewis. Now I can see that it's not just another Diablo Cody in-pop culture, but something that actually gives an indication of the characters' tastes and, subjectively, judges them according to their tastes. In other words, the reputation of Herschel Gordon Lewis will be maintained many years after he finishes filming - and that's a Schlock master's, no more and no less. Actually less. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to use Argento as a basis for comparison, as both filmmakers are approaching similar material, at least in the case of The Gore Gore Girls and, well, any Argento image. While Argento is extremely conscious of his craft, of the audience involved in every little story through the power of camera, music and style movements, Lewis goes the easy way to reach an audience that is immature Script stands and (easily said) smooth direction. The Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who is not interested in entertaining his audience as a horror movie, but as a side show or brothel. He can not direct actors, he's a porno movie, and for any possibly smart or funny one-liner, there are ten who are either totally stinky or half-smart or not smart enough. Apart from that, perhaps the best you can say about The Gore Gore Girls, a mystery movie about a detective (Sherlock Holmes type, played by Frank Kress) and a newspaper reporter (Dummie Amy Farrell)) to investigate a series of murders of go-go dancers is the template for countless other Troma-style images. Maybe this is a faint praise, and really the best you can really say is that Henny Youngman- "Take my wife, please!" - a few scenes and steals each of them, without much to try. It's sad, because it could be the kind of image that can entertain on an incredibly bad level. But even in this respect, one can laugh more out of embarrassment for the production, some actors (ie the guy who plays the cops, my God) than out of any guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Even the gore itself is a bit disappointing. At first, it is believed that Lewis achieves this goal and shows that these women are being murdered in a crazy, vicious and exaggerated way. But with the murders, everything takes longer than necessary; I do not mean that in terms of shock, that's fine. But there must be something else to really get it "stuck" that showing women's faces and eye-slices is alright when you're 12 and see this as one of your first "horror" movies. It will, I can not say, boring. Dangerously boring for such a "daring" so-called movie. <br /> <br /> This was Lewis's last movie, until 30 years later an apparently worthy swan song with a sequel to a movie he had previously made, took him out of his movie, retired from movies and did work writing books, how to do it in the business. Whatever he has experienced does not show that. It's not a failure, but it could have been, and it's just ... Schlock. Take it or leave it.
