Help, I ended up in the hell of the cinema! What a totally stupid movie that is. Nothing is really good. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly far-fetched: an anti-EU terrorist group is chasing a group of people traveling west across Western Europe Delivery of transparent bags with xtc pills. And the worst part is that they are serious! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of acting should be ashamed of all involved faces. <br /> <br /> 3) Some people with money eyes decided to let every English speak for the international market to prevail. Ugliest advertising ever! The French and Dutch mother tongues are anything but meaningful and the result is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is totally out of place and not properly selected. <br /> <br /> 5) The work with camera, editing and effects is supposed to be some post-noir-road-movie style, but it's hardly worth anything and is not meant to accompany this story (read: History). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. The hero of Wildschut convinces again and again. A true actor. Normally I would give an extra point just because he is nearby. But no, sorry, not this time, I would not forgive myself ...
