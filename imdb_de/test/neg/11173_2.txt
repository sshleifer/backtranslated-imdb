This is just the fourth effort I've seen from this director (whom I met at the 2004 Italian B-Film retrospective of the Venice Film Festival), and possibly the worst. As with its predecessor THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), this is a prime example from the end of the Euro-Cult era - mainly because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen at that time! <br /> <br /> Here we actually get a conspiracy that's spinning - I'm not kidding, people - a killer phone! The pretty but bland Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - is a model that has apparently just ended an affair; She keeps expecting her architect-lover to call her back, but every time the phone rings, everything is static, accompanied by otherworldly voices (or such crap). She befriends a new tenant in her apartment block, who conveniently has authority over paranormal activity (William Berger). He explains strangely that the negative energy that is released in family disputes, for example, can manifest itself as a deadly force on home appliances (I swear I did not think so)! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... er ... low points of the film include: the grumpy bartender from whose grubby place the heroine calls a few times (it seems the chain of events can only do that. ) Break again by letting Lewis go through her steps (EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) style!), the sheer variety of absurdly-looking cell phones, and the heroine's friend's apparatus, which faces her before the kill with the sarcastic policeman who greets Lewis as he reports the strange occurrences ("And what does the toaster make me wonder?"), the alleged rapist who was killed by a coin-hole fired from a phone booth, and Berger's bloody demise (by phone) to influence the pacemaker he is equipped with and explode the doctor's heart)! <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is quite confusing and it looks like it finally sees all 'lost souls' inhabiting a flock of pigeons and flying out of the 'obsessed' office window (a lonely service of the heart!). For what it's worth, the score - no less by ex-goblin Claudio Simonetti - is effective enough, though dated heavy metal numbers have been included in the soundtrack.
