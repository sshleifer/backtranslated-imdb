I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is something I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I love the original and have seen it several times and would recommend it to anyone. This may have been the problem, but I do not think so because there were a few bright spots that showed that they made this movie work. <br /> <br /> Bette was under stress and Anne was over used and miscast. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Englishmen or anyone else should let this happen in this condition. <br /> <br /> You billed this as Sex in the City, but better? No chance, I really liked sex in the city and was disappointed with this movie. So do not waste your money on this movie - see everything but this one!
