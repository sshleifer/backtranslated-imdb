I could not believe how bad this movie was, and I trust I did not expect a masterpiece of cable TV. I recorded it just because I liked Jane Seymour. I've seen her enough to know that she's undoubtedly an accomplished actress, so I just do not know what happened here. The characters were flat, the dialogue stilted, the acting bad and yes, this includes Seymour. It was nice to see her play against the guy, but not so bad. I noticed that she was recognized as an executive producer, so she can not escape the blame for the sheer viciousness of the movie. And oh yes, they had Barry Bostwick, who played the male lead role. 'Nuff said.
