A box with a button gives a couple the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of a person they have never met. This is a very boring movie. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed the screenplay, decided to make a movie without profit. They are taken on a slow-speed ride, one after the other, containing at best minor revelations. At certain moments, I thought, this will be very important in the end, but nothing will do that. The film allows only one thought: "This story could have been told in 30 minutes without all the extended nonsense." I hope you avoid this horrible movie and get your mind through it.
