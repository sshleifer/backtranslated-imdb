Very resistant, but ultimately harmless film version of the literary classic for children, which contains an animated game in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very different - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from the Miscast (a 69 year old Mason as a thieving chimney sweep!) To the inconsistent (Greenwood as) (a confused Aristocrat) to the bizarre (Whitelaw plays several "exotic" characters - including a circus artist, an old witch, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The animated segment of Der Film, which is handled by a group of Eastern European animators, is barely inspired, but in itself a little enjoyable, and as usual there is a selection of songs on this sort of thing, one of whom is heard, one of whom is especially too often reproduced for their own good. The film was filmed by well-known character actor Jeffries, who had earlier (far more successful) made other children's films such as THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and THE AMAZING MR. BLUNDEN (1972, I've seen that for myself, but was released some time ago on R2-DVD by Anchor Bay UK).
