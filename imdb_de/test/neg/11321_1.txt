I like a good novelty song. No, I'll take that back. I love a good novelty song. I absolutely despise GGROBAR on the other side and heard about the first note I've ever heard. When I found out that someone had made a cartoon based on that, my head almost exploded. Now that I saw it, because my children begged me, I wished my head had exploded. It would have saved me from the agonizing misery that was this Cr @ pfest. First of all, it's a ridiculous idea to do a one-hour show based on a three-minute novelty song. To stretch a song like this, which had to be made crazy to be so long, in a whole hour, is even more ridiculous. That was poorly written, cheap animated, badly traded ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, that is always bad.
