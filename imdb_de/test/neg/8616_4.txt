This movie, which is only for the name of John Carpenter, is set in Thailand and includes a sect of bad vampires who enjoy killing people and a sect of good vampires who do not. Although it's an interesting idea to shoot a vampire movie in Thailand, the authors do not seem to care much about the exotic locale. This film could just as well have been filmed in Los Angeles. What brings me to my next point is that this is very similar to Blade Lite. We have the rock soundtrack, the martial arts fight scenes, a blood club in the dance club and of course lots of sharp objects going through vampires. What we do not have is the budget and the talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial artist, too bad his acting was not so good, and there is a lot of decent wire work and lots of excited fighting sequences, maybe too many. The only problem is that they do not have the same effect as the Blade movies. Maybe it's just that the movie was "seen there", that it feels like that. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem for me, however, was that the filmmakers did not take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead, played by the nasty Colin Egglesfield and his girlfriend. She is kidnapped at the beginning of the strip after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. We have no interest in her well-being at this time and no reason to believe that her friend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. Well, that's a big drawback, if that's the main advantage of the plot. In the end, you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time, but I can imagine much better things. Do it with your time and hire one of the Blade movies.
