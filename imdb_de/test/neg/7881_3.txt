Well, how do you make a movie as provocative as possible? This caricature, straightforward shocker tries to lash with two low-living Parisian women (a prostitute, a recently raped ex-porn actress, no less) and speak out on a national sex and murder rush of men. <br /> <br /> A very short running time gives an indication of the experimental nature of this violent hardcore movie "Thelma & Louise" - but it turns out to be completely ironic or contemplative for any feminist message ... and there If we do not get very close to the protagonist, the violence actually feels subdued and stunned - and maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, I am always welcome when the "reputable" film industry dares to contain sex scenes full of sexuality. But the question is: Does it work for the movie as a whole? Is it good for something? Not very, although we have given the phrase "a shot in the ass" a new meaning! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
