Now and then I watch a movie that completely surprises me. One that comes from nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment. One that is fun from start to finish. Well, people, when a stranger calls, it's NOT the movie. It's an incredibly stupid and far-fetched remake of the much better horror camp classic of 1979. Our main hero, Jill, is forced to babysit after her cell phone minutes and is harassed by calls from a mysterious caller. Every clich√© in the world is used here, from the stupid cat's jump from a hidden place to a car that does not become a killer, it can be anytime, anywhere. This movie is bad ... not bad on "that bad is good", more on "so bad it is boring". Skip this divine movie and save your movie for something else. You will thank me later, trust me. Grade: D
