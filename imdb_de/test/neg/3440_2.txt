I love how everyone treats this show as if it were the next great American sitcom. I've looked at five episodes of this atrocity, and the only person who came close to a real teacher was the old man who had loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who had never gone to a real classroom. I loved the fact that each episode consisted of the two idiots (one who was put down and the other one who did not), who got into some kind of crazy trouble that indirectly affected their students. The British girl, who turned out to be sympathetic to the sympathetic idiot, was somehow shocked that he turned out to be Jackass. The hot chick, who was there for the special purpose of being hot, and the principal and her lackey who served to somehow advance the almost nonexistent plan. I loved that almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but I ask you to think about your high school days and remember the teachers you had. , , did you look like that? Or did you go to high school where middle-aged people taught? This is the gymnasium everyone else went to. The show lacked any research into what's going on in the schools. In public schools, the principals have no authority over senior teachers and fire teachers, but the school board does, but in every episode I watched the school principal, she threatened to dismiss her teachers. Think back to your history lesson. , , , , Or think of a history lesson. Have you ever seen an incredibly hot British chick teaching American history lessons? Have you ever seen a teacher lounge so big that you could actually play basketball? <br /> <br /> The teachers could have been a great show if they had actually established themselves in some form of reality. What makes tuition funny is the stories one gets from interacting with the students, and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students on a daily basis. The overemphasis in her life outside the classroom made it another sitcom with four cameras, where unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment said unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry, I just did not buy it. The show could have modeled itself on other, currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and should focus more on teachers' relationships with their students, not the others. <br /> <br /> It will be a star to try and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history while a hack trying to understand a profession. I just hope that when they do another sitcom based on lessons they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity like this never touches the TV screen.
