I think this movie was a terrible waste of time, and I would know after seeing him five times in class. This film does not show what happened in these times absolutely perfect. Nobody can really say that these things happened with the letter. If anything, the actors would be the only good role, even if they really were really crap. They read the script without expression. pretty boring. I would rather play a school. I definitely do not want to see this movie again in my life. It's a complete waste of time, unless you want your time wasted and you want to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
