Roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corncob that he wants to patent and sell. Immediately, his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he collects roommates to help pay the rent and gets a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he writes a book about roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these details of the plot is examined in detail. What you read above is more or less as interesting as the movie. When his uncle dies, there are some breasts on the screen, one of the potential roommates he interviews is funny for about 40 seconds. The end is literally the worst thing I've ever seen. I want to go back the other 87 minutes of my life! <br /> <br /> I did not think anyone could make a movie with so little merit. The script can not be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must be tiny, since the entire film has three locations and a car. The only conceivable use for roomies is in my opinion, if you consider someone hostage and want to defeat him beyond human thought. If so, let it be repeated and within a day you will have a finished wreck. <br /> <br /> One and a half from 10
