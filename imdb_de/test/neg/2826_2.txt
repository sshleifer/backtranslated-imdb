I wrote an essay in 1981, the year I graduated from high school, the "last American maiden." I also had a friend named Nancy, who was the prostitute in this movie. Apparently her daughter got my essay one evening when she slept in my house. One year later, I wake up one morning and see the ad for this movie. I was 18 years old and founded the essay on experiences in my life. The film is a little different from my essay, but definitely taken away. I had no proof of this, except for my English teacher Mr.Versace, who gave me an A on my essay. I let it go and never did anything about it. I thought that what is going on around me was lamenting against all those involved in this film. I just had to take it off my chest because I've never really told anyone about it except my closest friend and they agreed to keep it a secret. That same year, when I came out, I saw Nancy on a market, she really had the nerve to ask me if I had good stories or screenplays for her. I think that's what Hollywood is all about, getting stories from wherever you can. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen. <br /> <br /> ghostwriter!
