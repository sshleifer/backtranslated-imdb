Too much footage (almost a third of this 53-minute film) really slows it down. Granted, the plot is such that John Weston is sent by Marshall George Higgins to participate in a solid rodeo (say "Ro-DAY-oh"), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina - even in the big "duck soup" [1933]) and the "heroine" Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young balance (hey! It's her sister!), Would benefit can of more screen time. The happy ending is too abrupt - though John Wayne actually kisses the girl this time around. <br /> <br /> The most interesting stock footage was the long rodeo parade of real Native Americans, Squaws and Papooses. But if the best part of the movie is the stunt work of the Mighty Yak, Yakima Canutt, who lets us jump from one horse to another and leads several different jumps on a horse, then we know we're in trouble. As noted by others, the last fight with the villain is very bad. <br /> <br /> My copy of 'Platinum Disc Corporation' contained an additional, sparse, poorly fitting (pseudo-classical) stereo music track that ruined the authenticity of the original movie. (The DVD box had 'Enhanced Audio 5.1'.) If you modernize and colorize it, you should add a Western score with acoustic guitars, 'klip-klopping' hoofbeats, harmonicas, and an accordion. Finally, we have to say that this is one of the weakest Lone Star efforts.
