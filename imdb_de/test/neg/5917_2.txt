In the 1930s, the Hal Roach studios with stars like Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and the Little Rascals were at the top of the comedy world. Most of these films are extraordinary and have stood the test of time. One less well-known product by Roach, however, was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later Todd was paired with the equally untalented Patsy Kelly). Try as much as possible, I just can not stand those pictures - they're just not funny. Unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was no chemistry between Todd and her two co-stars. Before you even think I'm a nutcase, understand that I've seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films as well as many other early comedies. So I know the genre well and within this genre this team is one of the worst. I think I'm right with the team because as a Roach subordinate, I got all the scripts no one else wanted. When Stan or Ollie hated a certain idea of ​​action, she was often passed on to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and usually she showed up. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, the team is at the lowest level. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laugh and a sophisticated plot. The film begins with Zasu on the jury and Thelma as defender. As for Zasu, she is a totally annoying idiot. NOT the lovable idiot (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), just a totally annoying and annoying person who is pushy and disgusting. As far as Thelma is concerned, she is, as usual, the rather dull "straight man" and as such has little to do, but to react to Zasu's boorish behavior. <br /> <br /> The act implies that Thelma defends a customer who accuses the sale of explosions diet pills. Considering that the pills are very dangerous, the lawyer, when he asks Zasu to swallow one, just seems stupid. And while they were called "pills," they were more like huge black blobs bigger than golf balls. Swallowing seemed unimaginative and meaningless - even for a low-braow comedy. When they find out she's swallowed the pill and she's really explosive, everyone panics and runs around like idiots until the movie ends. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. But even for those who like the movie, there is not a single legitimate laugh in the entire short story! When I talked to my wife (who also saw the movie with me) about this meeting, she thought that my score of 2 was too generous !!
