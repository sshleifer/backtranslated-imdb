It's nice, but what else did you expect? The heroine is a younger sister of Cinderella with evil mother, sister and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffective plaster; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villains. <br /> <br /> The cast, settings and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did an excellent job, considering how weak the material was. The film was beautifully filmed and featured a soundtrack that was carefully designed to inform the viewer what emotions he should consistently experience. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and gave the movie some of his best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you will love this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you will love this movie. I do not have. I was able to prevail, but it was close.
