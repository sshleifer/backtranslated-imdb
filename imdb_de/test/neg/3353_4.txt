Threadless Horror Trip has an innocent girl (Meg Tilly, as always appealing) trying to get along well with the popular clique at school (though she apparently hate her), and lets herself be subdued to her sisterly attitude: spending the night in a spooky mausoleum , Despite the total absence of originality, the low-budget thriller creates some sizable special effects and some good performances (especially from Robin Evans, who infiltrates Campy's viciousness as the girl's leader). The script is not razor-sharp, but it has enough quirks to make the process a bit bearable. ** from ****
