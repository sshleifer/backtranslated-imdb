It pretends to be the life of the apostle Paul. It opens when he was involved in a loincloth fight with a priest. The Pharisees were so named because they "parted" with Hellenism imposed on them by their pagan leaders. The point is that Saul was never involved in Greco-Roman wrestling. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we have the two men (Saul and the priest, Reuben - a totally extra-biblical fictional character), who are washed away naked in a Roman bathhouse. Again, the Torah, in which Saul held on religiously, which was severely condemned to the nakedness of another man. Reuben shows that he is the one who urges Saul to destroy the church. Again, the text of Scripture does not matter because it is PAUL who says he devastated the church and exhaled threats and battles against the church. <br /> <br /> The film shows Barnabas "splash" Paul - do not baptise (dive) him, with the text of Scripture saying it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> They do not mention Mark or his repentance, so the authors of the script are forced to do so. Paul and Barnabas are arguing over Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of his separation. No Silas in Paul's second and third mission; No Timothy ... EVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, no, no! It is said that James "knew Jesus for a long time" and not, as the text of Scripture says, that he was the brother of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Why is not the movie called "Frank, the." fictional apostle?!?! "At least that would be closer to the text of the script.
