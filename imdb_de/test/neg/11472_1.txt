I saw the director's cut last night ... glad it could be rented for free, even a dollar would have been too much for me to have seen this attempt at "Film Noir". The anachronisms (modern phones) were annoying to me, not smart and seemed more like budget constraints. The "non-traditional" casting was also distracting. If I have to stop following the story, ask myself, "What the hell is the black chick / drag queen doing there?" then the storyteller failed me. Again, not smart in my opinion, but annoying and irritating, and very film school graduation project. And, for God's sake, if you want to shoot in black and white, you should at least use some of the techniques used in old films that have the advantage of having no color. There were no nuances in the lighting, no grayscale, no depth, no texture ... just black and just white ... boring!
