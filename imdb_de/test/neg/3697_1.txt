I saw this movie because it had a huge person and was called a monster movie. I do not understand why it's called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I expected a lot of destruction, but what did I get? The film was mainly about relationship issues and people thought a woman was an idiot because, for some inexplicable reason, she saw a spaceship fall with a giant inside. The action started a few minutes towards the end. Has not the woman been murdered since the woman was killed? Could not they have done anything but kill her? If you see this because you expect it to have something to do because it's labeled as a monster movie, do not look at it. It is not a monster movie. It is a drama.
