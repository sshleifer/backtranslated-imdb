My God, how bad that is. Who is this cheater pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart, multi-layered satire and humor of his show with penetrating toilet humor. This was obviously an attempt to publicize him in the States before he released his show on HBO. A commentator here argues that we do not judge the movie for the show's content because of the different media , While it is true that the standard format of the show could never be transferred to the big screen, Mr. Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the intelligent use of his comic style in a more conventional movie plot. Instead, we have this mess that, quite frankly, has nothing to do with Ali G except the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Find the DVDs of Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling for a real Ali G.
