This movie is so horrible that it is funny, not quite on Troll 2, but still funny. The drama is terrible, the music is cruel and history makes no blind sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a horrible grandma costume who kills a lot of people at a party. The death scenes are so badly made that they are funny. A girl is repeatedly stabbed in the chest, but does not scream, does not try or defend herself or does not run away. She also manages to stop, although she has been repeatedly stabbed. Another death scene with a rope is also extremely funny. No thought seems to have been put into the story. Grandma seems to magically move from one area to another (eg, hiding under leaves in a woodland, right where the victim is standing, appears to somebody even though it was behind them ten seconds ago), people kiss extremely inappropriate moments (would you stop kissing someone if they were chased by a murderous maniac), and the double twist at the end is absolutely ridiculous, it just seems like they're just throwing it to people confuse. I would advise people to watch this movie if they love terrible horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but not if you're expecting a scary horror movie. You will be disappointed
