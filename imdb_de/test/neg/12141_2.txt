I grew up with the "Bowery Boys" on the weekends, and even at a young age I found that, as the name implies, this was low rental cost. Still, it was fun to see Satch (Hall) beat Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs beat him with the crap. The East Side Kids material was never shown, even though it was public domain material and was probably cheap to run. It was just too low for hiring children, even though we only had 5 channels available. Enter 2005 and I'm back in my childhood. I can not find Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found The East Side Kids both on CD and on a public domain. Luckily, I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz on the net for free, and it really gets going. Now I can see that there are a few Bowery Boys here and maybe some bad movie lovers who gave this melodrama decay 7 out of 10, but come on, guys, that's not even trying to be funny. It's a drama of the East Side Kids, not a comedy, so it's not good. The best thing was to see Muggs fight in the end. He reminded me that my school days fluttered like a girl when I got into a fight. It was a bit abusin. Leonard Maltin said in his mini bio that this strip is one of the better, so you can easily imagine the rest. If you want to see some halfway decent East Side action, you might see Ghosts on The Loose, but the bottom line is usually a comedy team that starts and rejuvenates. These cups sucked Chucks in early and then slowly caught up, until Hall's antics dominated when they were the best. Still the second stage below the three henchmen who imitate them, but amusing for those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring back any pleasant "Bowery Boys" memories and should be left to monogram fanatics.
