Another movie about a hardened adult who meets a lovable, street-cult kid (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And once again, it is not funny or interesting to see for everyone - children or adults. I'm sure some people may find this movie amusing, but I have no earthly idea why. Once again, I feel sorry for the poor children who were forced to work in this film, so that everyone else and their parents could earn some money at the price of a cheesy, cheesy movie.
