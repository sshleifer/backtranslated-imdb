This is definitely a "lesser known" comedy from the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was that it was on a DVD from Kino Films with Non-Laurel and Hardy Shorts with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but on average average to below average for the feature film. Compared to shorts from Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely one step ahead in quality and humor. Even the accompanying music was pretty bad compared to other silent DVDs. In the end, I turned off the sound because the music was inappropriate to create the right mood. Nevertheless, they are still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest with this short speech. It was the last of 8 on this DVD, and when I got to it, I was pretty bored with the mediocre of 7 of the 8 shorts. So it's possible that the movie A LITTLE is better than a 4 - but if that's the case, no better than a 5! The movie is a pretty normal short film about an incompetent pageboy. Nothing particularly interesting and there are certainly MUCH better quiet shorts.
