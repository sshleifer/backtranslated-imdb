As a kid, I never understood why anyone would watch this very shitty show. It was pretty dumb and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to get into some kind of fatal accident (they were so annoying). Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude towards the cartoon. Although I still think it was total crap, this only affects the American version of the show. I read a book about anime and found out that the shows we saw growing up were completely different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots responsible for syndicating the series thought it was too violent, so they cut it out of the episodes. That's bad enough, but what else they did is unimaginable - they actually cut the episodes apart and put them together into shows that were NOTHING like the originals! For example, an episode could consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! So I really do not know if the original show was really bad - it could have been brilliant. But who knows, all that can be seen is the Americanized mess!
