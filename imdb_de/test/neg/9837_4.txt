This is one of those classic B movies after the exploits of 2 Hobos. It's really cheesy and Big Stupid runs off of one-liners like a cardboard box. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as Creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the voice of the father, which is 10 octaves higher ("You loved her?"). Danny, Big Stupid's protégé, is surprisingly stupid, but not as despicable as our lead star. There is also a strange scene where a guy in the diner is a pimp. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive nice girl and probably the least annoying one. And those yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and alcohol is evil, according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shout. Take a look at the MST cover of this and Crow's grandiose Elam tribute!
