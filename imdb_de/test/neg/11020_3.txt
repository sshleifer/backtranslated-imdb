After watching the television commercial for this movie, I marched into my local movie theater and expected a lot of laughter. In the end, it was one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent. The Wog Boy really failed with a story that had enough substance to sustain my interest, and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes did not fill that gap. The dance floor of their local nightclub was the only one that really impressed me. The only figure worth watching was "Nathan," played by Stephen Curry of The Castle. His struggle with the opposite sex was responsible for most of the few laughs. Save time and just look at the TV commercial, as the only laughs are displayed on it.
