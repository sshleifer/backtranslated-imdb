People call a 976 "party line" to dirty talk to strangers, and maybe make a sexual connection. A confused, slightly incestuous sister and occasionally a transvestite brother use the line to kill, mostly married men, but they do not discriminate! A pair of sixteen-year-old girls also call the leadership for fun and pretend to be older. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who is hot for her (or anyone else). In the meantime, a vice police officer is being loaned out when he first discovers one of the siblings' victims. He has teamed up with an assistant public prosecutor. Nothing special here. As a police chief, Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo. One of the dirty speakers of the sixteen-year-old is played by an actress, who also pronounced the peanuts character Peppermint Patty. According to the IMDb, the other died quite young, just a few years after this film: sad.
