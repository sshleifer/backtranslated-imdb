Lovely music. Nice photography, some scenes are stunning and impressive. However, the dramatic tension is lost in a film so badly cut it's hard to know what's going on. Sometimes the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. He should be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm. We see dozens of farm workers sweaty and dirty in the hot sun. Then we see Gere, who looks like he just walked away from a Calvin Klein ad. Sam Shepard, another type of glamor, is said to be terminally ill. But he looks good. Nice try, but it just does not work. Brook Adams tries hard, but she gets lost in the countryside. The real star is the girl.
