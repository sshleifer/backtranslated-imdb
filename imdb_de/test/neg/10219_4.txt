According to Randolph Scott's standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing Western star. Two or three of the characters could be left out, while two or three other characters could get more meaning. (The humor has to be completely rewritten.) De Toth, as usual, treats the action well, but his understanding of the general narrative is weak.
