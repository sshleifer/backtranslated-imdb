I like to admit that I see a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are as bad as When Women Had Tails. It's a stinker of epic proportions. A sexy comedy about a group of cavemen who first saw a woman was a boring, lifeless affair without a single laugh. The comedy is extremely weak. I think if you think you hit someone in the head is funny, you could find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like fine art. And there just is not enough plot to hold this thing together. It always seems to move on. <br /> <br /> Well, you might ask, "If it's as bad as you say, why did not you rate it under 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First, the film is not without curiosity. I find some interest in an Italian parody of films like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. When Women Had Tails I give a point for its historical "value". The other two points concern the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not a big explanation or justification for a review, but what will you do? It is the best that I can find.
