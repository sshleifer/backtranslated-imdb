The only thing that makes this watch look, is the performance of Corey as a madman. What remains is a most impossible story of revenge and marital discord. During the walkie-talkie scenes, I felt that Cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device. What's interesting about this is that Alan Hale (the skipper of "Gilligan's Island") is not that fat yet and he can still lower his arms below his waist. Otherwise, there is not much to recommend.
