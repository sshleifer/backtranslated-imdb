Some movies you watch and you say, "Well, that did not make sense." And you do not really mean it that way. They just say that things were too complicated or a bit nonsensical. <br /> <br /> "Bread And Circus" makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And that's not because it's surreal. It's pretty clear from the beginning that it's a weak excuse to spatter special effects. There is no script. There is no conspiracy. There is no story. One event does not lead to another - so basic is the bad writing here. <br /> <br /> So what? I mean, there are tons of movies that fall into this category. They want to show you Gore, they give you Gore. Why talk about it at all? <br /> <br /> Because in this case "bread and circus" gave me hope. Okay, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas in the ground - people crawl out of them. The earth in space, two legs on each side. These kinds of pictures are wonderful, funny, funny and crazy. But the movie does not do anything with them. <br /> <br /> Stuff happens, the movie ends and it's all very unsatisfactory. I suspect the script was created "on the fly". Too bad. If there was a story of ANY kind, it would have resulted in a much more entertaining film. <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to the beautiful car you would like. Then lift the bonnet and there is no engine. Just a little man selling a bike. <br /> <br /> GRR!
