I always say "There is nothing better than a good movie". And I have to say, that was nothing like a good movie! Dirty, boring and boring. It was like one of those bad dreams that never end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. I do not mind the concept of a film without words (eg entering a fantasy or dream world), but there has to be something to conquer your imagination, not just empty images, as it is in this movie. There seemed to be no evolution of the characters, and it went from scene to scene so fast that it was hard to spot a story. (Was there a story at all?) It could be said that the actors did their best, but unfortunately the bad direction has sabotaged the work of the actors. It really seemed to be a kind of cinematic masturbation that only the director and nobody else would like. Great waste of time.
