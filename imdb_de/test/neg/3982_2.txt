This movie had an interesting plot about clones and organ usage, but it fails because the lead actor is so annoying and weepy that you want to see him dead. Not that anyone else is very good at it, but if you hate the character that is supposed to gain sympathy, the movie just will not work. Funnily, it looks like a movie will be released in the near future that contains an action that reflects it with more action and better cast. Nevertheless, I can not imagine anything else than this movie could be seen. This movie has a super stupid clone that's smart enough to figure out something is wrong with its camp, where people ride bikes a mile an hour and wrestle for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they're ready to go to America, but our "hero" has doubts, so he snoops around and learns the terrible truth that sends him to flight, from the bad guys, to the guy shoot again and again. He is looking for the man from whom he was cloned. Peter Graves is there and Dick Seargent too, but they do not add anything to this film that looks like something made for television. On the positive side, when "The Island" comes out, the creators of this movie can proudly say, "We thought about it first."
