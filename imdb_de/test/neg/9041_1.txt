*** SPOILERS *** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK - is probably the worst movie ever made, and is just brilliant. A sexy, rich girl works with a sturdy action man to search for her sister in the jungle of New Guinea. What follows is an unspeakable mix of cannibalism, crazy cults, and religious madmen that must have been seen. The cannibalistic scenes are pretty awful, but so poorly staged and played that they prove to be amusing. The actors are terrible except for Janet Agren's female lead, which is excellent. Watch out for the scene where she's naked and covered in gold paint! My rating - 1 out of 10.
