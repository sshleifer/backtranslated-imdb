Ocean's Twelve: just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> An art robbery. At least 10 well-known actors. A weak script and a very slow idea. That's why I characterize a movie I've only seen for at least 20 minutes. Do not get me wrong, you may like it. But I like the movies of the ocean just because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 is not about Heist, what's the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his main mistake and broke through a film that was far superior to the first film. A big compliment for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not a really good director. Apart from his hit "Sex Lies and Videotapes", nothing other than the career of this director happened. Shame on him. But only his fault.
