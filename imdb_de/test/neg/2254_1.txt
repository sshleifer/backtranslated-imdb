The disappointment that seriously disappointed Brad Pitt and QT is very superficial and lame. If not indirectly intended, this film glorifies the Nazis and damnably depicts them as men of honor. (THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER) Hitler, along with the most famous Nazis, is less involved in a stupid movie about the murder of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris The Nazis laugh and marry every murder in the movie as if they were watching a STUPID basketball game, the deal in the end is lame.What's really terrible is that the movie received great reviews and was in the top 250 here in the 1940s It will not come as a surprise if it wins many prizes, including the Oscars, the film is just a kiss for the Jewish people, but hey, it's not even a great work, it put the entire Nazi Jew Conflict really in the shadows and a pure insult to all who fought under the tyranny of the Nazis and suffered.
