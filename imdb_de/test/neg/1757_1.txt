Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renne Zelwigger. They are all terrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It is headed by the same man who made the English patient, and it is based on a bestselling novel by a man who risks everything to return to his beloved, but in contrast to the wonderful English Pateinta, this movie is shit. It is really bad. <br /> <br /> Worst dialogues ever. "But we only know each other for a moment." "But there were a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "In some cultures just I have to marry you three times and you're married" lovey-dovey- "I'm marrying you, I'm marrying you, I'm marrying you, I'll marry you ... "<br /> <br /> I'm ashamed I've eaten everything. <br /> <br /> the whole movie was horrible, terrible ... Uhhh no words, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (the one is for the really loud ball sounds, the sound team did a good job)
