How is this a documentation? Rather like a walking ghost tour, which could be done in any city in the south. The offers were generously dropped without identifying the source. George Orwell was the best-identified quote. Documents were referenced without being produced in any way. Fraudulent recordings, which were the footage of the time, were put together alongside historical film roles without any separation from reality and self-promotion. Film roles that were completely unrealistic and unlikely in the near future were recorded as if they were trying to patter Blair Witch, hoping to stir up a haunted house on an otherwise dead real estate market. <br /> <br /> Is not this, in a sense, a major disregard for the actual victims of tuberculosis, a dance that dances on its collective graves for commercial reasons? The line between actual footage and self-service is so thin; the trickle of doubt played so insignificantly; The scientific boundaries were so obviously ignored ... how could this possibly be listed in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> This is a holiday activity, and it succeeds completely. Hell, I would visit the joint if I could find it on Google Earth. Not scary said a previous poster. Not too serious, I say. Fascinating story. Filigree filmmaking.
