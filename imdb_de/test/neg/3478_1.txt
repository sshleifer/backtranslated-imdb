Plankton or creatures from the Abyss, as I am convinced that it is more commonly rotated than & as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears above a moving image and starts with 20 in the same font as the rest of the credits. Clay Rogers), his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), the sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) & an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon), who all decide to fit into a small dinghy to the sea Do not ask why, because I do not know. Oh, and the idiot Bobby left the gas and never thought to tell anyone, so it's no big surprise that it lands at sea with no gasoline for the engine. To make matters worse, they get into a thunderstorm. Discover a dead in the water. Shortly thereafter, their luck seems to change as they encounter a yacht and potential safety. First they find a science lab with different fish samples and computer equipment, then they find downstairs furnished and luxurious cabins. You find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who looks crazy and can not speak. They eat fish from the fridge, causing Dorothy to stir up green vomit, bugs and snails. They learn that these fish are a thousand years old and have been contaminated by toxic waste in the sea and that they fly, mutate, bite and are generally uncomfortable. I really can not bother going on with this plot, so I will not do it, here's what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I would hide under a different name, though I would make such a bad movie) & I think Plankton is simply one of the worst movies ever. There are so many things in this film that it is difficult to know where to start. At first, the script of Richard Baumann is totally crap, it makes no sense at all and is so slow and boring that it was torture for me to sit through it. Why did five people simply take a dinghy into the middle of the ocean, barely big enough to accommodate them all? What were you planning to do? Why do we often get point of view shots of these fish creatures, but they seem to be completely invisible to the characters, as they are never shown on screen, even though they are right next to a figure, and how these fish are nearby, as it is no water for swimming? The actions and reactions of people to things are all wrong, they are constantly parting, they make bizarre decisions that just do not make sense in the situation they are in. Part of the dialogue is as horrible as anything I've heard. I could go through all the action holes and ridiculous events all day long, but I'm going out of the room if I did that. The fish creatures themselves look awful, a mix of garbage-rubber dolls and some really bad stop-motion animations at the end. The scenes in which they interact with the human performer also look awful, with a bad super-imposition. I've heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is bloody. Do not make me laugh! Forget it, there is virtually no blood or blood in plankton. There are a few slimy scenes in which Bobby turns into a fish monster while having sex with Julie, but it's pretty short and he does not kill her, he just drips mud on it, grows some tentacles and a fish head comes out of his mouth. Later, Julie's vagina begins to drip with dark slime, but that's it, we can never really see what's happening to her or what the slime is. Dorothy has a fish creature that came out of her back and controls her, but again we can not see what's happening to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very short shot of a plastic harpoon on her forehead. The coarsest scene is easy when Dorothy pukes the green stuff with bugs and snails. That's it, only one person actually dies on the screen. Plankton is mostly tame and as exciting as drying paint. I almost fell asleep, it's so boring. I can not see how anyone likes this crap, I just can not. The acting is awful, the dubbing is horrible, the characters are terrible and I hated everybody. Technically, plankton is predictable with an estimated budget of only $ 250,000. All I can say is where the money went? The sets are dull and boring with a lab and a few cabins, the special effects are the bottom of the barrel, including the most fake exploding boat of all time, the cinematography is bland, the music sucks there zero atmosphere or tension and as a whole plankton is as its name suggests, as low as possible in the food chain. I hate plankton, it's terrible in every aspect of the 86-minute duration. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs, unless you are either Masochist or Insomniac.
