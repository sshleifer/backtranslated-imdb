A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in a movie I recently saw on television: Indecent Proposal. The two protagonists of Indecent Proposal, David and Diane Murphy, are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. I am not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they did not do well, but why should we care so much about whether these two stay together was a mystery to me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction? None of this materialized on the screen in their interactions. <br /> <br /> Knowing that Robert Redford would show up at some point, it was clear from the beginning that the good, the flesh of the movie, would be scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson could not muster any emotion for the movie at all. He seemed to be holding back, busy with his receding hairline. <br /> <br /> OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are to think that they can win back the $ 50,000 they owe gambling. No theatrical faux pas, just terribly bad, lazy, unpardonable writing. Of course they lose all the money. Surprised? I dont know. Do you enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie)? a romantic, maybe emotionally cold man, an updated Gatsby. A very good role and not a great actor, Redford looks like Olivier next to these two. He falls in love and immediately falls in love with Diane and we feel the audience once. So you can love a woman! Not in the way of David drifting mouth to mouth with Diane on a slimy pier. (Did I see that correctly?) As a gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes, it should show the seemingly brain-dead audience that this is a rich man, but it also looks damn good and at this point, the brain-dead audience appreciates that! Other wardrobe imagery includes David's now ironed shirts at the end of the film that mean determination and come together after a long interlude of a forgotten, crumpled shirt. <br /> <br /> And what about the California Garden parties, as shown in Hollywood movies? Suddenly everyone appears British, complete with lace dresses, three-piece suits for the men, hats (HATS!) And of course the umbrella. Yes, Diane, her transformation into Rich Man's fianc√©e is now complete, and at the auction, a parasol turns gloomy. Although she insisted that she could not be bought, she eventually succumbed to sexual tension. Here, the film branches to pure Americana. I mean, David and Diane will end up together, of course, my question is WHY? Diane was bored with David, why would not she let the Robert Redford wave ride? And I mean for a long time? How can she easily pull herself out of the sexually romantic Thrall of this sexy older man just because Woody Harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party, sits down and looks Demi Moore in the eye. It just does not work that way. He was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But we have to have our happy ending. We have to swallow the moral lesson. We are not sophisticated enough to be different. Director Lyn has been trying to create a fatal attraction for the Juvie group, the Young'uns. In addition to garden parties where there is no SUV, T-shirt or baseball cap, such films are also in sight have a reliable public transport system that connects distant California cities and towns. How can one symbolize the return to the middle class or the life of the working class?
