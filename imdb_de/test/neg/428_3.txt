This movie would probably have been fine if it had not used CGI (computer-generated imagery) for the werewolf scenes. As a result, the creatures were faked and the werewolves looked cartoonish from Twister. But if we see a movie in which the creature must look absolutely real, CGI is not the way to go. Take a look at An American Werewolf in London. No CGI. Just make-up and a mechanical creature, and what you imagine was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel. This movie had some jokes that were fun, and the humor in this movie seemed to attract me, but it was nothing more than a movie that I thought was OK. And that's not good enough. In my opinion, an American werewolf in Paris does not stand up to the original.
