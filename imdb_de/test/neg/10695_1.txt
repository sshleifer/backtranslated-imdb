This is the worst movie I have ever seen, so bad is it amazing.

How did anyone get the money to put together this movie? Is there a society in Hollywood that deals with garbage for male students without brain? "Oh yes, they will love this one: there is no credible plot, some Kung Fu moves, Chuck Norris, a black buddy with bad honking, a sweet little Israeli (or is he an Arab or is anyone taking care of you?) Pickpocket and the devil. "Brilliant and many thanks to all who enriched humanity.
