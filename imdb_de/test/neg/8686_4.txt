Max Cash, a captain of the charter boat, who works off the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah, who is looking for the legendary boat El Diablo and his stolen treasure, which sank in the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to protect the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew it were killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who felt that this would be a horror feature. Instead, we ended up with a budget-priced B-grade movie from the late '80s that had recorded the deep-sea adventure movie "The Deep" in 1977, but with a bewildering supernatural origin and a riddle. The story is a tawdry mess (so many inconsistent angles make no sense and promote a spotty pace) and the technical side is clunky. Beautiful exotic location and underwater photography. Even the carefree performances were not bad. A lousy Wayne Crawford is funny and June Chadwick is fair next to him. Sheri Able is pretty much a feast for the eyes. There are some bizarre developments that amuse one or two sinister sequences. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. Most cutaway deaths occur off-screen, except for the bloody, lazy opening kills that were carried out by something invisible. Again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. The music is generic with its dull hints to warn us of approaching the danger, and the POV shots work well. Tatty, but observable.
