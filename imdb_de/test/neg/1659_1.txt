I constantly review movies on this site but usually do not write comments. In that case, however, I felt compelled to WARN OTHERS! This movie is bad! It is probably one of only a dozen films that I have rated as "1 (awful)". I know, people say that all the time, but that was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's easily under the last ten anyway. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I'll overlook all sorts of inferior filmmaking for good fear. But this movie is embarrassing. It looks like someone bought a video camera from Sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies. (The fact that the name of each crew member is included in the cast list proves this theory, I think.) This film has lower production standards than average high school games. It's actually a bit shocking to see a movie that looks so bad on DVD. The special effects are sometimes effective, but amateurish at best. The best thing to say about the actors is that they at least spend most of their time not looking at the camera. I can not say with certainty if they have trouble remembering their lines or coming up with them. Every attempt of humor is lame. This movie is such a huge waste of time.
