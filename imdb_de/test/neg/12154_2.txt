I'm really surprised that this means 88% for Rotten Tomatoes and a nomination for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. The rating of 7.3 on IMDb ... is no surprise as users of IMDb recently voted. I just can not get into a movie that clearly distorts the facts about its main character, not so much that the movie becomes artistic, but more melodramatic and less boring. This actually makes it very boring for anyone who expects a serious and credible interpretation of the life of Genghis Khan. The far-fetched and over-dramatized Mongol is often reminiscent of 300, a movie that could not be happier than being ridiculously inaccurate; However, unlike 300 Mongolian takes seriously. It's stoically serious, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies that make it a really boring movie I've seen this year. possibly the most action or biopic movie I've ever seen. The characters were written pathetically. I doubt that Genghis Khan was as boring and passive as shown in this movie. What's funny for me, because if there's something I think should be changed from a theatrical point of view, then a boring person turns into an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Borte is similarly boring, simple and stupid. Without betraying anything, Mongol contains the only stupidest scene I've seen in a long time - in which it would take a good 20 minutes to develop the plot, the film jumps on without explanation. It looked like a Saturday Night Live sketch parodying epic action movies at a dreadful pace. (Did I mention how serious Mongol takes on himself?) Meanwhile, it's like no movie I've ever seen before. Even now, I swore it was three hours long. After about 45 minutes, I checked the time and was pretty sure she was almost done. Apart from a beautiful backdrop and quality of Asano (of course), Mongol is honestly just a disaster. It absolutely did not entertain or enlighten me. I would never give this movie a second chance. And not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me a trashy and thoughtless American epic about Mongol every day. At least then I know what I'm getting, unlike Mongol, where the reviews and reviews made me believe that it was really worth seeing. I have friends that I know I would undoubtedly love.
