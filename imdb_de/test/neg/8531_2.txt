Well, at least we have to admit that the big Hollywood horror producers are getting smarter and more empathetic. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and then remake them in America, they now discovered that they could simply hire the Asian directors and hire them to make their brand-new ghost story straight in the States. It's like killing two birds with one stone. Way, guys! "The Messengers" is virtually identical to any other supernatural chiller that has come from the Oriental countries since "Ringu". Roughly translated, this means that it is a boring, overlong and completely bloodless film, but it contains plenty of false horrors and embarrassingly weak "Have we scared you?" Moments Earlier, the Pang Brothers (Danny & Oxide) had made the extremely overrated "The Eye" and it is a tradition for them to build a story with clues and clues to a point where it is almost impossible to meet the expectations of their curious meet audiences, but they do not seem eager to change their formula anytime soon. And they are so ruthless that they use the same old and repetitive ghost themes again and again. Restless ghosts of former residents trapped in the walls of a secluded farmyard? The protagonist family, which has been torn apart by unprocessed traumas from the past, so they first have to regain trust and confidence? Give me a break! Insert a videotape and a seven-day curse. Why not? Even attempts to lift you into your seat are too déjà-vu and scare anyone over 7 years old. Hitting doors, dirty and increasingly larger stains on the walls, ghostly apparitions, noises from the basement. The endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost offensive to horror fans. "The Messengers" revolves around a family that leads a new life in the country as a breeder of sunflowers. The family situation is somehow dysfunctional, with a personal tragedy (uncovered late in the movie) causing her youngest son to stop talking and the parents distrusting her suspicious teenage daughter. Soon after, the children in remote farmhouses experience strange presence, but they fail to convince their parents to leave. This completes the entire movie. Little Ben sees things, but he can not speak and Jessica is repeatedly attacked by supernatural powers, but no one listens to her. The basic assumption of "The Messagers" is very derived from Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", only he lacks the ever-threatening atmosphere and disturbing tone. The script takes itself too seriously, though it's pretty easy to predict the final resolution and total absence of violence and bloodshed. At least "The Eye" has brought some real shocks at the end, while the ending of "The Messenger" is simply pathetic. The only positive elements I can think of are the beautiful rural locations, the appropriate workmanship and the promising young acting talent (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And there is an eerie, but unfortunately underdeveloped supporting role for William B. Davis.
