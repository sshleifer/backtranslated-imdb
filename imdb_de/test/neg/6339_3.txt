The disappointing comedy drama with a sentimental coating makes Michael J. Fox ideally act as a former child star who now operates a talent agency for the dead boys. Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. While this sounds like it could not be missed, too much of the scenario is left to the quirky Christina Vidal as Streetwise Tyke, whom Fox believes will be the next big thing. They quickly lock their heads, and the jocular dialogue leads them back and forth to an uninteresting formula end. Fox and Lane are both appealing, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to the syrup. Slickly produced, but ultimately stale. * 1/2 of ****
