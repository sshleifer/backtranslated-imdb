The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became Gingesh Khan. I knew that Mongolia and all the places where the movie was played have beautiful scenery, but the movie did not benefit from it. The jokes were really poor. The narrator, Gingesh himself, could have told a little bit more about Mongolian history, traditions and so on. I was so looking forward to this movie, but I was very disappointed. It was one of three films I have ever seen in the cinema where I thought before the end I would go.
