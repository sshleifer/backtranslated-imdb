No shortage of female meat, but still not interesting! At least Lenzi is likely to be able to peak at Spasmo and start Kiss Me Kill Me. The release of the Hard Gore R2 DVD can be shortened to 86 minutes, but this film contains a victim's cannibalism effect - a scene with a native girl who is brutalized and disenchanted by the cannibal trunk we are warned about and who later set fire to some huts. Arsonist Holocaust? Firestarter Fernox anyone? <br /> <br /> Certainly not a cannibal movie, but has there ever been a decent movie? Avoid.
