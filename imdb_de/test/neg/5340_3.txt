Well, it's a Monogram quickie from the dreaded 1940s era when poverty studies brought out many "horror movies" that are almost unimaginably boring. <br /> <br /> The story is about a doctor who has worked on a path to restore the lives of the dead by using a room full of non-useful electrical appliances that create a nice spark. Beneath a bell hangs a dog's heart that twitches uneasily, what we know is proof that its method is perfected, the inevitable death of a young man being revived in a rather undramatic order - and undramatic even at the sparks. The important plot is that a convicted murderer is executed at midnight, which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived. It is no surprise that the young man is very different in his experience; apparently amnesic and with a strange desire to visit the places of the underworld and meet certain gangsters ... It is difficult to explain why this is not totally unsurpassable, but perhaps it is enough to say so. It is mildly interesting and contains several Murders and some interesting characters. Towards the end, it even starts to move with some tension and a confrontation that is almost Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I must warn against a very, very bad end. A superfluous, painful end. After the plot has been resolved quite effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know something ... it's all a dream. Never happened.
