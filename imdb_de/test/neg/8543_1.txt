Franco films can be divided into 4 categories - the "Earlies" (often black and white and imaginative), the "naughty" (end of the 1960s / early 1970s, often with Soledad Miranda), the "Nudies" (from different eras , but fully frontal female nudity as a plot drive) and "the rest". <br /> <br /> This is part of the "rest". It is not a cannibal movie at all. It is certainly not a gorefest. The few women in the picture do not even lose their loincloths, and there is little frontal stuff at all. The picture quality on the German DVD is bad. The movie is running out (if it catches fire at all). As a Franco fan, I would tell others that they should not bother. Do something different with your time ... read a book ... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... really everything ...
