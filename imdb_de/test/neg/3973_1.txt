Parts: The clonus horror is alright a horror. Of course, there are the bad fashions of the late 70s. There's the really bad show from Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones. Their days are mostly running, jumping, cycling and wrestling. If they do not do that, they learn something about America. Not the band America or the song of Neil Diamond, but an America in which they become part of a larger society. But they get a strange drug, then they've drained all body fluids (General Ripper was right!) And are put in the freezer and wait for Thanksgiving or Christmas when they are thawed and fried at about 450 degrees. Oops, that does not happen, but it would be much more interesting than what's shown. Mario, known as "Super Mario Brothers," is a wonderful cameo as a doctor fighting with Dick Sargent.
