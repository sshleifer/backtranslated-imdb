First of all, that I am a big fan of JJL and NOT of Patrick. That's why I looked at it to see its performance and it was excellent, of course. I do not think the director was right for the film because of several very bad decisions: skew, jam, etc. When the director tried to give him a "realistic" feel, they failed and lost some good performances. Almost always, I found the camera too static, too far from intense facial reactions - and so often, when the plot depended on the intimacy of the main characters, the dialogue was slow and laborious. This could easily have been resolved by cropping or changing the camera angle. But I had the impression that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also had the impression that maybe scenes were shot several times and the energy of the actor ... was used up.
