Like a terrible cancer that rained from the sky, I recently walked in a pot channel in this pot. Since I'm a fan of bad movies and actively involved in buying and watching the bad movie, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​a really awful-looking action movie from the modern age. However, after that had calmed down, my hands inexplicably turned against me, reaching for something within reach and bumping my head and neck. Something scary was in this tape ... um ... where was I ... anyway, this is one of the most embarrassing movie pieces I've ever met. William Forsythe can no longer play as a figure and this character is always a joke. Even if he is put on a comic background and has things to do that are considered funny (ala Deuce Bigalo), he is ridiculous in the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is pretty much the same after playing in her horrible films and doing terrible jobs in each one of them. The classic B-movie villain Andrew Divoff does a respectable job, but has barely a scene to hold on to. Even the reliable standby mode for B-movie action Daniel Bernhardt creates nothing that borders on entertainment. As far as the movie's own merits are concerned, the plot is lame, the script is just as boring as the action and the plot action and ... well, stupid, because there is no better adjective (the Lord knows they have not set any Trouble, why should I?). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has watched enough movies has seen some bad ones, and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them, but here there is simply nothing to be enjoyed, unless They are among the worst film tolerants and just feel inclined to test their courage. Before you do so, take it from me, it's not even terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike the ... more ridiculous Italian zombie movies). A fan of B-movie action would be much better if you look at most of Bernhardt's other films, or just about anything that's ever been filmed on this issue. America is simply not the place to trade, especially now. If you have a craving, look all over the oceans, movies like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider (along with everything else in the awesome Keita Amemiya cannon) are much more fun and action-packed than anywhere else , most off all here.
