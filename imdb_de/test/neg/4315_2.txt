This is total schnapps. If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck out all the good stuff, lots of twisted, kinky bondage parts, some rape scenes, and add one or two truly scary scenes, you'll get this movie. People call it a rip-off of The Hitcher in the '86s, but I do not see it at all. Even the worst Hitcher rip-offs are still better. The main problem shown here is that there is really nothing here, except for some of the director's fetishists, who are presented like circus exhibitions. Is everything you need from a movie when girls are abused and tied up and cowering in fear? Well, then lend this movie! <br /> <br /> I would rather just watch a good movie, which is clearly not the case. The sad part is that there are some really good thrills waiting to be discovered, but only a few. For example, the tension at the beginning of bondage nonsense ... pretty damn good, if you ask me. And the scene in which the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (can not remember names) is daunting, very brutal and even challenges The Devil's Rejects for rampant rage. How come that the rest of the movie can not be that good? Huh I really must stop renting stupid crap. Closing message: Just let this gutter die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
