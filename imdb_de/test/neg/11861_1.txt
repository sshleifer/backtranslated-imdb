Anyone who writes that this is some good kid there might have worked on it or put money into this horrible college experiment. It was bad, slow and painful to look at. The runtime of only about 84 minutes felt after three and a half hours. The only culprit is the director, who has no idea how to steer a scene where the camera is placed! 95% of this horrible movie was shot with long master shots. Two or three people who are in the picture or forever talking (or how it seems forever), No close-ups !! No medium sized shots !! There are two so-called battle scenes in which any filmmaker with a brain would have taken close-up or medium-sized shots for them. They looked very amateurish. The scenes in which father and son scream at each other could have worked better if only the father or only the son who acts or responds was cut off. Tri-C must be very humbled to show this everywhere. I have seen some bad movies in my time, some of which are fun because they are so bad that this is not one of them.
