Wow, Jeez, I do not know where to start commenting on what they call a movie. I really do not know what the hell David Bradley started smoking after he did Hard Justice, which in my opinion was a good movie after the American Ninja movies. I had not seen any of this man's last films after Cyborg Cop. Luckily, I saw them at Amazon for £ 5 each, and I can safely say this: If I dumped the £ 5 I spent on Total Reality, Crisis, and Expect to Die, I'd end up happier been when it was needed Sit through the 90 minutes each of them had. My God, how can HECK call these "movies"? And why fall action / martial arts actor knee-deep into the stinking horse manure when they have reached their peak? I mean, David Bradley is not an Oscar-chaser, but his first movies were pretty entertaining. A tough, cool guy with pretty good martial arts who did some crazy lines, but entertained action and martial arts fans at least to some extent. But I really would like to know what this guy went through after he did Hard Justice. To be honest, his last 3 films have to be the BADEST that I've ever had to win. As already mentioned, I would like to buy back my money on the 3 DVDs that I bought. The crisis was the epitome of drowsiness, Total Reality was tough, but this "Expect to Die" is just nonsense. I bet the director was either Megasteiner when he did that, or he just took the piss out of any David Bradley fan who was sitting in that bastard. The story revolves around a doctor (Bradley) who creates a kind of virtual reality game in which he kills only several people in a row. I'm sorry, but I just could not take this guy seriously, playing a villain with this posh hairstyle, glasses, and gray pants and absolutely NO physical fights (honestly, his best asset). The movie is even worse than any of these Saturday afternoon B movies, because acting is ridiculous, the direction is terrible, and the few fights in the movie, well, what can I say ... The actors look like they're training with them her fitness buddy. We get a stupid, muscular cop who shows off his fighting stuff like an hour in the movie and fails hard ... a French-haired version of Van Damme who just can not fight, act or speak to save his crazy life and Bradley, the supposed protagonist, played the evil doctor, for whom I was really happy when he stopped doing this kind of consumable. I even suspect that he did not kick in this movie, probably because of his heart problems that have already affected him. For a B-actor, I have to admit that I really liked that guy, his style, his body, his martial arts ... But I'm really glad he stopped after this monstrosity because I honestly could not sit through another ninety minutes of material for peeing like this. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a family of David Bradley. You'll be glad you did.
