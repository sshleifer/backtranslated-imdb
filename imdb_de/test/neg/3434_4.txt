So I got that from the rental business I work in before it's released (release is 8/21). I looked at it today and am now speechless. They could have had a decent movie here, but they messed it up in a painful, obvious way. <br /> <br /> First of all, the parts with John Krasinski were funny and the only reason why I mentioned him above 3, but they are due to bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections on life between the main character (Andrew Keegan ) and his girlfriend (the annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better than a straight comedy like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it because I think Krasinski is funny and wants to do him good. The story was not bad, just not original. But the direction (and a lot of acting) was terrible. I swear they had a hard time keeping people's faces in the shot, and still just dealt with it. <br /> <br /> Your carelessness is shown when the weapon expert corrects another character and says that a "Dirty Harry" weapon is not. 357 Magnum, but a .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 Magnum). <br /> <br /> See this if you really like 1 - John Krasinski 2 - if you see low-budget (and bad) -directed movies or 3- have too much time (that's me!)
