This was a modest attempt in a movie, though it seemed more like a trained TV pilot. <br /> <br /> Some people think that's unfair, but it looks like someone has seen "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance". and thought "Hey, I could too." Well, not quite. <br /> <br /> While I personally felt the movie was predictable, doing something bad and constructing (pay attention to the cookies), Carl Payne shows that he can take a lead role and be back on TV. The main actress (can not remember her name, I'm sorry) was plausible too, but you always think of Julia Stiles (she was the one in "Save the Last Dance, right?"), Because these are really in "white girls" stuck "mode.
