For me, this movie was a disappointment. Somehow I had expected that it would explain the reason for the popularity of General Rommel and his success as a military strategist during World War II. But there's nothing like it, it's about the last year or two of his life, and in a way, he's trying to wash it. So I have to assume that Rommel was first and foremost an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquest and killing business, with no particular charm or notoriety in behavior. Such real-life people just do not make good footage. I'm almost sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to embody a pretty wooden figure. Actually, a good director and great acting talent had been wasted on this movie? with the exception of Luther Adler, who represents a truly memorable and strangely naturalistic representation of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> There could also be a cultural problem for people like me who belong to the German-speaking world. Famous British actors who embody Germans are simply not believable. For example, Rommel is not only perceived as a German, but as a typical "Southerner" from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. You immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain joke, a certain way of seeing the world (the sum) the opposite of, say, a Prussian ?? Junker "). I also believe that the attempted assassination on July 20 is inconsistent: many of the conspirators were not Democrats and just wanted German troops to join the Western Allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (prolonging the war forever) br /> <br /> By the way, General Patton can for a brief moment be seen in the extensive documentary films for this film, in which he inspects passing vehicles The open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl handles are clearly visible!
