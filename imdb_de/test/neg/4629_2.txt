Sex is an extremely remarkable aspect of existence. It is perhaps the most interesting activity between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN examines the sexuality of man dry and boring. Actually, it's worse than just boring. Seeing naked 40-year-old is uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I think it's shocking when adults are as old as our parents talk about sex, but after that for twenty minutes, that stops being interesting. If the characters were all 20 years younger, the movie would be visually compelling. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth the time.
