Movie I have ever seen. Actually, I find it one of the most entertaining episodes of MST 3000 I've seen. Not that it was good, but for anyone who has seen Manos: The hands of fate know that these were not two bad ones. The monster in the movie looked awful, everyone wore bathing suits and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they made the monster. You have never given a good reason. The lead actress had to be the most terrifying girl I've ever seen. They would have done better if they had thrown Gal initially slaughtered as a lead. On the positive side the dolphins were great !!!
