It is unfortunate that many of the other critics of this film seem to be influenced by earlier distortions. (Rage on the gay characters, I think French thrillers are bad, etc.) I admit that I'm not familiar with the novel, but as a movie I turned my eyes after about 45 minutes. hopefully i can explain my complaints in an eloquent way before i'm tired of spending more than two hours in this movie and half a silent movie, 3 hour epic, i have no short attention span and i'm not that of the mtv either so exhausted that I can not appreciate a subtle and slowly building film. Here is my shopping list with complaints. First of all, the end. yes, there was a scooby-doo-quiz, the character explains everything in the end. Now I'm actually thinking for this movie, that was necessary. The movie had so many plot changes, emotional revelations, new facts that emerged and were discovered. One reviewer said it well: "... yes, it is a very logical story, but without the very important background story (her childhood stories, the relationship between the three parents, the relationship between the two love birds and the son of the Great Man) It just did not feel right ... I felt cheated "I won" If I threw too many spoilers here, I could call certain revelations that I thought were unnecessary, but according to the reviews here, there are many people who really do Personally I do not like soap operas, the complexity and twists and turns for me sparked any impact that the final revelations might be able to deliver, and in the end, it did not really interest me - it did not necessarily exist It seems like it could become a great book, WRITE it is perfect logically, but if I believe that this is REALITY, something is wrong with the pieces that were randomly inserted. Too often, I felt that key characters we never met were thrown in to further complicate the conspiracy, enhance emotions, and develop the mystery. The acting, about which I had no complaints, the directing, anyway, not bad, but the plot and especially their development, I was VERY MISS missing. Sorry for those who felt like this was a perfect thriller, but I could not get involved. I have given this a 3, simply because I do not want to appear completely unfair, and there were moments of easy intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * MAJOR SPOILER * and I have to mention it ... but if the father makes his revelation for Alexandre and JUST, if you think the plot could not fit into another twist ... " Your dad did not die in a hunting accident ".. I almost died .. when was the father even developed or even mentioned in the back story? !! are you serious!! Like the already complex plot, where characters from all families and their relationship to each other were not enough !!? Does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he already fed ?! Sorry, I had to insert such a spoiler, but that bothered me as much as I've ever seen in a movie.
