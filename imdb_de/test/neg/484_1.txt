I was exposed to this terrible apology for a television movie. I only looked at it because I have no cable and my only other choice was golf, college basketball or local news. The plot is very general and has no substance that I could see, not to mention that she had a big mistake in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen is a washed-out astronomer who believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will hit Earth, causing all life to come to a standstill. He bases his belief in the discovery of cave paintings of an Aborigine (I'm sure I wrote that wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline showing significant events in history, such as the building of the Great Wall of China. All events are displayed in perfect chronological order and the last image on the timeline is Earth's destruction. Well, if the picture showed things that had actually happened, why would the great doctor believe that he could somehow change what would happen? Apart from that, the film moved with extreme formula accuracy. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good and on some occasions I just felt that they did not even take the movie seriously enough to make enough effort to convince me that the characters are worth taking care of , The whole movie was clich√©d and a waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon every day for this crap. At least Armageddon has a good acting (by comparison), not to mention the fondness of Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, golf is not so bad ...
