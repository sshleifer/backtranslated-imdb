Although this is one of John Cusack's and Demi Moore's early films, even hardcore fans may miss them unless they absolutely must complete the collection. I rarely have moments where I can handle Better Off Dead, but this movie is worse. I'm just not a Savage Steve Holland fan and he made both films. So if you do not like the cheesy, random comedy and amateur animation, stay away from it. For your information also for the fans of Demi Moore: She can not sing and the synths of the 80s did not save her. There are too many predictable twists and too easy jokes. I think if you want mindless entertainment or something you can leave in the background and ignore while doing something productive, then do it. Otherwise, do not look at this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) could not save it, you know it must be bad. They're the only reason I did not give this movie a 1.
