The Untold ... is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story seems truly original, but it was badly put on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this crap. But he did a lot of low-budget movies ... you have to pay the bills, you know? Joke. Lance is a great actor, but in the end he has a lot of stupid actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was just there to have a nude scene, and other actors ... well, they were just there. There was always hiding the editing, and that makes me sick! That was the most horrible move that keeps on getting you really angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a bizarre pace that just ... goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Can not say more ... do not rent it or do not buy it. You can see it when on TV.
