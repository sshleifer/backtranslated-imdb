At least it is with this episode. Here is a time traveler, the professor of Gilligan's Island, dating back no less than 1865. What do you do - why save Lincoln, of course? There are no really interesting variations on this old theme. As another reviewer has said, this episode is particularly bleak and unstylic, and there is little evidence that "the professor" was actually back in the 1860s. Budget constraints are obvious and the direction is rigid. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but it remains a very shallow production. We feel too often on stage waiting for something clever. In the end there is a small twist, but I emphasize the small one.
