Sayles had a very interesting film with Silver City in his hand, which was very confused from beginning to end. Chris Cooper has done an extraordinary job that embodies the essence of his character, a kind of dubya, but he did not have nearly enough time on the screen. Instead, we're on a rage with a character that feels less personal, less developed and altogether too confusing. The path that Danny Huston leads us inevitably leads to the downfall of the film. Too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. These characters happened to be involved in the progression of the conspiracy, which became nested every minute. Sayles knew what he was creating, I just feel that it would not translate well to the screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles is a master of his trade. His films inspire and evoke thought, even if they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think he had too little money and not enough time to explain everything. At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of ​​what was going on, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more storylines occurred, I lost the sense of the movie through the end. While the end was very smart and very dark, I needed more explanations. I think the reason why I lost my train of thought with this film was the casting of Danny Huston as a leader. He was pathetic. I did not see him as a very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. He seemed to be walking through the movements, but not really achieving much. This was the first sinking of Sayles's important film. <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that the characters of Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I only needed a better leader. Help me to understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston just did not cut it for me. Outside the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. I sometimes had the feeling that if I was not deeply rooted in the political world, some of the clues were about my head. The entire rationale for the establishment of Silver City and the corruption behind it was withdrawn. I'm a rogue who loves advanced movies, but this just did not make sense to me. There were several times that I wondered why, instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt like the individual stories were as clear as glass, but the whole picture was dusty and dark at the same time. Sayles had to focus more on the big picture than on those minor issues that eventually clouded this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went into this movie with the wrong idea. I had expected to see a different version of primary colors, but instead I saw something less heartfelt and technical. Without betraying the end, I considered the final scene to be one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history. The brilliant imagery I've remembered in the last two days after watching this movie while the rest of the movie quickly left my mind. Maybe a second sight would be better for me, but for some reason Silver City simply did not click on me. There seemed to be too many gaps that were never explained or explained. An ensemble piece is always good for me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, it just loses steam. This was one of those rare opportunities. Overall, I was very upset about this movie. As a very Democrat, I wanted to see one side of politics that I did not know, and another side that would make you laugh. I wanted to deal with the world of corporate money and the chosen Dufus'. I wanted smart humor, framed by George W., but all I found was a very confusing story, addressed to a specific audience and of which I will never be a part. Sorry, this picture had so much wasted promise. <br /> <br /> grade: ** from *****
