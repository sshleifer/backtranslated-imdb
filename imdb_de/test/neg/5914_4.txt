by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I was kind of looking forward to this one. I like Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star makes a vehicle for himself or when someone who writes decides to make his own directorial debut. But if the star's head gets too big for the rest of his body, there's always a risk of producing big Hollywood vanities. <br /> <br /> Will the filmmaker keep the reality? or will he just tap the sums of money (the studio that is ours) and the time (the studio, ours and his own) for half an hour on the back? Unfortunately it is the latter. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried-up genre. None of this here. The warlike nightclub films are so mixed up that even the parodies are bleak and deathly. <br /> <br /> Murphy does not. He does that the most clichéd thing: he puts on a normal gangster image in conventional form and plays it as serious as "The Godfather". It's like a script where the next draft uses the jokes and new ideas. But it looks as though somebody with impact has looked at it and said, "No, that's good." Probably Murphy. He will credit all this. In the opening shot of beautiful, white satin bows, his name beats about five times. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: A young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor takes on little Ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> Twenty years later, Pryor's Dump has become a premier hotspot. They pull down a lot of money and a gangster wants their action. He even has a dirty policeman in his service. But Pryor has a scheme, a la "THE STING". <br /> <br /> Murphy's screenplay unfolds like an unfinished first draft in which nobody had the couple to call him. If anything, the actors are not allowed to stand out much. Even the almighty Murphy seems to be on autopilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows class and gentleman manners as Sugar Ray (maybe it would have been better to call his character BROWN Sugar Ray - another proof that he needed a polish), but everyone is here Basically only on vacation. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination received by the film is richly deserved (Joe I. Tompkins's Best Costume Design), but the production values ​​are the only part that makes the 1930s look authentic. <br /> <br /> Some sets seem a bit spotty, but it's a kind of comedy. It is rare for a film to be nominated for both a Razzie and an Oscar (unless it is one of the new "Star Wars" chapters of Lucas). This is a prehistoric formula of the white man. And with all these black comedians and satirists, expect them to impale the genre or at least bring new life. Nope. Murphy runs around here almost only in the sea. <br /> <br /> The great Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly as he commented in his review: "Murphy is closer to his story than a costume party, where everyone will look great looking through a lot since at least 1938 was not fresh. "<br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy is perfectly staffed and seems to indulge in her role, and Michael Lerner has all the looks, meanness, and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss. And there are moments when Pryor gives you an idea of ​​what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like. He gives every scene in which he feels worthy. <br /> <br /> Was it too much to ask that Della Resse sing? Or at least stop talking with all their "Kiss My Ass?" <br /> <br /> And the late Redd Foxx can not leave much swan song here. He has some back and forth with Resse, which could have been great. Nope. Murphy is wasting another opportunity. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and sympathetic. But these moments are certainly few. Murphy has never looked better and never bored. His character made me laugh twice during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer with a terrible speaking impediment is not only painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. Comedy offers more than just something unpleasant. You have to incorporate a light touch and a funny situation. To burden him, even when it comes to the simplest words, we are sorry for him and angry at Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write a screenplay? Well?? There was "Raw", but that was really stand-up material. He certainly wrote the outline for "Boomerang" and "Coming to America". But she did not have the last word there. Maybe a team of doctors who remember ER would revive them. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet that you would swear that he slept at the wheel for a while. He has too many static shots and does not seem to know how to build and release tension. In a way, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, astute and ambitious. But sometimes charming. Well, if only he were funny once. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which Murphy has a female fairy tale in bed that is about to fall in love with him and kill him. You can probably guess how it ends. Like everything else in the movie, that could have been better, but? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly," Murphy has not made another film since (he received a Razzie nomination). And he also does not write the finished draft for his films anymore (he won the Razzie for writing!) <br /> <br /> It's great to watch and the music is beautiful and there are some really nice scenes. But that simply falls under the category "gems among all the garbage". Not enough of it. <br /> <br /> Could it have been. Should be. Was not Well. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
