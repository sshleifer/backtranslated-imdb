I have just seen this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and can not believe that this is Sweden's official submission to the 79th Oscars, which is considered the best foreign film. The producer Anna Anthony had last year also received the official template of Sweden for the best foreign film with Zozo. I was not a personal fan of Zozo, but at least it had a certain production value. This could have been filmed as a high school movie project. It may have worked as a short film, but as a feature film it's just as lost as its characters. This is a story about twenty-five of some friends who live in a Swedish small town and have no goals, hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long-forgotten childhood. Actually, Falkenberg is not a remote northern Swedish village. It is a popular summer resort with almost 40,000 inhabitants and cities and is located between the two major Swedish coastal towns of Götborg and Malmö. The characters are sympathetic enough, but if they were children of high school age and had a grim or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives, I would undoubtedly interest them more. However, they are far from the point where they should make plans for dealing with adulthood. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, they certainly need to work in the tourism or fishing sectors instead of just cycling, drinking, smoking and occasionally painting a house. Maybe if they were hanging out with one or two girls in their circle of friends, of which girls are missing altogether in this film, which makes no sense. Jesper Ganslandt made his directorial debut and wrote the film together with the cameraman, of whom I easily use the term Fredrik Wenzel. the spectacle is not that bad. I would rate this at 4.5 out of 10, but despite the template for the Oscars, I would not recommend it.
