Similar to Final Fantasy, when you take a still image shot - it does not look that bad. But when people start to move, it's absolutely terrible. Uneven jerky movements, frightening lack of emotions and a lack of life on the face give me the horror. The characters do not even appear alive / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview with my daughter who actually fell asleep! She was not engaged at all. For the album, I thought she could easily keep a flashlight under the chin by the campfire with both Pixar-like movies and some "bad" 2D movies like Sinbad. The lip sync is bad - actually worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously doubt that Hanks plays five characters ... this was a big distraction throughout the movie. The role of the conductor is scary - even though I can not pinpoint it somehow. It reminds me of my dad's wrong phone voice when greeting customers. <br /> <br /> I think that's why the different roles are distracting. It makes every character feel ACTED instead of being real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by Hanks's multiple role. I've seen how the technique works - a la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks just can not sound close to having a voice alone by the awful animation Wait for the rental.
