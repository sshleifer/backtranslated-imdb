This is not a very good movie, but it's by far the best Troma Studios movie I've ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - the "heads" behind Troma - does not care about a good plot or even a moderately entertaining movie. His main concern is to make something bizarre. His definition of bizarre often reflects my definition of terrible cinema. In this movie, we have the titled figure, Luther - whose favorite pastime is not baseball, but biting off the heads of chickens - and his release is from bridging. The board has considered him rehabilitated, though he does not speak - he just looks like a chicken - and has a set of razor-bit bits. Once Luther is free, of course, he causes chaos, first in a grocery store and later in a farmhouse. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (violence in this often tasteless state) flick. Luther drops his scraper into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop, then spends the rest of the movie terrorizing his mother and daughter in the farmhouse). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk shows a remarkable complexion in his picture, while former Lois Lane (I can not remember which Superman edition she came from) gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend - a man who just does not do it - I do not have any chemistry with Ms. Haiduk - the extended shower scene material in the DVD Extras gives the viewer a bit more of Stacy's something. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!!!) The script of Whitey Styles is perhaps the worst ever written: The way Luther is released from the asylum raises all credibility the Ogue window is something a preschooler could write, and the acts he writes for his characters border on the absurd, as if Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people in certain situations r eagieren. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The movie belongs to Edward Terry, who's a decent job as a geek, he's rather threatening in a stupid Barnyard way, Joan Roth as a mother does a great job, but Haiduk and her friend's lack of chemistry made her roles awkward at best).
