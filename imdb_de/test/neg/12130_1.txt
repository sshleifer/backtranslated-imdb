This movie was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant. It's hilarious and I'm not tired of it even after seeing it around 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The acting is great, though Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is great. He is a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And since I've seen most of Johnny's films, this is probably my favorite. I give 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
