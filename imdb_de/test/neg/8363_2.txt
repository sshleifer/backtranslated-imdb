I rarely see a movie with such a cast, a potentially powerful story, and a bestselling book that was so weak and to some extent unsurpassed ... <br /> <br /> The premise of a story reads like Brent Easton Ellis's novel - many drugs, hopelessness and self-induced tragedies when young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to assert herself as a suicide. This does not seem to accept that she lives well and that she is basically pathetic about being such a baby ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci not only plays a tragic personality but also a tragic one Actress, whose sobs and screams are for the most part of the movie Actually you make you want to scream - kill yourself and let's come to the credits ... The director does not help, because he delivers absolutely no tempo and the story feels so incoherent, that you have no idea what this damned girl is about. The director was apparently on Prozac when he staged this imitation of a film, and therefore let the film drive with an autopilot, which he became an unbearable mess Fortunately, it was decided to selfish egocentrist and an incredibly good Jessica Lange as the mother of To throw cry babies. Lange can not seem to be defeated by terrible screenplays, directors and terrible fellow actors. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I do not know if that's really Wurtzel or not, but the movie has made me completely uninterested. <br /> <br /> In the end I finished this movie and immediately thought: OK. Time to see something that is REALLY a problem ...
