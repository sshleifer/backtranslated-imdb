L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where is Bob Denver? Do you even have a Dwayne Hickman? A Frenchman moves to Barcelona to attend class. He moves in with some other students who are not more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is incredibly boring. The only bright spot was a pretty French woman playing a Belgian lesbian. She puts her hands behind her head and shows shaved forearms, not the usual dark, stinking hair. But naked armpits do not make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was funny, as was La Cage aux Folles. Let L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard ask what's wrong with the French comedy.
