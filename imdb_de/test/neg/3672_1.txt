If you sit in the dark for 90 minutes, both literally and figuratively, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> A waste of actors, resources and time of the audience. Finally, a waste of space. Do not be tempted by the CV. There is no further substance beyond that. The film lacks all the basics you might expect from this genre. Action, character, development, dissolution. The cast may perhaps know from the bottom of their hearts that in this case their efforts will be completely forgotten and their career may improve over time. Absolute butt.
