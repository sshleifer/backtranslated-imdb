First of all, though I believe that Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and (as here) downright wicked, most of the blame for this ugly embarrassment of a film has to go to John Grisham, on whom this novel is based. <br /> <br /> The film is set at an indefinite time (the 50s - now the 70s?). He begins by rape and murdering a child with rednecks that are so caricatured that they seem to reassure racists that "at least we're not that bad"? Cut to the bad guys who arrive at the courthouse when the girls' father, Samuel L. Jackson, is afraid that they will ask a few technical questions and be gunned down in cold blood before the trial. <br /> <br /> The scenery is a "deep south" that probably never existed - the few black characters live in huts and seem to pick cotton, the colored racists (Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version) of a Klansman ) are ridiculous in their villainy. The set-piece is the process: defending the "good guys" - a milkseat lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey in a coma, his assistant being played by Sandra Bullock's breasts (she seems to serve no other purpose) and Donald Sutherland as a necessary drunken lawyer crying to fight the good fight. For the Procuratorate, Kevin Spacey makes the demon spawn's moves, while crosses are burned in the city, witnesses are intimidated, and the city's residents do not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Some of the reviews here say the film is immoral, because Samuel Jackson is certainly a murderer and should rely on the forces of the law instead of relying on a faint, heartbreaking oratorio by Matthew McConaughey. To be honest, even though the underlying message "vigilante justice is good" may be unpleasant, everything stinks about the film: the characterizations are pitiful, the acting agent, the director, the script, and the dialogue are almost parodic. Peter Menzie's lavish 50s Technicolor cinematography is pretty, but distracted. <br /> <br /> And it takes almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What else is there to say? This is a waste of 141 minutes of everyone's life, it's boring, empty and sardonic, and almost retrospectively it's morally repugnant.
