Roger Corman has enjoyed his share of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career with over 300 films. Although few would call him (if any) great, his dark links to underground culture (by reference, tribute or influence) have given him a corrupted heritage. Throughout his career, he has also made a bad habit of recreating his own films ("Piranha", "Humanoids from the Deep", "The Black Scorpion", etc.) without any improvement. "Raptor", "Written" and "Directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite actors, "Chopping Mall") brings this practice to a troubling new low on Corman's mid-nineties "Carnosaur" -Trilogy. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's credits are in quotes because "Raptor" is not a tribute to the "Carnosaur" movies and not even a remake. "Raptor" is the "Carnosaur" movie, or at least the dinosaur-triggered death scenes of the film that were randomly put together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes (many of which are "Dino's view view") in a movie lame attempt to make the inserted scenes less obvious). The "new" material was written around the footage rather than the other way round, and is completely unobtrusive, with large logical gaps (for example, two separate teams are sent by the military, ie footage from parts 2 and 3, where the soldiers were different uniforms could be included), which is astonishing given that little logic already plays in one of the "Carnosaur" films. The absence of any feelings of actors in their characters (though in fairness each character dimension is shown only once, maybe twice in the script) reminds them of the terrible wooden drama in the B-movies of the fifties, and it certainly does not make any difference between the demolished ones Attack scenes that are worth seeing. It is even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes when there is an obvious discrepancy between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. If the only scene that provokes reaction in a movie is the oldest trick in the horror book, the "spring-loaded animal," something is really wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a despicable practice Two B-Grade characters (who do not have to worry about ruining their reputation because they have none) tear down their own material for the cheapest and fastest dirty tricks just because they can (why else would someone obsess about ripping off a series that was supposed to be a rip-off of the Jurassic Park series?). I can not say much other than that this film contains my highest recommendations against viewing. The only good thing about it (aside from looking at Melissa Braselle's navel) is that I do not have to see any of the "Carnosaur" movies right now.
