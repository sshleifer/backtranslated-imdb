It will indeed be a blue Christmas if you make your family dependent on it. I loved the original movie, and this movie is not worthy of being its sequel. In fact, it is not in any way its continuation. Only one character of the original cast is returned. Granted, this character happened to be the funny cousin Eddie, but he's just not funny as the protagonist of a movie. His niche is that of the crazy relative who brings crazy antics alongside Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this movie to succeed, and he definitely was not there. For me, a movie is not a "vacation movie" unless good old Clark Griswold is at the top.
