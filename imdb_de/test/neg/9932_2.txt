I saw this in HBO's Guilty Pleasures category, and I agree that I felt guilty (and pleased) when watching it. First, it's garbage and really slippery garbage. Second, the plot is slow and predictable, and once you learn "who did it," you think, "So what?" However, I have to admit that I've been fed up with a male chauvinist pig to go through an obviously bad movie, if for no other reason than to watch Peta Wilson being completely naked a few times. Do I feel dirty because I saw it? Yes. I'm sorry I saw it No, so there's a contradiction between the love of good movies and the female anatomy, even if she's in a bad movie. Sigh!
