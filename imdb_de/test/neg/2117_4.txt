Joe was first released in the US in the summer of 1970. Despite considerable announcements, reasonable box office and an Oscar nom, he disappeared shortly thereafter and remained forgotten in the eighties, before he was unjustly inspired in the US in the late 90s. Thanks to this lengthy unavailability, it has long been known that (inexplicably) it stands next to Michael Winner's original Death Wish. Although revenge is an issue, a movie about alertness is definitely not. <br /> <br /> The plot is not worth reviewing. It's a wobbly, cranky and bizarre thing about an accidental murder and the improbable relationship that blossoms out of it. This relationship and the largely class-based quirks of their two main lines are exaggerated in ridiculous caricatures. These two and their situation have absolutely no relation to reality. <br /> <br /> Almost everything about this film is cantankerig and reluctantly outdated, which fascinates the whole thing. Hippies are depicted as heinous and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs either leave you sleeping or dancing with lipstick on your face and most young women are ready to have sex with strangers for marijuana in no time. It's a movie of the '60s and not the' 70s, which is why some industry greats have begun to include it in retrospective talks about the beginnings of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese even participated in all those involved, though probably only to say the damp, lavatory tones of dark city cinematography that influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe seems to be an angry tirade against Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde rather than a continuation of this insurgent cinematic ethos. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie of truly artistic significance - despite Joe's incontinent fury on everything in his world, it remains a story about absolutely nothing - but his value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. Filmed on and around the streets of New York City during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War and at a time when America (and especially its cinema) has been revolutionized to the horrors of the old guard, the film ends in a unique, completely unsuspecting and random manner and way that speaks more about this epoch of history than numerous infinitely superior films aimed directly at capturing them. <br /> <br /> But as a movie? Despite a truly shocking and effective shock, this is basically a Michael Winner movie, but not so well done. How does your pleasure tickle?
