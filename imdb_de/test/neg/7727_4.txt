Granted, HOTD 2 is better than Uwe Boll-Crapfest, which was the first one, but it can be said that drowning is better than being hacked alive. OK OK, I'm a bit tough with this, it's just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in your mouth. Resident Evil was fine, but its consequences are pure garbage. The first HOTD was more than anything an entertaining crap; Uwe Boll took care of that. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but ... that's it? The script, though subordinate, was better than the first one. But the script has dreadfully written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés, and an end that draws to a level of ridicule that would make the Bollmeister very, very proud. But it could have been worse, right? HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a crazy doctor looking for a cure to death. As you can imagine, everything goes to sh * t. A nearby college campus seems to be the center of the zombie (or hypersapienic) epidemic, and as you might expect, a group of commandos and two zombie scientists are trying to save the world by going there and solving the problem , Your main goal? No, it does not blow up. Instead, they must receive a sample of zombie blood to cure the deadly virus. Between this and that are mild character interactions, an unbearable amount of clichés (but hey, at least the black is not the first to be killed) and decent-looking zombies. <br /> <br /> The acting is passable. Who would have thought that Sticky Fingaz is a passable actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine as leaders. And the side occupation was also passable. It was all passable. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects of the zombies were fine, it could have been worse than the first HOTD: only guys walking around in dusty mummy suits. The gusset was fine too. Cheaper anxiety and even lower tensions are almost nonexistent in this movie, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid like the others, but at least there were no sword fighting zombies or this ridiculous slow-motion effect. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will only appeal to zombie fans, fans of arcade games, and someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. There will apparently be a third, as the ending implies, but I would not count on it. Unless Uwe opts for it. A 4.
