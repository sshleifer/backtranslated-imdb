This movie is just awful, the movie was only an hour long and for about 25 minutes of the movie these were just useless random snowboard clips that did not even connect to the movie. The plot is completely "re-shot", my 5-year-old cousin could probably write a better script. I do not understand how anyone could finance the production of such a movie ... terrible. This is definitely the most horrific and horrible movie I have ever seen in my entire existence. I think the casting director just took some random kids off the street to star in this movie. The direction, acting, production and writing for this film are all really bad. I feel bad for the people who have wasted money to finance this garbage. They could not pay me to see that crap again.
