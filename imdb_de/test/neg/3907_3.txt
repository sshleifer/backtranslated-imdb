How are such stories made? This is not a question. It is a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the story development was predictable and boring. My feelings ran consistently in a flat line. It was not really much to drag the viewer into the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were very uncharismatic. One was a loon, another was confusing, and the third was damned boring. There was absolutely no reason to address these people. Although I knew it would not happen, I always hoped that they would meet someone, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. A short film ??? In the desert??? The desert is a place that most people would rather not visit. How come that these three people end up in the desert? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the author really expect me to believe that the last three humans on earth would find themselves in the desert within a few weeks? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for Ms.? Ryan, to be in two scenes that required a bathing suit? Hey, she looks great, but it was pretty unfounded. <br /> <br /> Okay, if I thought it was that bad, why did I give her a 3? I try to be as objective as possible. Although I found Alan annoying, I must say that David Arnott made a neurotic nerd very believable (the character reminded me of some annoying rolls by Albert Brooks). Jeri Ryan was trying to do something with Sarah, but it just was not well written. Okay, so she should be a confused, dysfunctional woman. But why? What has it added to the story? Their mood swings made me feel like I was (hard!) Rolling in one direction and then another and then another way. Stiff, predictable, boring. Proceed at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
