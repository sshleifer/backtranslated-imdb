Apart from the commentary on the technical merits of the production or its absence, the spectacle is absolutely terrible. What is really scary about this movie is that I actually have a copy of it. Of course, he was in a bargain basket and was renamed "Dark Harvest 2," and after seeing him, I can understand why he was in the movie The Bargain Basket - they had to pay me to remove them from their inventory. <br /> <br /> The majority of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a desperate father walking around a cornfield. Labyrinth is looking for his daughters because he knows something is going to happen to them. My guess is that the camera the girls played with at the beginning of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the maze, he encounters the ghost of some kids who have been badly made, and the movie is terribly headed south from there. I can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise they would never have done that. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit in, and it was not worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
