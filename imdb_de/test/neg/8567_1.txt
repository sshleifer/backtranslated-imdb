The movie is nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, it's an insult to the horror genre. None of that borders on scary ... not even near the threshold of the eerie ... <br /> <br /> It's just another case of "another teenage horror movie" - one you've seen. First minutes in the movie and you know what will happen next. Worst of all, the script is duller than the newest part of the scary movie. Would have been better if it were written in Spanish. And do not let me start with the inside jokes and punch lines. <br /> <br /> Although I want to thank the special effects a bit. But believe me, like any other Hollywood horror movie, CGIs and special effects have little or no effect on the horror of a horror movie. In fact, it makes things worse. <br /> <br /> There is not much to see between the fresh-looking Anita Briem and the eerie location in this movie.
