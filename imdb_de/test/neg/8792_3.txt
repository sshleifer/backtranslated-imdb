It is painfully clear that all efforts in this film were directed at cinematography and very little at everything else. The most obvious mistake is the failure of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed out of place, and it did not help to have an amateur director. The story is a very common geisha story, and the characters were very uneven, making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine. <br /> <br /> The theme of this film is "modern prostitution". Still, it was annoying that Tsuchiya Anna's lead role spoke like a female motorcycle gang member, while everyone else in old Japanese fit for the frame. This movie has beautiful, vivid colors similar to Zhang Yimou's "Hero", but viewers can easily see that it was shot in a cheap, elaborate set. <br /> <br /> The two sequences with Shiina Ringo's insert songs were really nice in the middle of the movie. Actually, I really did not like her music, but it fits in perfectly with this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a total failure as a film director, she has great potential in the production of PV videos (music videos). I think the story felt very clear as the director did not focus on character development. and because Tsuchiya Anna is not convinced as an Oiran. Had this film been directed by a well-known Jidaigeki director with another well-known actress in Japan, he would have had the potential to become a masterpiece.
