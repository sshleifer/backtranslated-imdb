Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is no better than mediocre and that's generous. The plot is grafted onto a travelogue and remains completely unshakeable. <br /> <br /> Located in a suburb of Newark, the conspiracy is considered ridiculous. All that rescues the film are the Tuscan countryside and occasional scenes playing in Florence and Positano, and a film about the sunsets that slowly lay to the west would have shown better, of which he is certainly one of the most beautiful places in the world.
