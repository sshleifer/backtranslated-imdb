I did not expect too much from this movie, but I was disappointed anyway. It's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes in which I actually laughed, and I think that's rather poor. There is no real plot, I always felt that most of the scenes could have been placed somewhere in the movie because there is no connection between them. But the worst part was the "acting" by Kim Franke. He has a facial expression throughout the movie, as if he should play a backward guy, but I think that's not the case. All in all, I rate it at four out of ten, I've seen worse movies, but I would not spend any more money on it.
