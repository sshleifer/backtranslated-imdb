Over the GW is a nearly failed debut feature, and not because it's not without trying ... Actually, it does. It's even more chaotic when writer / director / technician Nick Gaglia goes through the same rehab cult he shows in the movie. Sometimes, a first-time filmmaker, full of the force that brings a thumb or two of other film students, goes to a style that is far too incoherent, unsafe, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story is the most personal side , smeared to tell a good story. Gaglia, who was put into a hideous program at the age of 13, who had basically tortured and brainwashed his "patients" with crazy group dancing tactics, psychological Mind-F *** sessions that could last for days, and the Attitudes of rehab leaders who would do this Most Nazis are scared when he was 15 years old. I'm glad he came out, though it might help if he goes into a real rehab because of his filmmaking skills, if only for a few days to learn such things as structure, proper lighting, fluidity Camera movement, subtlety with actors and other fundamentals that are constantly lost here. <br /> <br /> It is all the more frustrating because Gaglia is busy with a topic that should be more publicized (recently there was a Newsweek article referring to a similar AA cult withdrawal) , Often one wonders whether certain personal character studies, as opposed to narrative dramas, could work better as documentary films. Throughout the GW, this is an uncomfortable feeling that is almost as if Gaglia is telling the truth, but he does not know how to communicate it properly through his characters. The character you would expect to come closest to him. Bronx teenager Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is being taken to a detox center by his mother in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, he is actually more of a one-dimensional being. There is very little background story (we see a short freaky one in black and white white in his old home) and little connection to his mother (Moriarty) who has more potential than a cold stone that is never touched hands over her children to another. But there is a story about his two-year crisis, I think. <br /> <br /> Immediately things get rough (a nude search in the first five minutes), and soon it's clear In medical care, it's more a mixture of anger management and bizarre religious sects, in which the head physician Hiller ( Insinnia) is a totally overdriving loon. But soon Tony's sister Sofia (Donohue) is thrown into the program, and unlike Tony's repeated moments of indignation and alleged non-compliance, she goes right through the crazed three-stage program and is released once. Sometimes in this broken nightmare there are pieces in which a woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been in the program for a year and a half, realizes that she is a prisoner who is no longer allowed to go and when the father of the main siblings comes and Hiller visits Enraged, as Sofia finally returns to them, which contain some raw power. Very brief insights into Gaglia, who can at least gain some influence on pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are moments sparsely planted. It is not just the unsuccessful characters, most of which are reduced to stereotypes that like hysterical D.A.R.E. Rip-off (maybe some of them, like a raging black youth, the passive-aggressive counselor, or even the older sister of Serra, whom siblings refer to as having been beaten, jointed, and nearly thrown into the program) would resonate more if more time were given to develop one of them). It's true that Gaglia, in his multiple roles on his tiny $ 30,000 budget, is so unfocused that one side of the potential talent can not get away. He uses shades, usually with a shade that is coated with urine), he wobbles with his DVX handheld camera as if it were very intense in the whole city of God, occasionally a character just randomly shoots into the frame Music is like the worst Selecting pseudo-indie soft rockers, and there are even crazy fake interview scenes with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) And Krakowsky, who feel as wrong as possible. <br /> <br /> Could Gaglia just not get interviews with the real victims he was with and use the artistically artistic Plan B? Bottom line, no matter how much the true life stories are that you might address, do not bother to see them in the theater or even in the rental department, unless you love a closing scene where two kids go digital To look at the world. Hudson River Sunset with the last words: dedicated to the children. Oy.
