Oh man. This sequel has a mirror this time that harbors the evil spirit of a psychopath who killed a whole family with a gun in the house of Amityville. The mirror recorded the entire ugly incident of the horrified family, which had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge), by a bum (who happens to be his crazy father and the man who is responsible for killing the family), and it is vicious that he manages the people in one Loft (like Keyes painter buddy Suki (by Julia Nickson-Soul), in which he lives when they look in.) Soon, Keyes has nightmares and looks through his father's eyes as he holds down the family in cold blood and fears he might be in He soon sees other events through his father's eyes, like that terrible daybreak that hits his mother's head against the floor of a facility or a moment in the cell when the doctor administered a drug to him immobilier. <br /> <br /> Pretty solid Next to the actors, who deserve to be better kept in a garbage like David Naughton (American werewolf in London) as a property he's the loft Keyes lives with, Richard Roundtree as the eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Quinn the psychologist-detective, and Lin Shaye the witty ditsy, rather strange secretary in the asylum (the one Keyes' dad held ), which should be closed soon. <br /> <br /> Round up the movie, the sexy, leggy Lala Sloatman as Keyes' supportive friend, Barbara Howard (Friday the 13th, The Last Chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (he was about to get one Jack Orend as a sadistic fiend trying to provoke his son into killing innocents like him, and Robert Rusler (a nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (by Nickson -Soul), who has found an unfortunate end as he tears up paintings to avenge his release. <br /> This film is a bad special effect movie, with only the Amityville title being used as a deposit becomes. The franchise was never great in the beginning, but as each sequel was lit in green, things got worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the notorious house becomes "obsessed" objects that torture people. The performers try hard, but the material (a mirror that causes chaos and murder through supernatural means) is poor in quality and the rather mediocre special effects do not help. O'Quinn shows how little he has to work with him, why he's such a great actor. He can even shine in excrements like this. Everything is not lost, you always see Sloatman in super skirts (.. or her husband's shirt in underpants) and shows her legs everywhere .. You have to find somewhere a silver lining. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the series. The coolest part of the film was the demon portraits painted by Nickson-Soul's artists, which may have been inspired by the evil mirror after they examined it.
