Do not worry - no spoilers here, just say there is a very predictable conspiracy. A couple decides to live in his father's love nest so that he can write a book / article / newsletter about his mantle with a famous Hollywood tragic star. This whole production somehow went like a high school troupe doing an episode of Murder She Wrote. The only act that sold me was the old fog that they had interviewed for sources in the story. Apparently the directors thought the film was going to be too long, so in the end they stopped pointing their camera at some sort of scary image of the asterisk, and brought in action improvers to bring this thing together. Do not waste time - even the proven horror / intrigue classics fail in this movie.
