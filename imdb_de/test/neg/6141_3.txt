I like the concept of CSI, but the show is spoiled by serious playing wood. The coroner has the best lines and delivers them in a vaulted manner that brings the story to life. Unfortunately, he has little screen time. <br /> <br /> Why does Jorja Fox always look so unhappy? I know that forensic investigations are a very serious business, but the characters seem to confuse sincerity with lack of humor and a complete lack of personality. I can not imagine going out with Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; what would you talk to? I'm waiting for the episode when Catherine picks up a remote control at the end of a shift, turns her on Grissom, shuts him off, and drives him into a closet until the next day.
