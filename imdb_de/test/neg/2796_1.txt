Now I do that without using spoilers if I can. My cousin and I rented movies the other weekend, and we stumbled across it with the big, crazy scarecrow on the cover. It looked cool, so we rented it next to Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Only ... Wow. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the movie was awful. Well, the boxing art, the opening scenes and the music were neat to well done, but the movie itself is awful. The acting is below average (Sean, the lead role, shows little emotion and / or effort in his character), the scarecrows do not look like the ones on the cover (wrong ad, maybe?) And the camera angles and angles were that of a bad wrestling Sports Events. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a wrestling fan. I know bad camera angles. And, frankly, that's all up with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's done so badly that it AMUSES me. It makes me laugh. Somehow this movie is a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, it serves as what to do and what not to do in movies, especially the Slasher genre. I recommend that people pay attention to this, just to get a good understanding of what to avoid.
