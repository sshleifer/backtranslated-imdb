I work in the video library renting this video in Lexington, and I have to say it should never have been done. I even know some of the people who worked on it and regret it. Bad effects, terrible spectacle, especially bad script. I swear the dialogue would not have been for PSX's original Resident Evil; It's so bad If you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this movie to learn a thing or two. If not, do not waste time. And even the director knows that it's shit because he keeps coming in and trying to sell the movie. No sir. I've looked at two-thirds of the horror section, and that value is even lower than Plan 9 from Outer Space. Even Ed Eood would have said, "No. That's too stupid even for me."
