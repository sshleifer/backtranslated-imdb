You can not touch NRFPTP! The new harvest is just awful. The jokes are not funny. Some of the troupe will not let me watch TV anymore. Lorne - you let your creation go to the bathroom. The guests are sometimes good, the bands are mostly garbage. Weekend update, Seth has to tell viewers when to laugh ..... Seth would get a decent reception in a Baghdad cafe ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 Just wash jokes again and again. Even the segments that are obviously not funny. Offending people has become the name of the game, but they can not even get it right. Only offensive. I'm so disappointed with what happened to the show, but now I know it's safe to go out on a Saturday night!
