The sister of a party Hardy guy is brutally murdered by a street gang and sends the young man into a sudden psychotic uprising. He and his buddies are massacring half the city to bring his sister back to life. The SAVAGE STREETS were released a year after this movie and were more entertaining. Linnea Quigley, who plays a costly role as a sexy (and short-nude) girlfriend for one of the boys in this film, also starred in SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This film is below average, but offers enough escapists entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please the intended audience (me). MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
