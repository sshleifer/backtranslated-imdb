By far the most racist and ghettoish animated film for children from 7 years old. Children watching this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk and behave like the characters depicted. I am disappointed with Nickelodeon and Nick Jr., who have agreed to send this terrible program. The Wayan brothers can be good at movies designed for young adults. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Normally, the young celebrities start to work in films and make language expressions for cartoons. As they get older, they become programs for young adults. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first began with All-That, later playing in MIB II, then Drumline and now his television program Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out, where comedians compete with inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how celebrities who have seen children on television not so long ago can become those who engage in non-child-friendly programs. It is very sad that this happens, but all celebrities change and grow up. It's the other way around with the new cartoon of Wayan's Brothers. It's bad enough that we have to deal with all the bad people in the ghettos. If the younger generation looks at this program, it will make the children with opportunities those who have no chance of a good life. Only my feelings about this cartoon and my belief in what will happen to our children if they see it.
