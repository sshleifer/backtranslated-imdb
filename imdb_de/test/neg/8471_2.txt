I looked at this cooking show a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just a question ..... Who can not cook a meal in 30 minutes, when everything is at hand, already packed, sometimes chopped and you can only make a few greens. Almost every cooking show on TV takes 30 minutes and most of these cooks do their preparatory work (except Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh yes, they also make full meals. <br /> <br /> I love the comment of the guy who hated the comment "EVOO". Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid tag words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious ... a loud, sociable woman who is really her own best audience. She laughs at her own lame comments, too many times for the camera, because she wants to convince us she's as good as she thinks. <br /> <br /> NO she is not "the cutest thing". She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
