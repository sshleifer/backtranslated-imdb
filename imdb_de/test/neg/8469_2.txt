I found this film extremely interesting, but a bit exhausted, it talks about violence and what it does there, I still do not see any sense in becoming terrorists to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries who justify the use of force and war tactics because they believe they are right. Think of the Puritans and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people in the Middle Ages. Much blood and death that goes far beyond today's violence has had a negative impact on religion in the Western world. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture in the past has had a very negative impact on some. But keep in mind that the majority of the Muslim population is PEACEFUL! The people of a nation somehow feel patriotic, but to start a war because I'm right and your injustice needs it, you have to rethink it. I repeat once again that you can not stop terrorists by resembling them.
