Week after week, these women simply sweep all the men off their feet. Really none of these women are knockouts. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) looks like a woman picking up men: 45 o'clock before the bar closes after her visibility and standards have been compromised by ten or eleven martinis alike. Nevertheless, she is the Queen Bee, a super sexy man murderer. The other three are not feeling much better. And their constant disgusting remarks ..... not to mention jumping out of bed with strange men and never getting sick. This show is pathetic and scary. I do not think any of these women feel terribly drawn to it, even if he's had Viagra popped during his vacation on land like Tic Tacs.
