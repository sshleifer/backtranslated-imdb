PDQ Bach has done better. A large part of "Bach" speaks of letters to various customers complaining about the amount and speed of his payment. The diary of Anna Magdalena, mainly about the deaths of children and other family matters, works even more. The music is confusing: 17th century chapel orchestras and choirs creating the sound of a 20th century concert hall. The overall quality of the production reminded me of a Junior High Slide Show. JS Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This movie does not add anything. Netflix sent me two discs that could not be played, so I streamed the movie. Netflix was clearly trying to tell me something.
