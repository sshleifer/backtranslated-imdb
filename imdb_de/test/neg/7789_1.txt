This was just the second version of Charles Dickens' classic story that I had seen, and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst. The film begins with a quick live-action piece in which Simon Callow begins the story of A Christmas Carol as Charles Dickens, and then obviously it's about the animated story itself. You probably already know, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grumpy cold-blooded one Businessman refusing love and hating Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage), who warns him against visiting the other three spirits of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the Dumb Future / Yet To Come. After all, he obviously recognizes the true magic of Christmas and promises to be nicer in the future. The only changes I noticed in the story were that Scrooge had mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's ex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) had to see him to help in the orphanage. Will "and" Ignorance, "Scrooge is still being followed after he's become nice, and he worries that he can not live up to his promise to stay nice, with Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit , Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig.The animation is not of the highest quality, the actors have wasted their votes on a worthless garbage.The only good thing that comes out of this film is the good voice of Kate Winslet, who sings the closing song "What If", which by the way is terribly terrible.
