Three young filmmakers are invited to reopen a long-closed old theater in which many years before a shocking series of gruesome murders took place. It seems that many more murders have taken place since then, but all of these are unknown to these three young aspiring employees hoping to finally be alone. As they approach the great reopening night, things are becoming stranger and more disturbing as objects suddenly move on their own without visible aids and a fearsome old man seemingly pervades the premises. Oh, that's really awful. If Mary Voronov's secretary were not such a wild, outspoken, extremely strong, young woman stealing virtually every scene she appeared in, and the incredibly hot girl playing the incredibly slender and totally sexy Selina, that would be a total loss. The only good thing I have to say about this film is that some of the theatrical murders are made in really imaginative, if not overly bloody (a fondness for me, but not necessarily for others) fashion. The rest rolls in constant sleaze (so extreme that the few really find humor in it) and runs through the predictable slasher killer that kills annoying characters one after another.
