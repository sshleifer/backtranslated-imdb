The dominant conflict is between some good actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the terrible screenplay. Obviously, the actors lost, because the director / scriptwriter Claude Chabrol finally forced the leading couple to follow this worthless part of the ill imagination. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the film, miraculously gaining depth and humor. Chabrol's insistence on keeping the film boring and illogical reaches the climax of the final scene, which is so incredibly bad that you'll wonder what pills he took himself while directing.
