The word honor should be erased from the vocabulary of all nations. It aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people. Anyone who disagrees should not read this comment. <br /> <br /> As expected by these scriptwriters, Yakuza is an exciting thriller that has a lot of respect for the ethnic background he faces Gore's friends and violence will not disappoint, but especially towards the end violence becomes something meaningless, superfluous and downright stupid. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find Robert Mitchum's performance very good. This is an actor who definitely has not improved with age. He looks like a tired janitor (it does not suit the part), and his distance, which made him an impressive screen presence in earlier years, acts as either confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as gentlemen and young, intelligent thugs. <br /> <br /> This movie is best seen as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by the mitchum figure who calms the takakura figure on false assumptions. The mistake soon becomes clear, but the sense of honor demands that they are not allowed to withdraw. So they sneak around, shooting in all directions, swinging swords and destroying their friend's apartment (even though the guy asks them to stop, "the whole fight") The bodies start and the story ends with Mitchum's character doing his Point of view: If you give him your little finger, I'll give it to you. "Well, it's the least he can do, right?" He pulls out a knife, takes his breath in resignation, and begins to cut off the extremity (out of the frame). It was a moment that probably should have been solemn, which just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of locations is very good in this movie, I especially liked the scenes that were filmed In and around the International Conference Hall at Takaragaike Lake, an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto Protocol was signed there), the Archit presentation appears to me here ectic better than in Sydney Pollack's recent documentary sketches by Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.
