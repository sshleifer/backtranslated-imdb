******************** SPOILER ******************************************************************** ** ************** Let me now say that I totally agree with what the Carissaphillips had to say. What was Sam thinking? She was with a man who told her that he loved her (three times overall), was extremely hot, and she stayed with her despite her difficult times (Josh Hartnett). But she decided to break up with him, no, cheated on him with an ugly, spoiled, luscious fool who never said he loved her in the movie (oh, wait, he wrote it on the wall, or? this number?) and left her in her time of need because he was afraid (Chris LOSER Klein). Who do you want to be with? The only reason I had gone through the movie was because Josh Hartnett was there, hoping she might die in the end. I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who is indeed worthy of him. The whole thing "your mother" was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people say it here, but I think Kelley deserves it. Jasper should have told Sam, she needed a good slap. How the romance started is a mystery to me. They never said anything anyway, so I do not understand how they got together. "I thought of the cheese sandwich you gave me ... had it mustard or mayonnaise or ..." Oh, what an advent. The supposedly romantic lines were so stupid. Besides, he is sososososososo UGLY! I have to admit, I cried in this movie. For a long time very difficult. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried so much in this movie ... he tried to smile, but he could not stop the tears. He cried when 1) he said he loved her 2) she got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and he saw how happy she was with him 4) she died. I cried when he cried because he loved her all her life and told her, and yet she was stupid enough not to love and love a guy who left her in distress and not at the funeral wanted to scream. 1 1/2 stars only because I LOVE JOSH HARTNETT! By the way, Chris Klein, YOUR MOM! -Wileys Sis
