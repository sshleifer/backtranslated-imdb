I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried that I'm going to become one of those leftist liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it very offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything. <br /> <br /> Second, there is an early meteor attack that hits some (unnamed?). Why do you need a name?) Asian country. The reaction is to consider it a warning. Imagine, as in "my God", the tragedy that * could * happen *. You know, it happened to Asians. It could happen to the white Americans and that would be tragic. <br /> <br /> Later a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our occupation on the ground is irritated because it can cause our boys to spend less time than expected. Not very excited in America. No mention that many people have died. Then there is Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been such a sign. With a team of hardcore drills, it seems to be his job to stand behind and occasionally say, "Hey, you there man". Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like he's small - he complained in vain about this shuttle! He does not even lift a tool, steer a spaceship, or even help fix anything that blows up. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a pointless role). which seems mostly drunk and wrenches things with wrenches instead of repairing them because "Dat as we engage in Russia" is pretty dreadful. Everything cements, of course, through the website of blond, blue-eyed American children celebrating on corn fields because they are saved and everything is fine. Because death and destruction are irrelevant to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> You expect the bad script, the dodgy action and the implausible conspiracy (fat middle-aged men trained in 12 days to be astronauts, including a person who seems to be lagging behind?). But I could not believe that the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the life of someone who is not fed corn, is society for the world. <br /> <br /> And it's also a crappy movie.
