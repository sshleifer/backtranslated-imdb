Okay, I agree with all Barney haters on this page. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and disgusting and the show is very lop and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But what impresses me most is the way Barney has presented gays, lesbians, and bisexuals on his show when talking about same-sex parents and relatives. That would not be such a big problem if the creators of this show did not use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink, and not all lesbians are ugly and look male with a bosom that sinks to their tummy. As a bisexual woman, I find that terrible for a children's show. If this were South Park, I would not mind, because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who watch Barney are little children or people with disabilities who normally can not distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now that I think about it, Barney somehow comes into question as an ugly gay stereotype. Let's see, he has no girlfriend, he is dyed pink and wears clothes with sequins (yes, that's right). If you claim to be for the rights of gay and bisexual individuals, then stop ridiculing them in front of people who do not know any better. If Barney got black face at the same time and ate fried chicken and watermelon, the show would be blown up before you know it. <br /> <br /> I give this show a negative out of five. Do not show your children so hateful crap. There are children's shows that are less offensive.
