The Willies starts late one night when brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) camp outside with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin). They decide to pass the time by telling fearsome stories ... <br /> <br /> First, Michael is having a story called 'Bad Apples', in which a boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is bullied in school, the eerie new janitor Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him. , <br /> <br /> Next, Kyle tells a strange story called 'Flyboy', in which an overweight bully with a disturbing fascination for dead flies gets in a terrible, twisted way what he deserves ... <br /> <br /> Writer & Director: Brian Peck The Willies have not done much for me and I doubt it will do much for you either. The script is strange as far as episodic anthologies are concerned. Instead of the usual three or four stories, there are only two main stories and a few bizarre mini-scenes of the "urban myth" type. These consist of the person who orders the food from a fast food restaurant, only to find a dead rat in their chicken, a man who dies in a heart attack and someone who tries to cook his poodle in the microwave to dry, just to explode. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they do not add anything to the movie because the two main stories are both weak. For one thing, they are too long, which is a big mistake in these films. Normally the stories in the anthologies are short, sharp and fast, with a nice twist at the end where people usually get what they deserve. In The Willies, however, the stories last 40 minutes, which is longer than the average TV episode. I have to admit that I found both stories very boring, they have very little interest and seem to target children. The first story is better to see as a whole, but it has no end, as far as I could see, while the second has a nice ending, but the structure is weak and without good reason. I really like horror anthology movies so The Willies comes as a disappointment, frankly the genre will suffer. <br /> <br /> Director Peck obviously worked on a low budget and as a whole The Willies is pretty tough to endure. There are many continuity flaws and it's done badly. There is no atmosphere, no fear, no nerves, the special effects are bad and there are several times unnecessary recordings of a dirty toilet. All in all, it's a pretty unsightly movie to sit through. <br /> <br /> Technically The Willies are rough at least on the edges, the effects are anything but special and it has an extremely gritty and grainy look. Acting is bad, no one will win any prizes, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The Willies is a bad movie, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not entertaining and there are only two overlong stories. Definitely not recommended.
