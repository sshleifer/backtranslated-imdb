Humor is a very individual thing, and the audience at The Wog Boy's sneak preview seemed to like it more than me. I found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the ancient racial humor of Australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The boy never hits the girl's plot because of the lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos while laughing on the floor. If you want to spend your money on it, wait until it appears on video.
