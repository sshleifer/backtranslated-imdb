Unfortunately, this is not as good as the other films that Jim Carrey (producer and actor) and Brian Grazer have worked with, but it's definitely worth taking a look. Basically, Dick Harper (Carrey) believes that he is promoted to a better job. That's until the company is drowned and closed by Dynocorpe. Of course Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni) and her son have problems with the money. No matter what they try, they can not afford the money they really want. So they start to rob some places. And then they decide to rob the guy who built up Dick, his ex-boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most ludicrous pieces are when Carrey sings in the elevator "I think I can fly" and when he ties someone into a robbery and talks to a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). OK!
