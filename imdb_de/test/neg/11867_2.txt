Meh, really put it together for me. Boring story, boring dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you make something like a fight or a shoot-out boring - do you really need to try this?), No real characters, etc. Just boring. Snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer, but none of this has appeared in EVERY DTV work when the opportunity arises to give the audience a much superior product than they are accustomed to. Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that are important to you, and some damn explosive actions, fighting, shootings, etc. How can it be so difficult to deal with? My personal opinion is that the main actors of the productions simply do not care. There is no sign of enthusiasm for what they do. Take a look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man, etc? Great, intense performances, complemented by decent (if not always outstanding) scripts, good supportive casts and nasty action. <br /> <br /> In none of these publications is it all obvious. The lenders beat Wesley's face on the cover and know that the audience is going to rip them off as they have not realized that they have not seen him in theaters for nearly two years. Snipes works with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to fully exploit a DTV production and work with alpha stunts that are simply among the best action guys. Together they would form a fantastic team and a Snipes action vehicle that we could all be proud of. Detonator is shit. It's not as bad as The Marksman, who chews, but it's really shit.
