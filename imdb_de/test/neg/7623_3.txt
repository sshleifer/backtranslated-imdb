I bought a DVD of this movie in the big department store for a dollar. That's probably the best and nicest comment I can offer. At least it did not cheat me about the cost of lunch. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Chiller" is Craven's problem as a director. The man has his apologists, who claim his travel documents prove he is a really smart and all-around sharp conceptualist. It is no secret, however, that as a director, he has never had a bit of the visual and narrative sense of a Hitchcock. As confirmed by "Chiller" energetically, he is much closer to the legendary flat-foot Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven misses as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from being a director to a higher level of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Let us be specific. The transitional moments of this film are smooth. The establishment gives the feeling of a quality production. The film looks professional together, like a movie shot by a TV director. (One thought: the movie is just a visual distinction, these transitions that look at least professional may well be the work of some directors of the second unit.) It's the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions - the drama - that fall flat , <br /> <br /> The core of the process is handled carefully without exception. The critical settings (for example, after the departing car drove into the well-positioned camera, we drive to the night outside a hospital, then to the waiting area and hallway, then to the phone booth in the corner where the picture will be) Steps are done quickly, so we can hurry and get to the next part. Craven never comes close to the dramatic or visual possibilities of every moment. The net result of all this misguided attention to the least significant parts, and the fumbling to keep things moving, is a film that feels like the work of the young art student, who sharpens all his pencils, cumbersomely adapts his easel and lighting set , up, grinds all his pigments, stretches and primed his canvas ... and then has nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never gets into it. <br /> <br /> For Craven apologists, who point out that this movie was made for television, I refer to Spielberg's "duel" and say "no" more.
