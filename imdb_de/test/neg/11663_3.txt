"Blindness" is what you experience when you see this movie and then believe that you have seen something valuable. This movie, which tells of a trio of semi-psychic travelers doing no good anywhere in the California desert, is amateurish and just stupid. The film suffers from a terrible story, a bad script and a terrible direction, to name just a few shortcomings. If the movie has anything to offer, then it's even the performance of B-Movie Diva Rubin. Do not waste time with this turkey. (D)
