'Illuminata' has expanded the limits of mediocrity from second-rate actor to director, author and third-class producer of John Turturro. This movie was awful. It is incoherent and flutters from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story. <br /> <br /> We are served with a wealth of fragmented scenes, each of which is not a sequitur for everyone else. The only thread that seems to pass through them is that they appear in the lives of members of the same theater group. The few scenes that are relevant to the plot are so confused that you often can not tell if the dialogue is from history or if the characters play their lines for the play within the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were a person, she would be a schizophrenic with multiple personality disorders. It could not decide if it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sex farce or a theatrical parody. It was most likely to be tolerable as a sex farce. <br /> <br /> Turturro was lifeless and apathetic as Tuccio, supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose game has a great chance when the current show has to be canceled due to the lead actor's illness. Susan Sarandon performed well as an aging actress who wanted to seduce Tuccio for a role. Unfortunately, she felt it necessary to go topless, which only shows that the hardware of aging sex symbols is left to the imagination. Christoher Walkin did a wonderful job as a top-notch theater critic making passionate encouragement to a member of the cast. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had smaller roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2. Apart from Walken's vignette, there is not much to recommend, except that the puppets are used in opening and closing credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague it is. <br /> <br />
