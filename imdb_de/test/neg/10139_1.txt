Without a doubt, Reba is one of the worst comedy series of all time. I wonder why there are people who write good comments about "Reba" ... They see "friends", "married children", "Fraiser". If you laugh about it, you can never laugh at the silly jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer trying to find her way into the comedy and obviously having no chance. The actors / actresses next to Reba are fine, so I feel bad for them when they're in a so-called comedy show with the fewest people in the world (Reba). To sum up, I suggest this TV show to see how little comedy can be and appreciate those who can make you laugh
