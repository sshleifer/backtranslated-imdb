I have never seen the TV series or the previous films. That's probably why I did not enjoy it very much. Boring and just not funny, it sums up well. <br /> <br /> Given the budget the film seemed to have, it is embarrassing that they could not even do a decent job. <br /> <br /> We went to the movies without exception and hoped to see a funny movie that was not too exhausting. My friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and I spent the next 2 hours hoping that he would finally catch up. A hope that died with the credits.
