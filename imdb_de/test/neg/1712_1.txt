First I want to apologize for my rating of "1" ... The only reason why I rate this movie so highly is that I can not deal with negative numbers. All "This is a paroof" ideas aside, and though I have certainly tried to take it duly into consideration, I have left a certain notion; "This is probably the worst movie ever made." At every level and in some plausible quantification of the qualitative measurement ... Seriously, I tried, I'm just like any other movie that's meant for the cult of video distribution, next Buff balls ... <br / > <br /> If I had directed this "movie" I would have seen it as a legitimate reason for suicide.
