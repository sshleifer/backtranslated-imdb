A scientist (George Zucco) wants to make wolf men from American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is classified as crazy. He uses a simple gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, who constantly embeds his dialogue with the sounds of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men," has no idea what's going on, only that he's sleepwalking. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl who might bother modern viewers, and two of Zucco's rivals). There are some good dialogues about how man should not deal with nature (still prevalent today) and play God. Zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are highly questionable. And then there is his daughter Anne Nagel, who is nice to Strange, but has no idea about her father's actions. Johnny Downs is a reporter who outwits Zucco's bad side in the interrogation, but captures Nagels heart, creating the usual and boring, romantic subplot of classic horror movies. At 77 minutes this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror movie of the early 40s (especially one from PRC who has released this movie), so that the romantic story could have been cut short for cost and somewhat accelerated. Fortunately, Zucco is never jumbled; He left that to Bela Lugosi (who always clambered in a delicious theatrical manner that made him popular with the audience) and England's Todd Slaughter. However, do not think about "Bride of the Monsters" lab while you watch Zucco's work, or some Lugosi dialogues in this now classic cult movie. "Mad Monster" lacks cult more, because it is not wonderfully bad, but only boring in some places. For PRC and Monogram lovers, I would highly recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island"
