I had just read the book and was looking forward to seeing this TV adaptation aired Monday night (May 30, 2005) on Hallmark Channel. The key to the entire book was the manifesto the man had stolen with steel teeth, but I looked for an hour (of 3 1/2) and saw the man with the steel teeth, but I never saw a manifesto steal. I've seen someone steal viruses, but what did that have to do with the book? It's a shame because this movie had great production values ​​and a good cast, but it's not the idea to turn a book into a movie (TV or movie) so the people reading the book become part of the audience. They only kept me for an hour. I thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw away the whole premise? This book had a great McGuffin (to describe Hitchcock), but they ignored it. The titles said that Forsyth was involved in the production. You must have paid him a lot of money for sure.
