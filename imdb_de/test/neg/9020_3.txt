Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is poorly edited, but it has a camping element that makes it pleasant to watch. The villain is an Anglo actor who wears ridiculous Mexican clothes and influences an exaggerated Mexican accent that is hilarious. The girl is dressed like a Jean Harlow wannabe, after all, that's 1934. At least the filming locations are nice and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Watch and laugh. Do not expect a serious western, but rather a light and superficial story with bad acting, but occasional flare-ups of camp humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome and you can see his acting ability flourishes years after this unfortunate endeavor.
