Egad. <br /> <br /> I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure that Willy Keannu is hotly contested in this movie with his performance "I'm Made of Plaster". <br /> <br /> Combine that with the fact that there is almost no action and no sympathetic character, and it is quite difficult to recommend this turkey. Natasha tries her best, but even Julia Roberts could not save this streak from the darkness. <br /> <br /> Avoid it, unless it's really late and there's nothing else. Oh, hell, in that case just read a book.
