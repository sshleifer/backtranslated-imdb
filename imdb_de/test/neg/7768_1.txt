Frightening, flat, materialistic nonsense. How women (and gay men?) Can enjoy this garbage is not me. No self-respecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold diggers. Even more worrying is that so many critics say they are referring to the women on the show. If this is the future of women, then Lord helps us. If you show your independence and are equal to men, you should not spread your legs with another man every three seconds. I think that humiliates women and does not do them justice. But this criticism is not a word against women. Fans of the show say it's "weird" and "rivoting," but every time I saw this show, I was just trying to stay awake. Despite the story of the reporter, there is never anything in this show that is near anything that could be thought of as rational. So it's not entertaining and not informative. Why should you look at it? One in ten stars.
