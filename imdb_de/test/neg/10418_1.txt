I'm sitting here writing this review, and the movie is not even over. In fact, I just checked, and there are still 45 minutes left. But no matter, there is no need to endure it to the end. I write this review and laugh while the movie is running in the background and stumbles into a kind of terrible conclusion I never ever want to see or know. <br /> <br /> What does mine matter? Hostility to this movie? The characters are not credible. The plot is not credible. The presumption of the film is sick. Basically, every element of the movie is wrong. Buscemi apparently thought he had something to add to the dozens of films that have already explored the worn-out themes of dysfunctional families and the obvious meaninglessness of life. Buscemi was very wrong, because this movie contains nothing new. It's very hard to be depressing, but luckily nobody can really be depressed because it's obvious there are no such people around the world. This film has been awarded several unearned prizes. Disgusting!!!! Conclusion: Stay away from this worthless film at any cost.
