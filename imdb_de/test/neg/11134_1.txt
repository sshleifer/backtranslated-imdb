OK, so I'm chilling in my room when Mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it has to be an older horror movie, because today anyone can be stupid enough to call a movie that has been playing after the blockbuster "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the movie is at least two years older than the original. That alone would have kept me from doing it in the V.C.R. But no, I had to take a chance, I had to believe that this film could have a little glimmer of hope. I did not know that the rays were not visible there. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is so ridiculous that it's probably true in some country-jerk town. Second, the actors are more like real-life people wondering on set when the director roars. Three, just about every movie with the director, is always terrible. But the funny thing is that this is another movie by Kevin Summerfield. I've been counting on his movie to bring me to the floor with splitting laughter. <br /> <br /> Where do I start with this movie? I know, let's start with the jogger in the forest. The camera lighting was so bad that I could assume that the jogger was stationary and the cameraman was running. I love how the woman stops eating a chocolate bar. I mean, it's all about darkness or just light, who can tell by the camera lighting. And she stops running to eat a chocolate bar, I mean a CANDY BAR, WHAT HELL. So she's the first victim of stupidity, and I'm ready to break the band, find the director, burn his little hands, a car that's probably broken for several years. Then come the fake Mack 10 and a very real prostitute who happen to be part of our main chart. <br /> <br /> The film is a group of children, all in trouble. And have the option to pick up the garbage in Sleepy Hollow Park or the face lift forever. There he sent a forest with one of the teachers (Mr. E or a.k.a Kevin Summfield) to watch over them and make sure that everything went according to plan. The funniest thing is how undeveloped the charters really are. I mean, what about the wrong Mack 10 guy and who has ever heard that hacker is trying to kill himself? And some, how one of the students had an affair with the teacher, Mr. E., before all this community service had even turned up. Still, the school thought it was a cool idea to let him go. There is also a student named J who has the purpose in the movie of popping up annoying, trying to make the audience jump if he really just increases the cheapness of the movie. The sound was so terrible in this movie. I mean, one was seen when two guys were fighting, and the guy was punching the other one in the gut, and the TV sounded that sounding like someone was beating an outdated wooden box. It started terribly and ended dangerously stupid, even my taste. However, I will say so, the music in the background made the scenes look a bit bearable. But not so bearable. My conclusion is, if you want to leave another movie that Kevin Summfield has seriously bought "Sleepy Hollow High" 10. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
