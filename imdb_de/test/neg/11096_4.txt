If you thought this was the French The Mummy and if you are hoping for another "Vidocq" ... look elsewhere. It has the same story as the mummy about this Book of the Dead and a soul who has to find 7 missing parts scattered around the Louvre. I found the movie entertaining and boring for the most part. The special effects are not bad, but it's nothing special, as I expected big explosions and the Eiffel Tower collapsed, until I realized these scenes were in The Mummy and this Belhpegor. Apparently based on a French cult TV series, Belphegor could have been so much better. I only chose this movie 4/10 for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... She must be almost 40 years old and looks stunning!
