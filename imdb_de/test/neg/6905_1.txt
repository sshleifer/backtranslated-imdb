Words can not describe how awful this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'll take a stab: 1 - Compassionate. In Hollywood, more talking animals are put into graphics. Obviously, script and plot are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Kids movie, but still one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - Obviously stupid. The movie actually shows the livestock with human capabilities. In Nemo the fish could talk, but for the most part they are still fish. We only speak English as a translation. In Barnyard the animals actually speak English, which other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unintelligent - No clever story or even a smart sense of humor. (Ok, the 13-year-old dog on crutches was funny). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally Insensitive - The "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow played a stereotypical black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorant - No male cow known to me. I think we call them bulls. If we want to put our children to a drek, this could just as well do the simplest facts right. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old left us after 45 minutes. He practically fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate, because Hollywood producers just prove that the American public is just filled with suckers waiting for $ 8 two hours to get some rest from the children. An unfortunate circumstance. Why should producers spend real money when returns are the same in both cases?
