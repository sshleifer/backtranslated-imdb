Undoubtedly the least spaghetti westerns I've seen lately: basically a rip-off of Leone's THE GOOD, THE BATH AND THE UGLY (1966) with three different characters outwitting each other (and occasionally shaky alliances) their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin rated it as BOMB; Although it's harmless enough, it's also a routine, and the three main roles are fatal: stereotypes, that is, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank clerk who has ideas about his shipment being transported by train. Gilbert Roland is the "legendary" but aging Mexican bandit (his frequent failures in Spanish when he's upset are pretty cheesy!), Which is still seemingly irresistible to women; As an enigmatic bounty hunter, George Hilton tries too hard to imitate Clint Eastwood's "Man With No Name." Director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian B-Film retrospective at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, where he emerged as the most pompous of the cult film directors present! - shows little authentic feeling for the Western (with two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre I have his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I'm crossing my fingers now!) and the movie's winking approach is just as unfortunate.
