This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. What a faint waste of Michael Imperioli's obvious talent. Disgusting movie from beginning to end. All I can say is that this director is not an author. They never get into the game, the character's head, the amazing talented numbers that the real Stuey had. The cola scene is bad enough to throw the shoe on the set. It would have been a great scene if it had been shot for movies and not for the stage. The camera is half way through the house and hovers over a drugged mirror. Drama is far in the background. The scene where he wins the big championship is just ridiculous. This should be in Movie Production 101 - What you can not do when creating images.
