I do not know if I'm wrong or anyone who says that this movie is good, sincere. I'd like to do a favor to people who have doubts about seeing, renting, or buying it even worse (do not do it!). <br /> <br /> The trailers and the very early previews may be funny in one way or another, but it's not funny at all, it falls into a series of rows where you're supposed to be - laugh-here- Scenes that tend to get into really bad jokes, bad very very bad acting, tasteless scenes, cheesy effects; This movie has everything, everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> As a final commentary, the film would have been funny because of the basic concept, but believe me is really far from it.
