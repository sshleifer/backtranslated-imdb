NEEDFUL THINGS is based on a Stephen King novel and offers the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your place. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the Devil himself settled down as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? Von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role, which dominates the screen. The stars are also Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is solid and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also supported are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen.
