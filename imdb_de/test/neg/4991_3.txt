When I first became a dad about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many sacrifices that I had to bring. I knew I had to change diapers and take them for swimming lessons and attend some ice-cold Santa Claus parades, but I was not ready for the kind of sacrifice I sacrificed last night. In my humble opinion, this is a cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> Underdog is bad. It's not all Karate Dog bad, but the Shaggy Dog feels like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a TV show, I would recommend stopping by. Not even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can save it. Arc. Wow. <br /> <br /> It was only the best 80 minutes I've ever enjoyed. James sat to my right and Michelle to my left, and I spent more time watching her response to that talk, flying mutt, than watching the screen. At the age of 5 and 3, they were the target audience, and this film has achieved the goal. There is a scene where Underdog loudly bumps into another dog face and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever recorded in the movie. As Underdog flew into space, James literally stood on the edge of his seat and was fascinated. The kids absolutely loved Underdog and that's why I was there. That's what happened last night. <br /> <br /> If you do not accompany someone under the age of ten, you do not have time to waste a second of your life watching this brutal movie. But if you want to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old, I can not judge. I had a nice time.
