Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What she does not know is that she was killed by a Sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk), and it's still out there ... waiting for her players. I seriously wish I could return in time and stop myself. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" are the films you wish you'd never seen. Not correct. This will be. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of crap, but that's the only crap that haunts me. How I wish I had never seen this! Acting is not that bad. It's just writing and governing and the pace and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not these. <br /> <br /> Please listen to my warning. Do not look at this
