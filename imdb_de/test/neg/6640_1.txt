So I switched on HBO, which just occurred to me that there would be some quality movies and I saw that. Carrot Top is so funny that it's bad to look at it. I've seen bad movies before, but I find it's impossible to watch this one because Carrot Top thinks it's weird. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy, overreacted overreactions with extremely silly jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate. Talented actors have already signed up for this project, like Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you have ever seen Carrot Top's (or whatever they were) terrible MCI commercials, that's the same, only worse. It's a slapstick celebration that's a waste of a big budget that could have done something to save the homeless ... anything but that. I'm not sure it's been in the last 50 years of all time, but That's a shame for the $ 10 million spent.
