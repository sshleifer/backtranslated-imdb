This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that Hollywood does not have good ideas and is a terrible sequel and ruins the first one. Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love the first animal master; I even liked the third pretty well, but this movie is cruel. I'm a big fantasy / sword & magic movie fan, and I hated to see such a terrible sequel to a classic like the first Beastmaster. Why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? At first, the whole idea of ​​the film is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon (who was not mentioned anywhere in the first movie ... huh?) Are going into our world via a practical dimensional time portal. You see, the Earth happens to be on the same parallel interdimental plane as Dar's world. While you think the first movie is just a past movie, it's a completely different world with this movie. That's just one of the many things I hated doing. It did not work with "Masters of the Universe", and it does not work here! Films like this should take place and stay in their own timeline and familiar surroundings. For God's sake, what's next? Hercules in New York ... er, a bad example! Let's go ... <br /> <br /> Arklon's device is a device called a neutron detonator, to use as a threat to its enemies to dominate its own kingdom. So it's up to Dar, his ferret, his eagle and his tiger (this time not a spray paint) to save the world ... but on the way they have the help of a young, cool, and the hip Senator daughter who lives in is involved in all this chaos, and she shows Dar near LA, takes him on a pleasure ride in her BMW and helps him get out of difficult situations here and there. How Convenient Right Speaking of cheap: I found it very convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a heavily guarded military base and get away with a stolen, highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the US Army and L. after him. ... waaaaay too light, even for a wicked barbarian wizard from another world. There are so many action holes, I do not know where to start; Why did Arklon go to the Los Angeles Zoo at the end of the movie?!? He has absolutely no reason to go there; And would not that be like the last place you would lure your biggest enemy, who just has the handy ability to control animals? <br /> <br /> And do not you just love these types of movies? The police are portrayed as total idiots and even if half a dozen policemen shoot at a man, they still can not beat him. The police in this movie belongs to the "Police Academy" series! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses for the blind! Even the title of the film makes no sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time" ... they have never really gone through a "time portal" because the movie does not play in the future of Dar's world, but in the background a parallel world along our on the astral plane, so they NEVER really go through time, just a dimensional world along their. So there is NO actual time travel involved! This movie seems to be funny and it does not ... not because of the humor, but because it's just so bad ... and that's mild. The drama, the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the ending are all so cheesy that it is weird. What else can I expect from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing" (another bad sequel)? Very missing here is Don Coscarelli's wonderful director and the serious feeling of the first !! Avoid this smelly piece of rubbish like the bubonic plague and stick the first and maybe the third if there's nothing better for TV.
