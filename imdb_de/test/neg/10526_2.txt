I thought the movie had an interesting name and might have been thought-provoking, but I was wrong. This movie was boring, especially at the beginning and in the middle part. I can not comment on the end because I just could not watch the whole movie. The requirement to sign a student researcher just because he comes to your lab makes no sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and unfortunately, this non-living thing is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So if you have trouble sleeping, I suggest you rent this movie.
