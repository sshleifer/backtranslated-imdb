If I had never seen the first Road House, this film might get another star, but even then it's a 3-star movie. I was really surprised by the relatively high rating it currently has. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was not able to finish this movie because it was painful. Whereby it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it pretty much matches the original, although the original plot is still referenced. That makes no sense and does not work. Acting is also weak ... I never felt like going to the movies, but I felt like watching people perform. Even good actors like Busey do not work, probably because of the script or the unwieldy cut. The strangest thing is that the film feels like a B-movie in the mid-90s, though it was shot in '06. I'm not sure why, but on the other hand, for some reason, this often seems to happen in sequels. The music, the look and the overall feel remind me of movies that you saw 10 years ago on Cinemax late in the evening. The strangest thing is that I also expect Ja Rule to come eventually ... it often reminds me of more recent movies with rapper than actor. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing is love interest Girl, whose character on Smallville looks like a total rip-off of the Lois Lane character, is also quite annoying. And do not forget the wrong "southern accents" I've heard since Walk the Line. I know this is common in movies, but no accent would work better than trying to sound like a universal place on TV that everyone from a southern state (or KY and WV) sounds like. Sure, the people in AZ's desert towns sound like the people in the southeastern states that are more than 2,000 miles away. That was ten years ago in the B-films that were the source of the technology. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? Conclusion: I would not really recommend it if you are a fan of Road House or like good movies. If you have not seen it yet, do not spoil it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those random classics that people love and keep watching. It was an unexpected success like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused and, lately, Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first one!) And Napolean Dynamite. Why did they spoil it !!! <br /> <br /> You should never have done a sequel to Road House, other than a high budget version with the right actors / directors. Sure, you can never outdo the original (like bad news bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right, it will be presentable like the examples I mentioned. But to make a low-budget off-network, Road House's own production is criminal.
