I've never expected too much of a dirty B-movie director Jim Wynorski's movie: a stupid premise, some cheap effects and a bit of nudity from some busty women, and I'm usually pretty happy. <br /> <br Well, Cheerleader Massacre is delivering the former and definitely the latter, but unfortunately it's a bit light when it comes to spraying. And if a movie has the word "massacre" in the title and is on the fence, then we have a problem. Wynorski's film is about a group of cheerleaders, with their teacher at the center, minibus drivers and a couple of boys stranded in the mountains during a blizzard. They make their way to an abandoned mountain house on foot, where they find food and shelter. And a crazy murderer who wants them all dead! From the very beginning, good old Jim makes sure that his movie contains many scenes filled with T & A, and includes the obligatory shower scene as well as numerous other moments where delicious women get niggardly (including a spotty softcore sex and one very free triple) -babes-in-a-hot-tub-scene). None of the women looks young enough to be a cheerleader (and is never seen in their outfits), but who cares if they're all ready to undress in the name of art? <br /> <br /> However, I am interested in the many dull deaths of the film. I had hoped with such an extremely bold title that there would be imaginative bloodshed with all the butts, bushes and tits; Instead, virtually all killings take place off-screen or are virtually incidentless. Only a stupid scene after beheading (reached with CGI with cheap chips) comes close to delivering the goods near Slasher stupidity minus cruelty, then the cheerleading massacre after 82 minutes will not be too much of a waste of time.
