I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed that John Cleese was not Jean Bob anymore, he was my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? It looks low like a satellite cartoon in the morning! except for the flashback that was taken from the first movie. They should have stopped after number 2, which makes the rest look bad !! Derek's voice has changed, but she is not as clear as Jean Bob. Rogers looks very strange too. I also do not understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he died! This movie made me turn it off. As much as I love the first one, I was very disappointed with this episode. You will never beat the original! :)
