The film is based on Jacqueline Susann's bestselling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a ruthless TV presenter scratching his way up. It describes his love life and focuses on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his utter inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with every woman he can get. But this movie makes it seem like "gone with the wind"! This is a textbook example of how NO movie adaptation should be done. First, they densely compress the novel. The book deals with Stone's inability to commit and it becomes clear why. It grew up here ... and ignored. There is also a really vile scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but there's a reason that's completely out of the movie. And the book treated three women - not two. Do not even let me start homophobia. <br /> <br /> Apart from acting, that's pretty awful. Law is as horrible as Stone - VERY wooden and boring - one wonders why all these women are after him. To be right with Law - another actor was cast, but had a very bad accident before filming began and Law entered at the last minute. Wexler is terrible like Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really amazingly poor as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three performances are remarkable: David Hemmings (has a BIG time), camped as a gay photographer; Cannon is actually very good and Robert Ryan is just great. Dionne Warwick also sings the catchy opening song ("He's Moving On"). <br /> <br /> It's bad, but I looked at the whole thing and it's (in a stupid way) a lot of fun. I give him a 3rd. <br /> <br /> Also Jacqueline Susann has a cameo as newsreader.
