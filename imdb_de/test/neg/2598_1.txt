I have not seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it's a pretty sure bet that I will not see too many in the future. Some people say comparing this show to "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely believe that this show would not happen if "The Simpsons" did not come first and I absolutely believe that she wants to be "The Simpsons". I do not understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I saw, I understood where they wanted to LAUGH me. I understand that someone thinks a joke was just said, but the joke is not funny. I think the whole show is lazy: the title, the "jokes", the inspiration is completely missing. <br /> <br /> The best shows on TV (cartoon or not) are made as follows: a script is written, it undergoes several paraphrases, things that do not work are taken out, inspiration is stimulated, good things are added , there are other descriptions and then it is filmed. <br /> "Family Guy" episode to be created as follows: A script is written and filmed.
