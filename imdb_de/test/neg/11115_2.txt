"Chupacabra Terror" is rescued from the "1" by the presence of Canadian sweetie Chelan Simmons as a heroine. She is a pleasure to watch from the front, back and side. Otherwise, you have your usual monster movie here. plays like a low budget version of THE RELIC on board, John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported, and the very rash monster is just a man in a suit. At least the body is in this case pretty impressive. Formulaic, to say the least, I love the moment when Simmons ominously tells someone what Chupacabra stands for: goat eater! Oooohhh ... scary!
