The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the burning stove on the driveway and the run-down garage to the fire, which is the highlight of the film. It also has a wonderful sense of time, both in the 50s (opening of the film) and in the 1960s. All performances are top notch, especially Mathew MacFadyen as a psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as a dad, who finds his own intolerance magnificently magnified by his son. What a pity that the story is so ridiculous. First of all, by focusing on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, he can not show how he has managed to exert so much influence on the community. In the church we see five or six of the main characters in front and two or three in the back, but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins of him; No one at the cockfight says yes or no when he interrupts the proceedings, but neither applauds nor condemns anyone when Caroline throws a beer over him; A situation in which a stone is thrown through the shop window is mysteriously clarified by the onset of labor. Second, Middletown (which is not really a city, but a tiny village) seems to lack some important services such as police and fire services: murder can only be done by a family member with a crowbar; The residents observe an inferno that threatens to cover the entire city as if it were in the cinema. Strange things, such as phones and newspapers, are strikingly lacking, the rural community is strangely free of livestock or wheat fields, and the most puzzling of a "typical" north of Ireland is just a Christian community - not even a few Anglicans season the mix. Even if you're willing to put up unbelief, the story itself is pretty threadbare, a pale imitation of an A.J. Cronin melodrama. And the music? Well, it's nice for the first two minutes, but if you repeat the same four chords for 90 minutes without interruption, it will be more than a little irritating. My advice: Watch this with the sound off.
