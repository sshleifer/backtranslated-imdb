Impressive. I thought Eskimo Limon was the most horrible and embarrassing sex movie of all time. But I had forgotten that Germany is always trying to compete. In this case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger managed to produce even worse crap. Hard guys is stupid, unbelievable and predictable and above all: not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children have seen this in Germany (and unfortunately also in Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and be over 15, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke really tries to make us believe that he does not know anything about sex, but that does not help. Hard guys seem to have been made by someone who saw Al Bundy and took him too seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who play Schenkes semi-liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in the film. Nevertheless, their performances are the "best" and "funniest" in comparison. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
