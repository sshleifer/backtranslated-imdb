FREDDY FORSYTH has developed a storyline that matches the mood of the West over Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a bad guy as the Ruski president, who wants to bring the country back - not so much into Stalin's communism but into Hitler's fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could not have come from Marx, but from Mein Kampf. And the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to reach the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries team up with Russian Prez to carry out his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then join Pat Swayze of Dirty Dancing. He is a former American field driver, Jason Monk, who is tasked by the British government to see what the Russians are up to. As a crazy sidebar, Swayze's character, who is not a Monk (!), Has sired a Russian beauty Elena (played by the gorgeous Marta Kondova) on his previous missions in the former Commie state. Hardman Swayze is doing a passable job to defeat the evil Russians. But the young, unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the strip as his 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena, who helps father eradicate the terror that threatens her beloved mother Russia.
