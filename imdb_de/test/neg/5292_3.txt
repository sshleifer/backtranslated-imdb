I enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie when I saw it for the first time at 9 years old. Dunderklumpen is somehow cute for kids. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturdays. His Swedish scenes make the eyes pleasant. Do not expect older kids are interested, because the live action / animation is far behind the times and most older kids will bore kids in 1974.
