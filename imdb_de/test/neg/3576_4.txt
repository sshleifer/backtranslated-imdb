In New York, one morning near Christmas, a father and a mother of the upper class go to a private school with their BMW to see their daughter's play. Then they go shopping and later return to their chic Manhattan apartment. At night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they are preparing drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve, the father is kidnapped for buying his daughter's Christmas present, and his wife desperately tries to raise a large sum of money to pay the ransom demanded. "R Xmas" is a deceptive movie by Abel Ferrara. The main characters have no names and are anonymous, and perhaps they intend to say that in the neighborhood of a neighboring family in your building could be drug dealers; or that drug dealers also have families and can be affectionate persons; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than the criminals; or is it a simple apology for crime? What ever! But this humanization of criminals is a terrible message, and I really did not like this movie. In Brazil, for example, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities because the state is lacking in poor areas and in slums, but this practice does not make them a model citizen. In this film, we see a loving upper-class family using drugs as a livelihood during the day, but the destruction of members of other families is not shown in the story, and it's impossible to feel sympathy for any character. In the end, I wish everyone that they were dead. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto" ("Gangs of the Ghetto")
