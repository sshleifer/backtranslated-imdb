Jackass's Bam Margera has returned with his own reality show and is not only not as funny as Jackass, but also amazingly stupid! This is one of the dumbest shows ever conceived. Surely there are worse reality shows, but none is mean or stupid. <br/> <br/> Bam Margera has made it big and his parents have decided to break away from his fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while Bam and his buddies break things up and mischief, his parents are generally stupid at home. When Bam's parents are away from home and are lazy, they are tortured by Bam, especially his father. To humor, we come to his fat uncle Don Vitto, who is constantly out of the game and never careful. <br /> <br /> This show is really like a toned-down version of Jackass ... toned Down there are no stunts, instead Bam and his buddies just break down and do lame stunts, and meanwhile loud music is played to to make the whole thing hornier. That's not funny at all. I can not imagine a fool show like this, since there is not a gram of intelligence here. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Margera and you want to see one of the many successors / deposits in the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out of ****. 30 minutes.
