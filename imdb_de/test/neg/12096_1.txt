This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen well over 300 movies in my life. The terrible act, the only bright spot, seems to judge the anatomical strength of the female cast members. After watching this movie, it is recommended that the viewer does not operate or drive heavy machines for at least 24 hours. A bottle of Valium is also recommended so you will not feel so bad about the 100 minutes of your life. The plot is not original, the dialogue is painful and even the weapons seem to be below average. Do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn all the copies of this horrible movie.
