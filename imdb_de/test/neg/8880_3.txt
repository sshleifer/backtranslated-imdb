I had this DVD to watch and thought I would see a kind of biography of the painter Goya, but the film was about everything but Goya. This film is about a young woman kidnapped by the Holy Inquisition of her family, allegedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (just because the poor girl did not want to eat pork!). The rest of the film is about torture and humiliation, driven by a bad script (I can not believe it's from JC Carri√®re, as I could not believe that this guide will be directed by Milos Forman), referring to a religious man and this young man is focused woman and that's all. <br /> <br /> Ah, and I forgot to play Goya that he plays a completely peripheral role - this could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone. Very disappointing - one of those films that will be forgotten forever (if it has not happened yet). Rent "The Name of the Rose" if you want to have a movie about the Holy Inquisition. And I do not know what to rent if you want to see a movie about the Spanish painter Goya. Maybe a good-caliber director, not Forman, will have to make it. PS: The Spanish painter Goya - the title role that gets lost in the plot - is portrayed by a Scandinavian actor, making it even harder to take this movie seriously. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to play the biography of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
