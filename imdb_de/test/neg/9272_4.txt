The story of a former seal of the Navy, which is now a combat doctor assigned to a Russian submarine with a nurse. This is the answer to a call for help from a dying member of the original crew. The submarine was overtaken by terrorists committed to destruction. We see that the duo is trying to regain control. And this happens with the fear that the US Naval Forces are about to uncover everything that is in the terrorist subway to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful with the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A few inexplicable scenes towards the end. Look at it when you have time. Nothing to miss, even if you run the show while you get yourself a cup of coffee: Slow.
