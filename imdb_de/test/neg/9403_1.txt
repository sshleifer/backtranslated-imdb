This is by far the probably worst movie Al Pacino could have played in. The movie had no real action. It is in 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this movie are people from anonymous players. Mcconaughey's character is not credible enough to be Pacino's protégé. So he won a few bets for some degenerate customers as a sideline for a shitty job in a 900 service. Should this automatically convince an audience of their abilities? It was just stupid to think about it. The trailer promised to show us how to do his picks, but after reviewing the whole movie, I still need to know what his skills are if he ever had them. If you want skill, look at Robert de Niro's character at the casino. That's showmanship. At some point in the film, Mat's character chooses his winning bets after a coin toss. Everyone can do that. Al Pacino seems to talk a lot, and I mean, I spit out in your facial dialogue. I think this style started with Scent of a Woman and worked for him because he won an Oscar, but now I think it's just irritating. He always seems to preach. He does a mean act of portraying a man with unstable angina (which is an imminent heart attack) who usually remembers his behavior in Godather Part 3, where he plays aging, diabetic mafia Don Corleone, but the Pacino talent is different as this talent movie. Rene Russo is just a feast for the eyes of this movie. She is in shape and shows it in the tight dresses she wears everywhere. This movie is normal crap. Do not waste your money with it. It's a lot worse than the chips of Mats character in the movie.
