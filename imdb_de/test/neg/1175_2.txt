Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is 1957 in the small American town of Plainfield in Wisconsin, where the loner Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives alone on a farm after the death of his father. The local police had to deal with a series of serious robberies and when the local barmaid Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) suspects that something bad is going on. Ed is a violent, sexually deviant man who kidnaps and murders girls. Will the police find out the truth in time to save Erica (Adrienne Frantz), the sheriff's daughter (Timothy Oman)? <br /> <br /> Written: Produced and Directed by: Michael Feifer This was an attempt to tune a horror movie to the true events surrounding notorious serial killer Ed Gein & turns out to be pretty crap. The real life of Ed Gein was always condemned only for two murders and died in 1984, but some films were inspired by him, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000), this relatively new addition Although the worst Gein movie of all time existed Although Ed Gein was next to nothing in this movie, it is based on facts. Gein never had an accomplice. None of his victims was related to any of the investigators. There was no car accident, although Gein keeps his name to other people After the name had changed, the kidnapping and murder of the two depicted women actually happened at a distance of four years. In this movie, however, this happens over the course of a few days. Meanwhile, Gein is actually portrayed as a big muscular man. He was a skinny, skinny, old and rather short man. As a matter-of-fact drama, Ed Gein: The butcher of Plainfield is worthless, and for pure entertainment it's no better with a deadly boring pace and feel, the characters are all boring and if he does not kill someone, Gein is shown working or walking around and it is very boring. There is no tension because we know who the killer is, and it's just a lengthy wait until he gets caught in the end. There is no real attempt to go into Geins mind if the makers do not motivate him more than if he occasionally has hallucinations of his domineering mother. <br /> <br /> There is not much going on here, there is a scene with a woman On a hook of meat, there is a really badly edited scene, in which Gein cuts off a leg, there are the usual pitchers with body organs and skulls around and something Blood, but there really is not much excitement here. The film has obviously been edited to bleach much of the color from the image, as it is sometimes not far from black and white. I personally think the lack of color makes it even more boring to sit through. <br /> <br /> With a purported budget of about $ 1,500,000, I can not really see where the money goes in a very forgettable production. Although filmed in Wisconsin, it was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is completely wrong about Ed Gein's role, but physically, Hodder does not look like Gein, and he does a pretty poor job, just staring at the camera and making stupid faces. <Ed Gein: The BUtcher of Plainfield is crap and so easy and straightforward. Either as factual drama or as pure entertainment entertainment, this is a total journey from beginning to end, without it being recommended.
