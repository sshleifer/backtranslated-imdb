I am obviously disappointed, so I will be brief and not lose any time. At first the plot was not inspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we're in 2008 for God's sake and it looked like a brighter version of G.I.Joe. I will not even care to characterize the performance of the actors and the dialogues. Or maybe because I just saw you need 10 lines to post a comment here (?! ??!?!). Where were we? Oh yes, the idea, well, it was totally flat, lack of passion and talent, if I'm sorry. As far as the dialogue is concerned, as well as the acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that nobody would expect. Let's just hope the movie will be decent ... at least.
