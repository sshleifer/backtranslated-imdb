First, I capture the music. It's nothing as astounding as Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust's haunting theme or the masterpiece of A Tale of Two Sisters, but I'm not going to be in the movie so early. <br /> <br /> It must be assumed that the woman who examines her hypothesis for her PhD thesis that cannibalism as an organized practice never existed, one would think they would have to consider that they are wrong and themselves Prepare accordingly for the journey, right? Or why should you go at all if you already believe that the hypothesis is true before you even get tested? This is quite ignorant and makes the movie much more unrealistic and poorly scripted. <br /> <br /> This is similar to the film by Ruggero Deodato and is completely unprepared. No weapons, no decent hiking clothes, just nonsense through and through. <br /> <br /> Without college planning and preparation, people do not go on trips like this. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... <br /> <br /> For our brave, but stupid adventurers, it's not very good, as they miss a jaywalking iguana and their decoy ferret almost out of the car It's the sinking, then you fall into a mud hole. Well, I think it's time to run. <br /> <br /> Okay, then they throw a coin to see if they keep going or forget about it. How does this scene make any sense? All your conviction is based on the coin toss? After spending time and money and getting ready, they just have to go out. It's getting worse. Definitely part of the worst drama and scriptwriting, as well as music ever created for the film industry. Mike talks about how he and his friends were captured by the cannibals and put into cages in mud pits with 3-inch leeches sucking on their blood. I found that interesting because remembering the first cannibals they encounter in the jungle, a man they misunderstand as a common natives sits on the ground and eats such leeches as to whether they are the same? Really, though this movie is just awful because the script is awful and the acting is emotionless in the face of the content. They just agree that they feel eaten by the cannibals as if it was not a big deal. Of course, Mike is crazy, but just as in the first film, they treat the natives with such horrible behavior that it's just unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's film easily senses that the Americans are getting what they deserve, while in this movie you can hardly blame the natives for what is happening to the Americans again. <br /> <br /> And that's why the movie feels a bit pointless. We already got the point from the first movie, why was the sequel done? The lieutenant's name is Rizzo ?! Could it get worse? In movies like these, if you look up the cast, they find that they have not really acted in many other films, and their bios are virtually non-existent. So you can imagine that I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this film in Scorsese's New York gangs. Well, Lt. Rizzo sounded familiar to me, and I realized that in the 2002 film Spiderman he played a very tiny role as captain of the tugboat. Reminds me how William Shatner of the USS Enterprise Admiral became a police officer in a car. Irony, sometimes irony. Shatner never got the music right until his last album "Has Been", which is really good, just as Bono of U2 never got a real haircut and Dan Marino never won Superbowls. <br /> <br /> Sometimes irony is just sad, like Christopher Reeve, Superman can not go irony. The man will always be a legend because he was such a great guy, but I digress once again. <br /> <br /> At this point, I can say that I'm pretty bored even talking about Cannibal Ferox. <Br /> <br /> Kannibal Holocaust's message was who the true savages are and what's really evil. What do the savages in the natural life who are unknown to our moral records do, or what do we do with malicious intentions? Cannibal Ferox's message seems to be, "Be careful what you're looking for, because you could find it." I will say this for Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her dissertation, claiming that cannibalism does NOT exist, she saves others who are curious and go where angels are afraid, but overall the film was really bad. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
