OK, look, this show is the worst show on Nick @ Night. I love so many shows at Nick @ Night and I love them. When this show came to Nick @ Night, I was so upset. It's such a boring show and it's stupid. From all the times I've seen, I found an episode a bit funny. This show has some of the funniest and dumbest jokes ever. This show adds up to terrible. Give Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and George Lopez props. This show is boring and not a bit smart. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I do not think it deserves to be played alongside some great classic shows on nick @ night. This show lacks prudence, good jokes and style.
