'Gross Misconduct' was one of a series of texts published in Australia in the early 1990s that dealt with the alleged victimization of the privileged heterosexual man in the age of feminism. This creature only has to look at a Pretty Young thing, and it is accused of sexual harassment and ruined his life. Damn, these women's libbers! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone suggests, I do not buy any of these anti-feminist BS and have not enjoyed the movie either. "GM" trivializes the problems of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. Sexual harassment is here the product of the imagination of a confused young woman and the professional boundaries that the teachers are supposed to maintain. I'm not worried about this. <br /> <br /> Sexist rubbish, and even when I check him, I give him more time than he deserves.
