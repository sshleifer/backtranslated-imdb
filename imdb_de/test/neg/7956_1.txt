Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and a number of other so-called intellectuals are given the title of intellectual because they want to portray India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta still earns her money. Nevertheless, Hindus are too gentle or anxious to protest against the protest of Muslims, so that anyone can free themselves with Hinduism. And it is a fact that in the 1930s women in the West were also abused when they were widowed. Except that no one likes to point out something bad about the West or anything other than India and Hindus. She paints an incorrect representation of India and the situation of widows there. Nowhere is it mentioned that child marriages are illegal. She finished the film and said that there are 34 million widows in India. Of course there will be so many widows under a billion people. But how many live in the movie? Deepa Mehta is finally selling India and poverty to earn dollars. How pathetic....
