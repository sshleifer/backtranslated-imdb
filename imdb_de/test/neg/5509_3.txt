OK, no one's going to mistake that for Citizen Kane, but you have to love a movie where women are always on top. There are a few catfights and a bit of muddled sex. On the other hand, I hope that you will not overpay the man who wrote the dialogue. Here is a prime example. After one of the girls dies in captivity: <br /> <br /> "That's awful, it reminds me of the day Zenobia died" "A relative?" "No, my favorite cow." I guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like this plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sessions to master this beautiful piece of art, never a good sign. I think that happens after a while, when everything looks the same. I hope the people waiting to rent next time will not get too impatient. Do not worry, people, it's on the way.
