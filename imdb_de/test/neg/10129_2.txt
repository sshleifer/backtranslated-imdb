I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. Alex says something that is neither funny nor interesting, and suddenly there is a laughing background. My friend and I just looked at each other with a blank look as if we were asking, "What's so funny? !!" Seriously, every time we saw the show, you did not hear laughter or cough. Only an empty look. So we stop seeing it. I'm a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But the show shows us such a disappointment. This show could be one of the worst comedy sitcoms ever ...
