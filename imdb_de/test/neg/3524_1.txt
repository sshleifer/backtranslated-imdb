What can I say? This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are admittedly awful). The acting was amateur, the sets were boring and the camera work was modest and smart. The whole movie seemed to be a college graduation project. I always had to make sure it was done by a teenager to make it look good. The most troubling factor of the "movie" is that it is not shot at all - it is shot on video. That was extremely distracting. Moreover, the dialogue is simply catastrophic and the plot is so basic that my eyes will be tears. Not to mention stealing at least four more horror films in the first 20 minutes. If there were something like zero stars, this movie would get it. <br /> <br /> The only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is.
