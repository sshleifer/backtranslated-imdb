What did you think when you made this really TERRIBLE movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did someone who could make this film, who explains his unique artistic vision as a result of an (imaginary) affair with a grotesque but charismatic hairy freak (played by Downey)? <br /> <br /> In real life, Arbus broke out of the traditional marriage and the role of the woman to express herself. In this film, Arbus is an extremely bleak Nicole Kidman, whose inspiration is all due to a "Beauty and the Beast" dedication to an interesting man. <br /> <br /> For this reinvention, the movie is really shameful. Regardless, it's just stupid and boring.
