This film has tried to make the life of Stu Ungar interesting by being creative. What they have forgotten is that his life was entertaining on its own, without having to come up with something. <br /> <br /> A short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent He was in Las Vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts. He spent a lot of time in Florida and did not go to Las Vegas until he got the gin games on the East Coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never worked (or played) with a casino manager (or the gin played by Pat Morita in the movie). <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic turnaround in building the WSOP in 1997. In fact, Stuey has barely made it to the tournament. He snorted Cocaine the week before. <br /> <br /> Either tell the story correctly or do not tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for the incredible performance of Michael Imperolli (the only redeeming quality of this film.)
