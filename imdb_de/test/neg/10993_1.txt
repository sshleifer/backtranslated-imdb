One of the worst movies I've seen so far in 2009: History hesitates between a stupid thriller or a stupid comedy. <br /> <br /> If nothing happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogues that do not make sense! <br /> <br /> The cast is famous, but brings no emotion except to move the piece forward! <br /> <br /> And it happens in a luxurious seaside hotel that looks really bleak. In comparison, the "Shining" is a fair! <br /> <br /> NB: Many users believe that it is on the French Riviera! You are wrong! It's not Southern France (Nice, Cannes), but on the contrary: Cabourg & Normandy, to be simply the beaches of D-Day! That's why the sea is as gray as the sky and there is no sun!
