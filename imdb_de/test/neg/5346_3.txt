I just wasted my Saturday night looking at that crap! I've seen the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big from "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick (from "X-Files"), the decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney, and Mercedes Ruehl. a very reasonable IMDb rating (5.6); and many good reviews in IMDb. To my surprise, the movie is awful: the characters are poorly constructed; The story is trying to be funny, but she is totally stupid. The figure of Mercedes Ruehl is amazingly stupid for a Princeton professor. So I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and found that most of the IMDb users are only reviewers, relatives or friends of the cast and crew or people promoting the garbage. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("Without Returns")
