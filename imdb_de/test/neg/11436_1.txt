I can not figure out what Jon Voight might have thought when he came across this two-step, incoherent, overbearing, startling feeling. He helped write the supposed "script" himself, and he should be damned damn good. The movie (I can not call it a "movie" because it barely moves) is a far-reaching, embarrassingly cocky jerk - kind of like a really bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. It meanders senselessly from the Middle Ages to modern-day Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who believes himself to be the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and this is somehow transferred to the modern day Time when Voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company. If the bizarre casting (including Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard, and Armand Assante) is not enough to kill the deadly inappropriate direction, the washed-out photograph looks like (it looks like it's a real one) cheap 16 mm camera), almost complete editing (scenes either continue endlessly or get chopped off in the middle of a sentence), and Voune's embarrassing, seemingly streamlined "acting" is enough to bury them, and that's exactly what you should have done , A stunning experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
