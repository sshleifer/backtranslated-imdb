Review: A lonely swordsman who lives in the desert and acts as an agent for other swordsmen, remembers how his life has become as it is. It began with the woman he loved instead marrying his brother, leaving his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who himself is in the midst of a complicated love story in which a woman wants to kill him because he has run away from a promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to protect Huang, and everything is embarrassed if the woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comment: I have seen how the Redux version was published In 2008, the original was published, which was published in 1994. I can not say what the two versions are, but the Redux is stylized very much in the style of Chinese Wuxia action. This is unfortunate because this style seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. An understandable story. However, the stylistic scenery and visual elements seem to be much more important and in the focus of writer and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore, there are many colorful, very beautiful scenes that are unrelated to the story. <br /> <br /> Also the treatment and the schedule of the story are treated wrongly. In the scenes much is left out, the timeline is interrupted and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and quiet scenes are suddenly alleviated by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated struggles just to free themselves from something else that has nothing to do with each other. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the movie is included in the action genre. The poster and the photos also suggest this, but could almost be considered as wrong marketing. Only a few minutes from the 90 minutes was to be understood as something action, the other could not be further away. The film as a whole is very slow, boring and therefore very boring. Not even the rare action scenes help as they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I could say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style, as they often seem to be plagued by these same problems, most importantly, the visual element is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
