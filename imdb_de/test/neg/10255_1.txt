I do not really know why so many people love this movie: it may be funny, but it has ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself has said, this film has betrayed the book: Not only is the story reduced by force to about 1/3, but all the symbols, the complexity, are all in a very '80s fantasy / adventure movie for kids lost . Today we have effects, directors, a new attention for books: I hope someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) one day will direct the REAL Neverending story. A great writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it.
