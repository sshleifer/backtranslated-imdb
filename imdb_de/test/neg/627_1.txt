Pretty, stereotypical, good-looking cast, the story goes in a wide and confusing arc, guiding you through several garden paths (with no fairies involved) before plummeting to an end that wants to leave you. > If you are looking for a movie that has a climax or ends with a satisfying beat, it will be a disappointment. Despite the main character's seemingly obvious sexuality, I felt that he was androgynous and had no clear male personality, much like a clear-cut French personality. Although he intentionally sits naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the movie, the viewer is just as unaware as the character and the motivations - this little thing called a plot. Probably a stereotypical English-speaking perspective, at least if you put yourself on the side of the film.
