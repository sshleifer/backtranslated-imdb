Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultra Lame. Should I continue? There is one, I repeat * a * funny scene in this whole, boring, amusing amateur hour special of a movie: Fares Fares' fat father kills someone with his beer gut. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre heap of nothing consists of the usual, boring-looking Swedish "actors," who offer dialogues that go in and out of each other, a banal story, a sloppy direction, and, well, nothing worth mentioning. Nepotistically charged Fares Fares is as charismatic as an accountant, and his nose is even comparable to that of Adrien Brody in terms of sheer ridiculous size. Torkel Petersson should work only with Lasse Spang Olsen. Fortunately, the rest of the cast is easy to forget, while Fares's gigantic titanic nose will forever haunt me in my dreams. Josef Fares helps to ruin Swedish cinema. Do not support him and his nonsense. Jalla Jalla is comedy, which Arnold Schwarzenegger is for acting, Kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a budget Youtube video, and Zozo was simply the most presumptuous, pseudo-touching garbage ever unleashed by a Swedish director , Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish films can be so much better than this, so stop pretending that Fares' stripes are just because they are "good at being Swedish" , You're welcome.
