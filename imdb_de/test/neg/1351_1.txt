I really wish I had read the review before reading the movie ... it was one of the most painful movies I have ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater after 5 minutes; I should have followed my instinct. The movie offered nothing new or smart, it was boring and very clich√©d. I was surprised to learn that it was run by a woman! The characters were not women I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, bad make-up and hair styling. It was recently compared to the Sex and in the City movie; it was not even half as good. My suggestion, do not see this movie!
