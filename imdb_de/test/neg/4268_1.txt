Keep away from this. The worst thing is the terrible story. There seems to be a purpose to convey a subtle spiritual / love / friendship message, but it is so miserable without any stuff that you can not help but scare. In addition, most of the screen time is a far under-standard story of thieves, criminals and our hero dealing with alien time-travel artifacts. I know that you have problems dealing with time, but the story is full of holes than usual. You also have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture, overwhelming, cheap, abrupt and incoherent. All I can say is "You're alive! This movie is bad!"
