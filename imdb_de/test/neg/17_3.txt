It could be the biggest disappointment I will experience in 2009. I seem to be the rare person Park Oldboy did not like, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are among the best films I've seen in the 2000s. Therefore, I was very much looking forward to seeing this, especially as it received such positive reviews. Instead, I found the movie clich√©d and broke little, if any, new avenues in the vampire genre. And although I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, I felt that Park did so at very bad times. <br /> <br /> Others have compared this to "Let the Right One In" and I have to say that "Let the Right One In" was far superior to this game and was a new version of the vampire genre. Unfortunately, Park's tired tired.
