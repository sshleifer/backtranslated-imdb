Before I watched this movie on HBO, I expected nothing, just a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot. Well, that's exactly what I got out of it, only that I was a little bit satisfied at the end of the movie. I did not expect it to be like this, I thought it would only take one and a half hours to waste my hands on. Well, that was it, but it was worth it anyway. The whole plot was very stupid and cheap, and some of the lines were very stupid. Otherwise, there were still funny moments, even if they are not many. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you hire this, then not. Watch it on TV. I gave it a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but still it was pretty stupid.
