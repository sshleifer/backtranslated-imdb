OK. At first, I just wanted to check if this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. But 5.9. This is sicker than any killer's method -, -. That made me curious about what people wrote here ... which eventually led me to set up a report to bring my 2 cents of truth into this "Fountain of Illusion" that I find here. Call this movie in the same sentences as Seven? The only thing they have in common is that they show different crime scenes. That's it. And "Best Crime of 1999!" ? Did you even see another movie this year? Or any other movie in your life? 1999 is not a year people remember from RESURRECTION ... What about recent movies like 8mm, Big Eyes, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (Actually, you're more of a "thriller" than it could ever be ...). Resurrection does not deserve to be dedicated to a second second of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you guys can not be serious. I saw this movie yesterday with my girlfriend who was recommended by a friend. A "great movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... what I had not seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Well, first the covers: OK, nothing special. At second glance, you do not need any supernatural powers to be aware that they are simply mirroring Lambert's head, cutting his nose and doing this and that, and then putting a fancy negative pattern on it to frame the killer's image Cover to bring. You might even think they had an apprentice who consumed a gallon of marshmallows to describe that weird (booooh! -.-) mouth ... whatever. Turned over and the plot begins with "in Chicago it's raining ... blabber blabber". Come on, a six year old could have made this snippet sound more exciting. Well, with all this excitement coming from the movie's great presentation, you really want to start looking at it. Because it can not be that bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. This assumption from me proved wrong. By "proven wrong," I mean, it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting humanity has ever known (every actor, but the tips are the "I can 1-liners!") - Police Chief, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme, when she made several incidents into a still ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN hint in the case !!!! - cyclical, light years far-fetched conclusions that in my view constitute an insult to every thinking person and last but not least a cameraman Well, and if you do not shut down your brain completely (these are not prerequisites for seeing it), then you should know who is who and what after 30 minutes, simply because you're after The first scene knows EVERY scene, that's exciting, exciting, because this movie makes you almost believe you could see the future. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is by far the worst movie I can remember. Trust me, I've seen a lot of horrible movies that were just bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. However resurrection is the best example of how to fail in all sorts of areas. It was so bad that after I was shocked by its inconceivably low quality in "e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g", I laughed more often than in any other comedy, simply because I was intrigued by how buoyant the crew was to release such an unusual filmstrip. Good for Lambert he was in Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be pardoned. ; ^ O <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend watching this movie EVERYONE. In the end, we had a lot of fun watching: ^ D. I guarantee you, after you have completely seen the resurrection (be brave, you can!), You will adore the level of acting in any given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Or just go back to Highlander ... that's what I'm going to do.
