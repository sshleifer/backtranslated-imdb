The television commercial for this film showed how the Warlocks hit a truck, then were torn to pieces and reformed on the other side of the truck. I liked the special effects, but the general style of the film was uncertain. This is the "Charmed" TV series with three boys instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for the three adults that are about to grow up is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and consolidate all their power. As well as entering lorries, these children can fly up the walls of houses, climb out of the windows, stack each other in rubbish, and reveal the veins in their necks. However, if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and weak. The father of one of the boys is proof of this because he sits in an attic that looks like a mummy, but he is only 45 years old. The three good sorcerers are all dirty his own right, completely spoiled, abominable and annoying. In every public school, these children would be beaten up every day. Their looks and face ticks would not cut off any mustard from the hood of the boys. Unfortunately for all good people, these charming boys were sent to the Hogwart Reform School for the Warlocks who could not enter the class of Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What was the movie about? Three teenagers play with each other and their girlfriends. Another teenager who envies his power and money and happens to be a lost relative. After a few scenes in which the Charmed Boys show their strength and have sex with their girlfriends; The film comes to the revenge plan of the unknown warlock. The predictable stuff happens. The evil sorcerer attacks various friends of the other warlocks and finally attacks them too. The last confrontation takes place, and that's it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you want to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins then this is a good movie to watch.
