PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) lives in a remote country house is driven by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who proves to be a carnivorous alien, the avant-garde of a massive invasion ... Despite his most economical budget and lead-free pace Norman J. Warren's successor to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) is much more than the sum of his meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently his only writing criterion): Faulkner and Annan indulge in an obsessive relationship while living in remote splendor in the English landscape (alternately beautiful and threatening by Derek V. Brownes Although Annan's discovery of blood-stained clothing in one of the upper rooms marked one (or both) of these cat-eyes caresses as mentally disturbed explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom seem to have lived in the house sometime and have "gone" under mysterious circumstances. The unexpected arrival of Stokes disrupts the relationship, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men, and partly because Annan is attracted to him and creates tensions that lead to a violent whirlwind of violence. There is an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner tries to "disenchanted" her unsuspecting visitor by putting on women's clothes, although Stokes' alien mentality allows him to be more than intended mockery. At least in early scenes, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is portrayed with unusual grace and dignity, but this intimate sapphic connection quickly transforms into a series of handsome episodes of sex and lifeblood culminating in an explosion of horror as Annan pampers Stokes after a fierce quarrel with Faulkner. The final sequences are (in the truest sense of the word) persevering, especially Annan's last scene, which was cut off in 1977 for censorship reasons and never fully restored (what's left is still pretty much alive, so get ready!). Outstanding performance of the three leading actors, supported by Warren's unobtrusive orientation, which takes full advantage of the breathtaking forest conditions and thus balances the budget deficits of the film. Originally released in the US as ALIEN PREY.
