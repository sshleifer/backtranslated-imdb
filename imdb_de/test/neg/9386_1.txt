This show is terrible. I can not overcome the complete waste of great talent that this show contains. This is not a fun improvisation drama, it's just a cheap attempt to throw famous comedians onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improvised scene. I actually did improvisation work as an actor, and this show is not an improvisation. is the embarrassment of the guest star who is lost like a deer in the spotlight. The stupid, completely independent things they are dealing with are what people laugh about. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them it's wrong! I think this show is a shame for the arts and makes me cry after shows like Whose Line is Anyway.
