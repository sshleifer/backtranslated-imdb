As a fan of C. J.'s earlier movie Latter Days I really wanted to have this movie. <br /> <br /> The nicest thing I can say is that it's NOT a horrible movie. There are some good performances and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has some great scenes in which she talks to her fiancee's ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, it's a nice week. Too often the script draws on comic coincidences and clich√©d movie moments. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy does not even know he's playing the game?) Mostly, this movie had no idea where he was going or what to say tried. There are many scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut out half of the characters from the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Despite all the mistakes, I have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years. That says a lot about how bad most gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope the next movie from C.J. getting better.
