When this movie was shot in 1980, I was a teenager in the football stalls who played as part of the audience. This was done in Mooseheart, Illinois. The big letters with the inscription "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the bleachers were covered with a banner in the film. The director would cheer us on in some places, as if a touchdown would be carried out. The St. Charles Juvenile Correction Center is a real place, less than 50 km from Mooseheart, though I think it was recently closed. During a scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Directly below them is the head of my sister Noel (at that time she was 11). In the VHS version I can only see her head, but when I saw her on television in 1981, I could see her whole head and also my sister Jacqui was fine for a movie made for TV. Since there is already a description of the film, I do not have to repeat it. It is worth to see at least once.
