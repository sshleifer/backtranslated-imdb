I spent a year in Iraq, and among the hundreds of films I've seen here, this little gem called the Vampire Assassin. Judging by the cover (African American with corncrake with curved blade, leather coat and the behavior of a badass), I expected a rip-off of the blade. Fair enough. <br /> <br /> So I'll take a look and watch an overweight African American without a blade, no cornrows and well, really nothing, except ... I do not know. If you have read any of these other reviews, you will get the core of the strip. It sucks. Bad. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the Highlander Blitz after killing an immortal vampire, or the Karate kick sound effects for camera zooms or the twenty dollar budget for props or "We have 90 minutes to film this before being filmed at a Johnson & Johnson parking lot "or the martial arts that are just as exciting and fast as two old people having sex, or the acting class 7 talent or the eccentric Asian master who is either senial or on acid or what, but the movie manages to force you to question your existence. And that's great. <br /> <br /> Not many films can be so bad that your head will explode like a scanner. If you talk to your friends (or MST3K), this is the movie for you. I have seen it three times and believe that it could have permanently damaged my psyche. If you EVEN have no idea about the quality of the movie, people have tried to give it away for free and nobody would take it. Not even by force. <br /> <br /> Long story short, watch out. Either as a masochistic pleasure or as a punishment. It will rock your skull (and for the most part for all the wrong reasons).
