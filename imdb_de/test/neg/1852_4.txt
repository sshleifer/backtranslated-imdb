Michael Caine usually appears in very good ("Blame it on Rio," "Sleuth," "Without Clue," "Gambit," "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or in really bad comedies ("Noises Off," "Death she ")", "Harry & Walter go to NY") This falls into the latter category. <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that has only two successes: succeeding in a cast with Caine Gamble and Richardson, who all have comedic abilities, manage their mission of not making the viewer laugh, there's no really funny moment here, the main reason is the lousy script, there was so much vain effort to write a meaningless twisted story that's just too annoying to follow (considering this is just a comedy) that the authors forgot to make the damn thing funny, which, as far as I remember, That's the point of a comedy. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this idiot. Some people even say, "If you are a Moron fan you will love this one" blah blah blah. A Moron fan? Does this unwritten person really have fans? Such a poorly written comedy requires a mega talent to make one or two laughs, someone like Steve Coogan, not your average idiot. <br /> <br /> When you make a comedy Actors then at least make them the idiots they normally are. The characters of Caine and Moron are insufficiently stupid. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this unenthusiastic collection of scenes is the little girl. Only a really terrible writer would think, to spice up a lousy script, it is advisable to have an over-intelligent clever child. Smart a ** kids are not even fun anymore for Bill Cosby fans. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a normal kid and she was very funny. This stupid old kid is smarter than the grown-up and belongs to a centuries-old Marx Brothers movie.
