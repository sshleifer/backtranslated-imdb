I can not understand how anyone who has actually read the secrets of M. Didius Falco can make fun of it. An Aussie has no business in ancient Rome. None of the books in this movie are beyond the setting and the characters, and they're wasted on an action thin enough to read the stupid script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerves when they show their names in the credits.
