I thought I was watching this movie as I was doing a movie about a mysterious box. Therefore, it would be nice to see how this film developed and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> Before going to the cinema, I had high expectations for this movie. Actresses like Cameron Diaz would expect acting to be particularly great. The acting was a kind of disappointment for the movie, the characters' accents changed throughout the movie and made it incredible. The whole idea of ​​a strange box that makes your dreams come true, but destroys others. Such a brilliant story, but I think the director has failed. This movie had the potential, it could be a lot better than it was. This movie had no middle. it was too confusing and needed a solid action. Nobody wants to go to the movies and think what I just saw: "I did not get it at all". Sometimes it can be exciting and make people see it again, but this movie has made people never want to want to hear about the movie again. While watching, I noticed that half the audience had left before the end. I have the feeling that every single person had disappointed this movie due to the high expectations and the slow parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> put the bad points aside ... but I liked the scene where the son ends up in the bathroom. It was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie, and the way it was put together made me imagine, and how devastating and frightening it would be to be in that position. The lighting and effects made it look great. This scene looked a bit more 1990s than 1970s, as if this movie was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This movie was confusing because it had so many different aspects. Parts that would be expected to be lined up at the end, where everything becomes clear, but that was not the case, it completely met the expectations of the audience, even if the film was left on a cliff top and the audience no reason for it was given, why things could happen work and really good work, but this movie was not the case, it was a creative, unusual movie that I thought he could have been better, disappointed would not have enjoyed him and would honestly do it said not to buy DVD.
