I've never seen a movie that annoyed me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and horrible things. This is not a funny movie. I have to say that the plot is terrible. I had no patience to see it, so I only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This film is all about a stupid guy trying to meet with the daughter of his tyrannous boss. When he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to go to her house that night to watch her father's owl, and he thinks she has invited him to go to a party with her and around To be with her at 6 pm He is very disappointed when he finds out that he only needs to look after the owl and that she has a boyfriend. After her father leaves the house and gives precise instructions to take care of the house and his beloved bird, a secretary, a reneged son, and everything else that is not funny, appears in the house. But he finally joins the daughter of his boss. Trust me that this movie is awful !!!!!!!!!!!!
