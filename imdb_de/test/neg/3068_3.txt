When I saw the image of the restaurant on the cover of the DVD, I realized that this was a local movie. The word Detroit in the title has strengthened my suspicions and I've looked at a few things and yes, it was a local movie. <br /> <br /> So I picked it up. Someone I knew actually knew some of the producers / directors (do not know which ones) and said that the producers / directors forced people to get involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! What a great idea. The filmmakers get some capital for the film thanks to their cast and crew. Then the investors (cast, crew, others) get some of the profit, I imagine. <br /> <br /> Win! <br /> <br /> At least. This movie totally challenged me. The special effects were especially like with special children who drive the small buses to school. The spectacle was very amusing, but not deliberate. There is a great line in which a man says, "Well, this bone will not smoke itself!" as a pickup line. Unfortunately, that's the only funny part of the entire movie. The history? Well, I followed him about 3/5 of the way in, then everything made no sense and as we sat there and watched it, it ended suddenly. I mean as in ... no dissolution of anything ... as if they have no more time. "I'm sorry, people, out of time, good night!" <br /> <br /> We sat there confused and booed and added another movie. About 20 minutes later, a neighbor of mine appeared ... with one of the guys from the movie! We threw him back and he (the actor) gave us a comment on the race which was fantastic because he totally ripped the movie! <br /> <br /> What more can you ask for? <br /> <br The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle chase scene in which it was so dark that it could literally have been a guy passing by with a flashlight and not a motorcycle. That and the chin that suddenly drops in your face are enough to make you howl. Be in pain! The zombies looked less like zombies than my colleagues. And I do not work in the morgue. <br /> <br /> So I recommend this if you can get someone in the movie to come over and give you a detailed commentary on all the things that are going on behind the project and make sure that person hates the movie because it just adds to the fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, give this a pass. Rent something like Feeder if you fancy a funny movie ...
