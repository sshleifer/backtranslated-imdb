I was surprised in 2003 by director Antal Kontroll. His first American project Vacancy was less impressive, but a decent start. Armored is its second feature, and although the visual signature is recognizable, the movie never rises above the level of a B-movie. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the main premise contains all the ingredients for twists and turns, and the ensemble with many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great raid movie, instead an action movie. On the other hand, he could have done a cool action movie that does not really work in this department either. <br /> <br /> What remains is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters arguing and fighting for a sum of money. If you drop by for the sharp movies, cast and tight music score, stick to a below-average direct-to-video with Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This was probably the most disappointing movie for a long time for me.
