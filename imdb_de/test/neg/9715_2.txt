Too bad that Mike Meyers chose this for his dramatic debut. This movie looks like it was put together by a committee that could not decide if it was a comedy, a drama, a suspense, or a science-fiction movie. It starts kind of playful, then darkens quickly, and in the end, apparently just after one of the main characters was killed, the whole family stands in the backyard laughing at something. It's totally weird and impossible to line up. Acting is extremely heterogeneous as the older professionals draw your attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors who look as if they were playing in high school. This movie has shown me that making a good movie is probably harder than being obvious from the really professional fare we see in the first and the first art houses. This would be a good movie that a movie class could analyze. Action, character, theme, consistency - all are either flawed or missing in this movie.
