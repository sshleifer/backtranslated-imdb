Close but no cigar! - that's my opinion about this movie! TAG PURVIS wrote and directed this script, which should be rewritten before shooting. At times ridiculous, or a stupid script, the shining star of this film is Dan Mongomery Jr. Both talents should be considered in the future. My recommendation is to wait until it meets your local cable station and use the rental money for a classic!
