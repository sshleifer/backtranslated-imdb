Code 46 is one of those films in which the government controls who you love. They will actually punish you if you try to breed with the wrong person. The Haves and the Have-Nives live in completely separate territories, the powers can eliminate your memories, etc. We've seen this stuff before, but that's fine - no movie is 100% original. This kind of premise is always fun. Unfortunately, it is more interesting to imagine such a future than actually seeing code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe that's a comment on a dehumanizing future, but it's still boring to look at. It is slow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the pictures are nice, but usually (along with the "evocative" soundtrack) it looks like a glorified perfume ad. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of TV camera that I find annoying. You know, two characters are talking while the camera "floats" on one side. Two seconds later he floats on the other side to get your attention. <br /> <br /> My friends liked this movie. If they tried to look at me again, I probably would not, unless they agreed to pay $ 50.
