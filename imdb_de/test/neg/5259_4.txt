Bulletproof is clearly a disposable film. The way the bullet ransacked good and bad guys is so spattered everywhere that you really should not see them as human beings. The yawning between the lines of Wayans and Sandler is indeed great. They try hard, but unfortunately Persona does not make a good movie herself. Jimmy Caan plays a skilful villain, but he always had the edge of the red neck under control. My favorite scene is the repeated excerpts from a television commercial in which Caan unveils the virtues of America and can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in each garage. Besides, it's a buddy movie with guns for brains. Pass this on.
