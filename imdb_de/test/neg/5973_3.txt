The title of this documentation is very misleading. During the documentary, they never show how the introduction of Nile perch fish into Lake Victoria caused the problems of Mwanza town in Tanzania. The film tries to highlight the problems of Tanzania for environmental reasons, but the truth is that the problems stem from a parasitic external force. The documentary is very slow, without a narrative. Instead, it relies on small blocks of text between unlinked segments to display bits of information that do little to add or extend the topic. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental impact of the redfish. One is a small segment of about 10 seconds where factory managers are interviewed to process the fish. He mentions briefly how the Nile perch was introduced to the lake 50 years ago and consumed the other fish species. The filmmaker makes no attempt to pursue the matter further or go deeper. The second attempt is when this documentary shows the presentation of another documentary discussing the environmental impact of the Nile Perch, and no real attempt is made to explain how devastating the problem has become. <br /> <br /> The topic to which this documentary refers has nothing to do with the perch itself, but rather with the problems faced by most African countries. The film seeks to link the introduction of bass with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never establishes a direct link. Like all intelligent people who have problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not limited to Tanzania, but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would have been great if the filmmakers had shown what the local economy or life was before the introduction of the fish and how it was adversely affected by the introduction of the fish, which is not the case. The fact is that many of the people interviewing them say the fish has provided jobs and opportunities for many. Yes, things in the Mwanza town are bad, but in other parts of the country and continent, they are far and away the worst. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentary filmmakers to link fish to starvation problems in Tanzania is quickly being discredited by the documentary itself. First of all, Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Many respondents said they could go to Mwanza, the fishing village on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because it was so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative, and does not try to link everything it shows to Nile perch. It plays with the emotions of people by showing images of the destruction of poverty, hunger and AIDS. No attempt is made to show you how this is unique to the Lake Victoria Region in Tanzania or directly related to the Perch Fish. The fact is that most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and Christianity than with the impact of the fish on the environment.
