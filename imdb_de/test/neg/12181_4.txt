First of all, I'm a big fan of Bronson since the late '70s. I've seen every movie he shot on the big screen since "Love and Bullets," which ironically was the beginning of his ending as a Hollywood blockbuster star. I had always hoped that things would change For him, that he would make a really good movie in the 80s, but that never happened. And I do not know what he was thinking when he signed for most of his recent films at Cheapjack studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson. <br /> <br /> "Assasination" gave me some hope when I saw that Peter Hunt was directing instead of Thompson, but those hopes were quickly dashed. First, the film looks unbelievably cheap, as if it was made for around 3 Mil, minus the excess Bronson (I've heard that it insisted on 5 Mil per image, which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all of his Cannon films). The scenes from the White House were shot on the grounds of the VA in West LA - I took the bus when they were shooting. Good job rebuilding the White House, but did not anyone think about getting the palms out of the shots? Guess not. <br /> <br /> Second, the understaffing is really bad. Ireland died of cancer, and yet it is not bad, but the terrible Asian girl who plays Bronson's buddy was typical of Cannon's talent - nonexistent. I would be really curious how she got that role. I can not imagine a worse actress for this role and she is 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not so bad and it's something bigger and cheaper studios did later (Eastwood's "In the Line of Fire" and Costner's "Bodyguard" movie), but the way it's being staged here is real Sad. I wonder if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot. None of it is credible in the least. If the men of the intelligence service really behaved like the Keystone policemen in this movie, every few months we would have presidents rotating out of office (and out of life).
