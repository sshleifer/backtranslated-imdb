This film makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List". Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to think more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green light a P.O.S. Regardless of the friendships involved, this is just a bad deal. Larry Bishop has to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer / Director / Producer / Actor Bishop shows that his skills are not enough for these jobs. A vanity project to the south, "Hell Ride," usually allows good actors to chew on the scenery ... At least if the camera does not focus on Bishop's faint attempts to steal every scene he's in. The last three words to "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
