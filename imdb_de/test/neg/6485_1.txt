I bought this "movie" from a 3.99-ton petrol station for one reason: Billy Drago, one of my favorite actors. He is incredibly scary and good, but that stops it. The film itself is a dirt cheap, terribly horrible attempt at a Western and does not do it, no matter how successful the two genres merge together. Acting alongside Drago is so bad that I wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears, the production values ​​are not there and the script, I do not even know where to start. You're a hard-core Drago fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful and unforgivable.
