A plane lands in a dense forest in the Pacific Northwest, carrying employees of a large biotech company, including the CEO's daughter. When the search and rescue mission is canceled, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), assembles a small group to carry out their own search and rescue mission. But what exactly seeks and tries to save Knowles, and what follows and observes them in the forest? <br /> <br /> Oy, what a mess this movie was! It was a shame, because on the one hand, Lance Henriksen, one of my favorite actors of the modern genre, the lead role, and second, there could have been quite a decent movie. It has two big drawbacks, and probably both are the fault of writer / director Jonas Quastel - this movie (which I'll call Sasquatch) has almost the worst cut I've ever seen alongside Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast seems to be, "Okay, let's try again, but this time I want everyone to talk about each other, improvise non-sequencers, and generally try to be as annoying as possible." <br /> <br /> The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash apparently tried to nip the Blair Witch Project (1999) and all material related to the titular monster was Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like presentation and ridiculous dialogue The plot had promise and potential for more subtle and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume was, as soon as we actually saw it, more than sufficient for my taste. The mix of character types marching through the woods would have been great if Quastel and writer Chris Lanning had reduced the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The "cave" of the monster had a pretty production design, especially the corpses and a rather primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been well edited, there would be some scenes with decent dialogues that would have been easily effective. <br /> <br /> But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps: For some reason, Quastel thinks that's the way it is. It's a good idea to chop dialogue scenes that occur in real time in a matter of minutes instead, some lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use black screens often between dialog snippets, regardless of whether we need an indeterminate amount of time between irrelevant comments or irrelevant comments appear to be sequential anyway , <br /> <br /> For some reason, he does not care if scenes were taken in the morning, afternoon, in the middle of the night and so on. He just cuts off to them randomly. The scenes we see seem to be randomly selected. Important events either never or rarely occur, and we have far too many senseless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, in the film he has left a scene about cave art that either requires more exposure to justify it, or just needs to be cut out because it is not that important (the Intelligence and the "humanity" of the monster could easily have been shown in other ways). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - stayed in the script, though it is redundant. <br /> <br /> For some reason, we suddenly go into an extremely soft porn scene, although the motif is never repeated again. <For some reason, characters call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H" as if they were stereotypes of Asian domestics. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Quastel insists on using "Blurry" Cam "and" Distorto-Cam "for the monster attack scenes, even if the costume does not look so bad and it would have been much more effective, something Fog in, a subtle filter or anything but bad movie art. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie better than me I am Henriksen fan, I'm fascinated by the subject, I loved the environment, I love to hike and this is basically a traveling movie on a plane - but I could not. "Every time I thought it would be" from this Quastel took another terrible step in the end. "In the end, my score was 3 out of 10.
