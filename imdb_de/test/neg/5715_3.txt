It's nice to see how Julie Andrews plays a downright dramatic role - something she has not done for some time - but her character from Judith (show they did not want to spend her as 'Judy') has the old one Sophisticated manners and tomboy hairstyle of yesteryear, and Andrews plays "grown-up" as any other actor would coolly interpret. It's a surprisingly mild drama that plays on Barbados. Omar Sharif (not the liveliest leading man - not even in 1974!) Hopes to make Andrews a spy as he leads her slowly into the proverbial bedroom. An unforgettable trip has some bearing value: the James Bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy scream. As for Julie, she is calm and thoughtful, but that does not do much to the audience and the movie. Blake Edwards is testing like a funeral. * from ****
