This movie was not as bad as the story, but the camera work makes it difficult to look at it. I just do not like the so-called "realistic" camerawork that is being done these days; You know the guy who jumps out of the middle of the picture, buzzing around, and so on. What particularly puzzled me about this movie was the new thing they put into the mix by shooting some black and white pictures in each scene. I think the film would have been a lot better if the camera work was done in a much more conventional way because I could not focus on it and instead analyzed the camera work. If more people are dissatisfied with this camera work, the filmmakers may get the hint.
