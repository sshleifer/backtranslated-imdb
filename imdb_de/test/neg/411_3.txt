An extremely fast, exciting, interesting and detailed book. It is a great shame that the film had none of these characteristics. Not only does Tom Hanks' meek portrayal or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes in key characters, big deviations from the original plot, and the weak Irish / Italian accent of Carmalengo played by Ewan Mcgregor EVER. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of A & D, the book, I had high hopes for a more elaborate, literally more detailed film, in which it would start and end just like the book - and I wanted more <br / > <br /> Everything the movie really did was depressed me within the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> What was impressive was the ... Sorry! I could not finish this sentence without laughing. <br /> <br /> In short - Vittoria was the hot-blooded hottie, a second before Audrey Tatou and there were some very beautiful Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br / I would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard insists on making another book to film, I like Â£ 6.40 for a KFC Zinger meal and save some chicken wings - much more entertaining and deeply satisfying!
