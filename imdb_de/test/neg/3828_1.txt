I can barely find the words to describe how much this trash has offended me. Why is it that American filmmakers are always there to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of backward bush babies, and worse, throw people to Jamaicans who sound absolutely ridiculous trying to imitate the accent? We are not all extremely dark, we do not all walk around with machetes, whether to work or for protection, we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice VOODOO! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, business people, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I'm tired of seeing all these Jamaican images as a bunch of dreadlocks wearing rastafarians who do nothing but smoke on the beach all day or shoot rifles in the air (if we do not live in our tree houses) , YES, we wear clothes. YES, we have electricity. No, weeds are not legal on the island and CHANCES WE SPEAK BETTER English than you! The worst part is that I'm not only angry and bitter, but answers to questions most Jamaicans who have traveled abroad have ever asked. Read a book before you accept how it is in another country and what is worse. Decide to make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The land we do everything in is to murder white people and beat our bongos drums ... stories from the tomb have officially sickens me, along with the entire crew that has been working on this garbage, especially the Writer.
