OK ... well ... I like Kris Kristofferson and his usual uncomplicated delivery of lines in his films. Age has helped him with his gentle, low-energy, talking style and he'll effortlessly steal a scene. But the disappearance is his misstep. Holy Moly, that was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I have to praise the movies and the actors, including Kris, for trying their Darndest to make sense of this silly, confusing story! None of it made any sense, and Kris probably did not understand either, and he just made the moves, hoping that someone would come to him and tell him what it was all about. <br /> <br /> I do not care that everyone in this movie was made out of love for this project, or out of such nonsense ... I saw low-budget movies that had a plan for heaven's sake ! This had no, Zilcho, Nada, Zippo, no reason ... a complete waste of talent, landscape and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I've rented this piece of garbage for a bit of money, and I want my money back! I want to have back my 2 hours I invested in this waste of time F! Do not look at this movie or waste a minute of your precious time walking through a room in which it plays, or even open the case where the DVD is! Believe me, you will thank me for the advice!
