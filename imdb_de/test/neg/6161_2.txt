This is a movie with a wonderful concept, but very weak writing. It should never have been published without at least three more new releases (assuming one was received). The story is too loosely held together, and there are too many 90-degree turns in the story to make a coherent film. It would be nice to see what a decent screenwriter could do with the story.
