The year of production says it all. The film is a predatory jumble of politically correct left-leaning feminist, self-conscious swindlers, such a ponderous symbolic diversity that today seems ridiculous. Each scene has the goal of illuminating a burning problem of society, mainly the role of women in the workplace, the role of women over men, women as sex objects, consumption, politics, war, etc. Each scene is commented on through the inner dialogue of one the main actresses or by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no memory of an action or who the main characters were. It's a kind of film in which consumerism is mocked by a couple loving each other in a furniture store's sales window while the sales agent is giving his speech, or where a revealing interview with a stage actress becomes a full-fledged striptease act for "Of." Of course "If the offensive lords of the press are equal to a slippery club audience, then we'll move quickly, because we have to see war break out in a peaceful forest, we have to see several riotous feminist public speeches in the (male) beat of Of course we have to watch the news programs of Stalin and all other usual suspects, you have the idea, but it does not matter, the movie is an unrivaled eye candy for any (male) Ingmar Bergman lover. A film with boast leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson u nd Gunnel Lindblom at the height of her beauty, that this reviewer gives up completely and just gets dizzy? and also the pleasure of seeing her as generous as she uses her acting skills in a movie I've never heard of before. It is hard to believe that especially the face of Bibi Andersson has the screen every time it appears. Cinematography is magnificently orchestrated, often in an overexposed (?) Dimensionless white light, and you never get tired of watching the performers. How absurd that a movie made with so much respect for the feminist agenda tirelessly advocates that women should not be seen as just objects of desire can offer the 21st-century viewer anything better than a parade of stunningly beautiful women. As I said, I do not complain. I could watch it again tomorrow.
