Oh, Mr. Carell! How far have you fallen! After a fiery moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, the choice of Steve Carell's films begins in stark contrast to what has come since then. Although THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN was entertaining, it was eclipsed by its "sunshine" character. Hoping to find something that made me spit popcorn out of my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what kind of gable me could expect here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Faced with the banal and clichéd script, the entire movie felt forced and thoughtless. Evan Almighty has some fun figuring out family values ​​and the current US government's environmental stance, and tries to translate a profound biblical moment into humorous expressions, but miserably fails the story of Noah and the Ark. God's wrath was sent down with 30 days and rainy nights flooding the entire planet, while Noah, his family, and two of his creatures on Earth were relatively easy to eradicate wetness over the gopher's wood carcass. It was a big moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text). So why should God appear to a man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the animals of the world minutes after a break in the dam? The simple answer is that he would never do it. The policy of the United States was given too much importance and not enough for the events of the world. So Evan Almighty became a terribly short-sighted and centered in the US film. Although conceived as a comedy, it never really reaches anything that approaches the tummy. Maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) prefers another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long, whose sole purpose is to create opportunities for protected national land ownership. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God can not absorb this breathtaking movie disaster. <br /> <br /> The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals, especially as Evan learns how animal magnetism is REAL. Birds literally flow to him. Flock of sheep around him. Lions are proud to be around him (please forgive the word games). <br /> <br /> The special effects were fun, but short (for a good reason). The "Flood" was interesting in that the ark was obviously led by His hand and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, there is little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
