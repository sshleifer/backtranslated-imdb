I think it says something that the Bollywood "Bride and PRejudice" has remained more faithful to the source material than this Hollywood version of 2005. I also laughed more about the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you've read the book or seen (and liked) the BBC version of 1995, you'll be in for a nasty surprise in this movie. My friend, who had not seen either, was slightly amused at the movie. If you're a JAnst Austen purist or even a movie viewer who does not like historical inaccuracies, it'll be painful to go crazy. Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors would not have been half bad if they had a decent script, maybe someone who really loved Austen's work. Which travesties were committed? Well, you'll be forced to endure such disbelieving lines as "Do not you dare to judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me alone in your life!". Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane's writing pen, but can anyone honestly believe such words gushing out of the mouth of a regency-era posh young woman? The use of modern colloquial language is one of the many irritating ways in which the scriptwriter slaughters the book. The writer also chose to give lines to the characters, which in the book were called by completely different signs and for no apparent purpose. Worse, if they try to get a little closer to the book, the writer has the nastiest and most unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and replacing their already perfect words with inconvenient synonyms. It was as if the scriptwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other hand when he wrote the script. Stay with Austen's words; she did better than you! I assume that all this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the legendary BBC version of 1995. However, for me it was also a slander of the true spirit of Austen's favorite work. <br /> <br /> The casting had potential, though it was quickly torn away when the script came in. But Keira giggled excessive and bared teeth are not equal to charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him pretty handsome enough, misread his script and felt he was playing Heathcliff, not the impressive Mr. Darcy. I really enjoyed Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly, and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Her interpretations were really refreshing. <br /> <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as a hobo who accidentally walked the film set, and I have to say it's an apt description. And can anyone tell me why they made Wickham after Legolas? Although he has been in the film for less than two minutes, I dare to appreciate it, and without his impressive archery abilities to refresh the film. <br /> <br /> On a cabinet message, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were expensive and would fit more in the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency gown? Please, more Versace than Austen, that's for sure.) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to her salary and not to her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they did not catch him soon enough to comb the curls of the actresses before the shootings were made. In short, with this new Hollywood version, you offer Austen eloquence, subtlety and wit, because you get the complete opposite.
