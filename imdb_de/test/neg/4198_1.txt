I rented Dark Harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on-the-box kind of thrill. Scarecrows also freak me out. The film had an effective title sequence, but that was pretty lame (flat, bad light, drama, editing, directing ...). I recently discovered that DH 2: The Maize had a fairly extensive advertising campaign. I thought the first one might have been a little successful, so they've increased the stakes and possibly brought some more fear and terror from the killer scarecrows. Well, the video does not contain scarecrows ... no problem. The problems begin in DH 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars that wipe off titles and so on. As for the actual photography ... Each time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all those white spots to confirm that you're seeing a midwestern ultra-low-budget mini-DV project filmed his Uncles farm. Acting did not act at all. The cheap rip-off of The Shining Twin Girls was among the freshmen. The editing was extremely amateurish and lazy. The sound was rough and choppy. (For example, the editor would change the perspective of the sound change each time it cuts to a new setting). It's like someone's gathering his friends and family (actors), taking a video camera into a cornfield for three days, burning the night sequences (no kidding - they did), putting the footage into the computer, cutting one ( very rough version, throwing some music in, bypassing any imaginative sound work or mixing, burned it directly onto DVD and threw it into the video shop. Every horror fan should be offended by this kind of direct video editing that has no skill or style. Just because a person has a video camera and can capture a picture on tape does not mean that it should be released to the public. If I could give a lower rating than an ONE, I would do that.
