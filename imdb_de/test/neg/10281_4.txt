First Off, I've always been a big fan of Robert Blake. <br /> <br /> This movie came on Movieplex last night at 1:10 pm, and the title interested me and of course the star. But after seeing it, I was more confused than before, before it started ... There are some good scenes, and I thought they were leading somewhere, but they did not, it turned out to be an "anti -Cop "was. "Anti-buddy" "Anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-all-movie", with an extremely confusing storyline that went nowhere. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is great, as well as the lead role Someone might be present with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and love his acting even in crap like this ... but this one Drug induced the trip of the 70s, well ... better away from this movie ... And this end, what a pisser.
