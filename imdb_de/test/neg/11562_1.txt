Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not have provided any redeeming qualities for the presentation of this "gemstone". <br /> <br /> This is like a pirate pirate copy of the '80s porn you might have bought on VHS in a 42nd-floor game room. before Disney bought the whole blow and shut them all up. <br /> <br /> But wait - all sex scenes were cut. I challenge everyone to find a worse movie. This film could replace water-boarding as a humane survey method. <br /> <br /> No, I'll take that back - I'd rather go for a swim. <br /> <br /> The only credit that this film can earn, apart from being the worst film ever made, would be threatening the Middle East to solve its problems if it did Watch the movie.
