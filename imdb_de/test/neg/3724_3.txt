I can not remember this movie too much, unless the lights have been destroyed inappropriately. Almost every combat scene involved the needless and wanton destruction of useful lighting fixtures, even if it was equipped with kitschy 70's cylindrical screens to keep up with the timing of the story. In a domestic battle scene, between the brothers in the living room and dining room of the house of the mother a destruction of rough lamps takes place, in which devices are expanded in both rooms. The most vicious destruction, however, takes place only a few moments later in a bookstore and includes, among other things, the overturning of a cradle with a ceramic horse's head base, which consequently disintegrates, and the heavy denting of a cylindrical umbrella as a guy falls in during another fistfight. Later, this lamp will also be tilted when the guy is shot, further damaging the plastic-coated screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film promotes a particularly wasteful attitude towards lamps, one should keep an eye on the lamps. Regardless of their cheap construction or gait, the top-heavy appearance for the lighting they provide is still valuable. However, if you ever feel the need to smash a lamp, I would highly recommend this movie.
