Oh my. Oh, that's a really bad movie. Acting is absolutely cruel, the script is terribly godless and photography is just awful. <br /> <br /> But what distinguishes this film is that you never care for a single soul - good or evil, living, dying or dead - in the entire 87 minutes. "Oh, he / she died? Huh ... I thought they would do it," was the best reaction I could get after each murder. The characters are so black and white that you can still find out who was who when the volume is off. While the actors' voices were strangely monotonous throughout, their faces seem like an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow wiggling, exaggerated frowning, and "thoughtful looks." Each character is a humorless, dispassionate, one-dimensional one-trick pony; Once they have fulfilled their real role in the fiasco they have created, they will be rejected. <br /> <br /> It made me vaguely think about what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director and author of "Skyggen", American) title: "Webmaster") chose one Low-budget version of "American Psycho" and was distracted on the way. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly cruel movie. This is ensured by the cold, dispassionate cast. It is not an insulting movie. The director plays it so sure that nobody could find it that way. It's easy and after all a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so happy and actually paid to see this bomb on pay-per-view. As part of my penance, I am writing this report. <br /> <br /> Enough said.
