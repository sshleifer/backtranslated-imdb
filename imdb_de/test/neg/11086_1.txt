So you have the spoiler alert - but I would say that you can not damage what is already lazy. I assume they changed the name to "The Cavern" just in case "WIthIn" was preceded by the call. <br /> <br /> After I had paid the rental fee for this movie, I considered storing the trash for a month mail to the author / director. He had his garbage brought to my home, so I found it only fair that I return the favor. The film begins with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan. Maybe the author is a fan of the Ali G show. But they should have just started in the cave, because the outside was obviously not Kazakhstan. It was the first clue that I would hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has no redeeming qualities except one: it is consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, directing, acting, cinematography - every aspect of this film is just bad. And I like bad movies, dumb movies, B horror movies. , , but that was just bad. And dumb. And hacked. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To get a feel for the movie, go to your laundry with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights. Put a flashlight (switched on) in your dryer and start to stumble. Now everyone starts screaming and screaming. That's it. <br /> <br /> For a complete makeover, 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room must be dead on the floor. Throw check syrup over them. Turn the light back on (stop the dryer). Now a guy in a gorilla costume has to enter the room and rape the last person. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: If you read through the other comments, many find it remarkable that this movie was remarkably made on a low budget. That is not remarkable. It is remarkable to make a crap movie with a huge budget (Waterworld). It's remarkable to make a good movie for a low price (like Blair Witch, which I really liked). It's not surprising to make a shitty movie on a low budget, and you can expect more from those people still making films because I can not imagine anyone giving them a lot of money after watching them. <Is the low budget an excuse for a horrible movie? No, and it's certainly no reason to look at it. Would you eat a dog dung sandwich just because it was cheap? <br /> <br /> The IMDb rating for this movie over time will be interesting. It should continue to trend downwards, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent bystanders exceeds the filmmaker's ability to ask his personal friends for 10 stars.
