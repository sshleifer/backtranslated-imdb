Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why is a horrible script such as this approved in the first place? It is not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it is not properly explained to the audience! Such a close work for the fight scenes is also bad! This fantastic editing only appears in trailers. It makes the whole look cheaper! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russian guys at the top of the film? Who is being tortured? Is he at the CIA? <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve to be released in the theater. But it does not deserve to be produced at all. It's a joke to Hollywood.
