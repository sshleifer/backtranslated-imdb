This movie is really bad. It almost looks like it was filmed either in a park or in a basement. There is a giant spider, but we only see one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave and are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic hocus-pocus that makes no sense at all. The whole thing is just ridiculous.
