It is a male bonade. I saw this a while ago on sci-fi, and the idea seemed interesting to me. It could have been a good movie, and I do not see the plot as a male hitting, but certain specific references to men really get annoying. But I may still watch the movie because it at least tries to redeem itself by pointing out that the women in the movie may not be as non-violent as they claim, but they do not balance the really busy man -bashing I mean, I can understand a bit, it's part of the plot of the movie, but come on, it gets very stressful after a while. Not only that, but the assumption that the majority of women in the world would accept to become so gay easily, and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority to 'go in the closet'. It's just too incredible. There are far too many women with cultural or religious restrictions who would hinder it, it is absolutely implausible. I mean, I know, it's sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi at least has an indication that this is possible, and that's too implausible. The phrase "Truth is stranger than fiction" was born because the fiction must at least seem plausible to be welcome, but the truth is not always that way. This movie is not that. Apart from that, the movie has a good spectacle and the subsequent moral of the story that something that happened was wrong, it redeems a little, but not enough.
