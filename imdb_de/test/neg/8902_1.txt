Endless reruns about the evil World Bank, IMF, globalization and the Americans are blamed for all the problems in Africa - and the movie is long, about two hours, but it seems to be longer. The French have been occupying Mali, the country where the movie has been playing for centuries, but are just evil guys. <br /> <br /> You can not learn enough about the characters to really care about what happens They are completely marginal to the sermon that goes on and on and on. There is no plot, no character development, no humor (apart from a few pubs at Bush and Wolfowitz, but that's almost cheating, it's so easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre - no salvation there. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching on such a big topic and not providing any real information. The Irish ballad "I was dying, and then the famine came" has more content. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, the subtitles are hard to read, there is no real movie content, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
