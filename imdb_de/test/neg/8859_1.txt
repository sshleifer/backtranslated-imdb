This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It's been a couple of years since I saw it, and since then nothing has come closer, and I doubt if ever a film is produced that is as bad as this one. It tries to make fun of a variety of different films, for example, 'Nell' (!), And instead of funny it is just pathetic. Whatever you do, do not rent or rent this garbage and if someone throws you at you ... turn around and run the other way !!
