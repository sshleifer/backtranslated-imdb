This movie is just terrible, as the talent has contributed to lies beyond the human faith. I think they must have been angry when they thought of this idea, I feel like I've been taken 2 hours of my life. Harvey Kietel Will Try It If you distance yourself from this garbage, it should have been a great thriller, but it turns into a bloody mess of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who like to sleep through movies, you will not miss anything. The humor will appeal In the lowest dominance dominate films that encourage us and remind us that life is worth living. This movie makes you depressed. As DeNiro said in a movie, the saddest thing in life is a talent, and this film is a perfect example of that statement.
