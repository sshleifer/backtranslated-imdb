Also titled -> The Magic Castle -> This is a range. Why bother? Why make another rock beard and then add another story that has almost nothing to do with the game or Swan Lake? Only a friend of Rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (no votes left). Just before the start, this is a continuation of a thread. Next, you know that a bird has memorized the "Forbidden Arts" and Swan Princess 4: The magical bird is born. Luckily the chapters are supposed to be closed and this will start, but the trilogy ends badly.
