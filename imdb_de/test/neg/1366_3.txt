This is one of those religious horror films that never explain why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than those of the "good". Here we have a satanic cult that: 1) can "beam away" people (as in "Star Trek"), 2) kill them with small children's dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body to another, 4) telepathically hypnotize one greater distance and 5) lead to drastic car accidents in which selected persons become spaghetti, while others (in this case children) survive unscathed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the forces are "good" "can: 1) stand around helplessly, 2) cluelessly stand around, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time doing nothing, 6) reading comics while humans are being slaughtered by the dozens, and 7) getting too late to satanic rituals In any religious horror movie, I have to assume that the world of this movie is inhabited by God and Satan, and I have to Satan can not be 1,000,000 times as powerful, unless the film has a world order that resembles hell, in other words, where were the priests in this film who knew something? Priest of this film is the assumption that there are some witches - nothing else - because he has read all these books in his study.At the first glance of violence this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically and ends with a big one So, this is God's To contribute to the fight against Satan? Ridiculous. Any good religious horror film has the powers of the "good" that are endowed with (more or less) supernatural power, or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight the "evil". In that sense, this movie is pretty idiotic. There's the casting of droll Martin, the high priest (!) Of the cult. It is very little threatening or reverent to observe Martin performing a satanic ritual. I mean, it did not have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but had not they found someone who looked less funny? Why does the couple go back to town after the car is taken out of the race? After their "friendly" meeting with the people of the city no reasonable person would have gone back; They should have just moved on. The explanation of the man to his girlfriend (and the viewer) is: "Who knows what goes in that direction".
