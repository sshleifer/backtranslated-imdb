Maybe I expected too much from this movie, but at least a comedy should be funny, and this movie has very few amusing moments. It succeeds in offending homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, obese people and probably also several other groups. The scene where _y everyone who claims to be gay is one of the most disgusting I've ever seen. Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously wrong and Kevin Kline seems mostly confused. > <br /> Other reviewers compare the movie to "Will and Grace," but "Will and Grace" is at least funny.
