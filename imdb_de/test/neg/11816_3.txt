The title lets you know pretty well what you are getting. It's a grade C howler, but not as blatant as I had hoped. This 1972 low-budget action film was apparently directed by demo artist Eddie Romero from a story originally written by Jonathan Demme (long before he made "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), apparently filmed in the Philippines third world country. Pam Grier plays the hooker and small drug dealer Lee Daniels and plays the first half of the title role, while the long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely political revolutionist who looks similar to Patty Hearst's comrades to the oppressive local government to overthrow. Of course, antagonistic to each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they inexplicably wear light yellow miniskirts as uniforms. The prison is run by a closed guard and a horny matron. The jail is just an excuse for a long shower scene and half-hearted cat fight as Lee and Karen compete. Of course, they flee, but tied together to La The Defiant Ones and continue the cat fight until they attack a few nuns to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, various groups of unappetizing men are in pursuit - the loutish drug king looking for Lee, who stole $ 40,000 from him, the more passive revolutionaries who are looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (the humble because they have exposed their private to the drug king). Needless to say, at some point everything ties together, but not before a baseless nudity of some Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst men's fashion of the 1970s (a beer belly revolutionary wears a leather halter and a straight face). There's a pretty sad ending, but what's really sad is how much of the potential black comedy is completely missed in this hilarious-absurd exercise. Sadly, Grier disappoints on this trip because her character is not allowed to do much except grapple with all the "jive" while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I believe is desperately trying to be credible. With no one talent for acting, the rest of the cast is unremarkable, with the exception of the bald-headed, daring Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho-personality as a drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra.
