To use simple words or rather a word, this would be best of PATHETIC !!!!!! The movie starts with a little interest in the plot, but BUT few minutes from the audience become restless for restrooms and snacks or to breathe fresh air at the closed dark hall .... <br /> <br /> It seems like you would see a movie from the 1960s in which the colors were dull, led by a debutante and played by high school students. The movie revolves around an American actress trying to make a comeback by playing in one of the not so big Indian films. Her acting is really sad, complemented by the poorer dialogue deliveries. <br /> <br /> OverAll: I would not advise anyone to watch this movie. Believe me, it would be fun, as this film would not receive a single ad and no sponsors. <br /> <br /> And better carry an aspirin. P.S. I have no idea if the other reviewers have even seen the movie? I wasted my $ 10 on the ticket!
