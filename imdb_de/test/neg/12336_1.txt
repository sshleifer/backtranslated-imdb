We see who the good guys are. The Union. And who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see the good of evil. All the characters hate the bad guys, so the movie can help us to hate the bad guys. This is the worst kind of filmmaking - manipulative and childish. At the center of the plot is a policeman who is between good and evil, and he's in that ugly movie. It is boring and pointless. The story of Star Keach is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, pushed himself to the limit and played the man nobody likes and whom we should not like. It takes a long time for this hole to lift off and the title prevails; If it takes off, it crashes a minute later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
