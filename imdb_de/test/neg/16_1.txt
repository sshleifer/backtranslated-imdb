I've been a big fan of Park's work for years and "Old Boy" is one of my favorite songs. <br /> <br /> With great anticipation I rented this movie just to find the worst movie I have watched for a while. It's not a real horror movie. There is no tension and even the "light" part is so lame that I did not know if I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my younger brother Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got from it. For me, an idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you love movies like "Old Boy," Mr. & Lady "Vengeance," or even his short films about "Three Extreme," you do not love losing time. The movie is not worth it.
