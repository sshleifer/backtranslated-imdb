"The Ballad of the Sad Café" has been working hard on its image, but when it was time to crack, it was left standing in its self-created dust. <br /> <br /> You can not imagine saying that out loud, but if Vanessa Redgraves would fight Amelia John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard-earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. Her portrayal of Amelia was so close to perfection and with more in-depth dedication, as most actors are willing to give each contractor several million dollars. Redgrave gave Amelia that soulful trait that was a mixture of her own unique voice and a hard-earned Southerner. For the average viewer this could be annoying, but as the movie progressed, did it become her? Miss Amelia transforms this stage beauty into a roughneck. It was Redgrave's performance and her interaction with the other characters that made this movie great. but not the greatest. The others after their performance were necessary but not outstanding. As we passed the grim cliché image passed down by every set designer hired for the Depression South job, the smaller characters felt like a billboard. The image was needed to set the scene, but the characters of the city had no other purpose. Take, for example, Rod Steiger's vision of an old, wildly-spoken preacher. His scenes alone will make every viewer question the validity of this remote city. The two main actors surrounding Amelia fought charmingly for the admirable top-scene robbery, but because of the lack of direction? it just seemed faded. The most absurd of the two (though both are tall under the questionable sanitary line) is Cork Hubbard, who plays Amelia's "cousin," who happens to arrive one night. His character is never fully defined, he lacks real motives and his loyalty remains uncertain. He does not play a crucial role in this film except to force us as viewers to question his reason and honesty. Can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue, flicking your ears and beating your head and chest? Finally there is the other end of the absurd? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this tormented man make up the character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his intention to flutter. These were the characters, as southern as the cliché? Some stood up and tried to make an absurd piece, and I can not say that they had failed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" failed to rise above mediocrity was in cinematography and narrative. This movie was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. The comfort of the audience with the arrival of their little cousin was entertaining? you could not wonder if he was honest or just a trusting man who wanted to avoid a warm heart. Cork Hubbard's character is never properly understood, but we accept him with short shots of him and Amelia doing little things together. It's his idea that transforms from a retired businesswoman to a real café owner. The problem is that director Callow never really brings us to this dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave. Is the man crazy or does he represent the entire family of Amelia? I needed something from Callow that brought these two out of the David Lynch relationship they had. Then our pool with Carradine as Amelia's "love interest" gets even deeper. With the technique of a flashback in a flashback, we see the two marry, but never complete their love? Amelia's anger over her love draws him to the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was that in the movie? With the lack of focus on connecting these characters, the scenes between the two made no sense. Throw Cork's choice and it just gets completely disconnected. While there were some beautiful choreographed scenes created by Callow, there was the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus, interest and caring for the characters when I did not understand the last question? "Why"? <br /> <br /> All in all, "The Ballad of the Sad Café" began with a bang, but ended with a very small bang of a crack. My emotional feeling of this film fluctuated up and down, up and down, and eventually lingered further, mainly because of the lack of understanding of the characters' motives. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia, and while the other characters (except the random climber) did their best, I simply did not understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional end finally came, I was apathetic. It seemed that Director Callow apparently lacked the ability to import connection scenes to understand the dynamic relationship between all our key players. Callow created some beautiful scenes in which faces seemed to overlap the scenery, allowing us to focus on Amelia. or Carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. The movie was about anger, discovery, luck, flashback, anger, anger, anger and fading. Without the comparison ports, this film turned from an outstanding movie to actors who play parts in front of the camera. It was a shame because "Sad Café" had the promise, it just could not hold. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ½ out of *****
