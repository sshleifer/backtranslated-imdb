I just can not imagine any possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in the movie after reading the script. You might have been blackmailed? Or do you have so much money? The main problem of the movie is that it is boring. The conversations between Madsen and Hoppers character are meaningless, as well as the bored chatting between two friends when they drink beer on a Saturday night. You never have a feeling for any of the characters (although Madsen's psycho killer is very likeable compared to the other characters). Hopper has always been a good actor, and Madsen does a good job of being a serial killer, otherwise acting is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes throughout the movie where something really happens, each lasting about three minutes. The scenes "talking about murder and thinking about it and the nature of the killer" would have been interesting if they were scenes in a book. The whole concept would have been interesting for a novel, but a movie just can not deal with a story with so much inner thinking and so little action.
