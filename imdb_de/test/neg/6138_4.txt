This film is probably a letdown if you do not understand the circumstances under which it originated. The Marxes were selected to be played in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. They are somehow fit in the roles. Ironically, it might have been funnier to have used different actors who did not have such high expectations. Instead, it's forever anchored as part of a canon that really does not belong to it.
