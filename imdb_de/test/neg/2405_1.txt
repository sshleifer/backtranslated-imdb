This movie makes the difference that it's the worst movie I've ever seen and the only movie I've ever rated at IMDB with 1 out of 10. I was tempted to rent it because of the cool H.R.Giger cover artwork on the box. This cover is the only thing least good at this steamy pile of ... <br /> <br /> It was about frat boys being "freaks" in a weird but not the least interesting post-apocalyptic world The cities are in ruins / chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to drag other men into braindead frat organizations. The boring appearances of boring characters, less special effects, bleak, unusual landscapes and generally extremely poor quality in all aspects of production make this lemon the loser of all time. <br /> <br /> RECYCLING: 1/10 I wish I could give a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
