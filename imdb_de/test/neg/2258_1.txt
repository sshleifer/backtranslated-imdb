<br /> <br /> Summary: Not worth the movie <br /> <br /> As an avid gone with the wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that he had missed many important characters. Luckily the movie was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it, hoping to follow two of my favorite literary characters on their journey together. While the book lacks any quality, it remains a good story, and as long as I could separate it from the original, it was and is still enjoyable. However, I consider the six hours I spent with the miniseries "Scarlett" as one of the worst hours of my life. This series discredited some of the original character traits that were so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, and transformed the story of its continuation into rape, mistrust, murder, and malformed relationships that even Scarlett had not spoken of. The casting for many of the characters declined to investigate the features that had been well-formed in both the original novel and the movie, and even in the second book, and omits at least one incredibly important character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston on the pretext of visiting the extended family. After coming to an "agreement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and continues to connect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland to explore the "roots of the deep-rooted family," and is eventually called "The O'Hara," the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara engage her in her city of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures into the world of English landowners and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of her parties. She was repeatedly spurned by Rhett and agrees to marry Luke, the Earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes along in a clichéd "Night-on-White-Horse" - a kind of rescue. The mini-series "Scarlett" does not even live up to this justice. Raped by her fiancée and despised by her family, the series shows Scarlett being jailed after being charged with a murder her cousin committed. I recommend those who spend their day thinking this over to rethinking this decision. <br /> <br />
