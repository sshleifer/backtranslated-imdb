"Tokyo Eyes" tells the story of a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls like a man being chased by her big brother, who is a police officer. This lame film consists of about 50% filler and 50% of discussions, discussions and more conversations. You will be able to see less than three stars as they talk on the bus, play video games, talk and do a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc., when reading subtitles, waiting for something to happen. The thin touch of a story is not enough to support a film of low output, lean cast and action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just incessant Yadayadayada'ing. (C-)
