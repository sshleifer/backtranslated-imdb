Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder was committed and a few people engage a medium to conduct a s√©ance to see who the killer is. As the lights go out, there's another murder ... so it's someone in this room. Most actors seem too ridiculous. They look like on stage (where you have to exaggerate things) and it looks stupid on the screen. The most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula"), who REALLY exaggerates as a police officer. Static instructions from Tod Browning (who has always been overrated) do not help. <br /> <br /> Only for Browning and Lugosi executors. I give a 3.
