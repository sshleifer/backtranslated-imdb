With a cast of mostly less graduated stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert) lousy special effects (certainly it was the 70s, but "alien" and "Star Wars" came from the same decade) and an act is so ridiculous that you may want to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been BUILDING. Even the Oscar winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can not keep this "bird" in the air. <br /> <br /> The implausibility of the third film - plane sunk in the Bermuda Triangle - is far more credible than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "The Concorde" at all costs!
