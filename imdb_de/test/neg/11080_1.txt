"The Cavern "It's really" The Blair Witch Project ", only this time we're under the ground and not lost over it Throw a flashlight with broken batteries, a cow skull with fangs for a monster and one of the stupidest" twist "highax ever Let me urge you to listen to me, the little voice in your head, I'm your friend, I want you to be happy you have life. Stay away from this movie.
