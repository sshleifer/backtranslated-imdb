I love Brian Yuzna's other work, even coarser things like "Necronomicon", but "Progeny" was even too much for me. My main complaint is that it is being unnecessarily exploited by Jillian McWhirter's nudity. I'm not prudent, but those nude scenes just keep on going on and on ... just to culminate (almost every time) in a tawdry * wink, * nudge * allusion sexual violence The scene where they nude after several minutes Crying an abortion of a hanger tries is a prime example. Arnold Vosloo's "Performance" is extremely lax, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not save this brilliant film pile. The aliens are boring, the equally boring lighting arouses your interest and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were a glimpse of the true shape of the aliens (very nice model) and the scene where Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was also fine. But you were warned.
