I understand that the budget for this movie was low, but that's really awful. The script is just awful and that was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this movie plays like a traditional R-rated movie with lame fear and violence, instead of an unrestrained, unrated gore feast purposely made for video. Who were the guys who made jokes? That would have been published in cinemas. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful. The editing, another free aspect of the film, is not just for amateurs, and the plot, as I said, leaves little to be desired. The film has nothing original. Gore fans, avoid this. To the filmmakers: Try something original next time or stop filming. You are not good at it. People hate a trashy rehab, especially one of low caliber. AVOID! It's not even worth making fun of it.
