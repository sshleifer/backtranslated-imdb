I wanted to love this movie so much that I really did. But it was a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read the novel by Jennifer Egan in 1996 and was fascinated by the story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Mind you, the book had much more depth than this movie, in action and emotional resonance. They took care of the characters. It drew a complete picture of Phoebe, in contrast to the very poor characterization of the young girl in the film. Although she is beautiful and shows some promises in her burgeoning career, Jordana Brewster was so flat and hollow. This performance was the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was a terrible choice for both the role and the wolf, both physically and logistically. What an embarrassing looking couple. Wolf should have been more of a dark, brooding character and physically more enticing than he was in the book. In addition, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced. However, Cameron Diaz deserves the highest praise for her performance. She took an incredibly mediocre script and gave her character life, a real spirit. She is simply mind-blowing and her cautious behavior makes her very credible as a hippie. It's too bad her talent was lost in this forgetful movie. <br /> <br /> In the book-to-movie category, this is a terrible translation, almost as bad as Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner. But do not let me start ... <br /> <br /> I'm not usually that harsh in my review, but I was so disappointed here that I was really interested in the story and wanted it to be told Law. It did not deliver ... <br /> <br />
