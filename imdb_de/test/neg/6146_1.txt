In addition to the fact that Skylar is a complete douche bag and its drawbacks are unimaginative, his plans require a lot of preparation to make a scam worthwhile. Without giving spoilers (as if it were important to this bitch), its drawbacks are such a hoax, because it costs days and days of planning and using multiple accomplices and a whole camera crew, etc., just to cheat someone into a job which would cost less than a hundred dollars ..... in addition to when you read in the credits, they re-stage some of the phone calls etc because they do not fail ... The whole concept of this show is bunker, because all its disadvantages have both the cost to the crew and the expense of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for nothing. What is the disadvantage?
