I usually like movies about animals or reptiles that are against the common old people who threaten their environment, but I have to say that Snake Island was a big blow. <br /> <br /> The premise is interesting, a group of people, including a writer who is deafly played by William Katt, goes to an island called duh, you guessed it "Snake Island", and say what the island deserves by its name. That's one thing I'll give this movie, there are snakes, LOTS and LOTS of snakes of all sizes and types. The part of the film in fairness lives up to its name, but writing, acting and directing are SOOOOOOOO lame, it's almost painful to sit through. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unlikely that I begged queues to kill these dreadful people, to free us all from our misery. There are a few scenes that are so unreal and ridiculous that you have to believe them - snakes that resonate to really horrible disco music, while two women dance together in seminars and a scene with a snake starring inhumane with one of the performers Dialogue leads It is absolutely absurd. I think the author was trying to be funny, but this seemed like a strange LSD trip to me ... <br /> I remember William Katt years ago, when he played in "Carrie," what a Guy he was ... not that he was ever a big star, but to be reduced to this trash, I feel for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague, unless you are really interested in movies in which there are a lot of snakes and really terrible people.
