I can not honestly believe that this is a continuation or continuation of John Landis' classic horror movie from 1981. I suppose you can not really describe it as an original werewolf movie, since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the London set: an American tourist visits a famous European capital, barely surviving a werewolf attack in which a colleague killed he becomes involved in a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession, he turns into a werewolf, he is visited by apparitions of his dead victims, etc. and reading the previous line I just discovered how much the plot with the original has in common that she actually seems to be very similar. The difference is how beautiful and entertaining the Landis movie is. <br /> <br /> There are no scenes that really stand out in this Paris-based movie. There is no naked man who wakes up in a zoo and wonders how he will get home without money and clothes, there are no bizarre dream sequences of Nazi raiders and no spectacular climax. AAWIP tries to be funny, but is it more embarrassing than failed humor? I think of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone who has chewing gum in his pocket and no condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there's nothing special about this dubious sequel. You are really sorry for the fate and dilemma of the protagonist in the London movie. Here you just feel that Andy is nothing more than a Cypher going through the literary movements of a screenplay. There are also a variety of potholes. Is this the first time The Lunar Club has massacred? If not, does not the world press report a large number of corpses with their hearts torn out? Why did not the police get any clues? <br /> <br /> Everyone else mentioned it and I will - The look is bad. Take a look at the bungee jumping scene in the Eifell Tower. It is painfully obvious that this is achieved through a blue-screen projection, while the werewolf transformation is carried out by a very cartoon-rich CGI. I will not classify Anthony Waller as a director directing a film that totally ruins a film because he relies on CGI (the main problem with AAWIP is the script, with a high degree of expectation from those who saw it in the 1981 movie classic), but I would have preferred the Rick Baker special effects for the transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to speculate that the budget may not be stretched that far. But at the end of the day this is a pretty bad horror movie that did not need to be done and DOG SOLDIERS offers much better entertainment
