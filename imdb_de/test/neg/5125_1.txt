I am a dance teacher and looking forward to some good dance routines in this movie. How sad to have had such painful experiences. <br /> <br /> I had big problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely dismissive. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this is very incompatible with Alex's disturbing fatigue, especially in this disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the tantrums of a toddler. It's very hard to believe that after such a lot of screaming and frenzy Nick would always return to such a moody teenager, especially after she opened the door of a moving car and threw him a stiletto from the street - with only one shoe !!! And what about her idiotic behavior after the night in ballet? In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30-year-old man looking for a girl who is about 16 years old. Yuck. <br /> <br /> When it comes to dancing, I'm afraid that this' 80s style is totally outdated. What in the world was this TV dance sequence in the club? Who should dance? I was not even sure if it was a woman or a man in the air. And even this famous final sequence is quite disappointing, especially in the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera actually breaks their jump because you do not see what it does. And what on earth did she do when she passed every panel that pointed to her? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER enter a ballet company because of this audition - so perhaps they do not really say in the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame it in the end her her fear. From the 'Flash Dancers' I thought the best sequence was Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could tell she was a real dancer and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is natural if you can get past their horrible costume and make-up. <br /> <br /> There were two good pieces in this film - the ballet dancers stretched out when Alex first applied for an audition - they look so pretty and noble and at least that highlights the difference between their current dance career and the one she wants. The other good scene was the breakdance on the street. I also liked the skater's parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What did an 18-year-old spend alone in a converted warehouse? How could she afford this beautiful barre and all the furniture? Where was her family? Was this scene really necessary in the "naked" club? The person who wrote in her commentary that it was a Disney movie must have her head examined. And what happened to the skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said the film was poor, but they liked the message - hope should not be given up, you have to keep trying, and your dreams will come true. Instead, look at "The Little Mermaid".
