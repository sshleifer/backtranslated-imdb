One of the problems of popular culture, especially in the discussion of popular culture of the 70s, is that the mass media - especially television - are usually about four years behind the "underground" media, mainly music. Many people think that the "Woodstock Generation" remained important in the 1970s, in fact, it ended in 1970 in Altamont, not David Bowie, early metal heads and the so-called "glam rockers" who were all "peace and love" , Also not in a completely different direction was Charles Manson's "family". <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot for a television program (fortunately never picked up by the networks) tries to deal with a culture that has already withered away like yesterday's flowers have been lying around for some years - the writer Carlino was already known for its emergence for harsh mafia revenge stories, and the cultural references all refer to "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969) actually earlier, 1966/67 - at Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat and Sly and the Family Stone had that kind forgotten by folk pop. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a middle-class family walking in the street to meet hippies Wow, man, farout, outasight, it's a groovy, baffling event of a bag, but politics counts for nothing - Vietnam - somewhere in Asia, right? <br /> <br This average (mean and empty) TV movie is only honored by Jeff Bridges' surprisingly mature Performa Like the young college dropout who gets his parents and grandma to "discover" America (hippie). All other performances are standard TV shows of the then standard TV actor. The director uses some nice filming, but otherwise the movie is a bad time to spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I knew it was all over when Sal Mineo noticed one young outlier (telling the other) signs they are not really there): "She is a latent existentialist." Wow, far out, groovy. <br /> <br /> A few extra points for 'so bad it's funny', but if you're not interested in the TV version of the '60s, stay away.
