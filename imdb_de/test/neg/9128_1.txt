Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I have ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "pretty" or "beautiful", but the camera does not peek or bother. That's exactly what happens here. The camera is used to invade, embarrass and ridicule. There is no magical river, no sense of size or respect. Instead, some scenes are cobbled together without any major purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I have classified Koyaanisquatsi as the best movie of all time, this movie is the worst. It's also a "pure" movie, but this is the negative form, just what * should not * be made.
