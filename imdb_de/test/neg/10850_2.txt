Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. The maestro must have rolled in the grave when this malicious travesty of his work with its unnecessary nudity and cheap imitation and the presentation of the naive, but principled Gilda as a horny dick was released. Opera can certainly be adapted to the cinema - look at Zeferelli's magnificent La Traviata - but if a work is as outstanding as Rigoletto, it does not need cheap gimmicks. It would have been acceptable even if the synchronized music had been good, but it is a mediocre reproduction of the libretto with second-rate sound quality.
