I found it a most disappointing version of a charming story. I found the acting pretty good on the whole. Reginald Owen chewed the landscape as mentioned by others, but I found him moderately amusing in his short scenes. TCM made an Ann Harding fan out of me, and I thought she was fine as usual. Jessie Ralph had a field day called old Battleaxe, which commanded everyone, and Frank Morgan, as usual, played Frank Morgan with a sparkle. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or editing - the transitions were uncomfortable, the subjects cloudy. The movie was just too short to convey the story properly! I felt completely disappointed, especially as I remembered the later version so much.
