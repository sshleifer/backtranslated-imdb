When I first read about Berlin by the sea, I did not expect much. But I thought that with the right people, the right places, the right music and fashion, you could at least make a trivial film about hip Berlin that everyone seems to be talking about. but Eissler has failed, it is so ridiculously inauthentic. it is a completely false representation of what is going on in the so-called Berlin scene. Of course, it's not just about hippiness, but you should expect more from a movie that is sold as the final Berlin movie. <br /> <br /> and aside from all the credible stuff, it's really a bad movie. mediocre spectacle and a pretty boring storyline. Interestingly, some actors have proven in other films that they are actually quite talented. It must be really bad directing ability. <br /> <br /> Do not look at "Berlin by the sea", unless you are 17 years old, from a small town in West Germany and would like to move to the big city after you finished school. then you will find it really pleasant and totally cool.
