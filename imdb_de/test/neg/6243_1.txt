I hate it when people in the cinema talk back to the screen. This is one of the main reasons why I stay with DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD, but if I had seen it in the movies, I would have had to get up and SCREAM "HE IS NOT DEAD, YOU MORON!" horrible movies showing Mr.Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Proposed Independence, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something, I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do to an audience is this. Suppose you are kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He thinks most of the movie is for you. You turn the tables over and strangle him. Whatever you strangle until he dies! Do not strangle him for ten seconds. Keep doing! At least ten minutes. But Bob stops too early, leaves and forgets Mr. Kidnapper until ... .... He gets up, finds the gun and holds it back to our hero. At this point, I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him too.
