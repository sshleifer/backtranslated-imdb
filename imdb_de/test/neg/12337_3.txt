The novel is a real disappointment, such an ingenious journey into insanity, but this nonsense made for the TV movie is clumsy and boring. Stay with Mike Hammer. I can not believe that no corpse made a brilliant version of this book. Kubrick gushes about it on the cover. He should have taken the reins of this book. Stacey Keach is too quiet as Lou Ford, and the production has the same production value as the 70-year-old TV spinoff from Planet Of The Apes. I strongly suggest that you go out and buy many Jim Thompson novels. The Grifters is not that bad, that's one of them, with Jon Cusak.
