This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations for this movie. I have taken it with the movie "White Noise" from the video library stand. <br /> <br /> First, the credits for this stupid movie are about 5 minutes. The pace from start to finish is slow. The main ladies do not wear a bra and the director seems to enjoy the shaky effect as Anna Paquin goes down the stairs. If you like movies for fools, this one has a low buzz factor. Second, it's nice that the movie breaks down elements of Lovecraft and other horror-genre mechanisms, but in better films, there is the least rational or consistently irrational behavior. This stinker tries to convey a sense of modernity and reality, but then there are situations where no one calls the police, even though they have uncovered a treasure chest of potentially incriminating forensic evidence and rituals from another world in one comprehensive book about the other World are rituals like Buffy. I waited for Miles to show up and give some advice on how to kill a certain type of demon one way or another. The premise is that it is possible to open an age of darkness where creatures can do this. If you crawl on the ceiling, you can cut your throat or let the meat grinder effect on you. Ho hum. To achieve this, you must have a sacrificial circle and then have seven children who need to have their throats cut by people they love. This opens the world to the age of darkness. At least that is what is described in detail in the book of ancient rituals of ancient occultation. Which raises the annoying question, uh, well, how did those who wrote the book know, and if so, would you really leave that information in a book that you can take from the library, let alone out a library in a world that is not already covered in Darkness, a time brought about by lunatics who would have done so as they did earlier with the "Occult Practices to Bring the World Into the Darkness for Dummies, 2nd Edition" can? It turns out that the father in the story is the 7th kid who ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; He was released by his father, the doctor / grandfather of the film, who wanted to try the ritual with probably other stupid parents who just wanted to see if stupid that this opening of the world actually works for the dark. Grandpa let his father go because he "did not really love him". Aduh Dummer dumb movie, written by a moronic director who thinks he's some sort of Eurofilm Auteur. There is also a scene in the movie where the boy appears in the face with big welts and the mother grabs him and fails this total reaction. The whole movie is like that. People who really see weird do not go forward and do not respond in a normal way. It has to be a bad plot and direction. <br /> <br /> Anna Paquin is doing her best to play her character realistically without suppressing a grin, and she looks crushing in a halter top but at some critical moments in the story the character does Do not bother to sign up. They know more about it: "I'll get into a probably demonic evil situation, with no knowledge of the defense or help of others who carry flashlights or firepower, though I feel a threatening doom." And even if it seems stupid, even conjuring the age of darkness, these creatures that make you bloody can not attack if you have a source of light, but they appear as persons you know and tell you that The device should turn off light source. Reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; Maybe this movie is a rubdown on the concept of this game. <br /> <br /> The best actors of the film are the young kid and Anna. Both are dying in the end. The entire family dies. The Darkness creatures kill them, but in fact the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. The other adults could be exchanged with all the other actors in the Fine Shoes' Red Shoes Diaries series. <br /> <br /> So the worst things in this movie are the stupidity of the characters, who blindly fumble around an obviously unusual situation that is really crap space (there's an old architect in the story who's a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it The architect has assumed from the beginning that there would be occult sacrifices in the house, but nothing reveals that at any rate, because they had no reason they could not find the children, but he did not bother to ask the authorities of to tell the HIDDEN ROOMS he designed in the house, but he likes to spend 40 years in the house because he worries about what's going on inside him ... derrrrhh ... duuuuh), the fraudulent use of fear mechanisms (more kids stand in the dark or just show up on photographs and blood on the wallpaper) and the selfishness of the director when you see him In the DVD features where he's his crap as a new and original playback describes, you can understand where the real horror of this film lies. <br /> <br /> Is this entertaining? At twice the speed of a DVD player with subtitles turned on, it can be entertaining until you reach the end and realize that the movie is crap, otherwise it drags on it. The cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake; The empty calories are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film gives the impression that the director must have seen "The Ring" and tried to create something similar in the mood, which in this respect leads to the movie failing miserably So, in this In my opinion, Jaume Balaguer√≥, that is what you do.
