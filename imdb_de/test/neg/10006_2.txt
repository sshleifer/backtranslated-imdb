As a longtime fan of Japanese film, I expected more than that. I can not really bother writing too much, because this movie is so poor. The story could be the cutest romantic little something, too bad I could not stand the horrible acting, the chaos they called Tempo, and the standard "quirky" Japanese story. If you've noticed how many Japanese films use characters, depictions, and phrases that appear to be "different," force them to move away from the movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old could have told you how this movie would turn out, and that's not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: his role in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and if you're not a rabid fan, you do not have to suffer from this movie waste. <br /> <br /> 2/10
