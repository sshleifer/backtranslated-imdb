Without a doubt, John Wayne is one of the most popular and popular actors of all time. His career spanned over forty years, during which time he starred in such films as Angel and the Badman, The Green Berets, Sands of Iwo Jima, Rio Bravo, North to Alaska, and The Undefeated. , <br /> <br /> The films listed above are said to be some of his best, unlike this 1934 attempt "Randy Rides Alone," which has been pretty much forgotten over time. That's not surprising. It's nothing out of the ordinary, except for the very short running time of just 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who arrives in a saloon in the middle of nowhere for reasons never really explained, and finds that everyone inside was killed. As he looks around, a group arrives and finds Randy there and they arrest him, accuse him of being a gang member, and demand to know where the rest of his gang is. He is charged with murder. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered, arrives in jail to see Randy to make sure he was one of the gang members (she hid in a secret room when the shootings took place). Sally does not think Randy is a murderer and does not recognize him. While the sheriff is outside, she drops his keys and Randy escapes. While Randy escapes from the sheriff and his gang, Randy stumbles comfortably into the hideout of the gang in a cave responsible for the murders. Randy sets about clearing his name and bringing the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie, especially if you're a John Wayne fanatic. At the same time, however, it has too many shortcomings that can not be ignored. The film is also extremely outdated, as one would expect; We have the awful camera shots that make everyone look like they're moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is awful. Acting is not great either, and Wayne's character is very wooden and he looks like the rest of the cast, like wooden dolls led by someone (in this case, it's the director Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is at the top and doing a good job, but the story is paper thin. One can not help but feel that about ten minutes are missing from the beginning of the film, when Randy comes straight from nowhere to the salon and wants to meet someone. An explanation of why Randy was there later gives way to what turns out to be a PI. I was sent to investigate allegations that someone wants to take over the city. To be honest, I did not really understand, most of the time I was hoping the movie would end. I enjoyed some of it and sometimes thought it was pretty funny. But it's really not a great movie and it's not worth looking or tracking. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly outdated and is a troublesome western with very few redeeming qualities. Can be fun, but overall it's not a great movie and certainly one of Wayne's weaker outings.
