I really enjoyed Bruce Almighty, but when I found out there would be a sequel WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (the chattering scene is one of my favorites) and I think deserves Emmy for his role in The Office, he's pretty weak in this boring comedy. I'm curious how much work the scriptwriters are doing because we could as well get by without the story. But even if we discard the huge storylines (why elephants and lions have come to help Evan when the tide only affected this area in Washington), the movie is just ... not funny. I have not even laughed and as far as I can remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh. Or at least giggle. Not this. <br /> <br /> But there is a little hope. Evan Almighty has written "Family" and maybe a family visit is a pleasure (kids may be entertained by the variety of animals and stupid jokes), but for me Evan Almighty just does not cut off br /> <br /> I'll give up 4 / 10 and hope that Carell will be more careful in selecting his roles in the feature.
