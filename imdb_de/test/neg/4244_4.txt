In the 50s and 60s, 70s and 80s war films were shot in the former Yugoslavia, which glorify the heroism of the "partisans". Civilians who turned out to lead a guerrilla war against the invading German troops. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is usually only known in Eastern Europe, has staged some of these "partisan" stories. Unfortunately, only a handful of them were exported to the rest of Europe and the USA. "Battle of the Eagles" is a rare, inexpensive look at the formation and actions of the Partisan Air Force. Marshal Tito decreed that a partisan air force to fight the German Air Force must be formed over the skies over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots joins forces with two small biplanes and starts raiding enemy bases and convoys. Over the course of several months, other pilots and aircraft join forces to form a massive air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe fable? Whatever it is, it certainly is not convincing, but a group of great actors are trying to make sure it works. <br /> <br /> The film begins strongly with a successful German air raid on defenseless partisans. The A and O of the plot comes together almost immediately, and the audience is rewarded for a short time with a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly becomes another low-budget adventure by number. All characters are familiar clich√©s: Major Dragan (played by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typically patriotic, heroic captain. He shoots at planes with a machine gun and even has a duel with the vicious Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and stupid climax with an equally predictable outcome. The rest of the partisans are well known: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a hot Playboy; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a veteran aviator who comes from woodwork now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic ("The Day the World Was Shaken Up") is Dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks and eventually becomes a seasoned fighter pilot. The characters and their stories are known to every fanatic, and Krvavac does not try to build on these stereotypes. The cast does a good job, and despite the two-dimensional script, every player is captivating and fun to watch. Especially Bajic has some great moments? If he will take his first flight as a shooter and later, after the pilot is killed, land a plane. The plot consists only of a series of air raids against the Germans and subsequent acts of retaliation. Krvavac competently treats the storyline with a mixture of current footage and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and fake looking that the transitions between the actual aerial photography and the toy planes are staggering and ridiculous. Some of the bombing raids are shockingly real, while dogfights with scale models and action-figure pilots are just pathetic. Sometimes the smoke of "machine guns" is so great that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane. Worse, the editors often superimpose images of fighters on real footage. Although the aircraft are usually in the right perspective, it is surrounded by a distracting glow that obstructs any attempt at realism. All this action is put on an incredibly known and annoying score by Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "Battle of the Eagles" also suffers from a poorly edited English language release. Initially missing 28 minutes of footage? The film was cut from 130 to 102 minutes. The missing segments were carelessly cut out and the cut looks very careless. The music reflexes are abruptly interrupted and scenes are aborted before being resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only a few much needed action scenes can try to save them from complete incomprehension. Then there is the synchronization? All the scenes that revolve around the Partisans are dubbed in English (but rather poor), but some longer scenes remain in German without subtitles. The film might have made a lot more sense if the German-language sequences had been cut out instead of turning crucial scenes around the partisans. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Krvavac can handle the outdoor shoot pretty well. There is never a moment when the audience is on a stage. In particular, the Luftwaffe's German bases are extensive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter jets and extras costumed in leather aviator jackets. The landscape is fresh and green, and Krvavac is not afraid to record scenes at extremely wide angles or from a distance, just to convey the range of a battle or a long trek. A German ambush of a partisan unit, which is in the picture at an early stage, as well as a series in which Zare and Dalibor flee from an enemy base, can be seen on the home screen. is just another of many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. There's nothing that sets it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrific special effects and drastic editing put it just below the limit. Try to avoid this unless you find a full length copy.
