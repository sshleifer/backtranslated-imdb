Wow, this movie is bad. Think of flashdancing with ninja. The worst thing is when a sword is supposed to float in the air, but you can see the strings. Or the worst part is the gigantic eye-click (which looks like a coaster) that the good ninja wears. In fact, there are so many bad parts, I can not decide what the worst is. I can not believe that anyone is actually investing the money to do this thing. The only redeeming value is that it's good to laugh about it.
