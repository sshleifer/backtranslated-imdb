Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-Man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think there can be an excuse that this movie is as bad as it was. The cast was there for that, but it seemed they would have to try to fit them into the movie as soon as they found themselves with a decent cast. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was at best sketchy. I was wondering why I spent my money on this movie.
