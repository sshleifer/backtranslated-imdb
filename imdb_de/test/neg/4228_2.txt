This French film is supposedly a creepy, moronic policeman investigating the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. The film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. If a character takes ten minutes to go from point A to point B, the movie takes ten minutes to show this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. There are also static shots that last for minutes. The viewer is asked if he accidentally presses the pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The movie lasts about seven hours. You do the math. The actors were apparently amateurs and that shows. Note to myself: Never again see a Dumont movie.
