It's okay movie if it were made by high school kids for their friends. It is called "professional" far below the borders. There is no plot, no acting and visual appearance, as you see it through the plastic wrap. I was so happy to have the FF button on my remote, 32x worked really well. I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, but it should not be a reason to introduce it to the public. If you're worried about quality and budget, "Open Water" earned $ 60,000, and more than half went to the man who provided ocean safety and trained sharks. And this movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an Indy filmmaking event.
