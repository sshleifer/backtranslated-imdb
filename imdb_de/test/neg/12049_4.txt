Empty shortening of John Irving's novel bravely strives for profundity and is ultimately absurd. It is a quirky, dumb and bittersweet series of sketches that explain the growth of a man from birth to adulthood, and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism surrounding him. Garp was born by an impressive, unmarried mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close (The various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams reaches adulthood.) History traces him through childhood at a boys' preschool, where Jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions - wrestling, writing, and sex - with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems, and a writing career. Jenny has become a famous feminist and is committed to an unorthodox cause. The plot describes a wealth of comic and tragicomic episodes and offbeat adventures. Williams gives a cherub-face performance. This script did not match his ferocity and anarchy, so his talent was wasted. He is like a wounded bird that gets out of control. John Lithgow's role as a transsexual father who teaches wisdom also makes no sense. This film attracted some attention in 1982 due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into the movies. Williams had recently abandoned his Mork and Mindy persecution and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. The audience was confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
