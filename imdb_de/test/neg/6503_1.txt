The ABC is making his repertory fit for another unrealistic representation of rural Australia. Yes, it's all there, Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, a talented actor) Fireman, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) city slut, Preggers of Baca's brother Joe (I think). Then there is Uncle Geoff, the Big Daddy of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams on tempo. The only saving grace is the Russian actress Natalia Novikova as a vicious woman. She is great. I can not understand why John Waters took the show as Lilly's psychologist husband. Must have the money I expect! Nevertheless, he will not last long because Lill and Baca will do it in a suit. Watch this lemon to see how bad an Aussie show can be. Honestly, I am ashamed.
