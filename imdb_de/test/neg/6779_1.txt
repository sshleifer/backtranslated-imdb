The problem here - and with all the films from the Vietnam War - is that they are all too biased. Anti-war films overlook the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while Prowar films overlook the fact that many soldiers have indeed committed atrocities, as in this film. This movie is shit. It's time for a movie that was neither antagonistic nor warlike, nor liberal or conservative, but COMPLETELY UNCONDITIONAL.
