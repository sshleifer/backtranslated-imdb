Although I have seen Sal√≤, I do not know if it tastes sour. If so, this "movie" is named exactly. So much fiber, so little substance, that is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only the palate is not cleaned. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's head, and if I could throw in this movie and get the cost back, I would do that. The detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a fool's cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. could not save this semi-professional projection from failing. Waste of time, waste. ** Do not be fooled by the tooth-addicted Dominique Swain: competent eye candy she was in the Lolita remake, less tragic and subtle than Sue Lyon, but by no means better. However, a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skillful craftswoman. It takes crafting, not crap, and that's exactly what this movie is about. The rollers belong in the girls' bathroom, flushed until the pipes burst, while the director Christina Wayne should make 5-10 in the study hall. Observe everything else and pass this class forever!
