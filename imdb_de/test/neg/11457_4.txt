Not all movies shot in 1931 are creaky, and the fact that this was the "Best Picture" must have given even more impetus to the development of television. It's possible to bring the entire story to the screen, not to mention the development of the character. Dix - so rigid in the first third of the movie - makes a face, but nobody knows why and it makes no sense. And what is there about Dunne that makes her so stoic? Edna May Oliver's scenes are as always priceless. <br /> <br /> This film plays a role in the history of cinema but is long and boring.
