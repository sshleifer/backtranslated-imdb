Henry (Don Ameche) appears at the entrance to hell and tells his story (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on his relationship with women throughout his life, and in particular his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we confined ourselves to Henry and His Excellency for a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately there is nothing more to say about the film, because nothing happens. It's a sentimental story about a man's life and it's very boring. I saw it with my girlfriend and dad, and we found it despite the Lubitsch touch for garbage. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he's on the big screen as a grandfather and there were some fun moments of dialogue. The paint made it a good spectacle, but it was not enough to stop that idiot from getting into the dump. In the same way as "Its A Wonderful World" and "You Can Not Do It With You", and so it was not surprisingly nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of which is interesting and has no action of interest. Boring, sentimental and the biggest wet squib of an end that I can remember ...
