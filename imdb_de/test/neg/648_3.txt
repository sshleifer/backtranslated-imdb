"I assume you are here to damage your mental circuit." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson made me look at this ... he mentioned it in his book "Movie Megacheese". I asked myself, "Why should Mike Nelson misdirect me?" I now know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the devil. I'm sure anyone who worked on this film is likely to be in the league with ol 'Slewfoot or is now damned, from the executive director to the man who ran the catering truck in front of the studio. Do not pay attention to the love of God ... do not look !!! Not even making a copy and showing someone will curse you ... I'm doomed now, I understand that. I accept that But save yourself ...
