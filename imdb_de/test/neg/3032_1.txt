I can't almost describe how terrible this Irish Vanity project (funded by Canadian taxpayers - both state and Albertan -) really is Real life was a star athlete in Alberta, for no other reason to ensure Canadian content , There is also evidence that certain pubs in Calgary were useful. Everything here is filmed poorly and at least thirdhand (chunks of badly digested trainspotting, lock stick, snatch and reservoir dogs are the most obvious steals). , Avoid the plague unless you feel like one of those pugnacious nights, "so bad, it's almost funny" - nights in front of your TV.
