I found the first 90 minutes of this film very interesting, even though some parts were ridiculous (ie H. Philip Seymour Hoffman's character). The last 60 minutes were uncomfortable and I lost interest in the movie. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed. <br /> <br /> The film is well played and I can see why Rene Zellweger got an Oscar because her character was so interesting. The film is also filmed beautifully and the story is emotional. However, I found the message bad: not surprising in Hollywood today. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) leaves the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants to take him home. He is also disillusioned by the war. (Can you imagine that every soldier in a similar boat left the army in the two world wars ?!) <br /> <br /> In this movie, of course, that's all acceptable. What, in turn, has the liberal filmmaker ever said anything nice about the US military? To increase their left leaning, they represent a vigilante-like group that tracks deserters as cold-blooded, pathological killers. Well, in the world of movies, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good ... and only liberals would portray deserters as heroes.
