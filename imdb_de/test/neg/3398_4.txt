The incomparable Paul Naschy, a horror movie icon of Spain, lends his talent to this entertaining, if not distracted, film. What begins as an action film ends with a horror story. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy plays a cold-hearted killer hired by some dodgy Japanese diamond hunters (one of which is his child's flame) to strike a diamond cache from a Belgian businessman. When the deed is done, the temptation of the diamonds is too tempting for Paul to dismiss them, so he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, vows revenge and chases Paul through the forest, shoots him up and leaves him dead. However, Paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and taken to his home to recover. At the estate, the two daughters Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez fight for Paul in his weakened condition. With the busty Silvia Aguilar she decided not to lose the sweet and clean Azucena. But for Mr. Naschy, who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long-dead daughter on the grounds of the property, it becomes hairy. Connect this with the Japanese girl who has the job of killing Paul, and he is pulled from two sides. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story goes in different ways and does not fully satisfy the script. Paul builds a fight for Paul between the daughters, but Silvia, whose character is assertive and volatile, simply leaves Azucena in Paul Naschy Win the prize game without defending the Japanese) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You get a gunplay, a puffed-up baby and pigs who are poor fools alive.) Gore dogs become with this Naschy Movie does not disappoint). <br /> <br /> MOVEMENT: $$$ (Paul Naschy is fun as always, but he spends a little too much time in bed recovering from his wounds, again with Silvia Aguilar and lovely Azucena Hernandez who teamed up with Mr. Naschy in the little gem "The Craving" (both girls are doing a good job). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$ (You get very brief insights into Aguilar and Hernandez, but they are strategically placed and keep nothing in the way.For the full nudity provide the two less appealing actresses: the Japanese girl who seeks Paul, and the African girl who works for Silvia and Azucena.
