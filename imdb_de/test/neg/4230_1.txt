I can not remember the last time I was so terribly disappointed with a movie. I probably expected too much (of course you can expect action in Dogma movies, of course). But here is nothing wrong. Fortunately, I saw it at home and was able to change channels whenever the silence and silent faces killed me. And that was very often! It really is no great pleasure to watch ugly people who do not speak and move slowly, pet pigs and kiss French men, not to mention ugly bodies that have explicit sex. If only it makes sense ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; It seems as if it was just created to show another vagina because nulls are able to actually solve the crime. Since there are only four pseudo-developed characters and a movie that is nowhere to go, it soon becomes clear who the director has selected as a murderer. And that does not make sense either. Despite boredom and suffering, I have to admit that it touched me in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should try it for yourself, although I do not recommend it.
