First of all, let me make it clear that I love planes, and normally every movie I travel with is worth a look - and I've been through some shocking movies. The same is not true for this film. James Stewart is a great actor, but he's wasted in this commercial on Strategic Air Command. The action is mediocre and the direction is weak. I had to stop seeing about half of that horrible garbage. Despite some very good, maybe even the best aerial photos. The problem is that even for an aviation mother like me, I make something out of the shocking plane (B-36 and B-47) that gets on my nerves. It's a shame that the movie did not appear when the B-52 appeared. Then the superlatives used in this movie for the plane would have been valid. Then maybe I could have gone through it. Maybe I miss the point of the movie, which may be the fear that loved ones have to endure while their loved ones are active. In any case, it could have been much better. Recommendation? Well worth missing.
