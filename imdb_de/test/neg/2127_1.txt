Yikes. <br /> <br /> I have seen some bad movies in my time, many in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and the others of MST3k. This was also the case with this case, and although I found the movie quite funny in itself, it would not have been nearly as funny without the MST3k commentary. The film is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of Europe in the eighties. Terrible music, terrible acting, terrible action (which is a little there), terrible dialogue and really, really REAL, terrible cut. Cripes. <br /> <br /> This could be called a turkey if there is not the fact that it is in no way unique. It's pretty much the same movie that almost every Italian hacker in a director has released. <br /> <br /> So try to get the MST3k version. It's a pretty funny episode with Mike and Gang in pretty good shape.
