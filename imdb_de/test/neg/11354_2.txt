I was looking forward to it, based on the reviews and the fairly good rating. That was a big disappointment. For contemporary zombie flicks like Shaun the Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead, etc., this does not hold a candle. Horror flicks sometimes take a while to get started. You need to build the characters if you sniff them. You feel a little empathic, but still you have 45 minutes to sit down before sniffing a body. Up to this point, it's like watching a bad soap opera, nothing interesting or relevant happens, and when it's you. When you first look at it, you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes, you will not miss anything abrupt , When things get going, everything is very subordinate. Some of the kills and make-ups are done well, others are done very poorly, there's a lack of consistency, and there are some really shocking continuity flaws and some of the most dramatic wooden acts I've ever seen. That could all be passable if you really did believe that this all takes place in an airplane, but when guns are fired, firebombs are fired and pilots are not in the cockpit in a violent storm, but the plane stays in the air, come on, we are not all simpletons. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it really takes a whole minute for the missile of a fighter jet to strike a plane just a few hundred yards away. I know it's a zombie movie and you have to stretch things, but this movie along with the other major flaws mentioned above did not have credibility. One thing to overlook
