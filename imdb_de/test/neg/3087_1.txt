The movie producers hope the name Cameron Diaz will help sell this image. Unfortunately, nothing can save what has already been recorded on the screen. Despite some beautifully filmed European film locations and some solid production design elements, the film fails mainly due to its awkward, incredible romance between Brewster and Eccleston. An indescribable cinematic experience.
