I do not understand the exaggerated good critics of this film, except that a lot of people from Venezuela are understandably very excited because Venezuelan cinema really lags behind the other countries in the region. <br /> <br /> Above all, the film is too repetitive, with many scenes almost identical in each of the two main roles, giving you the impression of being a time filler. A time filler is also a good point, since this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will get tired after a while and look at the clock. <br /> <br /> All actors are pretty bad except for Venezuelan Edgar Ramirez, who has some slapstick and plays the role of Venezuelan recruiter "Pedro". By the way, this is not a representative film about the people of the region (Caribbean), it tends to taunt them.
