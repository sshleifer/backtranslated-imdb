"The Chilling" by Deland Nuse and Jack A. Sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") appeared in this stinker is a mystery to me: the frozen corpses of a cryolab are revived after lightning strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look awful and there is no blood. Avoid this cheap garbage like the plague. My rating: 1 out of 10.
