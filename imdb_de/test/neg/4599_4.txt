A boring movie about a miserable loser ... that's Factotum in a nutshell. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, alter ego of the author Charles Bukowski, on whose novel the film is based. When we meet Chinaski, he may be a writer, but he certainly is not successful. He floats through life, gets fired from one low job to the other, and does not care about a bit. The fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with him not caring. He meets a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor, and a relationship develops. Chinaski moves into Jan's apartment and now, instead of getting drunk, he can get drunk with someone else. Good times. At some point he has enough of this relationship, so Chinaski is self-employed. Unfortunately, he still can not keep his job so fast that he is broke. At this point, Marisa Tomei appears and for some reason Laura decides to rescue this wretched drunken loser she does not even know. We'll soon meet some of Laura's acquaintances, and the movie moves into a kind of bizarre world with this pretty diverse group. Soon Tomei and his friends are out of the picture and again we are left behind with Chinaski and his drinking and his wretched little life. There's a bit more time with Jan, but most of the time it's just a drunken, jobless loser. And then the movie is over and not a moment too early. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems to be infinitely longer as the movie moves on. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life drinking Matt Dillon, then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a compelling story, well-developed characters, or entertainment, you're in the wrong place. Dillon's performance is not bad at all. Too bad that the movie that surrounds him is actually pretty bad.
