Although it's not a complete waste of time, 'Eighteen' was not really cute, as it was. Also, is not the age of the actors who portray them? 18, my butt. McKellen could actually have appeared in the film, telling us he was 30 years old and asking us to believe it. Even Michael J. Fox was more credible than teens in Part II and III "Back to the Future" (okay, maybe not, they're probably equally credible). If you can overcome the obvious age flaw, you either have the complete gap to act or just too much to do (Paul Antony's so-called Torment, Clarence Sponagle's Lifetime Moments, and though I prefer Brendan Fletcher, it's best to consider him and more in "Freddy Vs. Jason") incomprehensible scenes (a faster marriage than Britney Spears Incest to prove a point and a man who needs help urinating but still has a hand free? I suppose that was the writer's imagination), a complete movie with despicable characters (Anthony Maybe he's playing somebody who is 18, but he looks like he's 12 and a weird "John" so that Anthony's character Pip can save the day? Was there really a sex scene? in front of a baby?) and virtually every character who asks his own question sexuality through strange acts / scenes. On the positive side, I enjoyed the voice of Ian McKellen. I saw a (rarely well-described) straight and gay friendship, a puppy love (from someone who collects stuffed puppies), a good score, some decent dialogues (love the separation) of gays and pedophilia? Wish more people would realize that) and act on the female leads (as well as cumming.) I can not really recommend it as it really tries to be too many things ?? Homosexual tolerance, gay Hustling, homelessness, World War II epic, priesthood, first love, faulty judges, etc, etc etc on a tight budget.
