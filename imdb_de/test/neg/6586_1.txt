"The Polar Express" was a horrible movie. What makes the movie the worst is the hypocrisy of presenting itself as an innocent, sugary, and harmless story for children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I never read the book by Chris Van Allsburg in what inspired it, but the most disappointing thing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, who also has the great "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" Animation could be appreciated by children and adults alike, while in this movie it looks like it has become a victim of its own ambitions, and it puts too much emphasis on producing an impressive level of detail rather than an interesting story "The Polar Express" has as much artistic level as an advertising campaign for a video game or a toy. Everything in this movie seems so lifeless: The characters may look like humans, but they have nothing of life and they have a vicious touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" in this movie. You could see it in some parts of the movie, and believe me, it was disgusting. Take, for example, a scene where a child refuses to come to Polar Express. Note that the character who looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture as if he were saying, "You're stupid not to accept my offer." Second, when the girl says the toys are so "warm" and things like that. In all that damned movie that kids keep talking about, how big the presents Santa Claus would give them. There is even a song about the gifts! The vagabond is an irrelevant and weak character. And in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? What do you think ? the gifts ! You can say that in many Christmas movies, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call a "children's film" because if that's what the kids would learn, I do not want to think about what our future would look like.
