Propaganda Pro-American War effort film, released in 1942, makes the East Side Kids tough on Japanese in their own neighborhood when they learn they are too young to register. Eventually, they find out that they were wrong in their mistrust of some people, but they also stumble upon a spy ring that they then want to break. The film is harmless enough in its own right, though some take offense, considering how innocent Asians were really singled out during World War II. All in all, though, it's a fairly generic effort, and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall have better moments, the best of which come here when they're ad-lib.
