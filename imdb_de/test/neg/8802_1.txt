This movie is bad, so bad that my mother, who can hardly bear the "suspense" of Disney's Snow White, has blown the whole movie. My first warning should have been that it was in Wal-Mart in the $ 5 ton. But I've really found some good movies in this bin, so I can not say anything for this debacle. The second warning should have been: When the cashier called the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again, I was never one to ignore the cheap ones. This movie is definitely not for people who are looking for something good to look at, and certainly not for anyone who likes bad movies occasionally. If you need background noise while playing cards with friends, for example, you should get it here, but if you're looking for something to actually see, do not bother. It was really disappointing because there were many good actors. I felt like I was watching a chocolate version of Willard.
