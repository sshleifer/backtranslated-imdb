This was a first feature for Clinton when I was there when he caused this chaos in Adelaide around the age of 98 ... <br /> <br /> Although I was not directly involved in the production, I was a typical witness Madness, post-set, went under: the parties, the drugs, the illusory glamor, really an example of what not to do when shooting a movie, but also a by-product of young, talented people immersing themselves in classical ideologies involve fame and worldly position. <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another rip with a more mature script ... that's where the problems are, and I'm sure it's a lot better Work will be done when there is a next round! Because apparently he was doing in his CV certainly no favor and not the cast ... but hey, it was a paid job in a country where actors starve to death regularly. <br /> <br / In summary, it's fascinating to see the "making of", basically not so much fun (unfortunately!).
