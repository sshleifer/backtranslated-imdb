I realize that there are some fans who might like this movie. I am aware that the idea of ​​looking for God may seem interesting to some, but for me it is really boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is just boring. When it gets a bit interesting, it gets stupid. Come on ... Kirk fights God and wins? How deep can we get there? The only good part of the movie is the camping scene in the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but after that the movie gets boring, irritating and offers nothing more than good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have Star Trek VI. (Ups, Kirk hit him).
