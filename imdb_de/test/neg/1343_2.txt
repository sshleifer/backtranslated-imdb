The Women (2008) by Diane English is unfortunately such a talent waste. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman, whom I like about everything I've seen there, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Brass, and Eva Mendes, who are not my favorite actors, but still nice See, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and just plain bad? It was made by Diane English, who is known as the author of the highly successful television program Murphy Brown, and this is her first film for which she wrote a screenplay. The film was a love affair for the English who have been trying for years to achieve this, and I respect that. I've even found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable camsos that are witty, smart and entertaining, but in general it's a second-hand "Sex and the city "a few months ago. I did not like Sex and the City very well when I saw it, but besides The Women, it was awesome. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital delivery room, where one of the characters had a baby and their friends were there to support them. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve this nightmare she had been through, and us, the spectators, with her? The films like "The Women" give the whole genre, chick stripes, a bad name. There is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about friendships and needs, dealing with marriage, motherhood and the professional profession? These are all very convincing and important topics to which every modern woman can refer. Why make movies with lines, dialogues and situations so clich√©d, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten once the movie is over? <br /> <br /> After watching the new movie I checked it out The original The Women came from my local library and I really enjoyed it. The story was told a lot better 70 years ago and aroused my interest. The old movie had a real star power.
