Failing to find the right words is a problem in this urban comedy of the vaudeville type. They do not know what to say, and they do not know how to say it. That's why they start with the potentially humiliating company of pre-agreed speed dating. Unfortunately, they all look like cardboard figures, not real people. The story follows a conventional three-act structure: you get to know the sizable cast in their sad single lives, the actual dating scene, and a final section of romantic episodes in which some of the follies of the newly found couples are presented. Because everything is so predictable, I would say that "shopping" is a failure. As a comedy it is usually too stupid to be really funny. Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the crowd of soap operas as the restrained, independently rich Miriam. Great make-up for her (Verena Wei√üert): Heavy eye shadow meets skin-glossy lip gloss and creates a brooding and bohemian, yet girlish effect. Thumbs up for Stefan Zinner as a Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as a hot nutritionist. They bypass the communication challenge with the timeless body language of copulation.
