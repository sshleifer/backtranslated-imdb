I have to go with my boy Allen (who has also reviewed this movie) ... ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (my copy has the title - presumably they have omitted the "NINJA" part after realizing that there is not a single "Ninja") or hint of ninjas is somewhere in the movie!) is all a waste of time. Honestly, one of the most boring, backward "movies" I've ever seen. <br/> <br /> A hooker is (again) raped (not graphically) by two zombies and then by a police officer (again) if the policeman does not believe her story. She meets a guy who was beaten up by those zombies and they try to find a way to seek revenge on the undead offenders ... <br /> <br /> First of all - there is no gangbanging (or really something else) "beating" ever) in ZOMBIE NINJA GANGBANGERS. I had hoped to get at least some kind of horror / porn hybrid like PORN OF THE DEAD or RE-PENETRATOR or maybe PERVERTED STORIES - but no - there was absolutely no sex in this movie. At least some of the old in-out might have cashed in on this boring trash, but without it we get a series of badly shot scenes of boredom with zero profit. I'm all for "trash" movies and most other lock, gore, porn and exploit stuff, but this one sucks in every imaginable way. Save your time, spend it ... 1/10 (and that's just for a few shots of subordinate titties ...)
