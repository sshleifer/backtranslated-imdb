This is, in my opinion, a very bad movie in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is promoted as lead actor (although he is the co-star) only to sell more copies. Obviously, this film influences the eponymous Conan movies, but proves not to be enjoyable and will ultimately not entertain. <br /> <br /> Bridgette Neilsen plays Sonja, a beautiful woman who has received incredible gifts from a ghostly figure after plundering her village, killing her family and raping her herself by the soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman) has been. Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control of the barbaric world and seeks a talisman guarded by Sonja's sister. After finding out what happened, Sonja seeks revenge and at the same time saves the world from the wrath of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, wants to protect her, whether she wants him there or not. <br /> <br /> The first big problem with this movie is the beginning. The events that led to the point where Sonja gets her powers would have easily made ten to fifteen minutes of entertaining film. The beginnings, however, turn into a quick one-minute "before on ??". Extract from a TV show. If they had actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the fillers later, they might have been able to redeem this movie, but unfortunately that was not the case (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer has been watching just two movies since Red turned Sonja). <br /> <br /> This movie also features some of the most annoying characters in the story, such as Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid figure and simply adds an overabundance of stock to the movie, which is sometimes the case, but works miserable in this case. He was obviously written for the comic relief in the film, but with the film's absurd overall effect, that was another costly mistake for "Red Sonja" anyway. <br /> <br /> For all the bugs, there were good fighting scenes with Neilsen and Arnie that are worth mentioning, but these are nowhere enough to save that turkey. The acting is about as good as it is for films of this quality, and even Arnie did not seem to bother his performance. I do not recommend this movie at all; For me, it's a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for ?? Red Sonja '?? 3.10
