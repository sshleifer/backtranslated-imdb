That was pretty much inevitable. This film borrowed "The Core" and the movie "Armageddon" and the films he borrowed from, and so on. Except for Luke Perry. This movie version of the popular "Save the World" plot features superquests that begin in the Pacific Northwest and extend the entire Ring of Fire. It soon becomes clear that everyone on earth could simply be doomed to failure. The military and some scientists are building one of these high tech drills to get into the earth and fix things (it would not be so much fun if they did not have to go somewhere in space or in the planets). There is even a line that tries to make the journey into the earth more impressive than the journey into space (as in "Armageddon"). It's a sci-fi network movie, so the script is a painting by numbers disaster movie. There is a dispute between scientists and military, there are rock-melting lasers, people are dying and sacrificing themselves for the good of all, and most of all (weak CGI) special effects. Not original and not so entertaining. This is a movie to watch if you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
