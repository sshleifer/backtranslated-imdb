The comments on this film completely mislead me, especially because someone said he had seen him at a film festival and loved every minute of it. I expected this to be a nice run of the old American pie film, and I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the camera work is terrible. I do not think the director knows that cameras are more likely to move around scenes then stop and the actors move up close. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenery! My God, I've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest. The club was totally unconvincing, with around three extras danced in the background at the same time. The apartments were bare and lacked personality. Third, the actors. Impressive. The director apparently opted for the typical "Reaper" character, a purring main character with a rugged "I do not give a f ** k" character making pot takes on the main insert. Everything the main character said and did was a job, so much so that I had to flinch. <br /> <br /> All in all, the conspiracy, the supposedly great revenge theme, lasted about 30 seconds and they lacked the real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and seemed to have no real relationship with others. No character had any depth, they could just as well have been cardboard cutouts passing the static camera. <br /> <br /> A really horrible piece, worse than a student who is 2 minutes short for Youtube in the first year. Advice to the director? Change your name and refuse any affiliation with the movie, which is likely to sell a copy on a sale in Yard in Ohio.
