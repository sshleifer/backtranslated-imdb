Previous Tarantino films came from a man in love with other films. This one is from a man in love with his own writing. It is not Inglorious, it is disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The whole point of a movie is to entertain - when you hit people's heads and entertainingly remove their scalp !!!! - And if there is an unforgivable sin that a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust. <br /> <br /> The film is just a collection of endless and painfully boring and disgusting scenes of people talking in different languages ​​at tables. There's even a scene where three people talk at the same table for almost 45 minutes before they're all luckily shot. I wish they had been killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to silence the F ** K. <br /> <br /> This table talk style is a Tarantino mark, but in other movies, I really cared what they said and what people said. I could not care less here. All of Quentin's films show enormous trust, especially Jackie Brown. But here in every scene there is a penetrating feeling. Tarantino had no idea where he should go with the movie. Is that violent? Sure, there is torture and scalping in abundance, but you would have to remind me. Luckily, the film was so thin that I did not even remember that I'd seen it earlier in the day when I looked up to a headline on MSNBC. <br /> <br /> He has no gimmicks and seems to be dying Roman. But do us a favor, QT, and spare us the movie. <br /> <br /> I came out halfway through the film, and I would never recommend anyone to watch the movie, no matter what a staunch Quarantino fan he or she is. <br /> <br /> I give 0/10.
