I could not bear to see a lot of this crap. This is your standard junk that some annoying women love - old drama from the English era with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to be plucked either directly by Oliver Twist or another Dickens novel. The usual clichés from the Victorian era are used. Certain idiotic people really believe that the whole emotional torment of this suppressed culture is somehow fascinating and romantic. This is juice, pure and perfect junk and boring while the grass is growing. As such, it is perfect for women who crave a kind of English landscape Snoozer drama in a Victorian setting, but for this man, this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment when you have a series of boring scenes with you unoriginal characters see miserable forced and fake English accent.
