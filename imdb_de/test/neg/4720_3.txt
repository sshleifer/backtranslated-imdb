Apart from the shootings, I felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could have played these roles in their sleep. The dialogue was reasonably bearable (and there was plenty of it - no one sat quietly in this film), the plot was all over the map, as if they could not decide how many topics should be penned into the story, there was no subtlety at all - the foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they took you through most of the story (I think they added all the dialogues to make sure you did not miss anything), and the editing really had to be firmer. The actor's screen time was more quantity than quality - again too many dialogues. <br /> <br /> The whole story took place over the course of a few days, but everything that happened was epic, much like everyday events seemed to be HUGE in high school, but on the whole that was not really important. Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Moses, they beat Button, they killed the dog - anything that would drive Boss and Charley's blood into the air. The importance, however, was watered down by all the "deep, meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the film. These guys have been working together for 10 years and are talking about this stuff right now? The only time that there was not much dialogue was in the shooting scene - that's why I probably liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gives Annette Bening a hairbrush! The fine strands of hair around her face that made her (a little bit more romantic) actually disturbed her a little. If she had worked outside the home, that would have made more sense. And why was not she already married? In the city, in addition to the marshal and his cronies, there seemed to be several "friendly and gentle" individuals. In fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want them (a common plotter in other movies). She was locked up in the house most of the time and did not seem to have much to do with the people in town. Do you wonder ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was too long, too talkative and too good for me. It felt like a star-studded vehicle with plenty of screen time for the big stars, but not enough character depth to interest me despite all the dialogues.
