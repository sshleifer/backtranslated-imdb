Wow ... As a big fan of Larry McMurtry's Western Tales and especially the Lonesome Dove series, I was looking forward to Comanche Moon. What a huge flop. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the outstanding performance of Lonesome Dove ... The story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... everything worked. <br /> <br /> Comanche Moon compared to a bad Saturday Night live sketch. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is babbling and the plot meanders mindlessly through the area. It seems like the actors are all reading from TelePrompTern. I could not identify with any of the characters, good guys, bad guys, not even the random characters. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of David Midthunder. It looks like it was torn out of an eighth-grade middle school. I'm sorry, I want to find something positive about Comanche Moon, but I just can not. There is nothing.
