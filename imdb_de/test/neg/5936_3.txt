Based on 2007's spy novel by David Ignatius, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) sent to Jordan to track down an al-Qaida mastermind Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the trailers might think that the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of Hoffman's Ferris, but actually The story is much more worldly. Instead, we are served a lukewarm broth with ridiculous embezzlement, while the white, handsome boy American Ferris moves almost impassively through the bustling streets of Amman Jordan, without a worried look over his shoulder or attracting the attention of the locals. Only during a scene in which Ferris takes his new Iranian darling to tea, reality penetrates into reality, when the couple is bombarded by Bavarian eyes by Jordanian men as nothing more than upholstery. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris is expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to Britain, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to look after his children ?? it goes on. This is the kind of stuff you do not expect from a spy thriller in an episode of The Amazing Race. <br /> <br /> Through corporal loyalty to his craft, Crowe won an impressive 63-pound flop for the The Portly Ed Hoffman, who plays Thespianer to the small, select club of actors consisting of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale who have undergone massive weight gains or losses for their roles. It's too bad that everyone else involved could not share Crowe's commitment to quality, otherwise we'd have a far better movie than this below average chaos.
