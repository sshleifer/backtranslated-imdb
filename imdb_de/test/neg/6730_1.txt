I have to say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL. <br /> <br /> how Seagal watched his funny martial arts on people. I have always been looking forward to Seagal movies and unfortunately I was first disappointed by GLIMMER MAN, which I found really bad. THE FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagal has ever played. Terribly boring, badly edited, wrong soundtrack and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor and stay away! <br /> <br /> Frankly, stay away!
