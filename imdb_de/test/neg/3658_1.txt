This "movie" will give me nightmares, I'll wake up sweaty and scream "I did not make this movie, please do not blame me!" I honestly think it would have been fun to watch a fat guy eating in his mother's basement for an hour or two, rather than seeing that crap. I understand the money was tight, but damn it, what the hell did they think, there were no thoughts, plans or efforts invested in this matter. This movie needs a warning "Please do not fund the drama department at the local JC for the love of God." On another note, these are the least sympathetic characters I've ever seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler in them. So, take my advice the next time you think about it, just hire a few hundred Adivl and let it go to sleep.
