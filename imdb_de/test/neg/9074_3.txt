I have not been to the Art House Theater for a long time and have visited Douches Froides because it has received such great reviews in the papers. <br /> <br /> The thing is with this movie, that's it. It has neither head nor tail, but only a temporal section about the life of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I already knew it would be a long sitting, but sometimes things can not be better in this case. There is no real character development or networking between players. You start in the middle of a situation, suddenly there is a girlfriend and then there is a man with whom he must be friends in order to fulfill his sporting ambitions, but the way they are put together is quite strange, as they are are "simply composed", it seems. <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one that you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other man is barely noticeable and really all I could think about during the movie was "When will they have sex again?". And if you think about it, it's really crazy. Because it basically means that nothing is really worth seeing, but three teenagers aiming for it, and that makes it a very crappy movie for me at least, stay clear and save your money (my â‚¬ 7.50 is wasted) There are better art house movies than these. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for the acting performance, one each.
