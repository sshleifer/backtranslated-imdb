When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run free, get ready. You can expect dark, shattering films like "Alice" and "Little Otik" or short gems like "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky". All of these are excellent films that show disquieting, surrealistic films at their best. <br /> <br /> However, if Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, it is recommended to leave the movie room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this regard tend to be both youthful and preachy, repeating straw-manic caricatures to express his pseudo-brilliant insights. <br /> <br /> "Lunacy" is unfortunately much the latter type of movie. Cartoonist ideas and characters are terribly stretched for two hours. There are a few moments of interest for a short time, but these few oases are separated by long deserts of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you find Svankmajer's terrible, monotonous short film "Et Cetera" brilliant and witty, you will probably love "Lunacy". If you've never seen a Svankmajer movie before, start somewhere else.
