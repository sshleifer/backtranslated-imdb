Ho humm - - - More of nothing. If you're a long-time rush fan, you know what's in this video: hideous songs from the past, the "BIG 3" hits from the 80s and their "last dig" to stay current. They manage to make fun of themselves by portraying the critics as "dinosaurs." Unfortunately, they fail to protect themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only help these guys to LOOK AS. <br /> <br /> If you've been following the band since the 1970's (as much as you can stomach), you know there's no new material here. Same old, same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) no real scenes (Geddy loses his SHOES?! Give me a break! Even ER thinks it is absurd!) 3) no new findings. <Br /> <br /> A better video would have been to show the CREW setting for 3 or 4 hours. Just let the camera run. And stop changing the camera angle every two seconds! I understand that the director wants to try to do something artistic. Then offer a full concert version with 2 or 3 recordings that the VIEWER can choose. We know what the band looks like? Let us see what we REALLY want to see. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor: RENT this movie first.
