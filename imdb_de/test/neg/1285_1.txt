What a waste of precious time! My 5 year old daughter brought this house out of my mother's house, and we saw it as a family. None of us liked it. This pathetic little film, marked by blatant inconsistencies, obvious Christian themes and terrible film quality, is not even worth a look. It felt a bit like a bad attempt at film school at the high school drama class. How sad it is to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and Co.) moving through this banal and bleak story. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The movie could have gone straight to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time should be spent better with the drying of paint.
