(Spoiler) Unfortunately, I SEEN the movie that this horrible movie was a sequel. It was called Ator, the martial eagle, and I saw it when I was only 8 years old. It made such a terrible impression on me that I never forgot it. I've been an MST3K fan for a long time. When Cavedwellers appeared on tape, I bought it. I was horrified to find that it was a sequel to the miserable Ator movie I had seen so long ago! Ator's costume has become increasingly tight as I last saw him. How can he wear this tiny little bikini? Does not it interest him that it shows the fact that he has no ... um ... package? And poor Thong ... he gets no lines and no girl and has to follow the froggy, girly dumbus Ator all the time. Has anyone noticed that Miles O'Keefe walks like a woman? No wonder he is not interested in the pretty, if slightly dull, Meela. The evil, but chic villain Zor is more to his liking, I'm sure. I loved Zor's cardboard spray-painted swan helmet and the way he spent all his time touching a part of Ator. The battle scenes are so badly choreographed that it's a miracle that the swords ever connect. The dull old man stands around all the time and looks downcast. Ator drinks from a mug given to him by a guy who hates him and then looks surprised that they drugged him. He has to be pretty clever - he invented a hang glider in five minutes and then flew into a rift in the space-time continuum, so he briefly traveled to 17th-century Bulgaria. That was after he had, of course, stabbed the giant snake doll and rescued the descendant, Meela, while doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the film was Thong, who saved Ator several times from his boundless stupidity and killed the evil Zor in the trade. Kudos to Thong, the only competent person in the movie.
