This movie has absolutely no redemptive features. It's not even worth being in the category "that bad, it's good" - it's just bad. Badly played, poorly shot, poorly written, poorly directed, horrible sound recordings and the whole thing is just incredibly amateurish. How this publication got published is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Oh, and could anyone tell the lead actress that playing "crazy" does not mean that you should constantly fumble with your hair. In a movie that was generally irritating, this was probably one of the most irritating things of all. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only movie that has ever shown a Nazi Carjacker ...
