That could have been a good biography, but what a mess! I had this movie when I was a theater manager. When I put the film together and looked at it, I thought I had some rolls out of service. As it turned out, I did not do it, and if I did, nobody would have noticed. I could not figure out what's going on! Everyone who went out pretty much felt the same way!
