This show is perhaps one of the most boring and funniest shows I've ever seen. The humor was subtle and I'm all for the subtle humor; The jokes were just not funny. <br /> <br /> The show is about two kiwis living in New York in their mid-thirties trying to start their music career. <br /> <br /> I saw the one episode where Brett leaves the other kiwi during a robbery. Okay, the idea of ​​action has potential. But I felt that half of the episode was just filler and the other half was actually important to the story. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that they kept explaining how the retarded person felt betrayed and had much distrust of the other. I have a piece of advice for the writers: Just mention it for the idiots who do not know how he acts, and move on. <br /> <br /> And I found the characters annoying. The character who left the others behind, Brett, was overly innocent and naive, the left-behind character wandering about in that monotone and robot-voiced voice, talking to him was obviously incompetent, but he was the only character I liked. He is also the one who rated the show with a star. <br /> <br /> All in all, a show I never want to see again.
