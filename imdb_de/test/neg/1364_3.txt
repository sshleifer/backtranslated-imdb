I'm a big fan of horror movies and can always find something good about a picture, but this film did not sustain my interest or attention. This story revolves around a father, his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years ago. These people are facing a terrible situation in a city they are visiting, and all the seniors in this city are attacking and almost killing them. This movie reminded me of a movie entitled "Children of the Corn," because it really concerns children who are presented to Satan and his instruments of terror. There are many songs, Mambo mess and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon, as well as dolls that kill a man and a woman.
