This movie had some fun parts, but for the most part I wanted to switch DVD's and instead watch "Malibu's" that I had in my own collection. At least I would know that something exciting came up and gave me something to look forward to. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very cheap movie. And I can not judge a movie by its budget. It just lacked originality and was too predictable. I would not rent or even watch this movie again, and I'm usually a repeat offender of the movie. The actors were forgotten. The story was half-thought out, and I had an insatiable urge to laugh. I ended up starring at Jamie Kennedy's white boy Gone Gangsta, who was scratching the comedy.
