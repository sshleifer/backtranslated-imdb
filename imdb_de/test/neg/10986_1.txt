This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show that I saw in Vegas six years ago - without the sportiness. By that I mean a few striking, artistically-appearing images that appear random and without supporting frames. The fake sepia movie is really sticky. This device is almost never authorized and certainly not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: You can fool some of the people at times.
