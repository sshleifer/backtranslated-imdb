In 1932 Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown - an unproven actor who starred in one of his first films. And because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie - a fast-paced movie with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why Bogart needed many years AND another movie studio before making a name for himself. Although the movie is not terrible, it's certainly not good - if you see it today, it's more curious than anything else. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. But when an empty rich playgirl approaches, all his dreams seem to stop. As one of the characters in the movie said, the combination of the two is like oil and water - they just do not mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart throws away his promising career, his sister goes full force on the road to Skankville - after meeting a sloppy guy who makes her sleep with rich guys so she can use them for each Shake off a lot of money! Bogey has no idea that his sister is NOT the actress she claims to leave the wealthy woman he loves for the same man he's lover of ... Bogart's SISTER !!! All this leads to a rather enjoyable finale. What follows, however, is one of the dumbest scenes I've seen in a long time! Meanwhile, the rich lady will not marry the man who sleeps with Bogey's sister (Phew!), But because she is poor now and is not good for Bogart, she flies away and kills herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps into the plane as it takes off, and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and rescue it !!! It's so stupid and ridiculous that I had to laugh aloud. By then I might have scored a 4 or 5 - this lowered the movie to a 3 (as a reviewer gave this one 8 is a mystery to me) a talking and stupid movie. Moreover, Bogart's all wrong, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his person, created so wonderfully in the early '40s. Male and solid suits the man better - one of America's greatest actors, but clearly out of his element here. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love pre-code movies and like their very grown-up feelings would like to see this. Virtually everyone in the film believes and practices premarital sex and bogey curses in the film - things you would never have seen after the tighter and more moralistic production order was adopted in 1934.
