For Sci fans, this is better than anything that happens on TV at any given time. That's about the best you can say about it. Good arguments; The repetition and humor are less boring than usual in such films, the plot is coherent and does not use magical mystical revelations. Bad points; The authors try to do good science, but it falls in the direction and production (for example, a drill with superheated rock drills breaks the surface under water, with no bubble or a boiling cauldron visible), the figures are clich√©s and the Action is pretty standard. OK for a too tired evening. But do not expect any major edification or even discussion points.
