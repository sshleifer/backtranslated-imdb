I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I am surprised that someone took it seriously. Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. The only advantage here is that it's so lame it's funny. For me, there is the added benefit of being shot dead in a state park not far from where I live. So it's a shout to see some local sights on the big screen off-duty cop, and it's a great point to teach a good person that self-justice is not just a bad idea, but contrary to the law. Imagine how long that takes ... <br /> <br /> Most Northern California characters in the movie are dehydrated Hollywood cheese balls that look like they've never been in a fight. The story is absolutely predictable. This movie is ready for a MST-3K-Lampooning. Only CAMP value. I generally forgive the films quite a bit, but since I had seen the old positive reviews, I had to comment. This is a dog. I give 3 out of 10 points and then just laugh.
