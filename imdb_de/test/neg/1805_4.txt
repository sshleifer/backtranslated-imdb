In a sense, this movie could not even be compared to the novel. However, it was good to get a picture of what the Congo looked like, and even the natives, if you did not see well while reading. I would never recommend watching the movie instead of reading the book. I can hardly recommend watching this movie, let alone other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others have not fulfilled this book. An important part missing in the film is the feeling of MArlow how the government of shortage formed an early genocide there in Africa. Also in the movie, MArlow and his companions did not stop and got the note and the wood. Similarly, Kurtz 'African lover suggests Marlow towards the end of the story, which has a big impact on the story but was not in the book. In the novel Kurtz died on the ship, however, he died in his hut in the film. The fianc√©'s reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words was also different. This movie is only effective if you want to visualize the novel more clearly.
