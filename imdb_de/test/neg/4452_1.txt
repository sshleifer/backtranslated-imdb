This must be considered as one of the biggest problems of the cinema. I was traveling in Europe at that time and had the misfortune to trip over the crew who filmed this movie in a still idyllic, pristine world of the world. I was hired as an extra and this was followed by an exhibition of modern debauchery. Forget all the accusations you've ever heard of Peter Mayall's interventions in this rare piece of French life - Geoff Reeve and his cohorts, who went to the restaurant of Les Beaux for a hype that made the maitre disbelieving. They were just terrible, uncultivated and undeserved of French hospitality.
