Just take a look. This movie has many things for different people. For Finns, as the comments suggest, it can be all right or awful or boring. For other people it can be something else. First of all, if you do not speak Finnish (I speak) you will understand half of the process because subtitles are terrible and even the title is translated incorrectly ("Paha Maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as Badlands into English English /> <br /> Why I did not like it Because it's a Tarantino-style movie: it just needs a very harsh reality and throws it back as brutally as possible, but I'm not an American, so I like that This procedure does not particularly, because it only shows that the director really has nothing new to say., Technical skill (camera work is brilliant), screenplays (not the Unoriginal) do not save this film from below where it belongs, if you have a Finnish film If you want to watch a movie by the Kaurism√§ki brothers, combine talent and directing skills with very good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director like that No one was understandable and therefore this film failed. If you do not see it, you will not miss much.
