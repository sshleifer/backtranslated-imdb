Surely expected more after seeing the cast list, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think a first director could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler did it does not bother me at all. Somehow the budget allowed them to get one Ensuring crowd of D-List actors who managed to embarrass them for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were just terrible, less Steve Wastell, who does a decent job as Axl. The story is so bad that it really does not have to be mentioned. The overall production value seems normal, with above-average camera work, if you manage to get through the god-fearing "slo-mo" scenes and the painful "person on fire" sequences. I knew it would be stupid, I just had no idea how stupid it is, and unfortunately it's time I can never give back. I suppose if you like really bad "B" movies, this might work for you, but if you value any story, it's just terrible ... A complete waste of time.
