The actors were not credible. The story was really weak, totally sap and completely predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a shame that they no longer focused on the struggle of the Canadian War of Independence. We have seen this love story many times, only with better actors! We had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a little drama! The soundtrack was totally disturbing. The underline hits you with sentimentality over your head. But really over the top. The only thing we thought was OK was that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found the cinematography of the Indian village relatively realistic.
