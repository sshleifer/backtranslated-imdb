I never thought I would get caught saying this: But I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and sets a standard in the genre of "High Octane" -coopshows like CSI, CSI: Miami and so on. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they are not good either. I like the karate-chop action that Walker distributes to the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as well as the science-tech of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Clich√©s / Counter types! Right, stereotypes / counter types! Unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to say goodbye to the old prejudices of the past, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a psychologically minded child ventured to Dallas, where he met a group of children in goth / punk clothing and began to harass him. Now! That's exactly what Central America sees in goth / punk culture. I mean, come on, how often do people smoke and steal clothes, people who just look after their own business? Whenever there are blacks and Latinos in the plot, they are always gangs in an impoverished neighborhood. OK! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs and poverty. The middle red state of America also sees this from these people. Finally, why is the trivia the hobbling buddy, can not you make the buddy an equal butt kicker?
