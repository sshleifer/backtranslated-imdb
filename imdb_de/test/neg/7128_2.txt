All the way, I thought to myself, "Oh god, why!" At the very beginning, I thought, "Right, it could be an average," but the acting and the plot were abhorrent in most places. <br /> <br /> Every part was so predictable, even though the first movie looked a bit like the ring, it was a half decent movie, but that seemed to bring the best of the first and made it terrible , Some pieces made everyone in the audience wet, eg. The part where Geller falls out of the building was sewing me. My friend had to tell me again and again, I should calm down. I kept commenting on what would happen next, and more than less than I was right. <br /> <br /> Why does it take you home when you go to the house? It makes no sense. It was a bad excuse for many murders, and no real depth was seen at all. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that comes, and you just have the feeling that it makes no sense to watch. Oh, she's behind her ... I did not see anyone coming * yawning *. <br /> <br /> These people must have thought ... oh, I do not know, wear a knife or at least try to defend themselves instead of being eaten, but someone's hair? Best during the movie I was a little bit scared (and I mean mild), I just shouted for the credits as they rolled, I exhaled briefly. If you have not done so, do not waste your time and money. pointless, plott less, sorry for a sequel!
