This show should be titled "When Bad Writing Comes to Good Actors," as most players have shown immense talents in other locations, such as: Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Road and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope that the frenetic pace of the show will be adjusted as the series evolves with the obvious clich√©s and dialogue so absurd that I wonder how stupid the writers imagined the core audience. We have been stunned by the main points of this show, rather than gradually discovering what the authors are saying, as if they had to say that the main character is a kind of avenging angel who is himself condemned to salvation from sins, both of them Dead bodies, as well as mortals, about the butt in his taxi leads many affairs. Seeing the premiere of the premiere demanded a great deal of disbelief that Mike Olshanskey's fares would lose its courage so quickly and he felt compelled to intervene in the lives of strangers. That he has these "super cop" abilities to be all things to all humans, weapon expert, martial arts master, psychologist, father confessor, locksmith and so on, ad infinitum. Drivelesque pure imagination. What about the recent television shows in Philadelphia, all of which seem to be filled with a bad ex-wife and a very thoughtful roast kid? Exaggerated. I really wanted to like this show, really, because it had the advantage that the premise was a bit different than many of the clones that appear in this season, and plays some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid this is just a potentially good idea, ruined by careless execution.
