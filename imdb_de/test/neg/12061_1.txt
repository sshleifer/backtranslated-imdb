First of all, as a group of comrades, we often find entertainment in entertainment films that are known to be dreadful for the value of the comedy. So our rental of Camp Blood was the first movie we rented, which had been shot on a camcorder, and it was so shitty that it's not funny at all. The DVD has been returned and a refund has been requested, with the additional suggestion A kind of quality control is being implemented to prevent such garbage from being dammed up. <br /> <br /> Do not do what I did and let curiosity overcome you, it's so bad it's not even funny.
