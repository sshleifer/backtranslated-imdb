Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they are essentially just advanced versions of skits that barely make people laugh in five minutes. "Tommy Boy" is a character from "SNL" - a fat, loveable fool who knows nothing. <br /> <br /> David Spade takes on the role of gratefully overburdened Everyman. He has teamed up with the annoying overweight Slob and they are suffering misery as they travel to Save Daddy's Business across the country. <br /> <br /> The plot for the beginning is really flawed. The whole premise - Daddy dies and richer, stupid son has to save the family business - can be attributed to almost every film you want. Like any SNL style movie, it's reduced to a simple motivation - empty, flat; Only one reason to see a fat and a thin man together "funny". <br /> <br /> The film's biggest "influence" is the 1987 comedy classic "Planes, Trains & Automobiles". This movie is great because the storyline is not outdated and recycled. It's easy, yes - a guy who goes home for Thanksgiving stays hanging out with a slob. But it's real, damn it. It makes the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is a pure slapstick and his ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we do not feel anything for them and we do not care what happens on the screen. "PTA" went the cautious line between outrageous and absolutely believable and proportionate with each other - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd. Jokes like a simple stag in the spotlight will crash, turning into a fight with a dead stag really is not dead, then their car awakens and ruins. <br /> <br /> The whole broken autoding is completely stolen by "PTA" and it's scary how much stuff in this movie actually resembles the Steve Martin / John candy movie. <br /> <br /> Farley is just too rude to be sympathetic - I've never seen him in movies, and that did not change my mind. Spade has little to do and serves as the film's most thankless character. Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie planning to destroy Daddy's business. The ending is a joke and not in a "har-har-witty" way. More like a "Oh God, are you serious ?!" Path. <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, that's cool. But I just can not deal with it, and I do not appreciate all that it "borrows" - not just "PT & A" - without any credit.
