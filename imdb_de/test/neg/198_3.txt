When a friend called me once for my first movie (a pretty bad video recording), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles first movie was indeed worse. He challenged me that it could not be, so I pulled out the Criterion laser disc from (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend only took a few minutes to admit the point. <br /> <br /> In this short text is some humor, but basically he is so presumptuous as (and perhaps a collegial response to) Gardefilme der Zeit. It's what it is: a sequence of images with a vague theme, and if you do not really like Welles footage (in thick make-up), it's not even worth tracking it down.
