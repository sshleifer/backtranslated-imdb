This garbage belongs in the basement of an old, moldy mansion, where he will never again see the light of day. The only scary thing about this garbage was the entrance fee. I was just amused when the credits started to roll and I could leave the auditorium. What a pristine hole; a complete drop of one and a half hours. When I die, I pray that I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the idiot who wrote this gibberish.
