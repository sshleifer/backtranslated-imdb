When a loser teenager is bitten by an insect, he becomes superhero Dragonfly ... <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie is the latest parody movie that hits the screens. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved in the films "Airplane !, Top Secret" and "The Naked Gun"), it still suffers from the error of the last parodies ... mainly it's more stupid than funny! The error is mainly in the gags. It's just not funny enough. Some jokes work, such as the nail gun, but other parts just fall to the ground. For example, the X-Men parody or the entire Furzfolge. Flaming saddle is not that! One of the most important things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane, is that while the dialogue is extremely funny, the cast is for the most part absolutely straightforward. That makes it even funnier. Even if simple dialogues are in the foreground, fun things can happen behind the cast. Funny again. The other important thing is that they all have some kind of conspiracy to hang up the gags. <br /> <br /> The current trend seems to be to shoot scenes from different films THEN then try and deceive them. As a result there is a so-called action of these films very seldom. Another flaw of these films is that some of the scenes in the original versions were actually funny and in most cases even funnier than the parody scene! The performers try to achieve the required spirit, but with many inglorious dialogues and scenes, it is difficult to work it out. <br /> <br /> As current Spoof movies are going on, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie or the horrible Meet The Spartans, but considering that some of those involved here have made good, funny films this is far from good enough.
