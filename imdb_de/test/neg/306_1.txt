"Fat Girls" is one of the worst movies in the Indian gay genre. <br /> <br /> The premise is promising: An average-looking gay teenager is trapped in a repressive small town in TX. His only kindred spirits are the other village HS outsiders: the "fat girl" of the class, a naïve immigrant from Cuba, and the sensitive acting teacher. Interesting so far. In theory, this plot provides a decent framework for an appealing coming-of-age story with a built-in audience - the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and immediately witnessed this youthful fear. Self-deprecating humor. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Ash Christian does not approach a differentiated Dramedy, but his autobiographical subject with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of unlikely, distracted, two-dimensional characters that the viewer can not help but feel indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) is a kind of gothic bitter navel gazer. She is such a spiky, unsympathetic person. There is little doubt about the reason for her friendly state. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. It may have been a bad casting, but it's more of a script that just can not be saved. One wonders then, when there is such a non-existent bond, which could possibly justify their almost constant camaraderie throughout history. Sabrina's new boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus) and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker), is one of the most exaggerated of the cliché stock characters that have been demolished by dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant / nerd who is lifted straight out of any slippery adolescent "comedy" ever made on television or in the movies. Judy is the born again, obsessed with Jesus talks and big hair. Just when you thought the thing about Tammy Faye had been killed, Christian inserts a scene where Judy's mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who may think that this tired old stereotype gag is strange after 20 years ad? <br /> <br /> In addition to the failed attempts of sardonic humor, there are many mystery inconsistencies in the story. Rodney considers himself a "fat ugly" loser. At the same time, however, he succeeds in participating in occasional and regular improvised trysts with the ubiquitous Jock / Hunk Ted (Miller). Although these relationships do not experience emotional fulfillment, most gay teenagers (who, like testosterone brothers, are filled with angry testosterone) would find this more enviable in the face of the more generalized alternative of involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Despite all credible contradictions, the guy lands not only in this small hamlet in TX, but is also openly gay. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an icy, angry smartass, and the viewer scratches his magnetic attraction. <br /> <br /> To his delight, Rodney is being invited by his new crush to the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. When he arrives, his future boyfriend leaves Rodney alone and heads to another area of ​​the bar to meet a handsome young man. This is another of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements, since Rodney's feeling as an outsider probably stems largely from his lonely existence in a parish. As small as the city is, do you openly have gay students in high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian mothers? A gay teacher and it has a gay bar in the city center (recommended by attractive men, not less)? Apparently the place is not such a backwater. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, Todd Stephens's "Edge of Seventeen" treated almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching and humorous film.
