I do not understand why everyone loves this movie so much. It has good intentions and meaning, but you can not compensate for such a bad script. Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker, but I'm afraid that's just garbage. It is extremely predictable and the subject is all too visible. I happen to be a big fan of Woody Allan and love most of the work, but I can not recommend that.
