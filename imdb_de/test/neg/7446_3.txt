I recently bought all three Robocop movies in a box set, and pretty cheap. The only reason I did that was the special edition of the excellent first movie. I have not seen Robocop 2 for 17 years. I have not seen it since, because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how horrible it really is. It really is a complete mess, it has all the signs of a disturbed production with so many plots of land going on at the same time. It also has a very irregular tone and it is also one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have nothing against a little violence, the first was incredibly violent, but this is just uncomfortable. Even the SFX is horrible even for 1990, say hello to bad stop movements. Even having a drug dealing, cursing a child as a villain is just too much. At least Peter Weller had common sense not to return to the next one. The only positive thing I can say for this film is that it has some nice gags, like thank you for not smoking, and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electronics store. To quote the child who plays the villain "It sucks"
