I just saw this movie at the Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As far as the story goes. Even girlfriends return from their Mexico vacation back. While they wait for their luggage, they meet some guys, who then take the last and of course wrong shuttle bus into the city. On board is also another older man, shown so funny that you immediately guess that he is one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The shuttle takes them to the industrial wasteland, and then one by one, a bit of blood, a part of the extremities, part of the violence, usually with the fear of the girl, comes to an end a few highs and lows, Heres and there are some not too new spooky moments, all but the driver and the girls are dead. The girls end up in a garage in which one of them is killed after confessing that she is with slept the friend of the other friend. The other girl, according to the conclusion, is sold by the surviving kidnapper (yep, weirdo was killed) in a cargo box to Asia (a cargo port is the last picture). History. Tons of loopholes, questions you ask, loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. I can not see how such an unprofessional loony should have kidnapped dozens of women (as evidenced by a drawer full of driving licenses ... aha) Secondly. Acting. Mediocre at its best. <br /> <br /> Third. Fear factor. OK. but i'm being drilled by torture as means to nothing but yourself. Trafficking could be a good reason for a horror movie, but it's not just used as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, music and sound. Some nice attempts, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, the warehouse garage and the truck sounds were not really explored. Music? Would have been worse without it, but otherwise. A pseudo moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination. OK, I think. <br /> <br /> Verdict: AVOID IT!
