I have seen earlier films by Cédric Klapisch and therefore expected a quality film with psychological depth. I was an Erasmus student myself and visited several friends studying abroad. I know very well what it means to spend time abroad while mixing with different cultures. Yes, it's fun! That's why I thought I should not miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover that L'Auberge Espagnol is unsatisfactory in many ways: the characters are stereotypical, the events are banal and the story is shallow. Although there are some familiar situations, they are irritating clichés and do not go beyond the banal events. This made the movie unattractive to watch, and gave me a strong "done-done-the-not-has-you-have-nothing-to-add" feature? Feeling. Apart from that, the film lacks a solid history. Sometimes it looks more like a documentary or a "real" show than a seriously made movie. <br /> <br /> However, I can imagine that it is fun if you have not studied or traveled abroad.
