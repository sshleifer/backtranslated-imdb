I was so disappointed with this movie. The slogan was something like "The story of a girl's sexual awakening". You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen then and took my girlfriend to see it. I thought we would see a sexy movie in which my girlfriend would fall in love. Unfortunately that was not the case. I guess we were just not ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required a certain sophistication that we simply did not have at the time. I am not so sure that I own it now, and I have long since parted with this special friend (a pity ... my first love). We left the movie halfway, and my friend, who should have known better, stayed the whole thing. I still had the desired result with my girlfriend, the film just did not help much. It would be interesting to see it again, so that I can make a more informed criticism, although I believe that the experience has drawn me for life.
