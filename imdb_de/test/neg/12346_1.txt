A friend and I watched this movie. We have different views on Fujimori, but after seeing this movie, we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to report on a foreign country where you were not present when the events took place, no matter how talented or how talented you invested in the movie. If you really want to know something about the history of another country, look at something that has been done by locals in that country. Otherwise, you can not move away from your bladder. And those who try to force their views and opinions about something they do not belong to really abuse their power. To make matters worse, the director decided not to talk about the CIA's embarrassing involvement in Fujimori's regime. She decides to avoid dealing with the single issue for which her country has much to explain to the Peruvians. However, this is not surprising as both the director and the CIA are violating Peru's sovereignty by trying to influence democratic processes at very different levels. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in helping Peru, she would have funded a Native American to make the documentary. In any case, there are numerous Peruvian documentaries, films and books on the subject. These include "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero" etc. The director of the "Falls of Fujimori" should spend them time, to analyze the numerous problems in their own country, or at least the involvement of their country in the affairs of other nations.
