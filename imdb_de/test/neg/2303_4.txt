The HBO version of Lumumba is incomprehensible and is a catastrophic representation of what once looked like a decent movie. Some scenes simply do not make sense in English and the actors bring their voice to zero energy. Add the self-censorship of CIA agent Frank Carlucci, and you have a movie that has lost both drama and power. I hope the subtitle version eventually comes to American TV screens.
