If you suffer from insomnia, Radiant is the best way to send you into a 7 year old coma. The film is so absurd and banal that it is hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could overlook this obvious boredom. History has taken a banished doctor (whom we never see) into the desert to create a vaccine that cures all diseases by filling the hosts with antibodies that can fight infection (yes, just like this episode of Futurama ). The vaccines do not work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> As the headmasters in masks do not want to bring the group head into the desert to cover themselves, hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus. All this is narrated by Michael, the only quartet immune to the infection. And it's the most boring tale ever. You could have cast someone with an interesting voice, instead we get someone with a less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the publisher insists on blanking out more than half of the movie and giving it a movie strange, dreamlike feeling and heightens the audience's desire to go to sleep. It's no surprise that half of the audience came out, for some reason I was not one of them. But I should damn well have it. <br /> <br /> The ending should be shocking and smart and foresighted. But it's just not. A relief, but not the least dramatic. <br /> <br /> The absolute cheapness of this production and the subdued sound that obscures many of the dialogues makes a confusing cripple of better actors, cooler places and a sense of urgency. Radiant is a snooze party.
