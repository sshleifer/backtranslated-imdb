What about Scream? Baby Scream should not make me feel like an idiot when I buy it? I bought it because, God help me, I'm a fan of the old B-Cinema, even if it's so worthless. Anyway, something about this movie teases me, it's probably Janet, Janet is cold and lost, seemingly intent on seeming so deep and noble, with an expression on her face that screams constipation, she does not seem to agree with anything, what her excited friend wants. I am glad that this is her only role. What really bothers me is that this is a 1960s gore movie that went horribly wrong. It's as if the director started with a Herschell Lewis style, but when he learned about his wife, he ended up in the breakneck scenes, leaving instead one boring conversation after another and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing bring. In other words, we land at Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Janet's friend, Jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this guy has something negative to say about everything. Come on, he's probably the least sympathetic goodie in horror history. The only thing that really promises this movie is that it wears the '60s / early' 70s B-Gore vibe that you can find in things like Undertaker & his friends, Blood Freak, or almost anything from Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of The Greesome Twosome is in this case. I thought his caveman comedy routine was irritating. Most role to role is stupid, even the trip scene was stupid. The only positive is the small amount of beach landscapes, but this usually includes that Janet has to moan that life is not perfect. In the only ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting once the story begins around the 45 minutes. If you are indifferent to whether your conversation can be viewed or not, but the color is offensive red, you can not hate this. Why is Troma distributing it? Would not that be something unusual video? Scream Baby Scream may well be the worst scare in Florida, but the potential lies among the unlikely characters and the incoherent plot. Scream, Baby, Scream really just seems like it should follow the Blood Feast pattern, so to get a quote from Janet: "If it does not fit, I'll throw it out." 2.10
