This story had the potential of a good movie. The difficult choice between love and money and the fear and regret of finding the wrong one. However, the film was ruined by the terrible abuse of Robert Redford as a villain offering $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. Just as Redford has to pay for it. Redford's boyish good looks and all-American charm simply do not make him seem threateningly unlikely. Redford's acting skills are not enough to threaten his character. I can see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK, the lady says, but you have to give me some time to raise the money. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect as a sleazeball.
