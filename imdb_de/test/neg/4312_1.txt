This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and certainly the worst that Nagesh Kuknoor has done. I can not believe that a person who made a movie like Teen Deewarein can do all this crap. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film itself is truly flawed that Zeenat Meera must search and her leniency to help her husband to avoid the death penalty in Soudi Arabia. The general logic is that if Zeenat Meera can not easily search this is not done by the Soudi government, so that Zeenat Meera's signature or thumbprint can be faked and produced before the Soudis. Another thing is that Shankar gave an incorrect address in his passport. Therefore, Indian government officials can not find the address, but eventually gets Meera Shankars suitcase by the government of Soudi. Impressive! Does not Soudis in India network better than Indians? <br /> <br /> Nagya makes a little more than a cameo appearance in the movie with Chopra watching Meera and looking for Meera's father-in-law. Girish Karnaad (this guy is just wasted) helps to get her as a fortress. <br /> <br/> Nagya does not speak Hindi and has been assisted by other people in translating the English dialogues he writes in Hindi. This time it seems his colleague has been in a heavy intoxication writing dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (Honesty Jump). In a few minutes to our worst nightmares Meera not only makes this honest jump, she taps her feet to make "Imaan ka Naach" (dance of honesty) his cinematography and really beautiful colors. But since Bollywood has learned the post production name, almost all movies have bright colors and beautifully mixed backgrounds, so no big deal. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Creating a cheesy movie is not on Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and everyone is ready to get hit.
