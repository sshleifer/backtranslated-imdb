I really wanted to have this movie, but it hardly spawned a 3. It is surprising that the votes were 10, the other half 1. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and sympathetic (he even resembles Marc Anthony physically in a more approachable but ultimately conscious manner ...), but even he could not save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on for far too long and points were eventually beaten to death. The banana scene was marked by selfishness and apparently showed how much movement was in his boxers. But in his defense, it was his first movie as a director (I know that) and I appreciate his love. It just left me empty, in spite of everything I wanted to say. Ultimately, I think the story would have been better treated by a more experienced director. After what I have seen of the "extras", there is a true story behind it and maybe I appreciate that attempt more when I have finished it.
