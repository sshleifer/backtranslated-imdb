This shows just how awful the WB network has been in the last few years of its existence. As a homeschooler, of course, because of their ridiculous fantasyland, obscure and inglorious stereotypes, I complain that the children are "weird hippies so clever that they are alienated from the super-cool high school students." I'm sorry, TV writers, the world being looked at from your butt (with their heads apparently, when you've written this show) is NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes while we live in a little thing which is called reality. For those who really liked this show ... please, dear sweet Jesus PLEASE rethink the statement that you really liked this crap on a very long walk. The spectacle is even hollower, more false and wooden than the stereotypes around which the whole show was built. Thank you, WB, for doing the right thing and getting that horse out of his misery. This show should never have been given the privilege of being made, no less than eight horrible episodes. I really hope that these actors got a hint sometime and stopped playing in garbage TV shows like this once this show ends.
