It may be unfair for me to comment on this film because it was the first time I turned off a movie because it was so bad. I can see everything, but this movie was so boring. I was bored before hanging up the DVD and thought this might be a ridiculous action horror / action movie to lighten the mood. It's not even that, it's a device that increases boredom by 100. Had to switch it off after 45 minutes, because all that had happened then was that some people were diving and a big mole had been discovered. Seriously, this movie is not worth the time, even if you can enjoy a bad movie like me, avoid this movie like the plague. What I have seen for years.
