I wish that all mockumentaries and horror parodies would disappear. If you want to investigate Loch Ness ... really do it. Enough of the bull ****. The same goes for horror and sci-fi. If you're going to make a movie, this should be scary. Make it scary ... not funny. I hate it when I watch a horror movie and the character is fighting for their lives (or running or whatever ... their lives are at stake) and they're kidding. That never happens ... where are all the good directors going? I think horror and sci-fi have really gone down the tube since the 70s. I long for the days when a horror movie was scary. The crap is all for the birds. This movie is also for the birds. If you really want to see a good investigation or a serious conversation here, do not expect this in this video.
