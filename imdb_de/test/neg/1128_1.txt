This must be the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is funny as a supporting actor in the original, but not as a leading actor. Too much Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, the supporting actor wore the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He is the Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! How is it that after all these years Snots still looks the same and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older? I do not think I laughed after 15 minutes of this movie. The island thing just did not work. Without the handsome South Pacific guide on the island, the movie would have been a total loss. I sat for a week in this review and yes, I still think that the movie should never have been made. Let's hope that there is no THIRD one! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
