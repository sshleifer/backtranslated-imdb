I am amazed at the most important comments on this OK-Surffilm. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school of Barnyard to beach antics and is not really plausible. The idea that the main kid should learn to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that it beats the real surfers in their game in the real ocean is just stupid. In Australia, where most teenagers surf in the city, this movie was laughed at by the audience and shot with a grain of sea salt. Made in the 80's, but with its heart in the 60's, it's fun to watch and looks good, but it sounds good, but it's not classic at all. Even the actors did not survive this. We are seriously into LIQUID BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANKET BINGO here. Oz stars like Occy and BIG Wednesday-hero, Gerry Lopez, are drafted to appreciate the farmboy's punch, but it only makes the crowd laugh in the movies. It's for 10-year-olds who do not question much. It's not even IN GODS HANDS and that was stupid too.
