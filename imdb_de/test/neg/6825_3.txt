When I reported on these events, which took place a few years ago (hard to believe that this actually happened), I thought: well, there is a basis for an interesting story. Many secrets have never been uncovered, the horse never found, the main conspirators never caught, etc. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to be distracted by character studies, and little attention is paid to the plot. However, some other questions are raised, for example, why should Mickey Rourke be in this film? It is good to see that Rourkes career has increased again, but he must scare at the mention of this garbage. <br /> <br /> If the topic interests you, do an internet search on the subject, you will be more Educated and dare I say more entertaining. Avoid that.
