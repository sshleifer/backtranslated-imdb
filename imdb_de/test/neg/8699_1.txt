The reason why this movie is shit, did these people even read a Bible? Everything in the movie was about Moses, God stayed outside. THAT IS NOT PASSED! God guided everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Humans also wandered for 40 years after arriving in Canan and betraying God again! They did not wander about for 40 years and suddenly found it. It was a punishment for her doubts. If the people who made the film first took a bible in their hands, they would say we misunderstood it. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like an idiot who worked with Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God was with them all the time and he wanted people to see that he took care of them. How dare they say, not even near the passage. And Moses was kept away because he was mad at the people and obviously disobedient to God! He sinned badly and was told he could not speak out. When did Mosen run off and shouted at God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! Read your story before you come up with something you think is a good idea. Also, this whole God stayed out of him for the most part and let her do it herself, is not true !!! God did everything for the people, he cared for them in every way and God told them where to go. He was there the whole time. The whole thing we have to do ourselves is true in some ways, but it did not work then! Yes, today he does not work directly for everyone, but then he actually killed people after the golden calf! God worked directly with the people. Read the Bible next time Echo Bridge or do not make another Bible film!
