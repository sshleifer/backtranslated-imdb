In summary, my friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater to share our favorite gaffes, reveal inconsistencies, loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of the movie. I found the story so banal that the storylines were underdeveloped while the Dino embryos were still trapped in the Jurassic Park 1 shaving cream jug. The editing was bad and none of the characters generated any kind of sympathy or emotion. In short, this film lacked the thrill and thrill of the first film in terms of history. Even the new dinosaurs were rare (although I really enjoyed the pterodactyl.) We got several short shots of the new kind and only two were really involved in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former paleontologist in childhood, the absence of any genuine scientific content (not necessarily realistic, but logical) that is, how they built the Dinos in # 1 and Malcom's Chaos Walks) was disappointing. <br/> <br/> In short, the movie seemed like an excuse to get Dinos back on stage for some money. I hope the moviegoers will not fall into this trap again (though I seem to have)
