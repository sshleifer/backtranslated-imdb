I'm not a big fan of musicals, though this is technically not qualifying as a musical. But I thought I would give him a chance because I love war movies. It was mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Hudson seems completely out of whack in this role. It just did not work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as best she could, but I find it hard to buy her as a fraudulent, fraudulent spy. Sorry, I know that this is classic stereotyping. But I have to say, I think that's Julie from her most beautiful and feminine side. I always thought of her as a matron, but that is surely the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of this typography in this role. She was pretty seductive, but I still did not buy her as a spy. <br /> <br /> I could not concentrate during the entire movie and found myself switching on and off and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - I always let everyone shut up). So that tells you how little my attention is focused on me. Do not waste your time!
