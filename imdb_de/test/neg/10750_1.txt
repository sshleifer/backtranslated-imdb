Some people found this funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this article. However, I'm so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I can not stand propaganda from both sides. I had hoped for a horror show, but got "cute" zombies and partisan bulls. I see how my horror movies are scared. This did not even try to be scary. Nor does this have the joke of Romero's political / cultural satire in his films ... This was a blatant, fantasy-free story that I found hard to bear (for wrong reasons). On the positive side, if you hate Bush ... you'll love that (I hate hate or Bush with that statement)
