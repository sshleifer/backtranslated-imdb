Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson perform well in this detective strip with Southern / New Orleans accents. It is worth seeing for their scenes and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors make it interesting for us, no matter what the movie looks like. The plot of the movie shows potential, but you get the impression when watching the movie that it was not pulled as well as it could have been. The fact that it is littered with a rather uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers messes things up. The film is worth a visit - if nothing more than entertaining performances by Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
