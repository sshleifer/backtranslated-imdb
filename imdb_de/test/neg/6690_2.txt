The first two Bring It On movies were pretty good in their own way. The first was pretty serious, the second satirically succesful - and the third chose the usual idiotic low-braow comedy we always see in the mindless teenage movies Hollywood gets out of the woodwork. The whole point of this movie was that cheerleaders are airheads barely knowing enough to have a conversation together, and that's the extent of the comedy in this movie. Ha ha. Not. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is no hint of wisdom, no subject, no subtext, nothing for someone with half a brain to talk about (and of course I could not stand it all). If you are the kind of person who is entertained by fart jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points.
