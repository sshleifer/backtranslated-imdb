This movie stinks of production line planning. It seems like the filmmakers are watching the last successful movies and throwing spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony man! Baseball! War! Infant! Plane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film is about the age of the actors of Stewart / Allyson; However, I am sure that we should still think that they are much younger. <br /> <br /> There are news in "Strategic Air Command" that I found strangely shocking and offensive, but I stick with a really wretched human element: the happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character is an important one Decision made without consulting his wife. In the most dramatic scene of the film, she calls him to do so. It ends completely unresolved - Allyson cries on her bed and Stewart goes out to her. No discussion; He just says he's right and goes out to his devastated wife. As far as he knows, she could slit her wrists. Later, Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision. Incredible! <br /> <br /> Stay with Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann - James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
