This movie is ridiculous. It's trying to be a comedy, but the script is terrible. The whole movie is shot in low light and you can not understand that it's a comedy. Really is bad cinema. You really have to sit there and watch to see that there are a few jokes here and there, but either way, they are all in jokes. This is more of a wannabe drama that went bad. It really is a very senseless movie. Her comments show nothing but consternation and disaster, which turns out anyway. If you do not want to be bored out of your ass, I suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.
