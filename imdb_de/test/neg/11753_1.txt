Hitchcock's original classic not only benefited enormously from the performance, but also from the "look" of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clean innocence: a young personality of the teen idol. He was not an actor who had previously portrayed villains; He was also not physically fit for the role that the public would have expected from a psychopath, especially in the 1950s, when this extremely deterrent aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) in the film was relatively unexplored. That's why the casting as Norman Bates was a piece of true Hitchcockian genius. The audience was surprised, to say the least. <br /> <br /> For this reason, this rebuild does not work, even if it tries to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you would never see as a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily conceivable as one. He lacks Perkins' faint look, and his acting strokes are far inferior, at least in that role (honestly - has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as authentically as Anthony Perkins?). While it was initially a meaningless remake, the abuse of the main character of the story completely sucks this movie down. <br /> <br /> As a side note, I feel that Hollywood's propensity to make great movies is new because "young" people refuse to see something that is not filmed in color, and it does not just stink in the movies Heaven of business greed, but invariably disrespects the original work. For spectators who can not see black and white - it's their loss. Hopefully they will mature sometime in the future and no longer need shiny colors to keep their attention. If so, they will find that black and white sometimes works better. When the background is muted, the story and the performances are all the more forward and central. In many cases, the mood or atmosphere in color created by black and white cinematography is simply unattainable.
