And I am afraid that I can not imagine why. It's really a really dreadful and exceptionally boring movie. In a way, it's reminiscent of early science fiction, as every set on a Hollywood back-lot had been thrown out of it. From the tiny and unconvincing set (the snipers seem to be about ten yards away), apparently made of plaster, to the actors, which are obviously made of gypsum with "amusing" stereotypes painted thin on the top, to the point of unusual warm pool in a frozen cave To survive the occupation uninjured, when medium-sized artillery shells burst open ground a few meters away, and finally the terrible script that reads like a training manual more than a movie ... I really can not say how boring that is. Even the opportunity to see if the young James Dean survived was not enough to watch me for more than an hour. This is really to avoid all costs.
