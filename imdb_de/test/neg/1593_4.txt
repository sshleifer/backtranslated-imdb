I guess I've been prepared after all the years I've heard about it. Heard for the first time by Siskel and Ebert. When they said that Divine had eaten excrements, I had to look. Then in 1991 a friend told me about it. She also said that her parents saw it when it came out and that her mother almost threw her dad over it! When I caught Pink Flamingos today at Sundance Pink, I was prepared. Mostly. <br /> <br /> I could still be surprised by the anal closeups and the blowjob scene. The only characters I sympathized with were Edie and the Eiermann. Her crying scene at the beginning of the movie makes me sad, although she is a bit frivolous to normal people. Although she was certainly not pretty, she had a cute voice. I was happy for her and the Eiermann, and they actually touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, action in this production at poverty level was not good. And how does the script come about, how does John Waters come up with this stuff? Well, at least it is different.
