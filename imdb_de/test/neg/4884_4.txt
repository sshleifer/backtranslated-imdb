Very interesting to find another reviewer who had the same reaction to this movie as me: It was a lot better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> More Than 30 Years Later it's still alright, but it kept my interest low. What seemed incredibly funny at the time was mildly amusing. <br /> <br /> Even things that astonish me as a ten-year-old were just stupid. For example, Trinity walks in a scene and shoots his revolver behind him, killing two men without even looking. In fact, he does not even bother to see if they're dead because he knows he hit the mark. Um, yes, right. <br /> <br /> In addition, many dialogues sound pretty wooden. I'm sorry, but 35 years later, it has not really aged. <br /> <br /> Although it's been a long time since I saw it, it's probably a better Terrence Hill movie than this one is my name.
