No, just no. That's all that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> Summary: A random guy is in a cornfield. For some reason, I'm not sure, but it's his duty to walk around. The next big thriller? <br /> <br /> A five-year-old could make a better movie by filming an anthill or just growing grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> One can not say that it is bad action because there is NO action. It can not be said that it has written badly because it has NO letter. You can not say that it has a bad camera because there is NO camera. You can not say it's a bad movie BECAUSE IT IS NOT FILM! If you do not believe me, look at it. Just do not say that I never warned you ...
