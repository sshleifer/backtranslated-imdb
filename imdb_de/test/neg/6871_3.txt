And in my opinion only one. <br /> <br /> This is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, both on stage and on the screen. However, we have few chances to see them. I think that's especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here she plays a sympathetic role. Not only that, she is also very pretty and should be something of a bomb. Walter Pigeon does not uphold the tradition of Drummond artists. He is always reliable, but not fun. He is not a rascal or a rogue. As a result, this seemed to me an intrusive venture with little action or excitement. But look at it for Leighton.
