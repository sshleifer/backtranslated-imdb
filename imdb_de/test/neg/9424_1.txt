This movie is a lot of crap. It is quite disturbing to see that everyone can say that this is one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Bad drama, bad action scenes that are really funny in the end. Excuse me, if this was a comedy, then I did not understand it. If so, I regret laughing at the tent scenes! Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of looking at it. Good night!
