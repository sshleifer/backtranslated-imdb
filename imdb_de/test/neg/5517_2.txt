If there were an EPA for the film, this film would receive its most sincere approval. If we had recycled all of our "stuff" to that degree, we would never have had enough. <br /> <br /> Funny, as I was reminded of this movie when I saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace for the first time. At least Lucas did not recycle his old footage. <br /> <br /> This is a dudel. But it is a nice guy. Sweet in spots (I liked it when the kid said "damn stones"). And if you like explosions (even recycled), you'll be full. <br /> <br /> It's pretty good for a no-budget movie. Acting is weak, but here and there there is a small characterization. The story is predictable but will continue to guide you. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that "all chases the kid", which is likely to appeal to younger audiences in particular. I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> I dug up my old VHS copy of this movie. I do not think it is on DVD.
