OK, what was this story about again? I'm afraid I never read the book, and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies I've tried to watch for a long time. I am a bit confused about the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man without a thumb. The movie did not even explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all came together. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie "Pride and Prejudice" with Colin Firth recently, I tried to see a study of his movie career on Other Movies about him, bluntly, except "What a Girl Wants, "I do not find much where he played. I definitely do not say that he was not good. He's really one of the best actors I've seen in the modern movie, but the content and quality of the movies he plays in leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is another perfect example where the director, the author and the crew are too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer does not get the picture? literally. The whole movie seemed to present Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long, boring emotions. Nothing is really explained, and each of the subjects seems to need a psychoanalytic assessment right from the start! <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott Thomas' character seems to love to describe erotic stories that stand in front of a completely male audience tickling other men as her husband. Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his marbles and is supposed to be a secret agent? I guess; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows everything. The rest of the cast is thrown to the four winds as the action continues. <br /> <br /> The subplot of mental nurse (Juliette Binoche) mentality and her motivations and commitment to Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that gives the viewer a tasteless taste. Of course, the audience is still wondering how the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) had sex for the first time in the world anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no accumulation. Just a beat, bam, thanks! <br /> <br /> And is not it romantic that Fiennes has found a traitor who helps Germans make maps in the desert? (Sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this film, I would simply have to say, "How can I impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, adorable husband who loves you." <br /> <br /> The last unbelievable part of this conspiracy is figuring out how someone Ralph Fiennes would decide on Colin Firth. Firth had little opportunity to prove his acting talents? When I saw the movie, I thought it must have been one of his first. The scene in which he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only second film worth watching in the movie. I have no interest in seeing it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth tries to get them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes even more fruitless film. Aerial desert scenes, however, were pretty neat.
