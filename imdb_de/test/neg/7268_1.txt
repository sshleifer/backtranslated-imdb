What the hell is that!? That was my first reaction to this movie (in fact, my first reaction had more swearing). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars is space battles, this movie has none. Star Wars is the power, this movie has only a backward witch with a magic ring. Star Wars is lightsaber fights, this movie has no significant battle. Star Wars is humor, not this movie. Star Wars is a galaxy far away, this movie contains HORSES !!! And how did Lucas come up with the crazy idea of ​​having a five-year-old baby lead the way? Big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Do not look at 1 in 10
