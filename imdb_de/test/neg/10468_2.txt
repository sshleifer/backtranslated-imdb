With the exception of the fine shelf on Clara Evans ... this show was pretty bad ... why did I look at it? Too much coffee and had to relax before he hit the bag. Watching BB turn into his lame Big Chief outfit was amusing at best, almost ridiculous in the worst case. Boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me and he looks more and more like the scarecrow the television series of the early 1980s. The women first have to go to drama school. Although Evans size is 40 and a 17-year-old plays (she was in her early 20s, was a stretch) ... the sci-fi channel has done better ... but for us people who do not come to the bars I think we have to take everything we can get ... after all, all is a good thing, which brings CNN, MSNBC and Fox over to the election of choice in 2008.
