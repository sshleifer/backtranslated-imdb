OK, that's a strange movie! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques that director George Barry uses, such as: B. Stock footage and cheesy voices. He can turn the wall into a plotter! There is more humor than horror, but I found it a mixed mix. They'll laugh and cry and probably wonder why they got their hands on this. Barry explains in the introduction that the film was shot in 1972 and completed in 1977 for $ 10,000. That's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you like your cheese on the camping side with the 'Gore' of the 70s, you may find an irresistible and funky snack.
