I love the boat. I was hoping for something similar - a realistic war movie depicting soldiers and civilians on both sides as real people, with both the joy and the pain of struggle. Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to have been written by a third student and a fifth grade student. Essential parts of the movie just seem to disappear, making it totally disconnected. The dialogue in the translation is ridiculous, but it does not seem any better in the mother tongue; You just have to watch the faces of the actors in the bad moments of dialogue to see how bad this movie is.
