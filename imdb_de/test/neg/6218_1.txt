I avoided watching the movie in the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Christmas. I had to look at it. I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I expected. But 'Mamma Mia' - outwardly, outwardly cr **. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this movie is just awful. The stage show looks a bit like a musical, but these races run with successive songs, no characterization, the dance numbers (which according to the extras on the DVD were heavily choreographed) are thrown away with only half of the body, the dance choirs always appear on the screen Northern Europeans at will on a small Greek island, while putting up and setting up numbers would dishonor Cliff Richards musicals in the sixties! Do their usual robbery in an outstanding musical! Her great piece - "The winner takes everything" - is Meryl in the Met! Note to the director - it should have been recorded in silence, with the distance between Streep and Brosnan gradually increasing! Part of the vocals is terrible karaoke in the amateur night. The camera can not be like a bad MTV. You can never settle down and just enjoy the music, the enthusiasm and the characters. But what's even worse, how this miserable piece of Exre **** has become the UK's best-selling movie and the best-selling DVD? Blair, Campbell, and New Labor have really reduced the UK to zombies - critical abilities everyone?
