I have just seen the last movie by Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy and here in the States known as Utopia-on Internet Archive, which expects some additional material, since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that this is basically the same version I saw earlier on the Goodtimes Home Video VHS cassette, which ran for an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of the Welch's Grape Juice label, though) a bottle was shown). The rest of the term is devoted to the dark empty room. Stan looks like he's going to die soon, but he's still doing a good physical comedy with Ollie for the first 45 minutes. Then the act of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a landless man on board - not to mention a charming French singer who also comes to an unexplored island on which they all land - with all sorts of complications that the Comedy pretty much clogs up and never really recovers, though Ollie said to Stan one last time, "Here's another nice mess you put me in!" before Stan cries uncontrollably before disappearing. In other words, if you're a die-hard Laurel and Hardy fan, you should watch this movie at least once. Anyone who wants to familiarize himself with this classic comedy team should look for his previous work for Hal Roach from the 1920s to 1940, when he completed his last Roach film, Saps at Sea. Come to think about it, even some of the L & H Fox flicks (which the two who made them for MGM have not seen yet) from the '40s are better than this one here ... Update-8/29 / 09: Just some missing scenes that appeared on the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and talks to the captain. In another, the captain's wife Cherie draws a weapon. Giovanni explains again why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is synchronized here in high pitch!
