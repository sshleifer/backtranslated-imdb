The most worthless movie of the decade. Those responsible should never film again. I can not describe the lack of entertainment in this film. You could not pay me to watch this movie again. Honestly, I think I would be a better person if I had not seen it. If I called it offensive, I would fall into a category of emotionally weak extremists. I would say this movie goes so far as to damage the industry. There are films that I do not want to see, now that I feel like they could be so tasteless. I feel like an idiot that in MANY moments when I was forced to, I did not have the good feeling to go out. Yes, I have seen the end and am ashamed of it, like any other writer. I am awesome ...
