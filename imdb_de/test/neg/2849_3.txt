Awful. Absolutely terribly long, confusing and uninteresting. After about three hours of this painful mess, the end really is the last nail in the coffin. Not even the gorgeous, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this bad adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The action draws and draws and time passes slowly and suddenly you realize that you do not even know what's going on. In the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, is there still much that is inexplicable and then? It is off. A complete waste of time and undoubtedly one of the worst adaptations bearing the name Agatha Christie.
