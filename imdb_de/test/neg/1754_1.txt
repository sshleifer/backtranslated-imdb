Another boring affair with Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on those big bloated super-productions that take two and a half hours to do what any sensible filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The Story Center about Inman (a somnambulist Jude Law) who is going into civil war after having just arrived with Nicole Kidman, a daughter of the Preacher, who has just arrived in the beautifully photographed backwater town Kind of romance started. The story alternates between Inmans exams and suffering in the war (that is, what boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman's exams and problems at home (which are very unbelievably boring, predictably). Renee Zellwegger arrives at Kidman's Farm to help Kidman get it back into shape after Kidman's holy daddy dies of an uncomfortable character illness. Zellwegger's lightning and bossy in this type of grandmother Clampett, and spends so much on Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn even the toughest observer of Touched By An Angel. <br /> <br /> This movie is just agonizing. Avoid it like the big bloated Oscar bait, the Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation.
