Oh Sex Lives of the Potato Men, what nasty demon created you? This is a movie you watch, grinning a little at runtime, and if you tell it to others when you see it, you can not help but smile when you speak. But it's not that Sex Lives of the Potato Men is actually a funny movie that makes you talk when you talk or think about it. It's just that the movie is so bizarre. is so insulting and is not shameless in his attempt to convey a meek laughter about sex and sex life in general, that you just can not help but make your mouth break into a grin. Remember that the grin is a sinking of the head. a consistent shake of the head and a raise of the index finger and thumb on both eyebrows as you gently rub them to remember your time while looking at this garbage. <br /> <br /> But that's the movie. it is garbage; It is very brave and shameless garbage, but still garbage. Anyone who has invented this idea, put it on paper and then spreads it throughout the industry when he tries to make it, must either be very brave or very desperate. It's weird to have a movie that's definitely something that does not have a deciding narrative under any circumstances. This follows from the idea that most of European cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open, and that themes have priority over others. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and the same technical joke are repeated over and over again, and this is an idea that consists of the following: "Sex is a very, very funny thing." These ideas may be more appropriate for an American movie, so it's no wonder things feel a bit uncomfortable after a while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts and ends the same way. to create the feeling of a round trip; A round trip that has gone nowhere and absolutely nothing was achieved. Three guys sit at a table and talk and what not. Their boss joins them, and the conversation is limited to unimaginable and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios that are imaginable. The strange thing here is that when a man says something unpleasant, the other grimace has an equally dirty story he has to give back, which creates a contradiction in what these men cross the border and what they do not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people who have teamed up with Tolly (Coleman) whenever the movie thinks fit to throw a third face to crack some bad sex jokes or some break strange stories. They are occupied by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but where the film is more about exploitation for reasons of humor than learning. <br /> <br /> So what about sex life of potato people? The three to four men are in a crisis, and throughout the movie we'll play the role of the luckless fly on the wall as we witness what a terrible game these guys are doing within a week. If the humor that revolves around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then things are just scary for Jeremy. It all starts pretty innocently and it seems like there's a woman he likes and one who likes him alike, but when the essence of Jeremy is just a stalker, the jaws drop. The character of Jeremy is so used and conveyed that unloved love and stalking generally only "funny" look. Jeremy is sitting in his apartment, listening to classical music and writing abuse letters to Ruth (Davis). He recalls a sort of psychotic personality more associated with Hannibal Lecter when he wrote his letter to Hannibal to Clarice in 2001. Whatever we may have for him at this point is absolutely wrong when the true origin of their relationship reveals later. Suddenly we feel cheated onlookers because we used to regret him as Mitmilch, and for some reason he did what he had done in the first place, just cowardly and disgusting. To say what it was would ruin the few surprises lurking in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very sad, as he writes in one of Jeremy's letters about one or another saying: "No artistic vision?" "just a big mess". I hate it when the words spoken by the characters reflect the movie they are in. Sex Lives of the Potato Men examines neither the psyche of another person nor his special interest in a fetish or why he feels the need to have as much sex as possible. it only uses them as a front to stack on ridiculously nonsense jokes and situations. Instead of taking group sex and exploring what urges a person to find it, it makes a stupid joke (cards with numbers on it?); Instead of going into the mindset of a sadomasochism fan, the movie hangs from someone on a cellar ceiling, warning everyone of 'salt and vinegar' from entering when it reaches its peak. Ferris disguises his face disgusted and the camera fades out easily to the next scene. It is a relief that the film meets no audience abroad. This is part of British culture, in fact the British mentality that I pray is limited to our coasts and ignored accordingly.
