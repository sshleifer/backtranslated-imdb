Franco Nero plays as Cole a Ninja who comes to help his war comrade Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his stray wife (Susan George) to protect them from a gangster (Christopher George) who wants the land. It gets even more complicated when the gangster hires Coles old nemesis (Sho Kosugi), who is also a ninja. Despite the martial arts actioner, though he has better production values ​​than most Ninja films, he brings no life to the environment or, for that reason, action scenes. A bad effort.
