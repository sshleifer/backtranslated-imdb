All I have to say is that this was the third worst movie I've ever seen, right after the assault of the 3 and the Murder Tomato 2 spaceship. It was not just dialogues or the paper walls or even the firearms that automatically disappeared with them Holes in the walls It was the terrible spectacle. No wonder I never saw these actors before they all probably slept with the directors. I think I'm nice to this movie now, but that's just because I'm too tired because I shouted at the movie (just seen). My advice is to buy and burn as many DVDs of this film as possible, so that no one can ever see this terrible waste of time, money and film again.
