I feel stupid after the first 20 minutes. Luckily, I went out and saved the rest of my brain. People should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly, not because of the budget of the film or the special effects. Just good to act and do simple things right, and most importantly it's not to be LAME - but I think this was for the Sheeple without taste and not as a clue of what is: "A good movie" If not afraid of rating movies too low, save your undervalued highscores for "once in a lifetime" movies. Remember that many use IMDb for trusted ratings and opinions. Do not spoil the broth by glossing over Turds Peace & Love
