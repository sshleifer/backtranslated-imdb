This movie was crap. The script is so full of holes. I can not see how the producers have agreed to finance it. <br /> <br /> We never get an explanation for EVERYTHING. The spectacle is terrible. The plot is shit. This movie was obviously written for the 8 and below. <br /> <br /> I have to say this: Why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long? The teacher comes in, finds a frog on the desk or draws on the board, and 30 seconds later the bell rings, the lesson is over. The kids did not even open their books. Can we at least have some continuity? Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the reborn, broken fetus, zombie thing. Do we really need the line "This is Dr. Jeter's office Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the tip; I could never put this together myself. It never gets better. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo start talking the way he does? Was Milo ever 'real'? Or was he never real, just always what he is right now? And if it was always so, why had there been the unexplained "accident" of Milo? <br /> <br /> Apart from "What is Milo?" We see all of these devices in his father's doctor's office and never get an explanation of what they are serving or what they are dealing with in the story. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium apparatus? They are obviously not needed. (Look at the movie, it makes sense). And what does this medicine do to someone? Apparently nothing, because it has no influence on the leading actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very, very bad rip-off of all other Slasher movies. It's a really terrible Friday the 13th / Halloween, which was pulled down by a 10-year-old writer. It's not cheesy enough to laugh about it, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.
