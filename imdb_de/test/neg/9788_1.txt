As a former MST3k observer, this film was also unsurpassable for me. Terrible attempts of humor - terrible acting attempts. No one has to read a harangue about this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> I just like how all the positive reviews were written clearly by cast members or family friends. Just click on the other reviews and you will evaluate all Modern Vampires. Give me a few dollars and I can do a movie better. One of the most incompetent pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen, and that says something. Watch at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
