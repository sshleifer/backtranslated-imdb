This could have been an excellent movie. But how many others do I think. Due to the language transfer this is done badly. When the entire movie has to be read, it takes the movie off and becomes something else. It has an excellent rating for me and I could not wait to rent it. But once I made it, it was a real horror. Here in Boardman, Ohio, I could not find an English version. This film was also compared to Dark Hours and this will not be seen in Boardman, Ohio. It is not available. I think we'll never know how good the movie really was.
