Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors. Director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind 1974's successful Greek Giallo Esquire thriller Death Kiss, and yet, if you combine the three talents, you'll only get this full load of Drivel! God only knows what drove Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to participate in this cheap devil worship movie, but I really hope they got paid well as neither deserve anything amateurish like this in their CVs. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children and make another group persecute them. The tempo of the plot is very slow and makes the movie very boring. The storyline is not far from originality and anyone interested in the horror genre alone will have seen something similar and certainly did much better. The obvious budget deficit is consistently felt and the film can not be overcome at any point. This is really a depressing and miserable watch, and not even a decent ending manages to bring the movie to the front to get this film out of the barrel. Extremely bad stuff and definitely not recommended!
