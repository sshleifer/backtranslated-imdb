'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more a love story between Helen and Paris, shipwrecked and in love with Helen, unaware that she is queen. The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wants nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different depictions of the characters, but in this they are just hopelessly in love.) The movie is pretty slow in some places, but the fights and the details of the scenery are pretty well done. There are also some good services. I thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job and she was one of the most popular characters. Overall, this is a good fit, if you can look beyond the slow history places and look over some of the cheesy romance and dialogue. In my opinion, a perfect Iliad movie version has not yet been created, but it is entertaining and has some good tracks.
