... why look at a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters is sympathetic or even interesting? I can somehow see what the writer David Renwick was aiming for: the wrong turns and the bad surprises of taste he put in "One Foot to the Grave", etc. I admit that the script has done a little more trouble than most on British television at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold holes. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend. That was the moment when I switched off this program, never to return. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not like this series are all British, whereas those who praise them are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that the BBC ignored the series and sank like a rock. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for all who liked it! In autumn 2007 there will be a second series - but without the male leadership. It seems the BBC has decided to make it a conventional 30-minute sitcom.
