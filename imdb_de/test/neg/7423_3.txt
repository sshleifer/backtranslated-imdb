Lance received quality support from James Cameron. Heck, he even had his own television program (Millenium) for a couple of seasons. Why does he do this? Could not he find a better way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I love a good low budget movie. Some of them you can just because of their ridiculous premise, their stereotyped characters from the textbook or often, because the actors are related to the director / producer that you can laugh about. However, this movie has no redemption value. I did not laugh I did not cry. I just had this sick feeling in my stomach. This feeling was quickly recognized as pity. At one point, Lance Henriksen was a supporter of the A-list. He was in Terminator (he would become Terminator before Arnold showed up), Aliens, AliensIII, classic B-movie Pumpkinhead, among many others! I wanted to send him money afterwards. Maybe we should start a support lance fund or something. <br /> <br /> Then again, to do this thing ... maybe not.
