Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, you should sit back and enjoy the scenery. He's on a "remote Greek island" and shows a very excited Michael Caine as a teacher working at a boys' school that interferes in games with local wacko / mystery man Anthony Quinn and his girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, who looks like Pablo Picasso with white hair and a striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good, but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen is stunning, but should never set a British accent. She is not very good at this kind of thing. The direction of Guy Green is good, but if you do not have infinite patience with the circular logic of the movie, you will not enjoy it. A real sour note is the casting of the bubbly Anna Karina in the completely joyless role of Caines friend. Having seen her on the order of A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and A BAND APART, her presence here is quite staggering.
