Do not see this movie In most cases, like Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese movie is infinitely better than the American remake. This movie was terrible though. The ghosts, much like a trick or cartoon, dressed like a ghost hunter, moan and gasp in an attempt to be scary without good make-up or special effects, and acting is just awful. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained, so the movie gets worse and worse. Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are more fun things to do - such as: B. the drying of paint.
