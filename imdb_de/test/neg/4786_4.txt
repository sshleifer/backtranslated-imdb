It seems that people are attracted to shows that show miserable lives that have no purpose. I give my sincerity to NBC for their terrible efforts to make new changes on television and make laughing shows. They always seem to have great success, like the office. When I started to look, it seemed possible for me to become a hit. But after a few episodes, I really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to wretched people presented in these poor, shameful, low-age neighborhoods. And at the end, where they show Earl and the brother together in bed, it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people who are having trouble paying the rent and have no sense for that The real world of ordinary people in society is like. I always just seem to be disgusted when I see the filth in which people live on this show. It's like Venice Beach in California, beautiful, but so many hobos. Believe me, I'm not a middle-class rich guy and not a pure freak, a bit sloppy, but it just seems like the show just does not seem to have a leg coming from all the cruel, crappy people out there I wish only that they would show a little more class, not all dirt and power and followers and only a below average life, it just seems to oppress me. For me, this show is nothing more than a showcase, which one should not do in life, which should not be. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have, since these two obviously do not have ounces of smarts. This is a gem.
