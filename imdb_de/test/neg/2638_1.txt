This movie was so weak that he could not even come up with good stereotypes. I love horror movies and will see practically everything, but if I had to do it again, I would have skipped it completely. You may think that I am exaggerating, but I urge everyone to find anything that is even satisfactory or interesting on this piece of rubbish. Not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.
