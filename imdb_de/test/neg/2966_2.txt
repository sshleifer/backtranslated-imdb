No matter what you heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It's not worth investing more than two hours to see stereotypically disturbed teenagers dancing, singing, learning, and staring at girls in the locker rooms. <br /> <br /> Every clich√© has a cozy little home in this movie. There is a gay teenager looking for acceptance. That would have been great if it had been more than a secondary plot point. There is a ghetto kid who has too much attitude - what was I surprised? And guess what? They all want to become big stars to find fame and fortune, and they would all be willing to crawl over the smoking bodies of their own mother to get them. Oddly enough, this movie is reminiscent of his movie music. But the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam," which is still too cheesy to be of real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing. "Fame" is senseless fluff that is drowned out by the mere spectacle of a huge dance scene in the street. And "I Sing the Body Electric" (which in Bubba's name does that mean?!?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. <br /> <br /> Poor action, distasteful dialogue and hacking (it's from the director of "Evita") is of little help to Michael Seresin's usual camera work. But film art alone can not carry a movie, especially a movie that is not as inspiring and meaningless as this one.
