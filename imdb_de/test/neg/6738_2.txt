This must be the worst Steven Segal movie I've ever seen (even worse than Eco Piffle like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down Below). I start with the good points ..., It has a stylish direction for a DTV movie and has wonderful scenery ... That's it! The story does not really go on, it's just a series of well staged set pieces just for Seagal to shoot bad guys (the body count can easily match Tarantino's bloodiest!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing, forget who the good and the bad are. Acting (I use the term casual) is mediocre at best, Seagal's usual EINSTEIN clogged expression and wooden acting I can assume, but the others, especially the British, were really terrible. Why are bad guys after? Is Seagal set up? <br /> <br /> WHO GIVES AS ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie to my local blockbuster (once paid), the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the store I could pick! (I felt like beating him until my arm went numb.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not seen Half Past Dead or Out for a kill, and I dare not put more humiliation in my shop search. but it can not be worse than this turkey <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is said to be young and hip - it has only pushed half a dozen apes for me. <br /> <br /> All in all, Seagal is in its worst situation! The guy who won about 100 lbs and looks good on it is a guy who just does not stop, he should gracefully retire NOW! and go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)
