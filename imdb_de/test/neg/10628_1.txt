There are many comments about the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version that I saw on TV recently. It's hard to cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is common for the bloodiest scenes to be cut for German television. I understand the reasons, but this movie was different. They did not just cut "gore-shots" - they cut whole sequences and only spared insights. For example: "We have to attack them" - a 5 second explosion in the camp - protagonist runs away. <br /> <br /> When the attack on the island starts, it is no longer possible to follow the attack. Action All cuts create something that consists of a series of irregular, disjointed scenes that make no sense. <br /> <br /> I could not bear to see the end after spending 60 minutes with this nonsense /> <br /> I think I gave the original 7/10. The German version is only 1/10 worth. <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and check the runtime first) or forget about it.
