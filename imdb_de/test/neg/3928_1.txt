I do not care what anyone says, this movie was crap. The only thing it had to offer was camera work, which was done very well. As far as the dialogue is concerned, I have heard so many people. Yes, it was honest and lifelike, but so I can hear someone talking on the street or in a fast food restaurant like this. What did the dialogue in films like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park do well was the fact that the WRITTEN dialogue needs time to think. Another thing was that the director should not get involved. I think the male character could have been much stronger but seemed to be weak. In fact, the film seemed to revolve around the male figure, and then it disappears completely in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the movie I found completely repugnant, not in appearance, but in their needy needs. To say that she is in love with a guy and is actually jealous of him the next day, what a crap. Finally, the sound was awful and I hope it was just something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final movie. During several scenes a constant humming sounded, which actually decreased the talking. The only good thing was Blood's job as DP, but the actress, who played the captain's ex-girlfriend, also did a very good job. These two things could not save a horrible movie that I do not want to name. <br /> <br /> 2/10
