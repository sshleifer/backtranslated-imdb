The concept for this movie was pretty good. But somehow the execution failed in many places. There are not many horror movies that I can imagine used dolls looking so realistic. Especially when these dolls start to blink or move their hands. So much could have been done with this premise. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and tension. And I really expected that weird things happen. But the film has never managed to be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. I actually thought that they did it on purpose to surprise us with a wonderful twist. Unfortunately, that does not happen. At least not as I had hoped. The cast has also failed to make everything credible. It would have been nice if more background information were given about the characters. In the beginning, when we get to know the main character. It seems that she and other characters are invited by some kind of artist. But it is also obvious that they themselves have no idea what they are invited for. Of course, this is part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. If I got an invitation without having any idea what the deal was, I just would not go. Also, most characters are not really sympathetic to the end result that you'll never care about them. Another mistake is that the director deviates from the basic assumption, which is scary enough and highlights new elements that are never explained and are not relevant to the "Doll Master Mystery". Overall, this movie was a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie with dolls, check out "Dead Silence"!
