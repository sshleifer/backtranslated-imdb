This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I can not believe that people actually write a) scripts like this b) have a budget to make a movie; c) actually expect it to succeed. Words can not even describe how awful this movie is. I enjoy my fair share of teen movies, but that was not nearly funny. Actually, it was funny just because it was so awful. I can probably count one (maybe two) part of the movie where I could even make a giggle (apart from the laugh about how bad it was) I've done it before. It's been a day since I saw the movie, and I'm still shocked at how awful it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
