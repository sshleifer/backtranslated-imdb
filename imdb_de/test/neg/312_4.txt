On Halloween, a city is terrorized by a maniac with a big pumpkin for a head. Bad drama consisting mainly of local talent and ridiculous special effects makes this a Baaaaad. B-movie queen Linnea Quigley seems embarrassed to be part of this movie, and even her considerable charm, which has helped many other films, can not help this film. If you're looking for a good Halloween horror movie, you can hand over that cheesy movie and rent the "Night of the Demons," which features Ms. Quigley.
