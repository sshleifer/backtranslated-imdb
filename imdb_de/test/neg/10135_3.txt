I know that it is impossible to save all the details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed almost everything for no reason. In addition, many changes have made the story illogical. Some examples: 1) In the film, "Paul Renauld" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book in which Poirot just gets a letter), who tells him he is afraid of being killed. This is completely stupid, because if Renauld's plan had been successful, Poirot would have known that the dead man was not Renauld (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs. Renauld identified the victim). 2) The film has two people to a "combined"! "Cinderella" was removed from the movie. The girl Hastings falls in love with and the ex-girlfriend of Jack Renauld are one person in the movie! Why in heaven's name? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is such a bad golfer. Totally listless and stupid. 4) The film tells secrets too early (for example at the very beginning). So you know things you should not know. 5) The killer is shot dead by a person who is not in the book. Maybe because the person ("Cinderella") who stops the murderer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complex. The movie lasts only about 90 minutes. Sure, it's difficult to pin down all the necessary details, but it's impossible if you include silly things that were not in the book and have no meaning (eg, bicycle races).
