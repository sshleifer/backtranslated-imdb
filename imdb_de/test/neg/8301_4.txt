Although I had seen this on Italian television some time ago, this time I found it a surprisingly bearable potboiler worn by an international cast of familiar faces (including a confused Joseph Cotten as a baron) and, unlike many others, another movie the Euro-Cult subgenre, an incidental plot instead of a lethargic tempo. <br /> <br /> The creature itself looks a bit gloomy and Cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously by an avid scientist still dealing with life forms of corpses (one would have thought he was meanwhile made into an army and could not put up with perfecting his technique), but Ms. Neri looks good and disguised and reliable is probably best for Herbert Fux as a lustful grave robber / blackmailer.
