I never thought a movie might regret the fact that I subscribe to the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but not even he could save that part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual Wiitches from Eastwick characters. Unfortunately, it does not go over to the American Southwest. He is an equally credible cowboy desperado as Pee Wee Herman. There is no advantage to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails. He is almost too stupid. The rest of the cast was worse. The delivery timing of lines is apparently something that the leading lady has not perfected since 1978, and the others just seemed to be happy. I recommend to all who are interested in this movie that you are taking valuable time for something dry.
