I happened to watch this movie on TV and it was so unbelievably horrible that I could not turn it off. Every single joke and intelligence was removed by the inept scriptwriter from Oscar Wilde's story. It hardly matters because the terrible acting, clich√©d camerawork and annoying music would have ruined everything, which resembles a decent screenplay anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who appears as the most mumbling, talented, mock-Shakespearean-Nincompoop as a ghost. "Get out of here!" He suddenly screams and wags his arms like a mime-villain. A really horrible movie, and why is it surprising that Stewart, who can act when prompted, has polluted his reputation by making worthless bitches like this and the XMen.
