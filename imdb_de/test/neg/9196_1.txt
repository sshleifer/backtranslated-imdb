This is a bad, bad movie. Full of Clich√©s, Unrealistic Moments: Celebrate the air after you've extinguished a fire, and do not forget that someone has lost their homes and belongings !!, proclaim pregnancy in a bar with all your friends before you She first privately quietly inform the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and tense relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music in the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from the same Flat! ! Did you have some oxygen tanks in the loft or something !!? Anyone with a touch of joke can realize that this movie was a joke. It's a pity, because firefighters do a great job and deserve to make a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
