I think the "Bone Snatcher" should follow anyone who is in touch with this movie. If you observe this, you will feel like the longest 90 minutes of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were terrible, not even removed. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art to the end, you will either be most disappointed or laugh hysterically. I bought this movie based on other reviews I read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker. If you are looking for a horror movie that will catch your interest, check out "U Turn". It may be based on a kooky plot, but it's full of those scary scenes that make you jump from beginning to end.
