The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we figured out it was a picture of another movie. Unfortunately, she is very little in this movie. But you can see how far she has come. <br /> <br /> The other bright spot in the movie, in addition to their very small part, were some of the locations shot in New York and New Jersey The 1980s. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialogue is hard to hear. Sometimes the dialogue was repeated without background noise, which is disturbing. For example, the sounds in the car are sometimes too loud, and suddenly there is absolutely no additional noise. The director loves close-ups of faces, and then it's clear that the movie was dubbed because the words do not fit the lip movements. For most of the movie, the voices sound like people are talking in a tin can. Background music, if there is music, distracts instead of adding something to the movie. <br /> <br The direction is ridiculous. Dumb camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially in times of tension, like in the middle of cannon battles. The writing is terrible. There are a few subplots that do not make sense, and most characters look very stupid because there is no explanation for their motivation. The author / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were in Vietnam, but none of that makes sense. These top assassins and former soldiers do not seem to be able to see the shadows of other people or hear other people moving. The actors go from calm to panic and back again without warning. It's just a combination of bad direction and bad writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that at first we thought we'd come across a student movie that happened to have Sandra Bullock in it. If you want to laugh about really badly made student films, this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
