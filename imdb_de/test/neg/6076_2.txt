I made a big mistake when I saw this movie. That's the lottery, watching movies, I think. After five minutes you only knew it would become a clunker and I struggled hard to stay in my seat - the old feeling of losing two hours of your life. <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that, without mentioning the whole "historical accuracy" wheel of the reviews, the script is painful, painful and bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes would have been spread over an hour to a real, plot development. Instead, it jumped from one undramatic "dramatic" event to the next. If the girl cries at the beginning of the movie, it makes no sense, because the audience at this point has no emotional attachment to anything. And the whole thing went in the end through the long lawn in the sunset. What was it all about? <br /> <br /> Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this. You could almost feel his pain on a few lines that he had to utter. The fabulously horrific was, for no apparent reason, he stares at the girl while she copies his work in his apartment, she looks up, everything goes a little blurry romantic - a lighting (or I dream) and he says with authority in his voice , <br /> <br /> "WASH ME." <br /> <br /> And she gets up and washes him with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? That's funny. <br /> <br /> And then there was the music. The long extended session, when it was just Beethoven's conducting, and the 9th Symphony poured out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waited, waited and stood still, which seems forever. And then finally with an enormous sound. It was an eerily wonderful thing and I did not dare to say it, it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> So that's where the movie got two stars. The only part of the film in which Beethoven could say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
