Some movies are not for everyone. This exactly describes the film by Igmar Bergaman, Skammen (Shame). At just 18, I still have what I think you could call a minor form of ADD. Well, I watch movies to be entertained. Shame was a movie with a very interesting premise, but trying to convey the effects of the war on ordinary people was not enough for me. I do not know if it was subtitles, black-and-white movies, the length of the film, or the fact that my studies took two hours to complete a major chemistry test, but I did not like it. I understand that this is a great movie and is very important in the history of cinema. However, I think that my teacher pointed out that not everyone liked it or liked it. I think I just wish it was done with all its many minor plots. Maybe the translation has lost something, but I had the feeling that there were an infinite number of small shoots that never came to a conclusion. You would meet characters and never see them again or really understand why they were included in the movie. My general recommendation for this film is that it is worth seeing, but only to form your own opinion about it. Whether you like it or not, it is necessary to respect the point it tries to convey.
