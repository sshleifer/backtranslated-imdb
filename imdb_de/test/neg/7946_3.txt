It's New Year's Eve, a police murderer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne) lands in an environment that is closed because of snow. When people are besieged, the cops have to band together with the cons to survive. This remake of the John Carpenter classic just had to add a few more than stupid plot twists, solve all the suspense and add a dreadful John Lequizamo to the cast, right? The first movie was exciting, bleak and it was a pleasure to see. This is more Hollywood, clich√©d and painful to look at. The only thing I got from this movie was that OCD can be very annoying ... VERY. The end song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comment by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with optional comment; 5 minutes "Armed and Dangerous" on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minutes "behind Precinct Walls"; "Plan of Attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 and a half minutes behind the scenes featurette; Trailer for "Unleashed", "White Noise": Seed of Chucky "<br /> <br /> Miscelanious: I received this at Best Buy and a bonus CD was included including the first 2 minutes of" Cry Wolf ", a first glance of 10 minutes to" Unleashed ", the trailer for this film and a Fuzion interview with John Leguizamo
