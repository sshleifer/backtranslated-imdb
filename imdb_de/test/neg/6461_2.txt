This show is great and we really enjoyed it. I'm in Alaska and disagree with the gay content of today's show. I feel like you're pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. It's one thing to have a New Yorker who fights wildly in Alaska, but transforms the Alaskan city into New York? This is a nice show about petite women and real Alaska Men. Getting a same-sex couple into the mix is ​​the balance. Alaska should be portrayed as a man and New York as a woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance to what you all do. Can not we have a nice show without the imbalance of nature?
