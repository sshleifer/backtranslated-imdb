This is exactly the same old crap spewed by amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - maybe that's why it's a direct movie that's supposed to be a Wanna-be movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's my fault to actually spend money on it (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What a waste. I usually like B movies, some of them are actually pretty good - but that's just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this junk deserve to be taken out of business. Spend time and money on those who produce a movie that obviously does not even deserve to be in the movie ! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely NO talent! <br /> <br /> Stupid conspiracy, terrible acting (especially the drag queens - what a sick girl would find that sexy?!), lame writing (if there was ever a script - seems like a bull *** * Somebody invented right there. <br /> <br /> What's amazing about this movie is its utter lack of anything that was done well. <br /> <br /> How much love for Detail would require it to ensure that every image of a film is so far below a reasonable standard? I do not think it would be possible to deliberately make such a bad movie, and it is unimaginable that pure bad luck can produce so terrible results <br /> <br /> Avoid this stink bomb at all costs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
