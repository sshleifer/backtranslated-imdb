This DVD was loaned to me by the director of a movie I work with, playing an actor who plays Prospero. Knowing his own style, I did not expect anything reminiscent of a "classical" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and boring. Like most experimental music, I find that in movies like this, the building blocks of powerful filmmaking are made, even though they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> So We have a Caliban who is more of a clown than a threat, and not even Miranda seems to be terrified of (which is strange since we know he tried her at least to rape once). A Stefano and Trinculo that are annoying rather than funny. A strangely young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and conspiracy through creative editing and highly stylized posturing. Interestingly, I have no problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His amazed enthusiasm and slightly insane innocence are actually appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but an experimental one. One that takes a tremendous amount of risk, but is more for art and film students, and not really for anyone interested in Tempest.
