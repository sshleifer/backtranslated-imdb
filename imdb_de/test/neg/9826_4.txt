I was looking forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend with a good movie about Jefferson. This movie was not. It was quite long, boring and unbalanced. There was too much time exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time for his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely terrible. Her acting was as bad as watching an A1 aerial head trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant, wailing voice rubbed her nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, not a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings for slavery were also underdeveloped, but the rebellion of his eldest daughter (Patsy) is an important late-in-the-movie event. The movie was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. On the positive side, the costumes were very pretty and Greta Scacchi played the role of Cosway well. If you want to see a movie about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then look at 1776, it's a lot better than Jefferson in Paris.
