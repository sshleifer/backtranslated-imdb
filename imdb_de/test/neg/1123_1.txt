National Lampoon's Christmas Holiday 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, Nick Marck. The embarrassing direct-to-video flop has helped his cousin Eddie and his family on paid-up vacation in the South Pacific by his boss in the hope that the fool will not sue his company after being infested by a wiser lab ape! Idiotic coups can not match any of the vacation movies (not even European Vacation!), With the question of whether the filmmakers found the script funny or not. Not even Quaid, Willard or Asner can make it remotely controllable. 83 min., Not rated. *
