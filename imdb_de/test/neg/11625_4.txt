When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored the swan princess. She experienced the same fairy tales as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day are always a timeless story that will never die. Well, hopefully. But I figured I would watch the sequels to The Swan Princess to see what they looked like and unfortunately this is the typical comic sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. The only character I still found amusing was the queen. She was very funny in this movie and had the best. But with the voice changes they were conspicuous and disturbed me pretty much, I did not want to be picky, it was just too funny for me. The story was also more or less borrowed from the first Swan Princess, only the villain in this movie follows Rothbart's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Odette and Derek are celebrating their one-year anniversary, but Derek has been too busy fighting for his kingdom to protect it. With his mother's birthday coming, he forgets that because Clavious is a new villain in town who hopes to go beyond where Rothbart's forces hung and abducted the Queen on her birthday. But Odette has to turn back into her swan self to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> Of course the Swan Princess 2 is more than ok for the kids, I do not mind, it's good clean fun for them. The reason these sequels are disappointing is that they are usually meant for the kids only, ie the audience they are aiming for, but it is happier when everyone enjoys the jokes and the story. Now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but in my opinion the first Swan Princess was not so smart. I would recommend it for the little ones, but if you're looking for a fun cartoon, I'd recommend staying with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
