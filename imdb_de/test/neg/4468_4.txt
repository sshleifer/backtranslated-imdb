The previews were so funny that I could not wait to see this movie. I've just come home and have to say I could not have been ashamed of this movie anymore. Yes, there were times when the jokes were funny, but the stereotypical roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a good actress, but the scene with the "Negro Spiritual" was just bad taste. Needless to say, the laughs in the movie house were for a mostly white audience (I was one of very few blacks).
