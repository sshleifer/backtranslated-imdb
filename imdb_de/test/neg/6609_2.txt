the movie is just awful (2/10). Although actors do their best (sometimes that's not much), special effects are ... Let me put it that way, but it would be better if there were none. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately it is the opposite. There is nothing left of the original atmosphere. And it's all very messy. Maybe they just had too much material to be shown in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, I would recommend you to search for the TV series (same title, same actor, even the storyline) remains the same one) made at the same time as the movie has been. It's so much better (9/10) and the story there actually makes sense :)
