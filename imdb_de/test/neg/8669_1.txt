Why did they have to make such a terrible adjustment? The entire "Complete Jane Austin" series as part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a big disappointment. Characters are totally wrong and there is no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing feels pretty rushed. The 1999 released film version based on the same novel seems to be a masterpiece by comparison. I really want to forget it. I am really happy that "Pride and Prejudice" will not be redesigned as part of this project and we will see the legendary Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists. If you skipped this "Mansfield Park" production, consider yourself lucky!
