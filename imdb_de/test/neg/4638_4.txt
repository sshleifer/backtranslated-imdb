The First World War is revamped in sepia color in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's relentless whimsical "A Very Long Engagement". Jeune's characteristic style consists of a mechanical, almost clockwork-like, narrative construction adorned with elaborate chocolate-carton production values ​​and seasoned with fake humor. It is an approach that has worked quite well with his previous image, the romantic fantasy "Amelie," not least thanks to the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role. Applied to much darker material, the method of Jeunet precipitates rather badly. Tatou reappears here in a variation on the same kind of sweet, deviant character as Amelie. She is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting and is determined to pursue what has become of her child son Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), a few years after he disappeared in the war. Manech was one of five soldiers who were court-martialled for 'self-mutilation' in 1917 at 'Bingo Crepuscule' and sent to no man's land for punishment. He is considered dead by all but Mathilde who hopes to find him. The film follows Mathilde's stubborn quest to find out what really happened, and as she delves deeper, she reveals a sad, even shocking, tale of high-level corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that come from various conflicting, overlapping, or incomplete reports of Manech's final hours. <br /> <br /> All of this should be poignant and poignant, but it's often just a confusing reminder of the visual and verbal confusion Jeunet's audience is having. There is just too much going on at any one time, including an intrusive narrative that adds nothing to our appreciation of the story and the characters. Without feeling a moment of information overload, I felt denied to think about Mathilde's search or the space to deal with it in my own imagination. Jeune's incessantly animated camera spirals, lintels and circles caressing any surface contour of his exquisitely designed production, however, do not penetrate the soul beneath the skin of the story. The result is profoundly unstoppable and even grotesque. The First World War was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine it was recreated as one of those scenic commercials for a well-known Belgian camp, and you have the measure of this movie.
