John Knowle's modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, is one of many subtle, and subtle is the watchword, themes of love, hatred, jealousy, rejection, and regret. The 1972 version attempts to address this style and what the book is - a love story with war in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use subtle but obvious usage in the story's presentation. What stares you in the face when you read the novel is a love story, and perhaps it is questionable, a gay love story. In the novel and 1972 film version, there are sexual undertones throughout the scriptures and dialogues. In the 2004 showtime movie version, these tensions were left out, and the actors were there in the late 1920s when they played teenagers, which meant that mature acting took away the tenderness and hesitation of innocence in youth. <br /> <br /> I did not like this remake for more reasons. The hair that broke the camels was that Phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the design boards! Finny is a character who has no last name or needs. John Knowles did it on purpose. <br /> <br /> Although I accept the 1972 version, the spectacle was sometimes moody, so trying to be honest with the novel was based on Devon Acedemy's on-site shoot at The Phillips Exeter Academy, The The on; in which also the writer John Knowles participated as a student. The directors and producers took all the young Exeter students except Parker Stevenson who attended The Brooks School to play in a Paramount movie! Class act of prepppies compared to this Canadian college shot, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - veto this sham experiment once again. The film version of 1972 with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real deal for A Separate Peace on the silver screen. The Showtime 2004 movie for the cable version was not created.
