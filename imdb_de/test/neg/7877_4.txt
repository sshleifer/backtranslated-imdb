This is not a good movie. Plain and simple. Take out the hardcore sex scenes and have a mediocre conspiracy, on average acting (at best), nimble, and boring dialogues. Add to the grot, and you've got a mediocre conspiracy, mean acting, nimble, boring dialogues, with whipping hardcore porn. The problem is that the porn is nothing special. So it's not a good movie and not a good porn. In both points it fails. You can say that women made this movie, and they intended to do it with the movie, and so on, and so on. But the conversation is cheap, the end result is what counts shock value to try, you persuade to spend your time watching it. One of those movies where you'd rather have the time you looked at to see them again.
