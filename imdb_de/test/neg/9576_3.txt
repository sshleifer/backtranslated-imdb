Deformed, aged scientist kills colleagues to steal formulas for cell rejuvenation and reverse the aging process. She takes it and turns into the beautiful, evil Satanik (Magda Konopka), who seduces and murders rich businessmen. <br /> <br /> She dresses very stylishly in late 1960s fashion clothes and manipulates people around her while she looks like the late Marisa Mell from the DIABOLIK movie. Coincidence? Despite all this, it's amateur and sloppy without the pop art devices of James Bond who had DIABOLIK. The filming locations in Madrid and on Lake Geneva also do not make up for that. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada & Roberto Pregadio and is not bad at all. It consists of a lush orchestration with some fuzz guitar used as an ornament. Perfect for one of these European Loungecore CDs released in the 90's. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD also uses inferior grainy color printing, which is in poor condition. At the beginning there is an explanation that this is due to the age of the movie. Bull! They either did not look for a better source or did not find it at all. There are only a few stills from Magda and that's it. <br /> <br /> Sloppy & poor all around, he gets 3 out of 10 points.
