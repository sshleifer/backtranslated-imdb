As a big Jim Carey fan, I optimistically took my place in the cinema. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane seemed to have all the raw materials for another Carey success. After the first five minutes of good humor, it seemed that the movie was about to do something, but the plan went awry immediately. The notion that a charming, charismatic, top-notch VIP employee could suddenly work in his nearest supermarket It's just so hard to believe and then it's almost impossible to get upset that this guy has also become a master criminal. The actors also seem to be confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotyped, rich, thoughtless head of the operation does not bother to go through his one-dimensional nature, but for Carey and others around him, the job is a lot more difficult. In a minute, Dick is seen as an obsessed office worker obsessed with obsession, the next minute he's a humpy mess that can barely put two words together, and eventually he becomes a little thief who's lucky enough to get one Another Gun Laying a Man's Head Jane is equally confused with her role and her character will never really get going. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is so good and it's a shame that this movie did not make it work. You can find the funny moment when you have to laugh loud comedy, but usually it's more physical humor than anything else, which is funny or smart. Carey tries his best to save a sinking ship, but his weird talent can never thrive on a character who has so many gaping holes in his personality. Carey shines when presented with a strong, daring character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura) with which, despite his best efforts, this film has never been introduced to him.
