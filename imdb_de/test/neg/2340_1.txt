If you're an overbearing person, it would be a good idea to brag about your intellectuality that you really like this movie. <br/>> <br /> This is the stereotypical movie for snobs. The plot line would be very stupid if you could see it from beginning to end. It is only presented in a confused way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie intellectual. Mullholland Drive is not pleasing to look at. You would very rarely understand something when you see it for the first time. And if you do, you will most likely be disappointed because it is no big deal.
