Negative numbers are not available to show how bad this movie is! Wood spectacle paired with a dozen times reclaimed storyline. Everyone in this movie should participate in Overactors Anonymous. One might think that an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a preschool try to deal with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It raises interesting questions, but the way they are conveyed makes it more of a joke. The typical characters were present, including the eager Jock and Nerd (glasses included). I could not be interested in the wooden dialogue and clich√© characters anymore. After completing the film I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this guy! You will not get back the 90 minutes of your life!
