What did I think when I rented it? What did the dealer think when he copied the tape and sent it to Holland? That someone really wanted to see these s ***? <br /> <br /> It's about getting some astronauts into space (Apollo 13 flashback, but never even in the shadow of this beautiful movie) and they want to go home. If you act in such a movie, you should be glad that you will move as far as possible from Earth! <br /> <br /> This device wants to surf in 1998 on the small wave of space movies (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were also not perfect (far from it), but at least they were worth a look (and maybe once again, when we're all old). They were fun. Max Q not. There is irritation. Okay okay. It's a TV movie, but does that mean you can come up with such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you have suffocated your own vomit until the very end (through all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you must have gotten bored to death with this waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the end, it will be worst when the space shuttle lands ... No, I can not spoil it (IMDb policies prohibit it). So you have to see it for yourself. NO! DO NOT SEE IT (sorry), but rent a movie that's worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!). <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
