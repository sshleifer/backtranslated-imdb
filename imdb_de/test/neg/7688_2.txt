As a fan of Michael Dudikoff, I sat down to see one of his good, old-fashioned actioners - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a group of American commandos trying to free themselves from a bunch of Syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the command unit and of course she became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask, since when did the British have female SAS members - as far as I know if they are ever needed, they come from other sources. Even if, then I can pretty much guarantee that they would not be as wet as Maddie Reese. I would also think that Tom Dickson was a little more responsible in his position - or did I lose the conspiracy ?! I know there is always a romantic point of view in these films because it helps deliver the feel-good factor, but must this be the case, especially when more important things need to be considered - such as the nuclear war? <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the signing of the US Aircraft Carrier contract. The "holy pin" as carried by a supposed television news crew - there were no security checks to find out who or what is aboard one of these ships, especially the caliber of the people who were on it. Mind you, if there was one, I would guess that there would be no story. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but when it came to "Inner Body Bomb Defusion" to safely remove a bullet, I gave it to action drama film and enjoyed it for the comedy that actually did it was. <br /> <br /> By the way, would a news reporter really say "Downtown Damascus"?
