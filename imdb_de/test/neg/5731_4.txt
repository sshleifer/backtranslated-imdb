It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best at this production, especially considering that he had not come to justice yet and in his dialogue delivery was still as stiff as cardboard is not as bad as some critics say, but also not good. It's amusing and acts like a poor Conan lineage, making it a conflicted, uneven, bad job. Speaking of bad, the quality is terrible due to the time this was filmed, but that's not the only reason. The story here is even inferior to the Conan line, but moreover, he loses himself in the "Red Sonja must be dominated by big, strong Schwarzenegger" and completely forgets his purpose, in case he ever had a-enjoyment "B" way , <br /> <br /> It rates a 4.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
