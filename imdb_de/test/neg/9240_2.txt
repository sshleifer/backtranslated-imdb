I just looked at it yesterday and wanted to read the comments of other people, but found some good grades. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * There were just so many basic history issues. A lot of Asian horror has the turn of ghosts trying to help, but just scary look (with notable exceptions: Ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here, unless they are not scary. A pretty Asian girl who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The character "Monk" directly explains everything as a completely natural life cycle; Again, there is nothing uncanny. But the woman just does not understand, she would rather kill herself and then let her baby reborn that poor spirit. My girlfriend and I just laughed when she jumped out of the building twice and the ghost waits a second time to tell her why she follows her. This information would have been nice before she started jumping, but whatever. <br /> <br /> * That said, I have some parts in the middle. First she drives a cab with a ghost (ghosts driving taxis?), Who has a lot of extra hair that is inexplicably scary. Immediately afterwards at the bus stop you have to see how it is pretty messed up. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a total bomb. This is a poor quality Asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into the woman's belly almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images.
