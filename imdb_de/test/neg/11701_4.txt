This film adds a new meaning to the term "uneven" and gives us some intriguing characterizations juxtaposed with an unwieldy conspiracy based on a few well-placed stingers that provide the majority of the thrill. <br /> <br /> Plot concerns a group of men who hold a secret that has been used to direct a curse in the form of a ghostly female apparition that causes death. She could also seduce her sons. <br /> <br /> It is quite a spectacle to have all the remarkable veterans in one movie together, but unfortunately they are not very convincing, especially the scene where Melvyn Douglas breaks up the deep end begs the others to hear him. It's no shock that the actors who play the same characters in their teens are terrible, especially the giggling Ricky. They deliver the worst "gee-not-all-drink" scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has a few saving graces, namely Dick Smith's great ghost make-ups (even though they were out of place.) in this movie) and Alice Krige's mesmerizing performance as Alma / Eve. I've never read the novel that made this movie, but I plan to read some of the other reviews on this page. However, you do not have to read the book to realize that this is just a shadow of the original story. There is a good story here, but it seems to be lost somewhere, in the midst of an exhibition that shows that men have nightmares over and over again and discreet references to the mystery they all share. <br /> <br /> It looks like about half an hour of material has been removed from this print, especially near the climax. After all ... how come Fred Astaire makes an excavation of the pond so fast? What did Gregory Bate and the boy have to do with Eva? And while we're at it ... what the hell was she doing anyway? Why did the apparition disappear after being left out of the car? If it was an apparition, how could it have sex with two men and not know them? <br /> <br /> These and other questions are never answered, at least not through this movie. Unless some restored material is discovered, it's likely to remain a curiosity forever with make-up makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and some attractive performances.
