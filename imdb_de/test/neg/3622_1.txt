Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I do not know if that's because the fucking Jamie Lynn Spears is the snappy star or what, but all I know is that the show is shitty. It's about a girl and her brother going to a boarding school. The jokes in this show are extremely boring and listless and I hate every character except Chase and Lola. Heck, the jokes on this show are so funny that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This show is undoubtedly one of the worst shows on Nickelodeon. She's down there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the pit of shame and if this show was a person of any honor she'd be ashamed. <br /> <br /> 1/10
