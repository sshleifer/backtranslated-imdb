Leafed through the TV and saw that The Secret Life was of; George Duran tried to be the host. I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and nobody was as much as he could be, but George was boring. He really did not seem to want hosting; His speakers were monotonous and did not engage with the guests. It seemed he was interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and he happened to be in the shot. I do not know if George will make the show "better". The show seemed to pack more information, but only because we had seen less of the host. The formula of this show was very delicate, and I'm afraid it was finally disturbed.
