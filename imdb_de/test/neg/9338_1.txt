In short, this movie was awful. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a Disney movie, which is usually flat movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. But I have to say that this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad actors, many lovely, screaming teenage women (my god) and a most unrealistic act. Even as a 12-year-old, I would not have liked this movie in any way. The only way this movie could have been worse would have been if it had tried to put it in theaters or sell it on a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change the channel before you look at it, no matter how boring you are on a Sunday afternoon.
