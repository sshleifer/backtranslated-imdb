Okay, now I know where all those boring TV shows with police / murder departments came from. I think they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" feels more like a TV episode or episode of a series. With standard characters and situations - the hot cop who clashes with his superiors ... the aging cop who, despite his lack of vision, does not want a desk job ... the ruthless rookie ... the double-cross lady, etc. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of actors here and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie boring because I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept coming back when they talked about the case ... something about bookmakers and informants. And yes, there was a stripper, played by the formerly healthy Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is, why did she call Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Was not Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What the hell does that have to do with anything? I guess I do not understand the hard movie Noir-ish somehow. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of the dialogue involved me: "Nobody talks like that!" I could, however, refer to a scene in which the wife of the policeman (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that perhaps she should not have made her husband the center of her life. Yes, I know this feeling of loving someone and being dependent on them for fear of their safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, under the stylized dialogue and the atmosphere that so unconsciously tries to be sombre and REAL that it actually seems unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A small background: this The film was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer and started putting an end to the healthy musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to give the films more "realism". I hate Dore Schary. Maybe we can blame him for all the sophisticated, gritty films that are being made today, reveling in life in the ugly "truths" and focusing on (and, I believe, helping) the worst of humanity. No longer elevate us as classic films were designed, and provide a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, damn it, we still need that distraction today! There is still enough depression and war. And what are people turning to today if they want to escape? Trashy, mind-boggling reality TV. Thank you, Dore!
