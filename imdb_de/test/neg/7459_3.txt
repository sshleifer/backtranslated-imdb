Before I saw this movie, the 1998 version was my only experience with this Dickens story. I did not really enjoy this movie, but this adaptation of 1974 moves in a particularly tiring way. <br /> <br /> The actors do not shine, the main couple Michael York and Sarah Miles are especially wooden boxes. The only character of real interest to me were the intelligent hunters of Anthony Quayle. The so-called conspiracy is ridiculous, but the story itself is great. It's a real lesson on how you can be destroyed by distorted values ​​and obsessive principles. Live with an open mind and do not care about what other people say you are what you are when others can not stand it, shit. Pip was told this early, but he did not listen. <br /> <br /> The girl who was adopted by the crazy old lady reminded me a little of the old Kaspar hauser story, not in the same terrible level, but in the way she shaped the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex whom she believed had betrayed her. Pip's childhood did not seem to be much better. The end did not seem to fit the rest of the story's style. The sets looked cheap, and when I came to Imdb I was not surprised to see that this was actually a TV movie (of which I had no idea when I lent it from the library). <br /> <br /> live and learn. So many good movies, so little time. That's why the reviews are here. So you would not have to waste time on this type of movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
