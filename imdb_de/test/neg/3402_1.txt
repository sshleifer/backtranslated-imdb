Basically, this was obviously intended as promotional material for the movie, which was produced by the same terrible director. This movie is even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. So avoid it at all costs. <Br /> <br /> The documentation is entertaining. entertaining and obviously misleading! Most of the "historical" footage is most likely just historical footage of completely independent events that unfortunately have been cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would otherwise have been. There is no doubt that Waverly is a pretty interesting place with a lot of fascinating history, but the production of documentation on the marketing of the locale and the associated production is abominably useless for want of better words. <br /> <br /> And yes, I lived in Kentucky all my life, and I visited the place several times. Waverly Hills deserves respect. and there is nothing respectful about this lame documentation.
