*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, kind words are hard to find for me to describe the film I have just submitted to you. The problems are far and wide and painful for me to report. , , but I feel I have to, if only to prevent others from experiencing the same torments as me. This is NOT a movie for everyone under 50, it's slow and slow, and when the great reunion of Ada and Inman takes place. , Nothing happens in the biggest and most important scene in the movie, it's an epic flop. Well, as the director should have done, I will keep my words short and end this warning. Her film is incoherent, boring, has no flow, and Jude Law is tragically misrepresented. - be warned, the movie should be renamed. , , Bored mountain love Ada
