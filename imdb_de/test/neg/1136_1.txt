God bless Randy Quaid ... his in love cousin Eddie on vacation and during the Christmas break stole the show weirdly. He's even made the terrible Vegas vacation that's worth a look. <br /> <br /> I'll say he's trying hard in this TV sequel, but the script is NOT so funny that the movie never really works. Quaid and the rest of the returning holiday veterinarians (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even Eric Idle of European Vacation can not save the show in a short cameo .... <br /> <br /> Poor and sad ... actually painful to look at ... Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst in the vacation franchise.
