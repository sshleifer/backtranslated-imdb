In & Out wanted me to vomit. I have never seen such a shameless movie! I seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and happy, but has no idea how to say it. For me, this was not a comedy, unless cruel, sick jokes are something to laugh about when a victim falls in love with it. <br /> <br /> From all I've seen, this movie had four (4) big drawbacks with (A) Matt Dillon's character as he announces to the world former teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. No matter how incredible it is that Matt Dillon's character won an Oscar for a serious role on the edge of a crack. But why would he say that? After all, this has never been a problem with Howard's students, his friends, his family, or his finace. Nobody. Why would he say that, if it was not true? More precisely, why does not the film give us the answer to why he said that? The reason is that there is NO answer and none is provided for the convenience of presentation. The second (B) mistake lies in the fact that the film has forgotten what homosexuality is - the attraction and sexual relationship with members of the same sex. In this film Schwulsein is based on liking Barbara Streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. It's all based on clichés! Both mistakes are eliminated at this closing ceremony, which must have been seen. Matt Dillion learns of the tumult in this small town and the movie looks to let us know why he said that. When he comes to the ceremony, he says nothing, and I was wondering why in the world he got there at all. He did not solve anything. Then when the entire audience announced to announce that they were gay, I was so moved that I wanted to throw up! These people stood up in defense of Howard when they were gay by mocking all these stereotypes. What the movie forgot is that he used those clichés to show why Howard was gay. The filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! But wait, there is more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, Howard appeared to be in court to lose his job as a teacher because people believed that he would make his students gay. The film wanted to say that homosexuals NEVER recruit and that he would not influence his students. But did not we see how Tom Selleck's character put Howard under pressure over and over again, even if he unexpectedly kissed him to get out of the closet when there was not a closet in my eyes to get out of? The film clearly shows that homosexuals can recruit. The film then shoots back in the foot. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard got out of the closet, nobody noticed how the script silenced him for the rest of the movie? I counted only three lines that he had behind: "Yup!" to his parents "hello!" to a student and "Are you ready?" to Tom Selleck before the last vomited scene. I may be low by one, but the point is that he can not tell us why he chose to be gay. I wanted to know what was in his mind because I never thought for a moment that he was gay. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, the movie also includes some really offensive scenes. One in which Howard asks a friend friend for advice about what to do for a friend (him) who is engaged and has not had sex with his fiancé. "Does that make him gay?" he asks. The priest answered "Oh yes, he is definitely gay". Uh-huh Or what about the scene where all the old ladies gathered around Howard to tell Howard's mother that she does not have to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because, well, everyone has she. Then the ladies confessed that she has never seen The Bridges of Madison County. Funny? No! Because the film shows that he is insensitive and has no idea how harmless it can be for the family when one of his members has announced that he is gay. I know. I have several friends who are gay, and none of their families took it well. That was a bad way to dispel the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last straw for me was the last scene that looked like Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera floated very slowly to the front of the church when ... It was not what you thought! I was deeply disgusted at the time, and I could never forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against movies about homosexuality or homosexuality. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and true in what they had to say. "In & Out" only screams for political correctness, but has no idea of ​​corruption at its core. What I learned from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, that is, if you have the slightest doubt, YOU ARE DEFINITIVE GAY. It is as if homosexuality became a dominant feature in genetics. If everyone told you over and over again that you were worthless and stupid, you might believe it, right? Howard Brackett was gay. I left the theater sad and angry. In fact, angry all weekend. This was a seriously sick and cruel movie, the 1997 WORST.
