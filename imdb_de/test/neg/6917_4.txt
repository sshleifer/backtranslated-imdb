Dr. Markoff is a crazy scientist who is experimenting and trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concert, he is met by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and sets off to court her. But if she wants nothing to do with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus to extort money, and his daughter in exchange for a cure. <br /> <br /> This is the basic requirement for this B-thriller on a low budget. I have to say that I was not so enthusiastic about this movie. Not that it was awful - it was not like that, but it was nothing special. It was entertaining enough for a visit, but it is not one that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is sometimes a bit cheesy and the acting is only mediocre. The story is pretty predictable and does not really give us anything new. Of course, I can not complain too much about a movie that has a man in a gorilla suit, who serves almost no real purpose, and a doctor with a Svengali-like gaze who does not fascinate his victims. <br /> <br /> It may be worth watching if you like this kind of movie, but do not go for too many expectations.
