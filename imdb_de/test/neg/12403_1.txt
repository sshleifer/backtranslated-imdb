This is one of those movies where the drama, location, direction and effects were so bad that you need to rent a copy to get 5 or 6 friends, a barrel of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from Douglas Adams: "If you look at this movie, you will have hit yourself in the head like a lemon wrapped around a big golden brick." What is wrong? Everything. British actors posing as Americans, there were many who could do it, like Bob Hoskins, but he is not there. It was not even necessary to choose North America as a location. Why not say that it was in England? The director seemed to like it, that he photographed the tits and asses of the girls, as that he triggered a kind of character motivation. At this point, drunk buddies will say, "ALL RIGHT, another T & A shot!". There are not many dialogues, so do not hesitate to go to the kitchen and prepare the sandwiches. What did I like about this movie? After my friends fainted, I managed to collect $ 185 from them and told them that they would spend it in the strip bar after we saw the horrible movie.
