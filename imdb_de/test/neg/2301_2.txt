This movie is the last straw in a list of movies I've seen this week. They marginalized me and forced me to join the IMDb and bring some warnings to the public. It was absolutely terrible. The movie was boring and boring. The sound, the effects, and even the image quality seemed to come from Willow (1988) or perhaps even Conan the Barbarian (1982). The Battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "biggest filmed reconstruction of the medieval battle that ever took place in the British Isles" made me giggle. There was not even a coherent formation, only a few guys with spears and horses running through them. The scenes of Douglas, especially in the final battle, were just awful, just like most of the actors in the movie.
