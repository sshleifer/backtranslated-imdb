May contain spoilers. This movie was the worst movie ever. I could not even see everything, it was so bad. This movie is actually worse than the Scarecrow Slayer that says a lot. This was worse than a terror toons, where at least terror toons was sometimes funny. Not even the blood in the movie was good. The shootings were wrong and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip it. If you see it in the rental business, walk the other way. There is nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie, take a look at the scarecrow night or the pumpkin head. If you want to see a new, cheesy movie, look at Scarecrow. I rate this movie at 0.2 out of 10. So awful is this movie really. The worst movie ever.
