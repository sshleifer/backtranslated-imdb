If you're looking for summer's feel-good hit, maybe Dark Harvest 2 is your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (looks like it was filmed with a Sony Handicam and edited with iMovie), especially the sound effects - they sound directly from a "Spooky Halloween Sounds" CD! The scarecrow from the cover, although it does not appear in the film and otherwise has no relevance, is frighteningly realistic! From beginning to end you will see a man aiming aimlessly for his daughters through a pun, MAIZE! At the height of the movie you'll see, well ... you have to take care of yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm really trying to say here is: do not go below 1000 feet of this movie. I rented it because I thought it was kind of "Troll 2", weird, but it's not like that. I cried after watching this movie because I realized that I had spent money on it (and I found the $ 4 I spent on borrowing). I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.
