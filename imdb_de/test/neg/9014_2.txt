Another gray, horrible bit of brawl from the Corman family. The first space capsule in the space crash lands on Earth again (with some of the worst special effects ever) and the pilot seems to be dead. But the bill can be deceiving. He's actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including a patronizing misogynistic old doctor (who was also really REALLY boring), a greasy guy who looks like he's been taking the hair oil market. Make a big impact, a scientist who never seems angry or angry when the old man is looking for the patroness, and a photographer with Farah Fawcett hairdo (of course, before Farah) and as much aliveness as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently everyone in the cast, including the women, was named Steve. Anyway, it turns out that the dead pilot Steve is not only alive but incubating baby aliens (or seahorses or shrimp or whatever) in his torso. The momma beast that has implanted these little creatures looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again I am impressed by the laughter of the monsters created by the House of Corman. The Venus spacecraft in It Conquered the World is still officially the worst and most ridiculous monster I've ever seen, but the Cormans always manage to deliver bad, cheesy-looking monsters. <br /> <br /> They have also managed to provide their other brands. that is, a boring, confusing plot, long gray shots (thank God Corman made most of his films in black and white, since his color still looks somehow gray) two or three places, stupid and lame props and special effects, and many, many boring dialogues. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you do not count the roasted parrot ... .. Cheers rang through the land, I'm sure the alien will tear off the old doctor's head and (seemingly) eat it.) Now it's in English It can also move the pregnant astronaut as if he were Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The monster's obvious intention is to rebuild its race using humans as food and huge uterus In the end there is a confusing piece (well, more confusing than usual) in which the creature tries to explain why it does that, but it does not make any sense at all, something in the footsteps of how humanity is doing It was never really said what it was, it could be anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows g is groaning instead of letting the alien shrimp crawl out of his body, and the oily guy (and the other guy) burns the parrot alien to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the smell of fried chicken .. Alien. End of the story where the rest of the characters migrate leaving their dead comrade on the ground to rot. Oh damn, why not save yourself the cost of a funeral? I'm sure that's what Corman thought as he tried to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
