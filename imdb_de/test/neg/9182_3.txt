This cartoon is not right, lol, I totally disagree with many of the things he has portrayed, even if it ended positively. But we and mine will not see it in our household, especially because we fight against stereotypes every day. The cartoon only confirms how most whites feel that blacks behave like that. <br /> <br /> The comment of one of the little black girls that was made on the cartoon was that her friend was so aware (he was white) that really offended me something that we, as blacks, easily realized Perceiving is a condition that blacks achieve when they realize their true ability
