Sometimes, when I hear that an A-List cast is put together in a movie for two hours, I hope and pray that it's good, not because of my $ 10 or 2 hours, but because of these actors. Career. Everything was lost in the case of "Be Cool". <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and a music officer played by James Woods in a car are talking about film episodes, and how most are not good. If you think that this scene was filmed just as Quentin Tarrantino shot his car scene in "Pulp Fiction" and listen to the dialogue, you can not help but wonder if this is 1) a disclaimer for the audience is movie will be crap or 2) trying to make the audience laugh about the humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel. Oh the irony! (If you wondered, Choice 1 is right.) The cool and smooth Chili Palmer from the first and good movie "Get Shorty" is revived to play a gangster music professional. He steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from her ghetto, a Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn), and makes her a singing sensation. Of course, a movie about an ex-gangster can never be complete without new gangsters causing havoc. This time around, the mobsters of choice are Russian, played by American actors who can not act Russian when my whole family beats their heads with their bare hands. <br /> <br /> As a Russian, I was not so offended by the way this film portrayed the Russians, as a writer I was more offended by the dreadful dialogue. This film was trying too hard to make the audience laugh. It became redundant from potentially good lines. The Russian, black and gay jokes were the same, which were reformulated only a few hundred times. After calling The Rock's character af ***** (he plays a gay bodyguard for Vince Vaughn) and Cedric the Entertainer's character ***** (he played a black rapper with an entourage that threatens those who are not play his tracks with guns) I wanted to go out of the cinema, because it was painful to sit through. If it was "Get Shorty," none of this would have had to be in the movie just to make a drama, or a really bad laugh. <br /> <br /> What was missing in this movie, which did not belong. "Get Shorty" was Chili's hot spice. In this sequel, he is a completely different person. For one thing, the old chili would have had more dialogue. John Travolta has no more than 20 lines in "Be Cool" because he is staged by the repetitive lines and the one and two cameo appearances of the most casual celebrities. I will not ruin the shock by revealing all the cameos for those who actually want to see this movie (PLEASE NOT !!!), but I will say that it will amaze me forever that these people were ready to to be in a movie movie of such insanity. <br /> <br /> What was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays the widower of James Woods, who is killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie LUCKILY). , Tarrantino has never made Pulp Fiction an idiot like the director of "Be Cool" he could play around with. This dance number was boring, long and just just pounding. The Black Eyed Peas, who played in the club with a total of 10 people, did not make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many storylines that I left the theater and wondered WHY ?! Everything about this movie was a big question mark. I just did not understand the meaning of anything. I could not even explain why the Russians were reaching for everything or why this movie was ever filmed because I'm confused. All I've taken out of this movie was that everyone in LA has a sidekick, and the movie was probably financed only by the ads of Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile and Trimspa Movie) and the Bad Screenwriters Guild. Plot holes, dumb dialogues, too many random cameos, terrible drama (even by professionals) and the not-so-fun attempt to imitate "Pulp Fiction" make this movie the worst film of 2005, and it's only the third month of the year.
