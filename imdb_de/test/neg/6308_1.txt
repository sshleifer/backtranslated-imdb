I have to say that I was surprised to find some positive comments on this turkey (in the desperate need of a spring graft)! I give him a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to throw out such garbage and be the "killer" does not deserve that! It's a good thing that it came late in his career ... they said Elvis had virtually ruined his career with the films he'd released in the 1960s! It's based on the book by Myra Gail Lewis and that's too bad to start with. It's a bad and inaccurate story from their life together with Lewis and there are much better books about the killer that could have made a much better and more interesting script. There are also a number of actors who do not know whether they are participating in a drama, a comedy or something of both. The otherwise so good actor Dennis Quaid plays with one of the worst achievements of an actor on many a moon! He walks around in the picture and talks about his "God-given talent," and as a spectator, one wishes oneself, he would also show some of it on the screen! Stupid gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this really horrible movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... except Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines. It's "grease" again and whenever Jerry Lee drives through Memphis in his convertible and has the radio in the car, the whole city dances away to the music! Everyone in this movie is like a cartoon character of real people ... from the wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a damn shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better, and I hope he took the $ 500,000 he got from the deal and told the company to commit himself ... twice!
