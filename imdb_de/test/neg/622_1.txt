Leave Ed Wood alone. Calling "Plan 9 from Outer Space," the worst film ever made, would be to deny its rightful title to this extremely vulgar bunch of Hollywood Guano. This pretentious fusion of witty and Baden sociopolitical "commentaries" actually seems to be in the form of "Plan 9", with poorly staged scenes of fortunate actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be shots of slaughtered and mass scenes that come from epics on a higher budget. While "Plan 9" is sometimes funny, if overall it should be entertaining, this kitsch pageant simply lacks the basic drama, with scenes that are offensive (the disgusting burlesque of Groucho Marx stealing Manhattan from the Indians). too low camp (Hedy Lamarr tries to embody Jeanne d'Arc when he hears her "voices")) too boring (Dennis Hopper does absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) for the unexpectedly poignant performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give Irwin Allen the worst directorial trophy because she has done so little in so little.
