Solomon and Sheba are in Hollywood not only because of the quality of the film, but also because of the fact that Tyrone Power died during the shoot, handed down. I was in fifth grade and well remember the huge news for days when this tragedy happened. I did not know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and appreciated the appreciation of his work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Ty had any sense for this movie and what Dudel proved it. He was also the unnamed producer. Maybe he just did not want to face the critics. It's a good thing that Power actually went out with witnesses for the prosecution, though you can see him in long shots, if you look closely. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical stew that would probably amaze the great Salomon himself. Several scriptural incidents that treat the Bible separately are pieced together, with Hollywood containing a few additions. <br /> <br /> The real story about the Queen of Sheba is that she made a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel, talked to Salomon a bit, returned with many merchandise and that was it. The story of a romance between her and Solomon is legendary. The ancient kingdom of Sheba is approximately where Yemen is now and its people were allegedly relocated to the African continent. So Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The queen never saw the famous case of Salomon, in which the two women with different claims represented a baby, nor was she involved in the construction of the first temple. Nor was she close to destroying them. Solomon was not. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the dispute over succession when Solomon's brother Adonijah filed a counterclaim. That's the heart of this movie. When Adonija learns that King David is dying, he declares himself king. Of course, David gathers temporarily and says that God came to him and said that Solomon should follow him. When David learns what Adonijah did, he says that this has resulted in God getting out of shape. Adonijah is greedy. After that, Adonijah begins to draw. <br /> <br /> Things seem to be closing in a circle where Ty Power collapsed on set as he dueled with George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, especially in Lloyds of London, which was the breakthrough role of Power. If Sanders is not the desiccated cultivator he was in Samson and Delilah, then he is still Sanders, the Biblical Kad. <br /> <br /> When Power died, Yul Brynner was brought to Solomon and thus received a wig of power in the distance could be saved. Brynner invests the dialogue with the proper dignity, but I think he probably regretted it when he hit the prize. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and seduces as a biblical seductress in the tradition of Cecil B. DeMille. She seems to have no real conviction, and I guess she was shocked by the sudden death of Power and had to do it all over again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can deliver the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> The actual story with Adonijah is not as detailed as this movie. He argued with Solomon for succession and gathered around a group of some of King David's court as supporters. Solomon pardoned her once and then Adonijah asked for Abishag in the marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David at his age. When Solomon hears this, he decides that Adonijah will again become greedy and have him killed. The Bible mentions someone named Berniah, who basically did contract hits on Adonijah's followers. <br /> <br /> What we have in the movie is a spectacular climax with a miracle I was looking for and could not find. It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor, who ended a long and distinguished career with a sour tone. It was a question of Vidor's attempt to play Cecil B. DeMille in the biblical spectacle. <br /> <br /> He did not make it.
