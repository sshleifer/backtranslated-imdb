This good-guy vs the evil tyrant story, set in Russia in the 19th century, may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves career beyond these "Hercules" films. Despite the different costumes, it is still a "Hercules" film with the usual stilted dialogues, random dubbing and cardboard figures. On the other hand, there is plenty of action, the tempo is rarely spellbound, and Reeves makes another scene in which he is dressed to the waist, tied with ropes and beaten vigorously, which of course has little effect on his defiant character.
