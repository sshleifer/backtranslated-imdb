Yes, this movie shows a girl named Jessica who says everything is evil and she also lets trees land on people (well, she just drops one tree, but she says everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently leases rooms to people, but otherwise offers little entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of a bad man. Of course, they do not know that until the owner of the farm helpers opens the box with his head. The head hypnotizes anyone he can so he can get to Jessica and use her powers to find things that help him search for his body. This movie has an interesting story, but it is very bad here. Everybody in this movie gets on your nerves at least once.
