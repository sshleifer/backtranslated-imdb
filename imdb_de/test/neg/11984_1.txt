Unfortunately, this movie accounts for about 1% of the hype the game created in 2004, leaving a very sour taste. For video game enthusiasts, book worms, and movie fans, there's nothing more disappointing than a movie based on an original concept (whether on paper or on a game console) and not delivering. And not only that works fine. Far Cry, the video game released in 2004, has created such a cult after a content-based movie had to be easy to make and a lot of players should have seen the movie. If you are a player who played Far Cry; do not watch this movie. Anyone else who has not played the game yet; It will still look like a B Grade Acted / B Grade Director. Uwe Boll, keep your head in shame ... that could easily have become a blockbuster. The story of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you have managed to integrate it into your horrific reconstruction of an instant classic. Video game companies are warned - when Uwe Boll knocks shut the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I'm looking forward to making up for you in Inglourious Basterds. What did you think you were doing? Sigh.
