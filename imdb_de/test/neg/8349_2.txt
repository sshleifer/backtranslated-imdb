As a geology student, this film shows the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone inside the burning house, it is less than a foot away from lava, which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is shown again when "Stan" rescues the underground 4. His shoes melt on the floor of the subway, while the rest of the team is just steps away from the flowing lava. And to end this monstrosity of a movie, they find the most illogical solution by stopping a lava flow with Z-K rails. Earlier in the film, a reporter's voice may be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow when firefighters have tried cars and CEMENT. Common sense dictates that this film is an absurd and gross understatement of human knowledge.
