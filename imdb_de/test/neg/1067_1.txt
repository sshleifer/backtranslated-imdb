The time I wasted this movie, I call back! I felt sick afterwards, but not because it somehow touched me. It's presumptuous to try to get the audience to feel bad for those involved, but I do not care. The characters are soulless and stupid. For some scenes, there is no explanation and leaves no thoughts to make your own explanation. All students in the film have problems, but since you do not feel for them, you do not believe their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can not, so I stop now. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this.
