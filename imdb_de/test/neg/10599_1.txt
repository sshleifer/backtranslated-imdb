I heard what people say, but I ignored them. When I was rushed to blockbuster, I grabbed a copy of this movie and ran away. <br /> <br /> After 45 minutes I struggled to stay awake. There are some attempts to keep the movie interesting, but it was just bad. There is a kind of hunting, but it was long and tedious - the perfect time for a snack. When the movie was over, I did not care when it ended. I just wanted him to finish. I go to my room and out again to see if it was over. <br /> <br /> The entire film is a clich√©, the characters and their relationships. The plot rotations are as predictable as the end. The actors made the most of really awful roles. Anyway, your clothes were nice, but the movie was just bad.
