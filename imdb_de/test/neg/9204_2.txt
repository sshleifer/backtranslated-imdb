An indefinite-future spacecraft equipped with spacecraft and laser weapons for weapons crashes on a strange young planet where dinosaurs also happen to be, and have not yet died out in this world. The survivors of the crash, about ten bland characters in blue, white and yellow suits, fight against the alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is a peculiar movie. As I said in my summary above, the movie's stop-motion animated dinosaurs are the only colorful actors. The models are coarse but effectively animated. And they are far more intriguing and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speech lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single revision. Obviously, most of the budget was spent on the dinosaurs, and though there's a fair share of it, it's not enough to save us from our boredom. These human characters are just there to scream, run around and mumble these poorly written and wordy speeches about survival. And unfortunately not nearly enough of them are eaten by the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is not a movie I'll see again. Some people will just love it because they are so cheap and so bad. Sometimes I enjoy movies like these. But this movie is just too long, too boring and very tiring for the mind.
