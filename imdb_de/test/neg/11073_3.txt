If it is true that the film cost only 150,000 pictures, that explains a lot. But it does not explain why there is no real conspiracy. In the middle of the movie I honestly did not care if they made it or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The end was really stupid and I wish I had just turned off the movie and gone to bed early. Pretty good acting, considering that not much was involved. If you enjoy really bad movies with awful lighting (even for a cave) and bad camera work (even for a cave), then you will like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 at the age of about ten, how could he forget to talk and build up so much trouble? Should not he have wanted help from the first people he saw, even if it was 14 years later?
