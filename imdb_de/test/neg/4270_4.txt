OK, that's enough. This is a terrible piece of television. The camera work is scary (do I have to remind you of the crisp gravel so loud that you can barely hear the actors speaking)? Lady Bertram has the most annoying voice in the world. anna massey 'acts' in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between Fanny and Edmund is beyond. Even the Bertram girls are not pretty enough, and the guy who plays Henry Crawford is terrible. To say that the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. I've looked at this adaptation over Christmas, and I think under other circumstances I would not have endured it, and I certainly would not have been able to justify the wasted time. I am a fan of faithful to Jane's adaptations. so i could not stand the film adaption or the last movie of pride and prejudice. but instead see another adaptation, even Emma is better than this.
