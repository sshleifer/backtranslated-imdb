"Catchfire" or "backtrack", as it is sometimes called, is not very good. This is bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this time. Why did she agree? I dont know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / kidnapper relationship is not credible, even though it's a common psychological phenomenon in real life A scene in which Hopper and Foster board a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle) This means that the traffic had to be stopped so that the bridge could be opened. I often had to wait for this bridge to go down, almost all on the bus. It is not a pleasant wait. This movie caused unnecessary bridge maintenance and the world is a worse place for it.
