Meet Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a nerdy young bookmaker who, with his boring life, wears down the numbers for the mob and lives in a bare basement apartment in a senior citizen center. His only rest is watching TV and occasionally Tryst with his quirky prostitute buddy Honey (Janeane Garofalo). But one day it all changes when the Mobboss is killed and the respected Cosmo is selected by smooth and convincing new boss Gordon (Robert Loggia) to become a full-fledged hitman. It is an offer that the reluctant Cosmo can not repeat, can not refuse, and he quickly trades his earthly, lonesome existence for a crash course of revenge under the guidance of veteran gangster Steve (Peter Riegert), a laid-back, suburban connoisseur It loves the maximum pay and minimum hours of the job. In no time Cosmo surprises both him and mentor Steve with an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work. Although he has never touched a weapon before, he turns out to be a crack-breaker and, after an initial wave of moral hesitation, a cool, distant killer. Soon, Cosmo will send Deadbeat customers with speed and style, and his natural flair with a weapon will soon make him an invaluable asset to Gordon's mob. <br /> <br /> However, the reality gets in the way when she spends one night massaged by Honey, Cosmo admits that he feels a little bit upset and recommends trying yoga to relax. Cosmo follows her advice and attends a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is immediately photographed with the friendly and gentle Jasmine, who soon attracts to Cosmo. If she can get rid of her annoying, abusive friend Randy (Josh Charles) now, maybe she and Cosmo can do something. With some of the "skills" of his new craft, Cosmo finally convinces that he has to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine decreases. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director M. Wallace Wolodarksy, a two-time Emmy Award winner The winner of his work on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons" has designed a script that connects his three genre-lovers: "I like comedies, gangster movies and romances," Wolodarsky explained, "so basically I beat up all three of these making this movie." What he came up with is a movie that is so disjointed and unlikely that it feels like a lot long sketch on Saturday Night Live looks like. It's a monotonous tone that does not accord so much with his droll sense of humor, as the fact underscores the fact that Jason Priestly has spent a lot of money on a vehicle to smash his handsome guy image innocently, not as a nerd, but as a character as a laconic zombie. A nerd may be naive, but a nerd has a passion. Passion for inward things. But Priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost as an anti-forrest gump. Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" does not have the sense of actually being against the Forrest Gump. <br /> <br /> Peter Riegert (Local Hero, Animal House) performs well as usual and Kimberly Williams does her best with what she has to do, but Janeane Garofalo (Larry Sander's HBO show) is in their role as Cosmos girlfriend virtually wasted. Probably not for long. Garofalo has all the excitement and charm of an apple waiting to be selected, and it's only a matter of time before she gets a meaty role and hopefully will do a tag team thing with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
