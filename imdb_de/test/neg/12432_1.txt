It starts off as a very serious social comment that quickly turns to other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. Who is the main character? Is this a serious movie or a Gregg Araki-Esquire about the best goofy movie? Is this a skate documentary with inserted moments of dialogue? I have no idea. I watched the clock and wondered when that shit would end. I always thought there would be a big shock climax that never came. I cut out of the movie for a good 20 minutes, rapping through the pointless skate scenes. Yes, it does not clarify the changing landscape between having. I understood it in the beginning again. Kids and Bully was so exhausted that I actually felt I was watching the realities of this group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and always acting poorer. Teenage Caveman, whom Larry did not write but direct, was terrible. But at least it felt like a horrible movie that did not take it seriously. Wassup Rockers was just bad.
