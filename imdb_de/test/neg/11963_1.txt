So, my boyfriend and our friend are shattering our local movie rental company and looking for something to accompany with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Remember that this is not just Scarecrow Three. that is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we both had seen the first two scarecrows and felt obliged to finish the work. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First, we see a picture of Ken Shamrock ("The Most Dangerous Man in the World") on the cover. Apparently he was used to market the film as a "lead actor". By the way, he has the lowest screen time of all members of the class. Next, we see a picture of a very attractive and scantily dressed woman in the middle of the lid. I can assure you that she is not in the movie at all. At the time of the rental we had assumed that this should repeat the fact that the scarecrow was "wild". In the background we noticed a big carnival on an island in the sea. I can also assure you that the carnival is not in the movie ... not at all. A review of me and my girlfriend should have known that something was going on. I mean, who the hell is putting a carnival on an island? Now for the actual movie. We begin when a young man inexplicably merges with a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield. Do not ask me how they were merged, but remember when Brandon Lee woke up in The Crow from the dead. It's just so stupid. But in defense of the scarecrow he has become "wild". Anyhoo, the scarecrow who now lives vicariously by the young man, is making a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who have wronged him. Yes, in the world of The Scarecrow, the beaches are conveniently located near corn fields. In short, the scarecrow kills all who are on its way without warning, except for the scarecrow's characteristic whistle, which signals a slash. However, this is hard to believe, as the scarecrow's mouth is clearly sewn shut. Several tracking shots that let Kubrick roll later in his grave and we have one of the worst third episodes of a series. Except maybe the third matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This scarecrow is wildly bad."
