Potential viewers are warned: The current IMDb viewer rating for "Tomorrow at Seven" is an anomaly of low turnout. It has an interesting premise: A murderer leaves a visiting card of ace of spades at the scene of his crimes while alerting the victim in advance. The execution, however, falls flat and to say that the film has its share of action holes, would mean that there is actually an action. Chester Morris portrays mystery writer Neil Broderick, who weaves elements of actual murderers from the Ace of Spades killer into his latest novel. Broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he has to pass the man's eccentric secretary - "If you line up his relatives, you would have enough nuts to hold a Ford together." This line makes him without further ado the daughter of the "nut" Martha (Vivienne Osborne), which offers the introduction. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson), just as this is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a courier this morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learn in the following scene, are the bold black form of the ace of spades with the words "At Seven Tomorrow Night". Well, whoever puts together a puzzle does not use the pieces in the beginning with contrasting colors! <br /> <br /> Initially, I was intrigued by Frank McHughs and Allen Jenkins, who were called to the Drakes residence as police officers. In general, their characters are colorful enough to provide real comic relief, but here they are just annoying. McHugh's Clancy, in particular, objects to his partner Dugan's unreasonable comments, and they usually go in the opposite direction if real difficulties crop up. <br /> <br /> Now here is a question - given the identity Why would he, as an ace killer, have invited a writer and a few policemen he had just met to flee to his plantation in Louisiana? Especially if at seven o'clock all parties were a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder was committed. However, it is not Drake who is dead, but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The early suspicion falls on pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe) after a light failure, but Henderson has still not reported the murder to his superiors until he arrives at Drake's plantation with everyone else. Can you imagine anyone trying to cope with it today, unless they were named Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> Since the cause of death has not yet been established, the local coroner is called, but the first one to show up (a Broderick accomplice) is a cheater. When the real coroner appears, he just disappears right after! In a second dark scene, a letter from the murder victim Austin Winters is read out. It is missed when the lights come back, and because it can point to the killer, it becomes a clue that needs to be retrieved. Where was the letter? Winters' daughter Martha grabbed it and sat on the mantle of the living room! How much was thought about? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the whole thing is so insane that Morris' character solves the case fairly easily. Although the movie is coming in less than an hour, it's almost a chore to watch all the nonsense. There is really only one humorous moment that needs to be repeated; Onboard the plane, the detectives exchange: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how many times are these things falling?" Clancy - "Once!" Apart from McHugh and Jenkins, I can not say that I've seen one of the other players in the films of that time, even though I'm a fan of most of the "B" mystery movies from the 30s to 50s. Fortunately, it is much cheaper for the couple to secure Humphrey Bogart in a stupid 1938 jewel - "Swing Your Lady," which is intended for laughter. The best thing I can offer about "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters midway, though that turkey - "This is just a stupid waste of time".
