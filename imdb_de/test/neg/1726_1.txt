Like many others, I have relied on Dennis Hopper not being a waste of time. I was wrong. Everything negative about this movie is more than true. However, what costs the cake is the terrible, terrible story for the main character. <br /> <br /> Here is the reason: The planet could be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover from it, so that ALL humankind can be saved By them, there are so many wise, capable, nice, competent people to bring in an underground hiding place. And Dennis Hopper is the only visionary / scientist who has prepared for the worst and has realized this. But what is the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo)? He is angry because Dennis has decided who should be saved or doomed to fail! Stevens has clearly stated that Dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger, but he was laughed at. The Hopper character was the boy with his finger in the dike, and now Stevens blames him for selecting and selecting ??? And if that's not enough, he wants to prevent anyone from entering this hiding place because "it's not fair !?" AND .... he is responsible for the death of one who is the Redeemer of humanity! Oh my god, how stupid can you become? <br /> <br /> What's also amazing is that IMDb forces you to write at least ten lines about this piece of crap. I mean, TWO MILLIONS in the household, what could have been done with it? Think of office workers, Blair Witch and many other films that were made for under $ 100,000 and were still better. AAAAARGH! I'm lucky I did not pay a penny to see this crap, and when I have to settle down at the end of that loud, superhuman craps is one of the most heroic things I've done this year. No wonder that the authors of this dungheap had previously worked as a cameraman and title designer ...
