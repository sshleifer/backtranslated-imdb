There is potential with "Tell No-one". A curious and fascinating plot and a French version of a very American story. But for me the opportunities were not used here. <br /> <br /> Although I liked aspects of the movie, there were three noticeable mistakes that put it down four out of ten times. <br /> <br /> First, it's a stupid, clich√©d murder mystery. A particularly invented Murder She Wrote or Bergerac. Being French does not eliminate this problem - it's just stupid and in French at the same time. It is full of implausible coincidences. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the transition from the US to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor hangs out on "the streets" of a French town with his new "Homies" and their blingin 'SUVs ... and then there are the chases ... <br /> <br /> it's just too damn long , For me, a movie needs a good reason to be well over 90 minutes, and over two hours requires a serious justification. This did not happen once.
