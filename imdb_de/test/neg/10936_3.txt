I went into this film with low expectations, knew Uwe Boll's legacy as a director and scriptwriter, and was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every movie he's involved in worse and worse. The overall concept was not bad, a man who is bored by his life as a stockbroker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the film is that there is no in between, he goes straight from the stockbroker to the serial killer. The film has actors without names, and I can see why, after watching the movie, I can not see why an actor with a career wants to be involved in this film. Anyone who rejected it did a favor to their careers. And if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and do not do it. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony a 3 out of 10 points
