I'll write that 10 minutes before the end of the movie. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film will end. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough that a rabid dog in a small town is at liberty killing people. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Uh ... no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that should not really have been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. Why? Because it is boring! The first 45 minutes try to give the main characters depth and create tension. However, it takes too long (half the movie!) - the characters are unlikely and we never care about them anyway, and it creates almost no suspense. The simplest movie (after action and time) to compare it with the classic cheeks. Everything that makes Jaws right makes Cujo wrong. Jaws created good characters and a real sense of fear. Cujo does not. Jaws creates a fearsome, scary villain in his shark. Cujo has a filthy Saint Bernard running over growling and jumping, and not much else. Jaws is exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless boredom that remains predictable until the end. <br /> <br /> Confusing is also the abundance of subsoil only serving as boring red herrings for the main plot of the movie. This movie was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director that could have been good. But it was not like that. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> People here say this is one of the King's best adjustments - I'm sorry you could not be wrong anymore. The fog is a hundred times better, the thinner is ten times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good! This is one of the worst in my opinion! The only good thing was that the action scenes with the dog looked real, even though they were boring. <br /> <br /> Movies ended now and it did not get better. Avoid.
