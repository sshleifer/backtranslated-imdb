Anyone who rates this movie over a 3 has a very distorted view of movies, everyone who shs that piece of! T rated 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for his taste in movies and doubted he ever saw a good one. I'm always ready to film every movie, and I made a movie with it. I tried to pay attention, I tried not to waste my money but 15 minutes in my friends laughed at me for listening to my ipod 25 minutes later I could not even look at the delusion that was happening in the Movie was playing, so I went back and forth, I've never gone out of a movie, up to this garbage. Anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar. or they should be excluded from this site. I get so angry when I see a person rating this as 8 if the overall rating of Godfathers is 9.1. It's like saying that the movie was close to what it is not.
