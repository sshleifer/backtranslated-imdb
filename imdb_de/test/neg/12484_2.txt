Yes, what did I expect? I thought this was a movie about young adults at their watershed, like "Sun Alley" or "American Pie", which I really liked. I wanted to watch a funny movie, maybe with an ironic look at the idyllic Würzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Attention, spoilers in front of us! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good indication of what will inevitably follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his lyrics and tried to hide this fact by improvising and simply repeating what he said earlier. But since I consider Bleibtreu to be one of the better German actors, I believe that this effect was really intended. I think the author wanted to show how boring talking with close friends can be - especially if they are stoned. But I do not need a cinema to be bored by the conversation of stoned friends. Boring dialogues make up most of this movie. <br /> <br /> But okay, that's one thing. I can deal with it, I have seen beautiful films with hideous dialogues, just think of Schwarzenegger's life's work. But next, the characters are cheap and flat and the plot is as predictable as anything else. Just one example (SPOILER !!): Why do you think someone brings a garden hose to his hemp plants deep in the forest? To pour it? Of course not, usually you will not find any water pipes deep in woods, right? The only reason this water hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists harvest their textile can be drugged, maltreated, and eventually filled with three bottles of janitor. I really hated this scene because it's really violent. Normally I do not mind violence in movies - slapstick comedies are full of it. But in this kind of comedy, there is a silent agreement between the movie and you that people will not be hurt if they fall on their faces or are hit with chairs or the like. However, if this happens in a movie that is otherwise realistic enough, slapstick scenes also appear real. In this particular scene in Lambskin, I really thought that this hunter must be badly injured, if not dead. The last scene really made me feel like he had to die there, completely filled with more alcohol, with each one can handle. And the protagonists just go away. It would have been different if the author had consistently followed a style; The scene could have been pretty funny. <br /> <br /> When you talk about being consistent - that's what I missed most about this movie. The whole movie seems to be a collection of small episodes that came to mind to the author. Things just happen for no apparent reason - yes, I know, that's life, but it's not a cinema because cinema is supposed to tell a story and show no boring episodes without meaning. I asked myself, "Where's the point?" the whole time. Characters except the two main characters are not elaborated on, you never know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend Kai, in fact, she says, but I could not buy it at all. I think she was there just to give Kai the opportunity to play this childish Aids test sketch that you've probably seen a thousand times and mostly better. The friend of the protagonist you met once leaves Germany (which you do not even see and the guy does not seem to care), and finally, in one sentence, she mentions that she met someone in America and shares the movie Protagonist. It seemed to me as if the author wanted to tie some loose ends. He did not really do it, you never really learned what's so bad about studying law and being daddy's son (Daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which makes him one of the nicer ones Characters made in the whole movie) and live in the beautiful Würzburg. Even dinner with Daddy's friend, who might show how terrible it is to meet his father's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with the family friends (except for the guy the guy's on But I think to show that eating with parents before eating is not healthy was not the purpose of this scene (if any), I have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this and I could not understand a single character in the whole movie, it just seemed flat and implausible. <br /> <br /> All this made the movie a not-so-good movie, but not one I care about There would be some good scenes (most were not new, like those with nice and sympathetic policemen), some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and I like Bleibtreu, although he repeated his well-known song this time again stereotypes. Not good, not disgusting, I thought, after the movie was half over. <br /> <br /> But then came this incest scene and I found that really disgusting. Incest is just not funny. I do not even know if that should be funny, some people laughed, so it could have meant it. This scene has spoiled the whole movie for me, I could feel no sympathy for the protagonist - I can not feel compassion for someone who fucks a helpless guy, for me the rape and rape is not funny. So it could have been a hint of drama, but the incest is never mentioned again (though we felt that this might have been one reason for the protagonist to leave Germany in the end, but never being mentioned again) we're not. "It's completely unnecessary, I almost expected the sister to get pregnant at the end, which would have just given that tasteless tale the finishing touch, but not even this last cliché is fulfilled, like in this movie It's not really funny, it's not drama, it's not a road movie a la Tarantino at all, despite desperate attacks, it's definitely not fun. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. Look "Final Fantasy", that's bad too, but at least with nice pictures and not so tasteless.
