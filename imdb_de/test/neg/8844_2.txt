I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into intellectual romantic films. This movie just did not move me. I felt like an hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor who loses almost everything. I found the whole movie just sad and depressed. If you like tragedies, you CAN maybe. I just thought it was too long, which meant that there were many unnecessary scenes that ultimately led to an hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, then look at Titanic.
