This was a horrible short film that tried to be funny in a dark way, but was not funny at all. Say at a film festival in Chicago. It's really what the title says and I just was not there at all. The bad storytelling was what it did. If you rewrote and rewrite it, it might work. This attempt fell into "the hole". Terrible filmmaking.
