I saw the first 10 minutes of this show. A worst show on TV. It is not even funny. It is so lame that it is disgusting. I gave it a second and third change could not even stand for five minutes. Do not waste the time. This is one of the many shows that must go bye. Speaking of regular night shows that have to go. All shows on CBS. All shows on ABC. All shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All shows in the new CW network. All shows on NBC (Accept The Law and Order series). All morning and afternoon talk shows. All court broadcasts. And every reality show out there !! Any stupid game show. Period the end! All home improvement shows! And all media news. Everything it is. Is a 24-hour loop with bad news. Yes, I have Favorite Monk, The Law and the Commands, that's for me.
