This movie has a rating of 7.0 at IMDb, so I even felt something rotten in its summary. I decided to give it a try. What a waste of 100 minutes. Above all, the 80s was not a good decade for crime and thrillers. Most of them were dumb with stupid plots (if they had one), so there are few who can stand out, and even if they were good, they are still not very good. The hit, however, suffers from everything that has made stupid criminal images stupid. It has a bad character development, an improbable action and was not written or addressed in a decent manner, and if you have such shortcomings, acting does not help. Stephen Frears often tried to simulate the French new wave in the English style, and the two do not fit together. <br /> <br /> First of all, Terence Stamp is hiding for 10 years because he has pronounced crime against some of his former partners. He is hiding in Spain, of all places. He is finally caught up and kidnapped by a group of dumb-looking Spanish thugs, just pushed away a bit by the two heroes to deal with him. These two are John Hurt, who is said to be tough, an icy killer, and Tim Roth (in his first role) as an apprentice to the devil. They do not kill Stamp immediately, they first have the "three Amigos", they should not have hired, and then they drive Stamp to Paris, because one of the buddies he's voicing against wants to confront him. OK that is possible. But even though Stamp is such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four men to overwhelm him, they do not tie him, make him in no way incapable, and ride around with him as if he were one of his friends. Stamp does not contradict and happily goes to Paris to get shot without taking half a dozen chances. These "professionals" offer him an escape. It seems Tim Roth is just a schoolboy who makes the idea that the boss of a big crime brings him together with a hard killer like John Hurt, which is even more unlikely, especially with such an important job. But as John Hurt himself is not such a hard core, he spends twenty minutes of film killing or not killing the totally surplus Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose sole purpose in this film is the adorable Laura Del Sol his lover, (who he says is 15, but looks more like 25), and her role in the story and acting skills suggests that she was offered the role, only because of the then lover the director or producer. After much deliberation, Hurt kills the Australian but takes his mistress with him for no apparent reason. Then he wants to kill her, but Roth with his "subtle ways" convinces him not to do it, and even if she kicks him, bites and scrapes through the entire movie, he stays true to this deeply buried human side. <Br /> <br /> Then there are just idiotic scenes, like when Hurt and Roth lock the car from the outside, to prevent the people inside out?!?! Nevertheless, the film continues. Tim Roth falls asleep guarding Terence Stamp with his gun on his chest. Stamp is just waiting to watch the waterfall. Then all the confusion of a conspiracy comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hours and 20 minutes goes out the window. Let's summarize, the key point not to kill Stamp right away (besides having a movie) is to take it to Paris. His former partner has one last word with him. And the whole point where he does not run away is that he's ready to die saying, "It's just a moment, we're here, then we're not here, we're somewhere else ... maybe, and it is Why should we be afraid? "But my friends, this is where the plot turns, Hurt kills the man while he's still in Spain, and we ask why he bothered for days and turned around, he had it in the first 15 minutes, and the stamp is contrary to his philosophy Very afraid to be killed, so we ask again why he did not run, and he had many opportunities. Roth is also being killed, but he should not be in the movie at all, and Del Sol, well, she's promised a role in this movie for purely romantic (sexual) reasons, so she stays alive even if she's attacked Hurt 15th time in the movie. He killed everyone else, but not her, she must have a maximum appearance on the screen. The movie was created with a shoe-string budget and shows, but if you have no story and card characterizations, it shows even more. And yes, Fernando Ray appears and goes through the movie as a guest star with a single audible line dialogue. Dreadful
