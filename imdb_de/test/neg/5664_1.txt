I watched the Halloween episode ... oh my god, I wanted to die. Acting was just awful. The lines were pronounced absolutely without conviction. It's also a bad idea for a show. I mean, who would watch such a web show in real life? Miranda Cosgrove has been great in a supporting role in Drake and Josh, but does not have the strength of character to anchor her own show. I'm still upset because their departure is a major reason why Drake and Josh stopped. She was approached with her own show ... She jumped on Drake and Josh. They decided that maybe they would do something with Drake and Josh, who went to college, which explained the loss of Meagan as a character, but Drake had already thought about doing bigger and better things, and he considered 'whether Miranda could do it' why. The best part of the show was the theme song ... a catchy, good melody in a swamp of mediocrity. Of course, Drake Bell synced the voice of Miranda and wrote the melody ...
