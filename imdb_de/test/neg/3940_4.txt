Stay Alive is a mellow horror movie about a video game that kills people the way they die in the game. The friends who play this game will quickly find out and then find that they have to defeat the Blood Countess from the video game or accept their fate. We had videotapes in The Ring, a deadly website in FearDotCom. Now it's about video games. Stay Alive does some good things; Character development is a bit deeper than in a horror movie. We really see some of the characters' emotions and past lives and get to know them pretty well so that the audience can gain emotions for them. The movie is also very exciting. Through the film often tense, annoying moments are played, accompanied by disturbing, scary music. There are many jumps and kicks for the viewer. This may be perfect once or twice, but these fake horrors, which Hollywood nowadays seems to surpass in horror movies, are getting thin in Stay Alive. The camera tends to have sharp angles or fast flashes to give the viewer a quick look at a demon or a witch, and tries to scare them away with this sudden outburst on the screen. Why? Due to the film certificate, the Gore is obviously very weak. The script for Stay Alive is very cheesy and quite ridiculous, and the characters play it too melodramatic and confusing. Clich√©s also come in from all directions, for example, people wandering alone in search of a strange sound, or when they have discovered a figure in the dark, go in search of them. However, the computer graphics used for the video game segments is quite impressive and looks colorful and sharp and works well with the other parts of the movie. Overall, this film is not enough. At a little more than a hundred minutes, it will not be a fight for survival, but for waking up.
