It seems at least vaguely possible that this film was "The Sopranos" as inspiration. Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a drummer who has so many problems from his past and his job that he is in therapy trying to cope with everything. At its 10-year high school reunification, everything comes to a head. The problem was that by the time Blank reached reunification, Blank had stopped looking after me. Honestly, I found this movie only from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He had potential. There was a reasonably good cast, led by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd. He played Grocer, his arch-rival in hit-man business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blanks high school he got up on prom night, and a limited role for Alan Arkin as dr. Oatman, Blank Psychologist. However, this pretty talented cast never really seemed to come together. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked humor. What I thought would be the best potential to be a comedy act was Grocer's suggestion for uniting a batsman, but apart from turning it into a joke, the idea was never really developed. As for romance, one wondered why Debi even thinks of leaving this guy in her life again. <br /> <br /> There was a handful of giggles, but nothing really caught me and held me and I spent most of my time wondering if this thing would ever start to click. It never did - at least not for me. 2.10
