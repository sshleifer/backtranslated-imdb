Technically, this movie is shit ... lol. It is also funny though. Whether it's intentionally funny or not, I do not know. Terrible in every way, it's also the only movie that I know that he plays 1) a fat kid, played by a slender actor in a (very obvious) thick suit, 2) an attractive 30 year old actress who plays a character who should do this in the late 60's, and 3) most compliments for plastic daisies of all time. Do not take this movie seriously, just look for laughter ... a great party movie.
