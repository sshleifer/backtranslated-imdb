I went into this movie and hoped for an imaginative twist on Second Coming. Boy, I was wrong. BBC are fools of running through a movie, total idiots in creating excitement, fools of building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how BBC shit. Uh, the creeping and time-consuming, tedious dialogue was only painful if he had to prevail. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I kept looking at my watch, wondering when the pointless, monotonous vehicle would end. They wereted an absolutely good actor in the lead role because the material is so lazy and sloppy written. All that happens is just to kill time. <br /> <br /> From 155 minutes only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial end). Too bad. Reading the plot is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the "Am I God" endless blah blah blah, the stupid doornails boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK THIS MIST
