If you loved the early '60s version of The Time Machine, you should not waste time. As with last year's "Planet of the Apes" this was "re-thought" and not for the better. And just like "Planet ..." is his main actor sadly suspicious and leaden; Guy Pearce, a terrific actor of wide range, is completely wrong for this role and gives a one-note performance that does not cause any sympathy. He is so grumpy and serious, and he lacks respect for the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that for a moment you do not believe he is experiencing them. Worse, whose idea was to resemble the love child of David Spade and Calista Flockhart? A handsome actor, here he is disgustingly haggard, which, believe it or not, is a big distraction. Honestly, the man looks very ill and is cruelly photographed. He absolutely does NOT share chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that does not match someone else's. Unfortunately, even with a real lead actor, this film has no chance, as it is fatally burdened with both a totally inappropriate director - entire scenes go nowhere and are poorly implemented - and a script that is totally inferior, scattered, and sometimes incoherent - you're interested Not for a single moment for someone in this movie, for the fact that NOTHING of character development is NOTHING in the way! In the original you had to KNOW the Eloi, so you feel for them and feel their terror in front of the Morelocks; Here, as the film emphasizes several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. If you are not a member of PETA, frightened sheep are the stuff of entertainment! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is as good as possible in her movie debut, but like everyone else in this mess especially Jeremy Irons (when he's the leader of the Morelocks [who like "The Reject" of The Mummy Returns Why is he looking like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) FULLY USED, wasted the money spent on the endless "special effects" that the $ 70 million spend on the film , obvious and unconvincing, and then there is the look of the film: poorly photographed, its artistic direction and sets are simply "there" and its costumes are typical in design - there are no original thoughts or ideas behind or on the screen. Above all, it's not even fun! (The filmmakers use the now ubiquitous Orlando Jones as a "comic relief," but as usual, Jones is irritated, and how survived his electric-powered r character in a world that seems to be without electricity?) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an empty, lifeless, boring, sterile and confused affair: have not you "REMAKE" Planet of the Apes? ?? (At least THAT was lucky enough to have some strong performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The last insult (beyond a head-shaking, terrible, not to mention the end)? They not only show the changing clothing store figures, but also make the time machine itself an anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome hole! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, it would look like this.) Poor ...
