This is the perfect example of how a great book becomes a bad movie. The direction just gives the impression that the film was made when they were playing along and Patrick Swaze is made of wood so that you can almost see the puppet strings on his body. Spy V's spy films are not - or should not be - chases and shootings, the bad guys in these movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters, even if they come up close. <br /> <br /> Even the action shots are just a clich√© with the usual sidewalks and yawning through tables and chairs. <br /> <br /> I went halfway and turned off - completely bored.
