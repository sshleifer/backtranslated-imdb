I have read many books in my short lifetime, but this is by far the WORST !!! I was just finished reading this worthless trash and when I finished, I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me explain the reasons! 1.The soldier dies. Why should the author let the soldier die ?! Why could not she keep him alive, as a good love story writer would? I salute Patty deeply that he's been trying to rip this FBI agent's eyes out. <br /> <br /> 2.Ruth get's fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) gets fired and for no apparent reason! She tried to console Patty, and then Patty's SOB dad fired her without good reason! Ruth, Anton and Patty were the only points of light in the book. Oh and the grandparents too! 3. The perm Yes. The perm Now, you may think, why would the perm disturb you? Well, here is why. Patty's mom asks the girl if she wants her hair ready. Patty says no, but the mother calls Mrs. Reeves (the terrible barber) and asks her to give Patty a perm. Why on God's green earth would she do that ?! Why does a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm, just to get her anyway? The mother always pretends that Patty has a say, if she has no say at all !!! She was to receive the "Worst Mother of the Year Award" for what she gave Patty. Thank goodness, Ruth cut off her perm! 4. Discrimination, racism and prejudice. I hate the discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too often. Yes. I know that the blacks were free at that time but basically had no rights. Why do today's children teach this word! It just teaches them how to discriminate against people. Not only black people were discriminated against, but also the Chinese. In the book, people refer to Mr. Lee as "The * Beep." That's really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis, I hate the city for spitting on a little girl. What's wrong with her, she likes Anton, she's a 12 year old girl !!! is a good book, no mess! I'm surprised that this movie is not considered "dirty" like "Lolita". 5. Patty, who is going to a reformatory, Patty should not have gone to this reformatory.References are for thieves and murders, not innocent 12-year-olds! The teacher or whatever she was called Patty, a thankless, spoiled brat Patty should get a civil service or something, she did not do anything wrong, she only helped a friend, 6. Favortisem: The parents played with her boyfriend Favor children Patty, her first born daughter, is clearly the worst, while Sharon that f five-year-old brat, her favorite daughter is. The father says that he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but clearly forgets his other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. The father. I hated him! He was so mean that Patty could have had Hitler as well as her father. Her father beats her for no apparent reason, and the way he talks to her at the end will drive you crazy enough to get caught thinking "Patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> Now you have it peoples. 7 reasons why I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "Anne Frank's Diary" or something else, because I warn you, it's very depressing and will really drive you crazy! The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of Anton, Patty, Ruth and the grandparents!
