When I saw this movie, I could only think: What a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I've seen a lot of films, but this is certainly one of the worst ever. I do not care if a volcanic eruption under downtown Los Angeles is possible or not. Maybe it's not like that, but even as if this could be a good movie ... but it certainly is not and I'll explain why. I do not know how much lava flows From an average volcano, but what I know is that the volcano in this movie makes Vesuvius, Mount Etna and Pinatubo look like a little barbecue together. I do not think that ever so much lava has emanated from a volcano as in this movie. I'm sure the director spent a lot of money on his film, but I'm really wondering why he spent all that on the special effects and not on the script and the actors. I'm not saying that he should have set a top cast, but that's really the opposite of what I would call good play. Their performances are so incredibly bad that it makes the whole movie even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script, you probably wonder. Can you tell me who thinks people are standing a few feet or even a few feet from the lava without being burned or hiding for the heath? Or people who sink into the earth when the lava flow is not even two feet high? <br /> <br /> I'm sure I would not be proud to write such a script, but obviously there are scriptwriters in Hollywood who are not interested in credibility as long as they pay good money! Very good money !!! <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie, you'll probably agree that this is one of Hollywood's worst disaster movies and worth no more than 3/10.
