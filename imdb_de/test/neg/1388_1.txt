... if you have laughed too much for a long time and need a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, I decided to turn it on and check for myself Everything that each of these people has said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half-hour version of Mad TV, but with some kind of bad jokes. <br/> <br/> One sketch I had bad luck was "The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics". What's funny about black guys who have difficulty swimming, or a gay guy named "Sparkles," who wins a banana food contest? None of these concepts is particularly novel, enlightening or amusing. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every week? This film came out like 30 years ago. Mencia's solution to funny things is to raise some clich√©s about Hispanics and throw in a few "beaners"; and call it a day to go home and roll around in his pile of money. Pure comedy. <br /> <br /> Then in a second show, which I had a look at, he scratched Jeff Foxworthy with a "Your gay if ..." piece. You could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he sat down in a Ryan Seacrest-is-gay joke. It's not that both have already been killed. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. Especially if there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle, who make fun of race and racism and are nevertheless enlightening.
