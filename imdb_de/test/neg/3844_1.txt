Obviously, the comments on the film about the movie were made by someone who belongs to the crew. I can not remember ever seeing a movie that runs counter to talented actors or viewers. In my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one I've ever left. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to the Producer: It's never funny to hunt people for race. Nice that you've tried to be politically correct by including all races, but you're still chasing people based on race, and that's sick.
