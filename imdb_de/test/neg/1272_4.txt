And again I find myself in the minority. <br /> <br /> I did not like these. This is the ONLY Varney work I have not accepted, including Knowhutimean. Slam Dunk Ernest appreciates the merit of being the worst of the line, but this is a clear contender for this dubious title. <br /> <br /> This work is too crude and too low to be lovable. Kindness was one of the key components of Ernest, and this element was completely lost here. Unfortunately, most people think that this is the best of the series, but if you love the essence of Ernest and Ernest, you will realize what I am referring to in this fifteen minute work. It was too blatant to be fun. <br /> <br /> It rates 3.5 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
