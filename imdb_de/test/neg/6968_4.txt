I have recently seen the autobiographical film Glen or Glenda by Ed Wood Jr. for the first time after hearing about it for so many years. Nothing I read or heard about this film could prepare me for what I saw. This must be the most bizarre movie ever made. Buffalo fall, women in bondage, Satan danced around and Bela Lugosi only wandered as far as possible: "Bevare, Bevare ... pull the cord, pull the cord ...", it was completely crazy. The drama was cruel and the dialogue was unintentionally funny, just as one would expect from an Ed Wood movie. Even so, horrible as that movie was, I have to get Wood to loan ... he was way ahead of his time. One must remember that transvestites were not even publicly discussed in this film, let alone a film theme. I read that Wood was a transvestite in real life, and I'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. It was sad to see that Bela Lugosi said the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was kind of Ed Wood Jr. to give Mr Lugosi at least some time in Bela's life a job when he was destitute was and a drug addict and nobody else in Hollywood would hire him. If you have never seen this movie, you must see it, especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
