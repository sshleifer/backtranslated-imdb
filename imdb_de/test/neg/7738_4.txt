Because they all only see MST3K with their artificial friends who (usually) do not make so funny and obvious comments about movies. And that's the only way these people watch them and then comment and vote in the IMDb just because they're not even trying to see the movie themselves. <br /> <br /> I was watching This movie is on its own, I did not read the reviews first, I did not have some people to laugh about, I just got the DVD (bought for the flip side Morons From Outer Space, an old favorite) and watched <br /> <br /> Of course, I somehow knew what I'm getting into if it's a Golan Globe movie by Albert Pyun, but usually they can be quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film is a not too heavy burden on the brain Alice in the story of the bunny hole that was made so many times and resembled in their basic structure (but wholly in content) Warlords of Atlantis, another entertaining B -Movie. <br /> <br The voice was annoying, but that's the idea they even stick with a few lines in the movie. <br /> <br /> The hero had one of the worst voices / accents in English fi It may not be a good movie, but it's not a really bad movie, it's just a bit like an average B-movie DTV Film, nothing too new, nothing too outstanding and would probably be more of a younger age group (about 7 to 14 years) than I would be enjoyed. It's a bit of carefree imagination. <br /> <br /> Will I see it again, probably not about 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> Do not be so keen in a movie because some dolls have also told you that this movie is not serious and it's certainly not a troll 2 or space mutiny
