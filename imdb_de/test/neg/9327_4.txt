I do not like to admit it, but they were right to dismiss Schrader. Here is the opportunity to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. It was not done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The direction was very bad. Schrader was overwhelmed and it shows. I have seen it several times in the hope that there is at least one salvation function. But no, nothing. The next phase will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will stay fine alone. If you want to know what the best follower of The Exorcist was, read 'Legion', written by Blatty, it must be the best copy of an original piece to be printed. Unfortunately, it was not translated very well for the screening, and I doubt it could ever be possible. As for Dominion, beginning. Avoid at all costs.
