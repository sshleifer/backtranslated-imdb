I am not tired of finding "a social value". Whatever book or movie people want to suppress, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness to Deep Throat or the latest hostage-taking, I sincerely wish they would not. I am not a lover of pornography or violence as entertainment, but what I dare to do, I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, almost to the exclusion of fear or tickle, sometimes even disappeared intent of filmmakers or actors. Even from footage that reasonable people might say never existed, I always think there's something to learn. I wonder more about how a movie works than what it does. Maybe that's wrong with me. Smarter, but more difficult than deconstructing awkward cinema, it might be to see cuts, pans, etc. inseparable from any content. I wonder what horror film makers and church architects have in common. Include in political filmmakers, fascist and not. Everyone manipulates light, space and sound to change their perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities to use as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I did not watch it for nearly a year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I tried a few minutes from "1" on the day it arrived to the clumsy street corner, which really seems to be an attack on the movie viewer's sensitivity, and found it inappropriate but effective. I would certainly have to come back to that, but the view did not please. Obviously, this was not the sublime horror of Cairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the rougher but traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the frank political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant cruelty of early Cronenberg. <br /> Maybe this word "attack" is the key. Matsumura does not attack his characters, but his audience. I can not look at this at this point in the story without remembering both Abu Garib (who I believe I showed on video) and the hostage videos, as well as Godard's torturer (in Le Petit soldier?), Against the atrocities is only a job, a fraction of a person's working day. And then there's the long news story from California, California, whose details I can barely remember, but which I can not quite forget, because it also includes "Cinema," a notorious duo of serial killers, if the suggestion does not match mine Memory plays because he recorded himself on video to torture victims. <br /> <br /> All three ANL entries are revenge movies, Vigilante exercises, but I attach these notes to ANL3 because this is the most ambitious and is a turning point for director Matsumura. (I did not see the posts following ANL3.) The first two offers introduced me to a camera that had fallen into the hands of one of those middle-school or middle-school marginalized children obsessively writing war scenes or other atrocities , (Or, as if one of Matsumura's vindictive characters had become a director, anyone who does not see that, who has not seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would like it.) But ANL3 seems to be mainstream. Matsumura's protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing some of Japan's typical cool close-ups of nature. For the first time in a Matsumura film, there is also a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's boss sneaks in and starts petting him while he watches the customers of the love hotel. Kikou finds himself unhappy in between. He is a middleman voyeur. The short thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism. There's even a philosophical-poetic garbage-seeker, a garbage voyeur who somehow reminds me of the poem that sounds in Wakamatsu's need-at-all-what-it-there, like Go, Go, Second Time Virgin. <br /> <br /> I can not get nowhere with that and it's in the way of commenting on other films. I can not shake the suspicion that a few years later I am entering a Matsumura retrospective in my local movie archive, perhaps hosted by a scholarly character who has got hold of something I miss. <br /> <br /> How much is it important for the director to get his deadly confused protagonists or simply "get" them? Does he even have to understand her? Maybe it's the job of a director to spit it out and get it overruled by critics, sociologists, and the rest of us. Maybe the direction or artistic responsibility is a wrong idea. <br /> <br /> In my last fight with this thing, I wondered what on earth a woman thinks when she looks at these overwhelming male exercises. We go through women over and over again, from Star Wars to et cetera and et cetera and so on and so forth and so forth, but is everything as masculine as the All Night Longs?
