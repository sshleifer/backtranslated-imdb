I do not understand why someone wastes their time or money with so much garbage ... Do not get me wrong - I LOVE a good western - I said "GOOD" - that's just garbage [br /]> <br / > Acting is terrible - Val Kilmer needs to know someone or owe a favor or something for them, just to use his face and name in this ridiculous bitch ... <br /> <br /> For those of you who Having enjoyed this movie, I make a list of your names to make sure I DO NOT see everything you suggest - our tastes are definitely different, but it is your right to express your opinion no matter how far from the base It is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 just in case it throws everyone out and does not count them. Only bad in all areas.
