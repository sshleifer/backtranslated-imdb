I have seen DEATH MACHINES on DVD as part of BCI Eclipse's Drive-in Cult Classics (with releases by Crown International Pictures). As I work my way through the numerous DVD sets, I will love more and more films from Crown International - especially the scary, erotic and psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEATH MACHINES is not one of them. <br /> <br /> After watching movies like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say that this is the worst movie ever made; But it does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy; really no story to talk about. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is not obvious? Only the actor responsible for the terribly played Tony (with the thick, fake Italian accent) made every attempt to "come into character". <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is why ... what forced the filmmakers to make this movie? <br /> <br /> Did you remember the story: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing crime bosses, 3) a minor character of Bartender / Karate students; and 4) his miserable nurse was so captivating that the world would not be complete without this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time and money for you, me, the producers, writers, actors and the director.
