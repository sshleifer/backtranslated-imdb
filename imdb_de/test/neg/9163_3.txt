When I finally saw this movie recently, it turned out that it looked just like that at first sight ... another Hollywood CG / live action reissue of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable. It's designed in every conceivable way to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, using uncompromising tools such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of Theodore's butt. <br /> <br /> This movie would bother me a lot less if it were not so obvious to the chipmunks. Even her characters that I found were badly changed for this movie. While each of them had a very distinctive personality in the past, all of them here behaved like immature, lanky kids with ADDs bouncing irregularly off the walls. It bothered me to see Simon being portrayed this way ... He's supposed to be the smart, serious nerd who acts as a "straight man" for Alvin's crazy antics. But here he is pretty much a copy of Alvin. A joke in the movie even suggests that Simon just * thinks *, he's smart, but he really is not ... and if I had never heard of the chipmunks before I saw this movie, I would have agreed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just an obvious cash grab and I'm more than sorry that it was made at all. The fact that it's a "kiddie movie" does not excuse its shortcomings ... Apologizing for a stupid movie that breaks down a classic franchise just because it's for kids is insulting to kids, and every kid would be something Much smarter than this movie.
