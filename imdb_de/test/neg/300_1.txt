Jefferey Dahmer was a sick guy. There is not much to say about him that has not yet been said, except that the many documentary films and films made about him are probably better than this one. It's ridiculously cheesy. It's so cheesy, a guy who posted the whole movie on Youtube added some comments to make the audience laugh. Carl Crew (Who is he?) Playing serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who started the killer killing in 1978 He only wanted to be friends with a young man who was back home, finally in 1991 with a man with whom he wanted to have sex and eat. <br /> <br /> I did not watch the whole movie. It's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks Dahmer made before he was caught. And since this movie was made in 1993, a year before Dahmer was beaten to death by a fellow inmate, Dahmer's death is not shown. but it would probably be as cheesy as this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
