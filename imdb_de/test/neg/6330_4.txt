I do not understand the people here. The movie is neither as good as it is bad, as some people say here. With the exception of De Kok, action is fine. The problem with the movie is mainly the script. The characters are not credible. Sex is okay, but psychology behind people makes little sense. The movie does not look good, but what do you expect? The movie was shot on video for very little money. Of course it does not look as good as a normal movie, duh! I agree that the music is bad. Sounds like a cheap erotic film from the 80s. The movie is not good, okay, but you have to say something for it, if you subtract that without money.
