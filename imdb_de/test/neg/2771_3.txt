This was obviously a pretty low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise had promises and a little more could have been done, but the script was not great - the plot is incoherent and seems almost coincidental at times the dialogue is stilted and dreadful. <br /> <br /> Basically, a girl's dad is beaten up by gangster comrades, later she becomes a robber and wants to avenge his death, and then it goes into a mob-protection racket with corrupt politicians. Alan Ladd gets a top billing, but he really plays a very minor role. <br /> <br /> I have to say it was a bit entertaining in its archaic B class, but it's really pathetic and pathetic.
