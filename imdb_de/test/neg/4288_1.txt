A horrible psychological thriller that's almost painful, and every aspect is terrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of top actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are utterly wasted, and although they perform well, they wonder why they are disturbed. Mark Kasdan's script is a complete mess, and Martin Campbell lets the tale jump everywhere, but if you can not follow him, take that as a blessing. There are far too many senseless, crazy scenes that just do not make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music is not much help either. <br /> <br /> Although the storyline had potential, director Campbell's approach completely ruined it. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
