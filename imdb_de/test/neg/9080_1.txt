This is one of the few films - perhaps the only one - that has really persecuted me for years. It was the first time I saw people being tortured, so much that blood gushed from their mouths because they had gritted their teeth and screamed, and so on. It was brutal; The worst thing I've ever seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most vicious characters I've ever seen in the movie, and I've watched thousands of them. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again and would not recommend it. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If it is not your idea of ​​torture to see people being tortured, then stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know that there are many sick people, many of them professional movie critics, who probably enjoyed this filthy movie Ill story It's a "B" movie with stupid dialogue and a bit of playing wood anyway by Charles Bronson. This is not one of his better efforts. Even if it were, there are so many horrible scenes you do not want to see. Trust me this time.
