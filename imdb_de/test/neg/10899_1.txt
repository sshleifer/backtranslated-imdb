If you only want gore and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right film. If you want a little good acting, logic, history, consistencies or even a good ending, go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I can not help but think for myself: "Jeeeez, are these people mentally challenged?" After the lead actress was chased around and saw other people mutilated, she meets a policeman and pours her the policeman Story with tears and all and tells him about the psychopath driving in a yellow car. The yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks over, talking to the man and the truck goes off without a hitch. The actress comes out and says why did not you arrest him? And then the truck drives over the policeman ... After being rammed, the truck stops about 20 feet away on the road and only stands there while the actress tries to drag the policeman away, but he is too heavy. At this time, the truck is driving back and twice over the leg of the police. The truck then starts. Why did not the actress get the weapon? (What she shoots the cop twice in the head later, because the psychopath wanted to burn him alive) Once through the mouth, what did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the work. * Rolling her eyes * Immediately afterwards she turns away to escape from the bathroom, which would explode, and when she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the policeman is no longer there ... OK ... <br /> <br /> Another example: The lead actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom, she spits out a gallon of blood on the floor and covers about a third of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress has taken a towel, she comes back in and everything is gone. : / They do not explain why everyone disappears. Stupid stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but this was just too stupid. I lost brain cells as I watched this dribble, and you should not.
