The recently released DVD by Good Humor Man describes the film as a comedy. It's hardly a comedy, more like a boring indie movie about a group of losers. Probably shot in the 70s, little attention is paid to the details of the period, with overly subdued color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to emphasize the repeatability of the film (perhaps that's the point, but this does not contribute to the enjoyment of the audience experience.) The clique of losers seems to hang around in one place, the grandstands. It seems like the film's packaging should be enticed as a comedy to rent or buy this movie, which is a waste of time.
