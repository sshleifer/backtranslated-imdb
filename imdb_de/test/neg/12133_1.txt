Heh ... I am surprised that this film exists in any form, let alone that it can be rented! <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the many bad slasher movies that exist only for the T & A and the cheap laugh. The action crosses a bit of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" with a stuffy mummy-centric backstory reminiscent of "psycho", and a bit of good old women in chains, tough as the ex-con thugs for a good measure - in other words, utter Unoriginality in half-naked women, spiced with a dash of utter idiocy! If the director tries to let the swamps of Quebec pass as South American Bayou land, that's sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Funny for me, I was actually at the premiere of this movie when I was friends with Ratchford, the movie's "star" at the time. It was painful to see Jeremy sit down in his seat as the strip unfolded its tattered wings. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that Ratchford has become a hell of an actor, after this first glimpse. He appears regularly on the Canadian police drama "Blue Murder", appeared on "CSI", not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood movie "Unforgiven" - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a rocky beginning, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T. Paul
