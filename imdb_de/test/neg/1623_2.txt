The redeemable quality of this film (apart from Ator's barely existing loincloth) is the comic behavior of the evil Zor. This wonderfully dubbed villain has a certain ... oh Shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). I giggled every time he pirouetted, raising an incredulous eyebrow at a henchman or hero. A true example of someone not being paid enough. (And the BEARD!) <br /> <br /> Well, what about the 12-minute hang-gliding scene? Really, really, really bad. I can not stress this point enough. <br /> <br /> So, if you decide to watch this movie, take a look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. With these lovely silhouettes, many terrible movies have been tolerated.
