Yah. I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title. How bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented that and thought it was a movie I missed in the movie theaters. It is not. It's a garbage "movie" that people did at Showtime (cable station). Gosh, these cable stations are making a few dollars that they think they can do the garbage films they want! It is not good. I'm a big Sinatra fanatic like any decent guy, but this movie was just stupid. Boring. Stumpf. Unpleasantly uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that you (assuming they've stuck to the facts) learn what happened to the conquerors of Frank Jr. Otherwise it's just a stupid movie.
