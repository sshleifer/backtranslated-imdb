This film brought a new meaning to the worn-out phrase "how to dry paint," because it looked like the paint was drying in the middle of the monsoon. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by the movie Its location on the west coast of Portugal that I visited. It is a robust, beautiful place and the black and white brought beauty to a whole new dimension. That was the only good thing. The story was horribly banal and frankly, you have to have a story. <br /> <br /> A film crew is out of film and the entire crew has to wait. Well, a wait is a wait. I can wait for a # 15 bus on Princes Street in Edinburgh, and I can spend hours on cold winter afternoon in the middle of nowhere. However, a wait is boring and yes, even this wait was boring. <br /> <br /> So, the leader goes to America to speak to the film supplier, who congratulates him on not painting it. After a series of arguments, two blessed bullets ring from everywhere and the eagerly awaited end is finally coming, not ahead of time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would watch this movie again, if someone armed me with a few paint cans, so I can throw them on the screen.
