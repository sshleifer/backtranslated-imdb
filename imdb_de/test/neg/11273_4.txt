A bit too much Mediterranean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful and beautiful in all romantic scenes. The area was beautiful with azure skies and azure waters. I could not convince such a selfish guy, who is only interested in his building, to be able to attract so many beautiful, vulnerable women. Only in the Mediterranean, I think. Certainly not in any world I'm familiar with. The macho men were really vile, and it was hard to believe that the female characters had been around them for so long. The script, cinematography, directing, etc., was set up to produce a class B film, with the main purpose of showing scenes of beautifully exposed female breasts. It was aesthetically beautiful for a while, but it could not stand a very mediocre movie.
