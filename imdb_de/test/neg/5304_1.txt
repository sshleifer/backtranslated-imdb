OK, I was bought by my brother-in-law a few Christmas back, who introduced me to "Get Shorty" in the movie theater, which impressed the two "Uber". And watched as both became shorty and cool one after another. I have read reviews from people who have not seen Shorty and thought that this movie is pretty good. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After nearly 10 years and Chili Palmer had become a pussy ... The script was basically the same, they teamed up with Travolta and Thurman after their success of Plup Fiction and threw some big stars (plus a lot of nobles). and thought that it would be good ... Vince Vaughn's character was just annoying, though I was a fan of him and the rock. Both actors were far too little used and unrealistic. Basically, I'm glad that this was bought as a gift, as if I had paid money for it, I would have been totally annoyed.
