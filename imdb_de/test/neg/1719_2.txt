Inconspicuous and extremely cheap Sci-Fi without any charm and charm. Even the scenes related to the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other films with the same plot. It's just a bad rip-off of "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be anxious to get away from this pointless and boring sci-fi entry. I give this a 2 (two). And do not say, I'm not a good guy!
