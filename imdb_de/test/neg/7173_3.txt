You have to be a fan of the little man, but I found burlesque on Carmen boring, unimaginative and totally weird. Chaplin tells the story of Carmen and plays a big role as Don Jose himself. It's a story about men and the women they love, though it's unclear why one would love a woman like Carmen because she plays the men against each other. <br /> <br /> Like I said, I did not think much of it. Chaplin has made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious, what's the difference between this movie and the 1915 version being an IMDB bug? <br /> <br /> Total: 3/10.
