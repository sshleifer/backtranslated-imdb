I'm getting out of here because this movie was shot so well and is so well populated that I'm twice as mad at its de-evolution as if I had worked with less work. Without revealing too much of the storyline, all I can say is that part one of my 2 VHS sets was a disturbing, unfolding joy in bizarre but plausible plot development. The main character was accordingly na√Øve, but also intelligent and very open. The events he has to deal with quickly are the separation of his parents, the culture shock, when his Pakistani roots collided with a complete collapse of the English frightened society in the 1960s. and transforming his cousin into a feminist militant, as his best friend, suddenly becomes an icon of the nascent punk movement in the 1970s. Amongst other things. <br /> <br /> What infuriated me was the amount of detailed work each actor did in the first part of creating and setting up his characters, just to turn it into very bad porno episodes second part, far too many to justify the development of the plot, and far too explicit to be even erotic. My biggest favorite is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their film, and this was an outstanding example for me. <br /> <br /> I felt like I had been invited to a party of very clever, funny strangers just to shut the doors and keep the guests from interacting and we all felt compelled to be bad Sex movies of the seventies to see. What an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors! Why not make a cheeseball strip right away? And why a great protagonist who can really act, and then cut off from him, when he turns into a great achievement? I almost felt as if he too was tired of the endless sex scenes in which he just lay there and pumped his pelvis to another naked actress. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Part One is a little genius, Part Two is the second level of soap opera perversion. I know that the book is pretty explicit, but I felt that these good actors were used in real life as well as their characters in the movie, and that made me pretty angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can make such a dubious humiliation of actors and plot and works so artistically. My suggestion is to look at only the first part, to throw the second into the proverbial pile of rubbish, and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
