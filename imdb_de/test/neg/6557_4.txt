I was a big fan of the Enterprise's original crew since I was eight years old. I watched all the films and appreciated everyone for what he had kept from the old series and for the evolution of the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Even in "The Undiscovered Country," I thought the aging of the characters was good, and the story would be worthy of a movie opening. However, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is by far the worst of the series with the original crew. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is well handled, but the overall script, the direction - by William Shatner - and the special effects are worth nothing more than a television episode. This is a "buddy movie" and sometimes barely recognizable as a Star Trek movie. The action sequences are not maintained and therefore build little or no tension. The dialogue is weak, although it provides for a few intended and unintentional laughs. The Klingons are retroactive. The whole "Sha-Ka-Ree" concept is just stupid and Laurence Luckinbill, a good actor in everything else I've ever seen him in, is the absurd thing in this movie. The scene in which Sybok conjures up images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain splinters the image of the characters as we know them. Spock would never take part in such stupidity, and McCoy, trying to save his father, is full of bland, redundant conversations and wastes DeForest Kelley's acting skills. The whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner did not have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects, and the budget for this film was tight, but that does not allow for such a bad story. In a way, I think this story fits the old series, but the films, including Star Trek: The Motion Picture, are all much better. It's a shame that most other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most movies. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but already far too little used. The old crew seems really uncharacteristic. I liked the old Klingon general and the sultry Romulan in the bar. I liked the humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. If it was a TV episode, I could accept many mistakes. As a film, that's just a bad, uninspired filmmaking. That's too bad, because I want this movie to be good. Even if it were the level of "Star Trek III," I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other films in the series look like works by Shakespeare.
