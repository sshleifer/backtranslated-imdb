The only reason I've seen this is because of its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare & Eric Roberts & Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin. All capable actors & have performed well in the past. NOT THIS TIME, a weak serial killer story. You can guess who the murderer is in the first scene. In all aspects very well thought out, there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 BAD
