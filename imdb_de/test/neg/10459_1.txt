As other posters commented this was a very, very bad movie (consider it kid friendly). FX was low class, they should spend the $ 1 for a Coke. As usual with these D-films, most of the victims die and leave a secret, save for a happy soul and, of course, the main role. I hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, a really big step from Babylon 5. It's nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but damn it, that was low even for him. "It was so bad and the older actors could even say that they thought it was bad. Do not pay attention. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning Spoiler Below **** <br /> <br /> This thing was chasing anyone who did it, and yet Boxlietner came from it was pure BS. And the end? How the hell did the kids land with him? That was just too much stupidity.
