If you live in the suburbs, do not feel well financially, and do not really have much contact with the city life of England, then this is the comedy for you. For a mass audience, nothing would be, but if you're like these characters, you'll show that you'll love it. All in all, this is a comedy where the snobs of the BBC sit back and laugh at their joy and only a few people. Compared to BBC comedy's like Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to drift from the regular BBC product to the audience and deliver something of a folk culture.
