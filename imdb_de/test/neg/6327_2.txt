Okay, the only reason I saw this movie is that Krista Allen is there. I agree to see Days of our Life ... I know her as Billie. Oh sure, maybe there's a reason to watch this movie ... that would be the soft porn section. They seem to exceed that. And little else. I would hope that someone who lends / buys this movie rented it only for the sex scene. Because if they bought or rented it for anything else, like good television, they might die from a heart attack. This movie requires little imagination. While I have a good laugh, it's stupidity, and maybe I'll buy it myself, I'm just a fool. Rent before you buy this product. 2 out of 10. (Note: I do not have to give a star a star yet.) The sensual scene alone has put off a 1 if they did not have a straight 1 in the pot and I would like a refund if they're not.)
