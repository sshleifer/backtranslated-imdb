For me, this movie is just a lame teen party movie with all the usual clich√©s and boring, stereotypical characters (nerds, jocks, popular girls, sleezy guys, etc.) but with an underlying anti-drug theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the unfortunate chance to see this movie, keep an eye out for all references to responsibility and keep it up to date (do not know how to phrase it that way) , I think the only thing that would have made this movie cool would be if it was playing on TV, it was burning. The DVD exploded ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10000 - Animal House instead.
