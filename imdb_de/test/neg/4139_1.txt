A complete zero of four. Worst of all, Ajooba sums up: terrible. In fact, more words come to my mind: ridiculous, third-rate and terrible. This is one of the worst films by Amitabh, who rides around in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap Zorro mask with tinsel foil with seemingly wings on the sides of Persia or Arabia and is characteristically unhistorical for an Indian movie. As mentioned earlier, 400 years ago, there was no K-Mart leather jacket with Velcro fasteners, unless all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also makes his patented cross-dressing in this film. Far from being funny, it is very embarrassing to look at it. What could be the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor to spread the memory of his house on the screen? <br /> <br /> If you really want to laugh, watch this movie. The blatant inconsistencies in the plot and the costumes are no match for the terrible dialogues and bad actions.
