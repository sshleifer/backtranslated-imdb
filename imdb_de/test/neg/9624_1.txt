This movie is really bad, it is not very well done and is a poor attempt, but I do not know what. I saw it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but did not bring anything. The characters are flat and wooden and the music, if you can call it that, is awful. There are, of course, all creatures and animated beings, but they are so badly made that it does not look like a third class movie. It's a shame that special effects could not be given more attention, not the whole thing and the end of a movie that I agree with, but in a movie based on them, this is a very important factor. For me a very sad attempt and should be avoided.
