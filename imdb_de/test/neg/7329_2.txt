This movie is available as a special "bonus" feature on the double disc of Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame. It has nothing to do with these films, but it does show that producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are at an impasse. As in these other films, young people are shown here walking into a building where they are trapped inside, often running along the corridors while being picked up one after the other. In the end, one or more characters have a different identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here people are invited on a Halloween night, which only opens the funerary museum. The museum does not have very many exhibits, and all are of a kind of Central America. There are also carnivorous, infectious zombies in the museum, as well as an old cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The film is very repetitive. It kills people pretty fast, to the point where you're wondering who they still have to kill - then more people come up with no explanation for killing them. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, one of the characters has a cell phone and can actually call the police, who take it seriously and show up at the museum. When one tries to pull the barrier to get in, the other one tells him that this is "forced entry." If people are locked up in a building that's injured, I find that irrelevant. The cops are stupid too, if they shoot a zombie in the head, then it goes down, but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and do not go down. They shoot another zombie in the head and it goes down. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credo and a nightmare sequence are performed in a kind of animation effect via video, a kind of poor man's waking life, but not so cartoonish. It's kind of interesting, but some of the attacks are done the same way, so there's no logic for that. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
