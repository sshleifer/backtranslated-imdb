Umberto Lenzi reaches new lows with this recycling waste. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of a religious Jim Jones cult in New Guinea. She hires an unkempt guide, played by Robert Kerman, to help her reach the cult place in the jungle. This is another (!) Cannibal movie and I would probably have liked it if Lenzi does not unpack this movie with scenes from his supervisor "The Man from Deep River". I mean, every cannibal scene is right off this movie, which probably makes it as believable as Al Adamson. I felt demolished. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.
