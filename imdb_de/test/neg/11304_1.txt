Do not see "Mr. Magoo". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny. He has not been funny since the Naked Gun movies. It will not take long to find out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The plot of the film is ridiculously stupid. Nothing in the entire movie was funny. The first minutes of the movie were animated to look like the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie stayed that way.
