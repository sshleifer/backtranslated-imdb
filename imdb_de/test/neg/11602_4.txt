This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it seemed he had yet to find himself in a pattern of consistency ranging from the faithful adaptation of the classic novel in Rebecca to a spy thriller in Foreign Correspondent and now this romantic comedy in the form of "Screwballs" was "1930s" images. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's formal approach, meanwhile, had decided on something consistent, so much so that he could not (or at least unwillingly) deviate from it him out of his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate, and in Rebecca it was really great to see Hitchcock forced by his producer and the source code to transfer his technique to a heavy gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs. Smith there is a big mismatch between form and content, in other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> Too First we look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock movies were wild, passionate and a bit dangerous. who "ever fell in love with someone you should not have had?" Situation, and he could do that great. This is something that makes a much earlier movie, Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really work. However, Hitch is not so good when it comes to a gentler and more familiar love story. A light, tender touch is required and Hitch does not have it. <br /> <br /> Second, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies could be funny? The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example? but only if the jokes in the story were sprayed. The suspense master is simply not enough for a comedy director to make a movie with funny bones. He cuts scenes like in a thriller? bissige opposing view of the people, close-ups of hands and feet, visuals ?? but does not allow comic timing or focus on gags. For example, the business with Carole Lover's dress, which seems to be bursting, is shown to us with a few close-ups, but these are more timely in nature than they would have revealed a crucial plot point, and have no comedy effect. Occasionally, Hitchcock's style is about the same as the comedy? For example, the arrangement of the characters in the scene at the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if he's with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table ?? But such moments are few. <br /> <br /> Even the cast of Mr. and Mrs. Smith is not up to standard. I am not sure if this was Robert Montgomery's strength, and he is bored here. Right here was Carole Lover's strength of "Queen of Screwball," and although she behaves well, the scenes are simply not designed to capture comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious if he was allowed to let go in front of the camera, can not cheer things up at all. Of course, none of these fine comedy performers will help the script, which is not exactly full of laughter from the outset, even if the basic story is a pretty good premise. <br /> <br /> The only thing After the comedy that Hitchcock did afterward was the problem with Harry, and that kind of work worked because she played with his familiar excitement. However, it was only when the story could exist independently of humor when the basic frame was exciting. What about The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot? that Hitchcock was able to do comedy well.
