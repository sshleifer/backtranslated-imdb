This is by far the most miserable film that Indian cinema or any other cinema has brought. It's totally a piece of crap. it is shameful that such a respectful actor has moved so deeply that he produces such a shameful film. The little respect he had is lost forever. He should have retired long ago, instead of fooling himself and losing all respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. In addition, I would suggest that Amitabh is already retired. I wonder how IMDb has given some recommendations to this film. There are no films that are so horrible that recommendations could be made. Watching films like Devdas in the same line as this movie leads to a decent movie. Overall, I could shamelessly say.
