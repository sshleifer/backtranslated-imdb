In Moscow, the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) sets up a team that leads him to the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), who in search of the legend about the existence of demons and access to hell under the city is missing. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I am so disappointed that this movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer has agreed to participate in this production. There are two shameful critiques in IMDb promoting this movie, and these are usually fake and written by users with only one rating on this site. There are two ways to see this boring and terrible film: My wife and I often slept because of the monotony of this pointless story, and we used the DVD rewind button to repeat every lost scene. However, the correct way should have been to use the Fast Forward or Stop button to finish this crap faster. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
