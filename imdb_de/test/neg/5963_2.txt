Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: Legendary South American goat vampire El Chupacabra is on the run, eating anyone who fails to cross his path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and chupacabra expert / author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) are trying to locate the creature. However, they are hampered by two stupid policemen, and a few nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments. El Chupacabra stinks more than a two-week-old taco and is an unbelievably bad horror movie that even fans of unbelievably bad horror movies might find hard to sit through. With his terrible screenplay, terrible directing (not one, but two talentless hacks, Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), ridiculous dialogue and some of the worst acting on this side of a porn movie, I recommend this movie as much as I drink tap water in Mexico. <br /> <br /> As Navarro and Starlina continue to investigate, viewers are treated with incredibly faint bleeding, the worst book jacket in history and the most convincing dead person I've ever seen since the flashing corpse in Dr. Watson. Butcher, MD, and a computer-controlled high-tech security system consisting of a keypad nailed to a post. <br /> <br /> To be fair, for a man in a rubber suit, the monster itself is pretty scary (hairy, with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are rare and widespread, with more time spent on boring trials and tribulations of whiny officer Navarro than on the titular creature killer antics (how often do you have to see Navarro h in paperwork to his bitchy boss?). <br /> <br /> If you, like me, make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned money on this terrible latino bilge (in my case that was 50p in all). Remember to use the disc as a saucer for your tequila instead of actually looking at him.
