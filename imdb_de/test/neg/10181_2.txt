The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was that for some reason I felt compelled to finish it! Basically, I wanted to see if there were any aliens, UFOs, or anything that was suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie, and the beginning of the movie. I was very disappointed to see religion thrown into the mix. This could have been exploited to the benefit of the film, but I felt instead that the film was trying to send subliminal messages to me! How big was the wardrobe of this cast? I was so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts that each character wore in each new scene, and I wondered if this movie should not really be considered a "bad comedy" br /> Toes thumbs down!
