Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage should be the first word associated with his entire work. Movie. Theatre. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. An inheritance with powerful consequences and endless consequences. He introduced neorealism through the work of the American writer James Cain in Ossesione. He gave Anna Magnani the exceptionally beautiful close-ups of her career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. However, the last word about his life and work is based on the talents of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) entitled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It is available on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment
