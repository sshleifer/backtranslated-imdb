This film tried something but failed miserably. All the rigging attempts were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and action holes that I laughed in the end and made fun of it. At least I was entertained. <br /> <br /> The spirits try to warn the family. Why are they attacking the girl whose name I did not want to remember? And what was in the beginning with black and white? I know what they were trying to do, but they stayed far behind. And where the hell did this guy come from (John Corbett's character)? He simply rolls from where in a huge field. And why did he suddenly lose it when the ravens came? And if the ravens were a manifestation of the ghosts of his family, why would they attack him if he tried to kill the family? Makes no sense. So many things in this movie just do not make sense, and acting is not particularly nice on the part of the main character of the girls. It's not terrible, just a bit like their children's film days. So all in all, this movie was not brilliant, but I had a good time tearing it up, and sometimes that's all a horror movie has to do. Rent for entertainment not quality.
