I made half of it but was not enough masochist to see it all. The first half of the film had virtually no dialogue! Almost everything was commentary to carry the story. The scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millenniums of detailed story in the voice. At the same time, he forgot every character development. Most science fiction fans do not need a lot of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the Fleet together fought each other. <br /> <br /> There are some good things in the movie. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were mediocre.
