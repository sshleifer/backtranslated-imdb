I was shocked to read all those wonderful comments on this film because I hated it. I held it to the end, but it was painful - especially that I had to listen to that child's voice. As Socact-1 noted, though the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she had no Chicago accent - it sounded more like trying to imitate a New York accent - but failed as well. I was so confused that I was waiting for the punch line. Why did you decide among all the wonderful actors who could have played this child? And why force them to talk like that? It was not just the accent, it was the script, the monolog created for her. The reason I chose this film was because I like the idea of ​​action - this epoch in history, the kind of characters that are poor and uneducated, the scenery - and the love triangle. It could and should have been much better for me. I was so relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way I did about this movie.
