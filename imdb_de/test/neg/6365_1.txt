When I heard that the movie was to be released, and the subject of what it was about, I was very curious. But when I saw this was the biggest delusion of my life. Technically, the sound is bad, you can report on man dialogues, which were newly created in the studio and poorly achieved in the final mix. Secondly, the photography is mediocre, some of the films show some soldiers wearing night vision goggles, and the way the cameraman reaches the "dark night" is when everything is lit up as if they were in a real military base with light unrelated to moonlight , my God! Last but not least, most activities are really bad, it is absolutely unbelievable what a soldier's wife looks like, their performance is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment, shame on the jury Who decided to send this movie to represent Colombia at the Oscars?
