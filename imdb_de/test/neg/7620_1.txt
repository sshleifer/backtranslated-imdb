Do you know what farmers spray on fields? Right - crap, so when the BBC decided to make a much-hyped conspirator thriller about GMOs and agriculture, that was what we got, one of the most odor-rich dung the BBC inflicted on its audience. <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> FIELDS OF GOLD opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a scientist (according to the current BBC all scientists are women) announces: "A new crop of wheat that will be the third world before save hunger ", then the story changes to another equally bold scene. If you want to make a thriller of any kind, should not you open yourself with a hook that grabs the audience? DOCTOR WHO was brilliant, as was THE X-FILES, while 28 Days later opened with a hook in a lab. I think someone at the BBC did not think this thriller needed a hook because the crowd had stuffed fans into their neck weeks ago. <br /> <br /> As the (not very exciting) story continues with some journalists (one is a drunk with a lower morale than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush, while the other is a journalist who is virtuous Examining patients in a district hospital who may be plagued by "mercy killings" At this point, things start to get confused as the journalist is threatened by MI5 spooks and the first episode ends in the murder of MI5 spooks br /> <br /> The second episode shows that the patients at the county hospital are actually affected died due to an infection with a VRSA Superbug.This is when things go completely hay wire.All in FIELDS OF GOLD, the audience was made to to believe that the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence were behind the dead - but they are not, it turns out that the bad guy t is an organic farmer who made the VRSA superbug in his bedroom, and the story ends with the work of THE MATRIX camera, with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a VRSA-infested field, spreading the superbug across the country <br /> I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD. At the time of his broadcast, I was both a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. I have since renounced my time in the environmental movement, but even now I am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here, and that the villain must spread a deadly genetically modified virus because it points to the dangers of genetically modified organisms very dumb. It's kind of like a CND member unleashing an atomic bomb in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war. I was also a bit offended about how the male characters were written as bastards, while all the women were very intelligent and morally superior. There are other problems with the script, especially regarding VRSA. If you take the time and effort to research VRSA, unlike the scriptwriters, you'll find that it's completely different than this. Oh, and if you set Diesel on fire, it does not explode like napalm. The worst criticism of the script may be that it resembles the structure of JEEPERS CREEPERS, with the last ten minutes contradicting most of the processes. Where JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes, FIELDS OF GOLD took twice as long, making it doubly irritating and illogical. <br /> <br /> As a footnote, environmentalism never makes a good subject for a thriller (who remembers these Steven Segal films?) and it is time that TV and film producers recognized this
