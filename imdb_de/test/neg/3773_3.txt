What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserve better. In the beginning, JT was terribly wrong at the top. The role called for someone who could convince as a broken antihero, someone who could look distressed and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would have let the bill or Al Pacino fit, but JT is just too alive and seems to have too much fun. Someone who had gone through the mill to the extent that JT had had his character would certainly have had some physical impact? The character presented to the crowd looked as if he could narrowly end up for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett was a bit better on the roll. Where was the pain and the conflict of what should have disturbed the development certainly? And as for the "conspiracy" ... well, none of it makes sense. The characters apparently jump from one state of mind to another with no cause - without explanation. The tempo of the film leaves much to be desired, namely the tempo. This is a very slow movie, not that I'm against slow movies as long as they go somewhere. The tempo increases towards the end, when it passes from a slow grudge to a frenzied race to pack as many tired stereotypes as possible. This succeeds - the only thing missing is something that involves a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one only for Gabriel Macht's performance - he was the only member of the cast that a) was well staffed and b) could convince in his role. All in all a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a few hours.
