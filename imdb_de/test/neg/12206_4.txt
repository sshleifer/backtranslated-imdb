Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this movie suggests. He directed ALL QUIET ON THE WEST FRONT, THIS TOUCH OF MINK, and THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON et al. This mediocre product, made for Dickens masterpiece TV production, is so bad that even those unfamiliar with the often-filmed story will not be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the film is only available from two well-known suppliers (Brentwood) and BCI Eclipse LLC) The poor quality of the transfer and the scratchy and jumbled soundtrack make it difficult to find this movie on video , not worth the effort. <br /> <br /> I've always believed that this is a company If you put a movie on video and charge the public money for it, you should have at least one copy of the film in the descent and a good one for the transfer Do a job. Unfortunately, neither provider has such a work ethic, and the result is only suitable for the cheap storage space in the local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is mainly told through flashbacks, making the movie episodic and talkative. Much of the richness of detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Traddles, and others have been cut, and the relationship between young David and Steerforth has not been researched enough, so we wonder why David is hanging out with the guy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David The Boy and the young Agnes are never developed and it's hard to understand why she and David eventually marry. Since Martha is expelled, it's a mystery how Dan Peggoty finds his niece. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely guy. <br /> <br /> Some have credited this film with the good work of shortening the long novel. I do not agree, this is at best a hassle in the book. Anyone who has seen the George Cukor version of 1935 will agree. <br /> <br /> The performances by Fields like Micawber and Rathbone as Murdstone in this version are definitely worth watching. The newer versions Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are both outstanding achievements in television adaptation of classic novels. The directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak, who are responsible for these films, deserve the highest praise. <br /> <br /> My last comment on David COPPERFIELD 1969 is "Do not Buy", there are some much better versions of the movie available. If it's on TV, turn the channel on something else. It's a waste of an hour and twenty minutes of your life. I'm sorry, people, but I can not praise such a terribly bad movie.
