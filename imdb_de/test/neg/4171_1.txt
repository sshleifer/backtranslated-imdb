Apparently I am swimming against the flood of glowing comments on this film. I have not seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing that I remember ... <br /> <br /> The bunyip was awful !!! Nightmare terrifying. With the creepy music and the little girl and the kangaroo they run / hop for their lives ... <br /> <br /> As a kid I also remember the animated hobbit ... do not worry. Water ship down Has not forced an eye. Dot and the kangaroo? It still haunts my dreams. And I have several friends of the same age who think it's really scary. Maybe we can get a group rate for the therapy. <br /> <br /> In short: a crazy movie for his time.
