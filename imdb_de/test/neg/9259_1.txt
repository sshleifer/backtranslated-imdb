Do you take a bad script, some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect moral history, and what do you get? Something that should fit for a good family watching. Seven Alone is the story of a 19th-century family traveling in a wagon train through America and hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose gender is not very sure), hence the title of the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the family, which leads a seemingly normal 19th century farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. The eldest son John is a precocious teenager, "lazy and good for nothing," as his father constantly reminds him. We see right away that he has a penchant for jokes when he ties the string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects them to a nearby mule. Of course, when the mule is moved, the poor girls are torn out of bed. John gets caught by his father and immediately punished with a belt. <br /> <br /> The same day a wagon train goes by. Pa is trying to unite as it promises a new life in the Wild West. So the family packs their belongings and sets off. <br /> <br /> The film is weak and amateurish from the start. The drama is below average, as seen from one of the films about the pioneers shown at school. But I can not blame the actors because the lines in this movie are stupid and too sweet and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you that I caught this movie when, on a boring Saturday afternoon, I turned a TV channel on a Christian TV station. I was not a religious mind, I watched in horror as Seven Alone made moral statements that were not only outdated but downright outrageous! If I was a good Christian, I would hope that I had the good sense to complain to the TV station that he had broadcast such garbage. However, being a cynical infidel with a mean humor, I decided to sit back and laugh silly. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes the father plays the role of the father The strict ruler of the house is founded when he suggests to his wife the idea of ​​going to Oregon. Her answer is a heated "over my dead body". We are expected to laugh as the movie moves on to the next scene, with Pa and Ma smiling as he steers the car through the prairie. Oh, I think even the convinced feminist would have to admit that this "father-white-best attitude" was the norm these days, and you could argue the need for such dictatorial rule under difficult living conditions to feel that this movie also supported this view today. Nice message from a Christian TV station. <br /> <br /> The family is getting worse and worse, and the moral integrity of the films is further reduced. An Indian (or Indian) robs John as he sleeps in a field. Like an ordinary savage, the Indian takes John's clothes and belongings with him. Fortunately, with the help of the passer-by Kit Carson, Pa can kill both the Indian and a few of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family will be assisted by the general practitioner of the freight train. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray), accompanied. He shares Paa's feelings about John and explains that he is a useless brat. Maybe so, but he's also the best of this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffoon who apparently is unable to put on his own shoes, let alone have one of the girls treated with a broken leg. Fortunately, the young child did not cry when the car ran over and grabbed her leg in half because Dr. Dutch did not seem to have the right bed. We know the disadvantages of the constant reduction of a child. Here is a movie that promotes this behavior. <br /> <br /> Later, Pa develops food poisoning or something, I did not pay much attention and he dies. His deathbed scene is what makes great acting. Honestly, the man did not even look sick. <br /> <br /> Soon after, Ma dies too. The children have to take care of themselves. And then the real adventure begins. They beat it through the rapids, meet more Indians (these are nice though) and venture through snowy terrain. These kids are doing everything. And I stayed when I thought, "What a bunch of garbage!" Sorry, but there was nothing redeeming about this movie. This little house in the prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to "families" everywhere. I am surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and at a time when the treatment of Native Americans came into focus, something could actually be done. <br /> <br />
