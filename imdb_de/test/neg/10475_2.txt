This movie was not very well directed. They almost completely ignored the book. I think they were trying to save time. The only advantage was that the actor who played Finny was cute. Some dialogues between the main characters seemed a little gay, which was not the case in the book. Essential parts of the book have been cut out again. They lost the overall effect, it was not as insistent as the book and made me suffer hard. Even the strong language, although short, was very unnecessary. Also, I was (not pleasantly) surprised by a new character that was not in the book. One of my favorite characters (leprosy) was poorly interpreted and presented. He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper in the book. Above all, disappointing.
