I do not even know where to start. I do not want it. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) The murder was justifiable, what possible reason could exist in the script for Linda aka Penelope) never explained It was all fluid on a table and dripped from the counter until everything on the floor caused a big mess. Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five-second cameo? Why has Diane Wiest used her Bullets over Broadway figure without stocking fun? Why was Jane Birkin in the story at the beginning? The list is endless. The movie ended and we all looked at each other - how - did you understand anything about it? hug the killer. Tell me something else when "Bob" separated from "Bob". What was the purpose of hiding the son in the closet? Did Bob have sex with Bob in front of his son? How did the killer contact the son so easily? <br /> <br /> If this review sounds confused, it's because it was a waste of film, talent and time. What the hell did the dead have to do with anything !! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, because he should have been better and could have been better, made some sense. Any sense. Instead, we get a watered-down "diva" (the 70s movie with a murder) and tired performances, in which we read boring words from a script that is completely crazy. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I and the rest of the people who discussed this movie are too stupid to understand everything - I mean, it's a French movie.
