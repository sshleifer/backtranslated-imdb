1. watched February 9, 2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J.S Cardone): Sexual political thriller that is not very successful in any of these areas, unless there are some interesting soft core scenes. The film begins with the portrayal of a couple exploring their sexual fantasies in their work environment or wherever and whenever they want. The couple take a trip to a retreat and a bathhouse where they meet a woman who is ready to be part of a threesome and fulfill some of her fantasies. At this point we only know that this couple is doing well, but we do not know that the fianc√© is part of a wealthy political family. The man hopes to be on the way to possibly get a convention seat after the marriage. They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter in the bathhouse and their Qwest begins with the question of how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want and how they should erase their names before anything comes out of it. This Qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into Saxon worlds and takes a lot of time to ask their friends and family what they do all day and why they look all the way around. This movie is sometimes interesting, but it loses its ridiculousness because it personally identifies the problem rather than involving the police early because of their pride. Of course, this mistake keeps the movie going. The performances are good, even though the performers have no names, but the madness of the situation is overridden, and the movie starts humming halfway. And of course they end up with a twist that challenges and challenges everything that has happened before (as is customary these days when they do not know what else to do to spice things up). However, this does not help this movie a bit.
