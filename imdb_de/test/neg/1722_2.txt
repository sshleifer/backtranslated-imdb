'Tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> I can hardly say anything good about this film. The requirements are completely wrong. A comet is to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to the earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this. In the mountains of California, a whole subterranean city plus a launcher for nuclear-armed missiles is being built without anyone noticing. When the comet approaches Earth, the news reaches the television channel and the newspapers barely a day before the event. And so on and so on ... <br /> <br /> No kind of emotion makes it on screen. Is the genius that discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or an animal? The director or Dennis Hooper, who plays the role, did not seem to decide until the movie was finished, and it does not really matter, because acting and directing are so confusing that one wonders what this movie is about tries. The special effects are so cheap that not only in the era of computer effects can not convince them, but also in the 50s, four decades before this film was shot, could not convince. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time.
