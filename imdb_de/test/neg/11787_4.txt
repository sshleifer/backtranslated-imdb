Irwin Allen, former master movie actor, pulled out of all stations in VOYAGE TO THE Bottom of the Sea. A poorly aged Walter Pidgeon, who was perhaps dead when he played that role, is the commander of a nuclear submarine that has to be as big as the Empire State Building. Every room is huge and some even seem to have no ceilings. In some of these rooms, you could roll and hold a formal ball at the same time. The submarine, known as the Seaview, is on its maiden voyage when hell breaks loose: the Van Allen radiation belt is burning and the Seaview has to launch a rocket at a certain time, otherwise the world will become global Warming advised! For the ride, there are a number of really awful character actors, many borrowed from television. That makes them TV hackers. Worst of all, it is likely that Stella Stevens of the poor man, Barbara Eden, was pressed into too tight clothing as the secretary of the Navy, wearing high heels and behaving as if she were appearing at a beach party. Maybe it's because Frankie Avalon is there too. A pretty old Joan Fontaine, barely recognizable here, plays a visiting doctor with a big, bad secret. But who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie that was obviously made for little kids, but which kid is going to sit still to take endless shots of a miniature seaview model moving from right to left across the screen, which is obviously one Studiopanzer is? There is not a single scene in which we believe these people are actually aboard a submarine. When the ocean shivers, the actors whirl around, sometimes in opposite directions. Just like the good old STAR TREK TV series, when the bridge wobbles. If I recall correctly, not a single fish or marine animal is seen - except for an octopus that instantly screws onto the submarine, a nod to 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if it was real, was probably about a foot long and shows it. Worse still, when people are standing in front of the glass nose of the Seaview, the sea they're supposed to watch is obviously a close-up, with an invisible air hose triggering blisters that are likely to be filmed in a fish tank. You have never seen bigger bubbles in your life. You'd think those bubbles alone would tear the damned submarine to pieces. Unfortunately, a badly aged Peter Lorre is also there. At the end, as the rocket enters the flame belt, Lorre congratulates Pidgeon enthusiastically, while everyone else is waiting for their cue to shake hands and embrace a victory. A one-take scene, if I have ever seen one. What a stinker. It's not even good for a laugh. Stay with SILENT RUNNING.
