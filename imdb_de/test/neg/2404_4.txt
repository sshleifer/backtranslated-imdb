Very curious that Nichols and Hanks would get involved, obviously they believe it. Strange, because it should be titled "Charlie Wilson's War Lies". How should the timeline elude the true story that the CIA, when it freed Afganistan from the Russians, supported the Taliban and today? World of Terrorism: Bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia in 1990 as a jihadist hero, along with his Arab legion had "crushed" the "mighty superpower" of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> To avoid any connection to Osama bin Laden, it says again: Hollywood cares little about Historical Truth. Charlie Wilson, a patriot, hardly like an amok.
