After I could not ignore the hype surrounding the show, I started to watch the first season, and it felt very good and I was addicted ... for about 5 episodes, then it started spinning down. Why? First, Ethan Suplee has a script that acts as a complete idiot, which very obviously confirms this by spewing out half-random stuff in great expectation that it will somehow be the next best joke. Jaime Pressly's startling looks, but when she thinks she is stretching her lips to explore parts of the face that she does not usually go to, and makes strange faces to emphasize everything she says That it is hilarious, it is far from the trail. Maybe she thought her character was too flat, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but made a flood of colors, flooded spices and loudly screaming for attention and it hurts my eyes, ears and my intellect. > <br /> I really wanted to love this show, as I said, the premise is great (coming from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny by Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee does a pretty good job here with some other actors, but it does There's no way I could be "sucked in" and forget that this is just a show, because the surreal, extreme characters of Pressly's and Suplees wake me up abruptly when they pop up. It's worth noting that their characters and their acting would be good if it was not a 70-part series and they did not have that much screen time.
