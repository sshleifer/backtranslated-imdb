If you've always wanted to know more about taxi drivers, this is an excellent movie that is shown for informational purposes only. I can just hear it now: "Wait, wait just a second! Why do not we follow a taxi driver all day long? Kabbys are funny, as are the people they meet, and they just talk to each other Minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have footage, Brian, you go along with some actors and we'll all meet here tomorrow to film! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the film could not have been worse if that had happened. At least without any planning, there is always the surprising. Something has always been added in some Jim Carrey films and they are always good at the box office. The problem here is that the first 90% are pretty well sorted out and are pretty shitty. Paul Dillon plays the taxi driver in Chicago who works all day. We see pretty well what he sees. People get in and out and drive to the city. He talks to these people for a few seconds and then we get more people. <br /> <br /> I admit there were some funny things here and there. A religious family tries to convince the taxi driver to go to church with them, he takes a pregnant woman and her husband to the hospital, breaks off a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor friend of her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home. I think the moral of the movie is that a taxi driver is more than a taxi driver and has a greater influence on the lives of his passengers than you might think. For some people, it is only a means to get from here to there, but for others, his ordinary words help change the direction of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to make feeling for the rest of the movie, and succeeds to a lesser extent. It had a bit of that feeling of regret in the deathbed where the good majority of the movie crap and in the end it's trying to improve everything in just one or two changes. I was not very impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few things worth reviewing. As for the actors, it is Paul Dillon. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all about 30 seconds, but do not adjust that, otherwise you'll be disappointed. I'll credit the other people that it's not your usual movie they made here, but it was not very good either. There just was not enough material to keep you running for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it did not fail.
