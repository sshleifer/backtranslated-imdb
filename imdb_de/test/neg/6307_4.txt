Dennis Quaid tries to prove to us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a stupid guy. And he's doing too much to prove it. TV sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white tracks. Music is good too, because Mr. Lewis sings himself. The rest, however, is just Hollywood B-movie style with the Happy Days Complex of the fifties. I think the only good thing about this movie is the young Winona Ryder.
