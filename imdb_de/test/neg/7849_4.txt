Maybe the director tried another PIRATE (Good Garland and Kelly Musical) - but this lame musical epoch falls flat. The voices of Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson do not match well - and the chemistry lacks spark. The premise of Sinatra as a sweet guy trying to incarnate his late "Bandito" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role. The amazing and wonderful thing here is how Sinatra can take a rather bland song and make it look special - his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to see you again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe that she does not sing something completely different and is not that interesting. She has her big moment with "Love is where you find her", which perfectly suits her and shows her abilities. The photography is luscious and both stars look just like the costumes and sets. The co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash put a lot of energy to make the impossible possible. Apart from Sinatra's vocals, there is a strange dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It is fascinating and funny. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is a real curiosity.
