Copy cats have copied this film from a 1974 Hindi movie titled "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical plot. The way in which the protagonists fall in love, then rebellion and climax in both films. "Call Girl" is better than water at least from the point of view of history. It was not as painful as water! Water, on the other hand, does not develop at all. The goal may be to sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better today than big copiers? Well, they call it "inspired". In their language it says: "let yourself be inspired (without any quotes!)"! :)
