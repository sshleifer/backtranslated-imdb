Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow shows Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks, a karate teacher who helps a cash (Jolie) escape Pinwheel, its creators who try to detonate them and destroy an enemy company. Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd appear to oust the duo while Jack Palance gives guidance to the duo on the run. What shocks the cyborg franchise is the way the series had quite prolific and unsurpassed actors in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (you do not know her - well, she was in a bunch of 70s porn). This one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, casting Cyborg 3 is not that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I saw it on the sci-fi channel and I have to admit that I was not impressed. Actually, Cyborg 2 is an often lovely-looking movie that has been recorded with excellent style and the visual details make the eye pleasurable. However, Cyborg 1 was the same way, in fact, the film was shot with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music, which made the eye very pleasant. Unfortunately, like the first, this project has no new ideas or something that resembles an action or texture. Most ideas come from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so the movie does not have much to offer for a variety of reasons. Another aspect is the terrible spectacle. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance are doing well, but seriously, Palance is a cyborg warrior and Kotea's a karate instructor. Michael Schr√∂der can not be accused of being overly ambitious with casting. Still, the movie is boring and I lost interest in the story in fifteen minutes. Why did you still connect him to Cyborg? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, which is worse than. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bath)
