I can not believe I rent this dump! The acting was so bad, my grandmother could have done better. The blows thrown in the movies were near the figure who struck the scarecrow on the floor. The movie became a chore! <br /> <br /> So this group of baseball jocks decides to bully, even though they should not be in the order of their coach under the consequences. So of course they go anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so-called "scarecrow". When the loser's best friend learns about it, he and his girlfriend want to rescue him. <br /> <br /> It is found that the child is suffering from diabetes, and is hospitalized while the jocks are the closest to the beach day. The scarecrow finds them there and pretty much kills them all. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you do not care. Anyway, the scarecrow has a connection to "Diabetes Boy" and the boy starts to finish the scarecrow job as soon as the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it is really cheesy. <br /> <br /> It thought that this movie was full of bullshit. Sooner or later (of course) only the friend and the girlfriend who are the main characters live :) The evil is then transferred to the friend, and he kills himself to break the curse, so that no one else gets hurt. Hey touch? No, do not waste your hard-earned money with it, I'll give him a score because that's the lowest, otherwise it does not even earn that much.
