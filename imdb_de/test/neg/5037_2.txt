From the epicenter of the cultural sphere, four working-class teens tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the last attempt in the last century and they failed. Before the dust had dissolved, band manager and SEX shop owner Malcolm McLaren spent the money The Sex Pistols had earned to make a "mockumentary" about his own role in their success. The film was titled The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle and consists of very little footage in which the Sex Pistols actually play music, and quite a bit of footage in which McLaren calls viewers idiots. Cod-surrealistic nonsense, in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLaren's cock, soon dissolves, allowing him and drummer Paul Cook to cum in Rio and spend time with "big assassin" Ronnie Biggs , Prepare yourself for the spectacle of three very unappetizing men nude to a hideous, irony-free version of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about killing Jews in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp) were killed whining that the text " God Saves Myra Hindley, God Saves Ian Brady "contains (texts that Johnny Rotten would have found unpleasant). The Sid Vicious scenes are few and idiotic. Jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing a bad biker song from the 50s. I played the theme of "punk is a joke" of the movie and tried to turn Sid into James Dean. I am surprised that McLaren does not recognize Siddy's death. The redeeming scenes are Sid in Paris and the infamous performance of My Way. The punk rock zeitgeist right there. Taunts a worshiping audience before he shoots everyone. You do not need a full movie, just watch this clip on YouTube. <br /> <br /> From the far superior (and more enjoyable) documentary of 2001, The Filth and the Fury by Julien Temple, we were given a balanced / honest view of what happened in 1978. But there were also a number of scenes I would have liked to see in Swindle (since Fury was basically a rework of the same material). One was an animated sid with Sid's voice. "You fuck your head, okay, or I'll cut you" - a still picture of it appeared on the cover of Something Else 7 inches - a snippet was shown in Fury, but I do not know which context originally appeared? Was it in original prints, but was removed after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also lit the movie "Who Killed Bambi", which was actually the glow of the Hard Day's Night that McLaren originally intended. It played Sting (!) As a member of a gay New Romantics group and looked damn more entertaining than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, that's a hoax. If you must, rent The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the failure of the music as a world that changes polemics.
