One wonders how FLYNN in 1997, as a film release with Guy Pearce aptly in the lead role could have turned out so bad. It's not often that the casting of such a famous man is just right. FLYNN was a stumbling block at the box office and did not end up on movie screens in Australia ... even to LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (probably by Guy Pearce) FLYNN starts a very robust and interesting start. Unfortunately, after about the first 35 minutes, FLYNN lost its air and with the entry of the hammering Steven Berkoff on a detour to New Guinea (who looks like he wanted to play the role of Klaus Kinski in FITZCARRALDO), the movie resembles a tele-movie instead of one great cinema biography. Believe it or not, after about 70 minutes it is boring and you are glad to see it past. But such a promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the film caused a mutiny at the box office and sank, unlike The Bounty without a trace.
