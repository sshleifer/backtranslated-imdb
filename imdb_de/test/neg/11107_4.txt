Let me first say that this movie is nothing special. The cast is like the one saved by the bells. The monster is a guy in a bad outfit and as always; the military is useless. It seems that the more training you have and the bigger your weapon is, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low-budget horror movie. Apparently, people in the film industry have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas who get the worst. The plot is thin, a crazy crypto-zoologist named dr. Pe√±a captures the Chupacabra. He then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two crewmembers release it. You can pay your taxes, watch this movie and never miss a beat. The most notable part that makes everything really worthwhile is the captain's daughter. Towards the end she goes with all martial arts on the monster and kick him in the butt. Let me make that clear, the monster erases the entire unit of Marine Seals while using the Armor Tank Ammo !! OK, it's a movie it can happen, right? But here comes the captain's daughter, who can not be over the age of nineteen, and kick the crap out of the Chupacabra with front and side rides. It was funny. You should get a medal for it.
