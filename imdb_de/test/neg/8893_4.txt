This movie was almost a good movie. The direction has to be a bit smoother to get from one piece to the next to make it more plausible. In particular: The flight of the main character is not explicit enough. Is he trying to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? His life does not seem to be that bad, so it's harder to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much. It's also not clear how much he fell in love with Jennifer Jason L. If the movie had been revised with more attention to these details, it would have been great. On the other hand, it's pretty good for an Indy movie! If you have a few drinks, it might be more fun to comfort the logical thinking ... <br /> <br />
