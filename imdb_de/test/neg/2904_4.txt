I remember watching this movie in one of the Showtime channels. What has struck me is that this film takes place exclusively in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from there, so I easily recognize the locales. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a ninja kills a scientist because he wears yellow pullovers and golf, which are being pursued by the police. About half of the police need him to knock him down, and if they finally kill him, there are no detectable gunshot wounds. However, his spirit lives on when a woman finds her and touches his katana. From then on, she gets possessed from time to time and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja. This may be a plotter of the previous two movies or maybe a plot hole. All I know is that this movie is very sporty, bad and entertaining. This is something you can watch with a bucket of popcorn and several friends and give it the MST3K treatment.
