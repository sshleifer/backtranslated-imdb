Screening the comedy Broadway hit "The Gay Divorce" (a title that was too scandalous for American moviegoers even though it was used in the UK) concerns a man and a woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who find themselves embarrassed Circumstances meet in the process of divorce from her spouse; They dance, argue, make up, dance, argue more and dance even more. Betty Grable is very appealing in a short time (singing and dancing in the song "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Edward Everett Horton), but the star couple looks thoroughly desperate. The environment is bullet-challenging, but the characters are nothing more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 of ****
