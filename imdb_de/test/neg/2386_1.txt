"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes, some may argue that small-budget, low-budget films may seem worse, but I would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formula "indie" movie that pretends to be more is worse , <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never get back the 91 minutes of my life I wasted on his film. <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From start to finish, the script did not succeed in providing an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience sees as a hit or a hit Want to see failure. <br /> <br /> In storytelling, the three dramatic conflicts are human versus human, human versus human and human versus themselves. <br /> <br /> The script focuses on a group of college friends in New York and deals with the dynamics of man against himself, where each of the movie's characters is so affected by depression and depression is self-destructive Behavior that stunted the film in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters indulges in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no background, why the character is addicted, a fiancé who has sex with the boss / investor of her fiancé, even though the figure is too It's too smart to have sex with such a bad character, a man who starts out as a decent guy but feels attracted to an unkempt investor and, for some unknown reason, turns into a similar evil business man: a locked, plump gay cyber geek who does nothing but finds online data, and a gay Asian who dates an HIV-positive older man but has no scenes of why the relationship works and why love develops. <br /> <br /> Crucial- Scenes Identify the cause of the character's dependence, the suffering, and the lover's self-contempt, which might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze pouch; story that would explain why a decent guy is attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" character and becomes a donkey; a story for the chubby cyber geek; and missing further scenes of interaction between the Asian man and an HIV-positive friend. <br /> <br /> Without giving specific details, all acts of the characters seem forced and invented. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> I found that Mr. Johnson's guidance did not have a clear position and the actors were emotionally disconnected. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can at best be described as banal. Mr. Johnson chose small areas for shooting and could not take the size of New York City. This failure produced a claustrophobic film that looked like filming a stage play and not a movie. <br /> <br /> The score was scrupulously absent in most movies. I assume that Mr. Johnson is to blame because he may have asked for each score to improve understanding on each shot. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" is annoying and unspoken flaw in movie production.
