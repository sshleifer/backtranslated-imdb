This movie would be a great piece of history if it really was a real movie about Kennedy's assassination. That's far too many mistakes in this movie to point out. It's a movie about Kennedy's murder, but many of the important facts have been changed. There are no scenes, and many scenes do not work after the presidential limousine passes the sign. Both Kennedy are noticeably slower than the other four people in front of them. Next time you watch this movie, look for things that do not match, like the Texas Gov. and his, along with the SS men at the front. indeed it is accelerating. This movie is clearly an attempt to cover up.
