This is by far the worst and most offensive crap on TV. I'd like to ignore it completely, but Fox put it on their Sunday schedule, forcing me to look for something different between American Dad and Family Guy. The dinky male star is pretty much the least developed, pathetic apology for a person I've ever seen on TV. Nothing on the show is funny from a distance and pretty much everything that has already been done on it, and much better from other shows. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that their strategy is to bring it deep and hard into the Sunday plan and to hope somebody starts liking it ... but I have to break it, Fox, that is the wrong hole. The scam did not work for me - I just look elsewhere - but come on, you fucking bonheads, this show is fucking SUCKS, and it's even worse when compared to the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup ABORTED REMOTE DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS DAMPING STACK?
