Understandably, critics call the Oscar Winner Club. What was won after Halle Berry for Monster's ball, went straight to the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Do not Cry and follows her with The Core. Jamie Foxx makes a dive as a pilot in the boring stealth after catching a gong for Ray. It seems Hollywood starlet Charlize Theron pukes over her "monster" Oscar with one of the worst sci-fi eyewear ever made. <br /> <br /> The film loses its interest after just 20 minutes, making it the only one that's really worth staying in. The fact that Charlize Theron is still a garbage is still an extraordinary actress, that makes the best of a crude and ridiculous premise. Æon Flux is not only flat after all, but also very boring for an action movie. It really only pleases comic fans and Horney teenagers who like the idea of ​​Theron running around half naked for 90 minutes. The river can only really be doomed to failure. <br /> <br /> Against the 2011 virus, which kills 99% of the world's population, and in the last city on earth, Bregna, the survivors, about four hundred years later, year 2415, they continue to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name the scientist who developed his remedy. <br /> <br /> In this utopia, not everything is good, and it's not beyond the high walls that protect citizens from the never ending jungle, but what an unspoken, unwritten taboo holds and binds this unwritten taboo, holding together and uniting these unfortunates who are within these walls of paranoia, conformity, and undisputed obedience. Ironically, filmed in and around Berlin, this is a story directed against a totalitarian state, a walled city where its people can no longer reproduce, and its sinister and secret conspiracy, as it is life br /> Flon Flux is the assassin tasked by the underground rebels to change the course of humanity forever. This is the story of their struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> In Flux, they combined lousy tales, rough tempo, and truly terrible effects. They are more like an unrealistic video game than a movie. The only thing that's happy about the failure is that there are no sequels in the works. Flux could only be the beginning and the end of one of the worst franchises in history. Thank goodness for the lousy revenue at the box office. <br /> <br /> My last judgment on this really lousy feature? There's really no story here except Charlize Theron jumping around in a black suit like a blade of grass. Acting is very feeble-minded and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that exist today. It's too much to be like an adaptation and does not really take away much of the cartoon's expectations. The only half of what was paid tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
