I really liked the Wrecking Crew (1999). This was the last of the three films in this series (the first was Urban Menace (1999), which I have not seen yet). I know it was Baaaaad, but all in all, the three leads did a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> But that was really cruel. Ice-T was terrible and he is the producer! I can not say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learned how to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. Miss Jones was pretty good in her small role, though she later made abominable, racist "jokes" on her radio program after the Asian SE tsunami (and other sad occasions). Keep it up, girl ... <br /> <br /> Nobody else gets a loan. Oddly enough, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (both of whom are pretty bad here) in The Wrecking Crew, which was done with Urban Menace at the same time as Corrupt, are much better. I do not know how that works. <br /> <br /> I will now try Ice-T's comment to see if he apologizes for the movie or tries to make us believe it's a great piece of filmmaking.
