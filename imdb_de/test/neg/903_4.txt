This curiosity contains Bunuel-like touches, but does not maintain its interest. A 10-year-old roams a bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual cult movie suspects (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) committing acts of evil in the name of the comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the writer is thrilled to make you wind. I remained untouched because of the broad acting. You know that you'll love Meat Loaf and Flea for the most appealing perfects. (And what about this kid's screen test? He's unbearable.) Recommended for about a dozen fans of SONY BOY ('87).
