... if only Disney stayed away from it. See, I think this movie has potential. Well, at least the situation of the main character. Take out the whole Jordan Cahill thing and you have the beginning of a decent movie! Of course you lose more than half of the movie, but well. Not so much loss. <br /> <br /> So here it goes: They take a typical, neat, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) whose best friends often yell a "pop sensation" (I suppose it's a direct quote from the movie, movies like this almost always contain that particular phrase) called Jordan Cahill. Apart from that, TPSTG of course wants more out of life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a highly developed person, who is exactly what TPSTG needs (to be honest, I do not care what the name really is, I like the acronym better). The two new friends visit Jordan Cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of the droolers) and get away with his cell phone. Hijinks follow, and in the end everything is fine. <br /> <br /> If only Disney or any major movie studio had not had such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds. Or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds had expected a bit more of the films they are targeting. It's sugar-sweet crap like this that makes me more than a little unsure of who I'm rather disgusted with (a little movie called "High School Musical" comes to my mind ...)
