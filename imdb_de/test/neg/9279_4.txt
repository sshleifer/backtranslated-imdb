This film is a window onto the world of Britain in 1973 - a world of summer camps, flags and birds. I was actually in Pontins Prestatyn when this was filmed. It is fascinating to see where I spent my holidays as a child and which world we left behind. The "conspiracy" concerns, as it is, the attempts of Stan and Jack to turn a job at a holiday camp (Â£ 25 a week!) Into an opportunity to hunt down young women and complete Blakey. The rest of Stan's family joins. Some laugh from Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive (Anna Karen), the persistent chuntering, as well as Blakey's shepherdess, but the notion that young women would see everything desirable in brilliant Stan (Reg Varney) or awesome Jack (Bob Grant) it is easily possible. Harmless enough in his day, now it's just a curio from a past time.
