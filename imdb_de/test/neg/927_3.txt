The third film, based on Charles Belden's play "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933), is aimed at the Generation X-tasy. The two screenwriters Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes spend more time developing the main characters than other Slasher films - a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic position. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) did not matter much to the world's most beloved heiress. She reads "In Style", striptease guys, chatting with a cell and annoyed about a poorly conceived pregnancy. Your regular routine has been irreparably changed. Hilton reached its peak - not so hot - during the parody "1 Night in Paris" (2004). While the Pimp-my-Ride is on the move, she "eagerly looks for lip balm" in her friend's lap (Robert Ri'chard). Finally, the "actress" expiates the word "N" on the sex band. Director Jaume Collet-Serra formulates his double point in contrast to the theme of the past. Each of them showed opposing qualities at that time, while a pair of good or bad can come out of the womb today. The latter, however, does not exclude the former. Birth is the luck of the draw. Viewers can hardly call Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary quasimodo. Granted, the hermits have similarities like artistry, disfigurement, subservience and murder. A small variable between the two, however, makes the difference. Vincent is uglier inside than outside. Collet-Serra's "House of Wax" pays homage to actor Vincent Price from the first 1953 remake. The film leaves obvious Van Gogh puns to the imagination of the audience. However, the decision to divide the antagonist into two parts ultimately removes a vivid twist. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's demasking comes second, but Lon Chaney's most terrible horror story is in "Phantom of the Opera" (1925). As for the new candidate, the effect of the separation operation reduces the effect. A surgeon should know how to operate on Siamese twins, physically and mentally. Your dad needs to call a few colleagues - dr. To consult Phil and Dr. McNamara for sucking / upsetting. Despite what the trailers say, "Wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
