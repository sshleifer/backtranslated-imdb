Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this by giving the viewer long facial features of Huppert, and these are a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - she feels emotions with the slightest lift of an eyebrow or a flickering smile. <br /> <br /> Aside from the pleasure of seeing an experienced actor in his profession, there's nothing like this movie that makes me want to recommend it. (If you enjoy self-mutilation, sado-masochism, and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" might work for you, and apart from those attributes, I could find no redeeming value in it.) <br /> <br / Buried in all this weird stuff lies a kernel of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically or whatever - start as strangers and are shaped by the competitive environment into strange people. <br /> <br /> It's not worth going to a cinema Learn this hour of life. <br /> <br />
