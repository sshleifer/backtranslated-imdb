The most annoying thing about "Dies d'agost" (August Days) is not just that NOTHING happens in this film, but director Marc Recha has the nerve to pretend that this movie is a kind of tribute to the Catalan journalist on the left Ramon Barnils. If Barnil's name is not mentioned a few times, it is a "tribute", this is a scam. In this film you will learn practically nothing about Barnils, about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and about the special role of Catalonia in this war. Nor do you learn about the collective punishment that the heroic Catalan people suffered for years from the victorious and vindictive Franco. <br /> <br /> The footage of the Catalan landscape is of course very beautiful, but "Dies d 'agost" does not have an extensive and diverse collection of such scenes to be considered as a travelogue. The multiplicity of the imaged still pictures - for example less luminous pictures of the forest floor - is the clearest indication on the lack of ideas. The aimless movement of the brothers Marc and David during their camping holiday does not create a captivating cinema. On the contrary, the strongest impression is of a movie made by and for middle-aged hippies. Do not waste your time. Instead, read a good book about the Spanish Civil War. (I recommend Felix Morrow with sharp anti-Stalinism "revolution and counter-revolution in Spain", which contains a gripping account of the Barcelona Uprising of 1937.) Barry Freed
