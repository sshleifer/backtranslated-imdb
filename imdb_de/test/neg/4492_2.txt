May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent caravan park or perhaps the white Compton of Los Angeles bears witness to a terrible childhood tragedy related to drugs and violence. An unprofessional but dedicated police partner is attempting to abolish a "sophisticated" club drug war that is being fired and gutted only by the high-priced lawyers of the drug officials. The plot becomes denser as more people return to seek revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was a walk by Ron Jeremy. <br /> <br /> If I were in a cinema, I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry for the poor actors in this movie. It was just awful and painful to look at. The worst thing was the camera, where the director flashed in the same scene, so the sound did not quite agree. And NO, it was not a codec or DVD issue, but an intended technique. Ughh. Two stars
