Fran√ßois Traffaut's "Mississippi Siren" had an unconvincing plan. The script required too much flexibility in lifting the disbelief. The plot was at an icy pace. It began in an interesting environment, but soon drifted into the depths of the melodrama lacking in logic or intelligence. What did the critics think? This is even overestimated to be called a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who enchanted in "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", was just annoying. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie at the same time we rented another Traffaut movie. We looked at it first and found it so bad that we sent the other unseen back at the same time.
