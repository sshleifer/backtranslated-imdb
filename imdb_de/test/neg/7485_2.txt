Jon Good's Wife (simply one of the worst titles for a movie of all time) or The Red Right Hand (another absolutely horrible-sounding title that means nothing and has no relevance to the movie) under which I've seen it, is in ' Salem, Massachusettes 1978 '(coincidentally the year I was born, which was probably the best thing that could happen in those 365 days), when five old college friends met for a class reunion, the gay boy Roger Mather Really? Just say it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) & her boyfriends Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) & his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) plus John Good (Marc Ardito, why is John different in the title?) And his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the beginning there is a restless tension in the air and when someone mentions his "missing" friend Calef (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories come back. Then the telephone calls, the mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and guilt come as the real horror of the events that finally came to light many years ago ... <br /> <br /> Produced, produced and directed by Kurt Gioscia Ding wrote & Kurt St. Thomas, who also gets the Art Direction Credit and if that was not enough, both act in the movie too! Personally, I thought Jon Cargo's wife was terrible, I mean, she can not cook or anything like that! Ha ha ha, just a joke! Seriously, although I did not think much about the movie as a whole, it's pretty slow at first, and the entire first 30 minutes is made up of reunited solid snooze material that consists of a lot of mutual catching and boring character show. The movie never explains, what about those weird nosebleeds for God's sake, the mysterious telephone calls, the almost inconsequential death of a group that may or may not be natural, and what is Sara all about? She looks like a curious, crazy for sex, dirty talk, shameless, extortionate know-it-all, who seems to be sleeping with every man she meets! Some of the dialogues she spits out would not be out of place in a porno and seem to be completely different from the rest of the movie, which looks more like a drama than the horror / thriller it should be. Then there's the end, when there's a worse way to end a movie than just literally hanging everything in the air, without any closures that I have yet to see. The whole thing was also very predictable. I mean, anyone watching this will not know that if everyone was "missed" by their friend Calef, it would not be part of it. <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia & Thomas are making an exciting movie, in addition to the predictability and the annoying climax there is a retrospective narrative by Alan that I simply do not understand because it has no other or less importance than any other & at what time he talks about himself? The reasons for this narrative are never clarified or elaborated. There are no tensions, because all things depend on the numbers. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is fine, but nothing special. Some of the locations and clothes did not look very authentic to me, this never convinced me, it took place in the late '70s. The acting was alright and what about the surname John Kuntz? I think if his wife were standing next to him, could we call her Kuntz, right? I really do not think much of Jon Good's Wife (an exploding doll would have been.) Better! Ha ha ha) & I'm not sure who would like it. Forget about any kind of horror, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere or excitement. In fact, forget everything that would have made this film visible because it is not here. Not recommended.
