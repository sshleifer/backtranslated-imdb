Given that Roger Corman gave his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Corman directed many memorable low-budget horror films in the 1960s. I especially enjoyed his adaptations of Poe's stories like "The House Of Usher" and "The Pit And Pendulum" and "The Raven", which played the late great Vincent Price. These films had a solid impact, atmosphere, excitement, strong characterization, intriguing storyline, and provided some deterring moments. Unfortunately, "House Of The Damned" largely sacrifices these qualities instead of kitschy low-budget special effects, straightforward nudity, and mindless gore crowned with fast cliché and camera angles. Interestingly, House Of The Damned starts in Ireland with some nice locations, but from here it goes straight downhill. Instead of spending some time building the atmosphere, creating characters that matter to us, or building tension, the director decides to crank up the body count. After a short introduction to the main characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the time shifting the film's balance from one "sinister" event to another, replacing a coherent storyline in this film. The main characters are so poorly designed and played so poorly - the audience does not care what happens to them. To make matters worse, the "scary" events are either completely clichéd or unconvincing due to special effects with low technical budget and low budget. The soundtrack has been lifted by "The Omen". The plot of how little there is is strongly based on "Poltergeist" and "The Legend Of Hell House", but it lacks the qualities that made these films convincing. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in getting well done Haunted House Flicks. I recommend you visit classics like "The Haunting (1963)", "The Innocents" (1961) or the early American International films by Corman and pass on "House Of The Damned" unless you are masochistic or mindless. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
