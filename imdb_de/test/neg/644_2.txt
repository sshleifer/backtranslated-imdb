Some plot spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> The renaissance of the Nashville network as "The First Network for Men" is a complete disappointment, as is the block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy were just terrible, "Gary the Rat" mediocre at best, and "Stripperella" rather unsurpassable. This cartoon is mostly boring; When "Ren and Stimpy" suffered from overkill, "Stripperella" lacked decent shock gags, funny nonsense gags, clever gags or gags. The concept is initially poor: Pamela Anderson, a stripper with a superhero, rescues "The City" from a selection of dumb supervillains. This cartoon seems to pay homage to crazy crazy superhero parodies like "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without the jokes and good writing of these cartoons - or even good storyboarding. "Agent 0069" tries to waver between idiotic and sexy, but it is not, and the cartoon that fails to achieve one or the other brings this series to a standstill "and see how a real superhero - Animation is.
