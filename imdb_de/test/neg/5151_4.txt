No, it's just a cheap 1940's series that carries the good name of the cap. If you are a fan of comics, you will be very disappointed. They radically changed their character. No shield, no Bucky, no fight against the Nazis, no wings at the side of his mask, and above all: Captain America is now a prosecutor and no GI anymore. Dick Purcell as Captain America? Do not look too closely when he puts on his costume. It's pretty obvious he was not in the best of physical shape when he produced this series (can you say limp?). It is also very obvious that a stuntman does most of the action here. In almost every chapter there is a compulsory fistfight shot and executed the same way. The villain is pretty bland and although he uses a pseudonym (The Scarab), he carries no camouflage. The story repeats itself and is very simple. The effects are ridiculous and the action is average. On the positive side, we have sexy Lorna Gray as assistant to the D.A. and the good Captain can drive on a cool-looking motorcycle in an early chapter. All in all, okay, but nothing special.
