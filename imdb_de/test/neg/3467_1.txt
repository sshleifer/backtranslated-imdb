Many of the negative reviews focus on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, it had about as much to do with the actual NFL as an average war movie with a war or a western with the true "old west." I think we should give them an artistic license. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the director (Clooney) apparently thinks he's doing a spin-ball comedy, a) doing stupid things, b) taking mugs for the camera, and c) stupid scenes of raids and them stretch far too long. Screwball comedies need a fast pace that is not necessarily frenetic, but always moves briskly forward. Here things are pulling and pulling and pulling. After watching this movie, you'll see how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he pioneered the genre with his Keystone cops. After 90 years, you might think that directors studied the old masters and learned or maybe even improved a thing or two. But no, it's as if someone had seen an automobile pioneer build a Duesenberg, and almost a century later he paid homage and "improved" the concept by assembling a pushchair with four-wheeled wheels. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several movies by Clooney, I consider him a gifted actor. But only a few actors can be competent. It took a while for Clint Eastwood to get the hang of it. Clooney is well below a very steep slope. The film is better seen during the few times it is out of the picture, but when it's in the picture, it makes itself the center of attention. In the fight scenes, his attacking is so abhorrent that one wishes someone would beat him. <br /> <br /> If you're doing a screwball comedy and want some romance, you need to develop some chemistry between men and have female leads. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of two dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. No spark, no hiss, not even a post-mortem twitch. Zellweger, who has also produced some good films, must have exchanged her Botox injections for oak tannin, resulting in amazing wood performance. She might have pulled off the "hard world in a man's world" just once when she'd tried testing the boys with a testosterone while looking into the camera with a small smile and a wink. But no, she kept her jockstrap close together until the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie is just not funny. Doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Doing stupid things like the Stooges or very sporty like Buster Keaton can be hilarious. But otherwise it is boring and all right. I think I got a good laugh from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I have seen it for free on cable and still wanted my money back.
