This terrible action? Science fiction movie is a crap. I've just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story makes no sense, there are many mistakes in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown actor is terrible, the lead actor seems to be too old for his role. I was induced to buy this VHS, which has great coverage, and to see this crap due to the illogical IMDb user rating and some "ten star" ratings. I've just reviewed the authors, and each of them has only a short review (from "L.I.N.X.") that was published in IMDb, and nothing else. Why do you promote such a garbage? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
