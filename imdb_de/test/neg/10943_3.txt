This movie is missing in everything. With the exception of Bobby Deol, who is mediocre on his own terms, no one in this film has come close to a single scene. Kangana is completely fake in her acting. <br /> <br /> The great Anupam Kher has a guest appearance and in these 2 minutes is better than Bobby in the whole movie. The music does not underline the movie so well. The difference in music between Bobby and Upen is not so well highlighted. Great concept went completely wrong. The film has no real ending. Please do not waste time as I did for this movie
