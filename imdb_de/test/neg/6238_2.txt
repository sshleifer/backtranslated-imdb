It's been a long time since I was as lame and boring in a movie as this one. It's one thing to have a slow pace in which the characters progressively evolve, or a particular aspect of the movie is significantly improved by such a tempo (like "Lost in Translation") and almost faltering, as in this case. I suspect that Helen Mirrens expression had shaken her by the disappearance of her husband! Surprise surprise! (Sarcasm) And what a great way that the whole story ended up falling apart, really a masterpiece.
