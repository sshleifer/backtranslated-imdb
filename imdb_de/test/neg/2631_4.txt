I caught this supposed "horror" sting late on Friday night. I wish I had gone to bed! Tell me ... Should a three-meter-high raincoat trigger a kind of fear on a gurly bike? Not here, but Mi-Low can see the caretaker (Antonio Fargas), who is three times his size, (?) Uh-huh. And the end is so pathetic ... it does not leave anything hanging on your head! I asked myself, "Is that it ???" <br /> <br /> acting is about as good as in a low budget movie. The aforesaid Fargas provides a decent performance; But it's my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn may be one of the worst actresses ever to be in Tinsel Town! Safe, sweet face, but bad spectacle. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
