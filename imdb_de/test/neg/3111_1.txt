I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 at a local flea market. I thought with the cast in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles are all alright), it would be pretty good. Boy, I was wrong. This movie totally annoyed me. Almost every scene stretches too long. The scene in which Rob Lowe sings and dances this girl in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is not a picnic either. My guess is, when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything 3x longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The current rating of 1.9 here on imdb is on the money. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Look dry for 1.5 hours instead of looking at it! <br /> <br /> If you want to see better movies from this director, check out 'Mean Guns' (along with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T). or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen).
