Not only why? But "What did you think?" This must have been a kind of <br /> <br /> sort of payback for Gus Van Sant, because this is one of those weird movies that should never be (re) done. It's going to be Hitchcock's movie <br /> <br /> frame by frame, but without the magic or suspense or the awesome movie <br /> <br /> doing. Rent the original instead and save yourself.
