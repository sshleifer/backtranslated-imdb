Hopper has never been so bad, as if he thought that this film deserves only a level B performance and he is doing a pretty good job. Outside Madsen and Hopper, the spectacle is terrible; You have seen better at your local high school. The sound and sometimes the editing and camera shots are low-end of B-movies. The scene with the Peeping Tom is the movie with the biggest unearned nude scenes I've ever seen (he does not get close to the movie). The script was probably a great 10-page outline, but if it's a feature film, there are more holes in it than the bodies Madsen left behind. I have to say that Hopper was driving the lobster in a nice suit, that I had to laugh out loud, but I do not think that was the intention. Yes, there is a small style, and Hopper can always catch my interest. However, the interesting action plan never pays off and you wonder why you wereted your time watching this.
