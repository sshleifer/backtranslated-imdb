This short review does not contain spoilers as the movie spoils itself. It is made of wood and pedantic. It has no saving grace. If someone invites you into their house to see Mr. Imperium, do not go. Even the title of the movie is awful and points to the garbage. The whole story is so bad that Mother Theresa could get desperate !!! It was not a stroke that led to the early death of poor Ezio, he had to act in this clunker who did it. He must have been following him for the rest of his days. Maybe he was a hostile alien and wanted to avenge his captivity on the Americans. In this travesty he found a perfect vehicle for his anger.
