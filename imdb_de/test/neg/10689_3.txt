Due to the budget and inexperience of everyone involved, Livin 'Tha Life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (whom I've always found annoying), as a previous commentator has noted, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) reactions take far too long (a director's problem)), has some comparatively subtle and funny moments, like when he wants to teach Jamal the right method of smoking a joint with a buddy. As a rule, he is more and more obsessed with Jamal, which may have been the source of a nice confrontation with the contrasts in the relationship, but was not very well developed. But the inexperience of the writer / director / cameraman / etc is no excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Did he ever hear of a close-up? Even Ed Wood could do a close-up. I do not think that this is a household question. I could just give a general description of how the actors look, not just because of the close-ups, but because of the lighting ...! Light for outdoor photography may cost too much, but you can make a reflector out of paper! The camera would have had to be moved closer to keep the reflector away from the shot, which at the same time solved the close-up problem. If that's too technical, you can turn the actors around so they are not in the shade, or you can put out the shadows, and if they had not been shot in LA, I'd say it's cloudy days. It goes without saying that the films from which this movie originated are all better, with the possible exception of Weekend at Bernie's, but Livin 'tha Life would have made a much better impression if the viewer did not all squirm would have the way through, to take a look at the human element. <br /> <br /> PS The scene in the hair salon is just stupid.
