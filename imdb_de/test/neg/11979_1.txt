As a fan of the game and when I saw this movie, I was physically vomited !! <br /> <br /> It was a horrible movie, though the story was similar to the storyline. the whole thing with the super human soldiers. Otherwise, Jack Carver, a pure American guy in the game, is played by a germen, unless that's a twisted irony. That's why I had to pull a middle finger to the TV screen the second it was started. The fact that you can film it in a forest filmed in the middle of a forest in the middle of summer is not recommended, as the game is played in the tropical rainforest while the director is looking out his window. In the morning we went on "That's on good forest ". <br /> <br /> THIS IS A NOTICE TO ALL GOVERNORS: If you plan to make a movie based on a game / book, play it, understand it, and ask the fans afterwards. Do not just play it Hour long and suppose you know it !!!
