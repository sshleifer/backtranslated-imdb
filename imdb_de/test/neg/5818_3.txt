This is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - proving why actors - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and not your neighbors! <br /> <br /> I will not do it but say so - the better moments show a base to be really funny (not just crazy) to keep trying, maybe take some courses and time to learn how to make a good movie. ("Dude, Where's My Car" and the "Scary Movie" sequence have everything in this ... college try.) <br /> <br /> The lighting was not; the production was not and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice attempt, not convincing). (This reminded me of "Dark Star" - this is about "Lost in Space" - but this movie is just lost.) <br /> <br /> The talent was the bartender (he said so annoyingly "dog") I knew he had to act ... right? ... now acting!), the man of Mark Hammond and Marty. I think I gave the film a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
