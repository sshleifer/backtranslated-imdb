After her star cross-country skier dies after a race, members of a track team are persecuted and killed by a mysterious masked killer seeking revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie It was pretty obvious that it would not be very good (at least in terms of true quality). The "dramatic" track race at the end of the introductory scene was one of the least credible sports events I've ever seen in a movie. It seems that the winner of the race has never run in her life before. Not just on the track. , , but run at all. Ever. From there we get a terribly unrealistic female Navy member who has broken many rules of appearance with her jewelry and make-up, not to mention that her hair hung loosely on the collar during the uniform. Ridiculously uncomfortable camera angles, miserable gore effects, and a spectacle that ranges from frighteningly exaggerated to boring (all in one actor, mind you), all contribute to making this movie one of the most freaking funny horror movies ever made. On the other hand, the writing was not so terrible and the story was actually alright. But the direction was terrible, aggravated by offensive bad cinematography. The acting ranged from acceptable to simply abysmal. Despite all the embarrassing bad elements, there is something here, whether it is cheese or something else that I can not understand, that makes the movie extremely enjoyable and very worth seeing. Maybe it was just Vanna White. <br /> <br /> Obligatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: Death scenes were funny enough, but the Gore was just awful: blood splattering from impossible angles, no real cuts or wounds of knives, etc. But this movie has the first "Death by Football" scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was a bit of nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley is still there and some overly horny students, but nothing too much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer ( s): If you think leather gloves, stop watches, track them suits and fencing masks are cool, this is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: Not at all.There is a moment in the locker room Girl I was preparing to be afraid of ... But it only led to a typical stupidity and was ruined for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: A bit, but considering the murderer's identity after about 20 Minutes, then I have 'I'm not too sure about your deduction skills. <br /> <br /> - awkward dance scene: There's a great improvised jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with one Guitar and a harmonica instrument leading to an incredible 80s bopping It's a weird mix of 70's disco and 80's breakdancing, which was probably the scariest part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 4/10. Do not take it too seriously and you can enjoy it (just like most other things that appeal to Troma). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
