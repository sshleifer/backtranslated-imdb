Korines has now established itself as a talented and impressive image maker. Mister Lonely's billboards contain all of the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one more promo material in particular: a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, streaming down from a lush green forest with pouring rain). The opening images of this film, Michael Jackson's resemblance (Diego Luna) on a small motorbike by a single track, are strangely captivating and beautiful: Roy Orbison's "Mister Lonely" plays on the soundtrack and the images evolve in slow motion. There is also a funny and grandiose sequence in which the same character mimes a dance without music (though a radio sits like a dumb dog beside him), in the middle of a Parisian street; Korine splits in sound effects and jumpcuts that evoke a sense of futility as well as a liberated liberation in the character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest who is currently flying over with some nuns and bringing food to impoverished areas nearby. In a scene that is both light-hearted and poignant, Herzog has to deal with a stubborn, enthusiastic native who wants to travel by plane to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange unfolds, Herzog draws a confession from the man: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the reason his wife has ever left him. This scene, short and sweet, gains in weight when you hear their improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when Korine and co. Filmed - and his adulterous nature was in the real world Life gives a lasting, overwhelming guilt. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is a hit. a series of intrinsically interesting moments that contribute to a frivolous, confused narrative. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy retain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural frameworks, Mr. Lonely feels like a victim of the integrity of spaces in space. A few scenes were cut from the film, which otherwise would have painted due to continuity errors in the costume otherwise fuller pictures of certain characters. This is undoubtedly due to the lack of a screenplay and Korine's tendency to improvise. In particular, a deleted scene in which "Charlie Chaplin" (Denis Lavant) and "Madonna" (Melita Morgan) have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene in the movie (I will not ruin it, But it's there, every one Feeling half empty of warmth or solemnity, and it is, as it is, only half successful.) The two incoherent strands of the narrative are best addressed as two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (It has something to do with the conflict between one's own ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) However, the Duke scenes are not enough to earn their place in the film, and therefore any connection between these two is allegorically interconnected threads inevitably tense - and the recording is boring in retrospect. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious move forward from Julien Donkey-Boy, who at least in the aesthetic segments has usually too many characters for the movie length, a mistake that would have been even worse if big stars all played (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many self-contained images of images and moments of real, true connection The soundtrack feels as if it would be more appropriate for an art installation or photography exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation, she would lose none of her power - in fact it might be more impressive to me. The loneliness associated with iconic performativity (such as those encountered by both the icons themselves and those who want to be like them) is captured in images in which 'Marilyn Monroe' (a beautiful Samantha Morton) represents the Camera with a camera seduces seven-year Itch pose in the middle of a forest or at "Sammy Davis, Jr." (Jason Pennycooke) settles down after the dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera and an incredible, calm lake. <br /> <br /> Moments like these and all those titles randomly selected Michael Jackson songs crawl across the scene and are much less married in a movie narrative than they should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I have lost all confidence during the egg-singing scene. You will know which scene I mean, because it seems like a bright thumb, as a kind of bauble in the new film language for which Korine was previously celebrated.
