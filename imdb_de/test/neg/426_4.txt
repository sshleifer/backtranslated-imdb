Jeff Speakman has never really made it past the lowest ranks of martial artists who have become actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson), and with vehicles like "The Expert" you can see why. There are three main problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say action - is everywhere, there are some characters who have a lot of screen time but have little purpose, 2) There are only 4 total combat scenes Some of them were completely independent of the main plot and some took place in the dark. 3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing. Strange as it may be, this is really the most annoying thing about this film: The score is a persistent effort to convince you that you're seeing a kind of grandiose epic, rather than the low-budget limited-action movie you actually see. With all that is said, there is at least James Brolin nearby, to add a touch of credibility. * 1/2 of 4.
