I've just finished this movie and think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I zoomed through it at X2 speed and completed it in less than 30 minutes. Not only was I disappointed, but angry that I had wasted my money to rent it. It's one of the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The story was very confusing. If I had not read the DVD case first before borrowing it, I would have been completely lost in this movie. I did not think Tim Robbins would have been willing to appear in the movie after making such good films as "Shawshank Redemption."
