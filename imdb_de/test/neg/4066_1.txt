You have to see that. I could not stop laughing at the stupid things that I saw in this movie too late after the event. There are perhaps a million individual mistakes and stupidities in this film. Acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years old. The alleged thriller is nowhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh about it and laugh about it for a long time. We had a great time after the movie. Really. Me and my friend spent the entire 40-minute bus ride home chatting about this movie as we saw the next Oscar winner. Unfortunately, we talked about all the bad things we just saw.
