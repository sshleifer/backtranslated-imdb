I saw Kindred for the first time in 1987 along with another movie titled "Devouring Waves". I remember that I hated both of them and I never really cared to look at them again. <br /> <br /> However, I recently started a crusade to collect so many horror titles of the 80's in their original box form for some time. I have a pretty proud collection with many more titles on my list! <br /> <br /> The Kindred, although I do not have a copy of it yet, has high priority, since all the old movies I did not like at the time are very important, I own them now and have looked at them again and think that they are brilliant, and the pieces that I remember from Kindred are now driving me to get a copy of ASAP <br /> <br /> Hurray for the 80s Long live the horror!
