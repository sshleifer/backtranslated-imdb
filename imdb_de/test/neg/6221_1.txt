I love musicals, from cheerful Oklahoma to Poignant Porgy and Bess to the touching romantic "Damn Yankees". And I know most of the songs, sometimes I spontaneously sing them with a crowd or hum them alone. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical, unlike this variety show, each song is laboriously put together the exact moment. It's an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or grandeur - a natural extension, to fail at the mere words. In "Guys and Dolls," "My Time of Day" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson, endangered by the most unlikely woman. Each song in this brilliant copy of the genre sets a mood or develops a character that creates a phantasmagoria of the place that is absolutely credible to the self-proclaiming incantations of the song. For this lover of the Broadway musical Mama Mia and her adaptation to the screen in the last half of the 20th century, there is somewhere between satire and a gruesome funhouse distortion of the genre. The songs of these musicals promoted there the often elaborate, often sexy storylines. While the songs, which are simply from a collection, only affect the shaky premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most viewers who make this film a monumental success simply have nothing to do with the art form of the musicals of the 20th century. You have no idea of ​​the magic that writers and copywriters perform that can turn a ballroom into someone we know and love as he has been achieved in "Sweet Charity" arrogance of this review. Maybe, on another day, in a different mood, I could have agreed and was not so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can only imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter Irving Berlin and so many others could have done with this silly premise. I think about it while the memories of the movie are fresh and I can not help but mourn the big loss.
