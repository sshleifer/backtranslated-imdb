I'm not sure why the producers had to trade in the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests it's a continuation of the first three films ... which it's not. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a completely different character in this film (he was eight years older). Okay ... so Reid and Martin were not the most talented artists and could not wear a movie on their own. But to trade in the HP franchise seems to me that there could have been some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier films. I'm sure that anyone who wanted to see it went "crazy" - believing they were a sequel - not a completely different movie with a well-known name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley is not funny and could not blame the deceased Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a considerable visual distraction ... I have to give this a DUMBS DOWN !! Just calling the movie "Down to the Last Minute" would have been alright. In addition, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) were not involved in creating this film.
