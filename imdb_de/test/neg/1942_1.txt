This is by far the worst and stupidest show I've ever seen on TV. It's almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties), as he does his parents, who only seemingly have no idea of ​​the stunts their bogus son and his equally stupid child have to endure. Friends Of course I know that his parents are involved, but I really hate how they always behave as if they were completely surprised. It seems to be wrong through and through. And I hate the intro of the show in which a voice asks, "Bam Margera, what is he thinking next?!?!" (I think that's the case anyway) and Bam himself replies, "Whatever I want!" - IMPRESSIVE! Bam is really a big awakener - at home with mom and dad! Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced by a tasteful beep, but we receive the message. Bam is the real rebel - at least in his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his group of deaf sculls target an audience of teenagers, and of course it's an MTV show, but please, raise the bar a little higher. It is painfully predictable and stupid and therefore nothing but boring.
