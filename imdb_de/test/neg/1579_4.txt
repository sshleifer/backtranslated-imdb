I'm a big fan of The ABC Movies of the Week. I'm only 27 years old, which means I was born after the end of the show, but I try to get as many of them as possible on DVD. I have about a dozen. I had read such wonderful things about this film here and elsewhere that I was really looking forward to seeing it. I just received my DVD by mail today and I was concerned. I admit that the first one or two phone calls have brought me goosebumps - the voice of this boy would give everyone goose bumps! But it started to disappear quickly, and the whole divorce was stupid. I also found out that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the end of the movie. Once this story was told about how Elizabeth Ashley's character had locked up his mother, I knew something was wrong. And had no one ever thought to ask him why he suddenly suddenly appeared that night when the fire in the barn happened? I admit that I thought he was training a boy at school to make the phone calls. I did not guess the dumb boy part or pre-recorded tapes (did you ever say whose voice that was? I gave this movie four out of ten because I really enjoyed acting.) Ashley is especially great. " br /> <br /> It's a shame, because this movie has such a great premise, but well, that sometimes happens when you have too much hope for a movie.
