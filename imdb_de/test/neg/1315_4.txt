The production values ​​for this film do not allow Hollywood blockbuster status, and the script does not allow cult status. What's left is a tired formula attempt in the catastrophe film genre that disappears with the tide. <br /> <br /> A decent cast that either misses or can not be disturbed. The beautiful Joanne Whalley can not do that The role of the police commissioner Nash, who wears the most irritating waistband over her skirt, is difficult to understand. Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavyweight part of the director of Thames Barrier with the conviction of a fairground candy floss. Their Canadian nationality and accent were probably formulated into a transatlantic audience. She and she fail. Her first appearance in a close-fitting pink jogging suit at work is ascendable. <br /> <br /> The role of "Siren Old Git Who It Right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if he is asleep and the various acts destined to his son played by Robert Carlyle to revive him to fight any response from him are hari kari for his failure as Met Office Director or for his acting or both, and only David Suchet appears with some appreciation for his role as Deputy Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> There was enough in the story, and the cast and impact have produced a decent effort. Unfortunately that did not happen.
