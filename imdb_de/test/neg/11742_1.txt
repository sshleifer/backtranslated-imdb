Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece with some modern facets: Walkman and Nudity by Anne Heche. If you do not have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked, there is NO reason to watch this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better, and Van Sant does not realize that the original shower scene is all the more horrible if she hides the nudity and the gusset. Ask Janet Leigh about it. The drama is also much flatter and the technical aspects are less impressive.
