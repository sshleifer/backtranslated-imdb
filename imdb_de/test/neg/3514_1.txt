I have to start with this being one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen in my life! Disturbing factor number one: never see the face of the "son" (for the entire movie). And the infinitely more annoying factor: The incessantly ringing phone ... nothing more than listening to the phone over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, over and over, over and over, over and over and over, over and over. They understand my point of view. The old man was molested, but also the VIEWER! At first the movie was interesting for me, but it deteriorated very fast. The film might have been good as a short film, but it was definitely not enough to retain something that approached the feature length. I suspect I'm trying to say that the message of racism (which ultimately appeared in the last two scenes of the film) is secondary to the harassment of this old man. Who wants to sit and watch what is really nothing but an old man who causes obscenity on someone who insults him? If you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy ... look at it!
