Slayer begins in the South American rainforest, where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a bunch of vampires. They barely manage to escape with their lives. Jump forward six months later and Hawk is called to Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter), who informs him that other vampires have been spotted and that his ex-wife and wife Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) has gone out on an expedition to study beetles, she worries that she is asking Hawk to take a troop of soldiers to South America and officially provide Captain Grieves and his men while at the same time he unofficially searches for Laurie and is not killed by the vampires who have decided to get out of the caves and into the civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook, it deals This is another very bad sci-fi channel original, which is only isn't very good in any way. The humorless script, as far as I could see, has nothing to offer, it's one of those modern vampire movies that chooses to choose the "traditional" vampire movie rules it wants to use, like those vampires with stakes through the game Heart & have fangs, but at the same time can walk around freely in the sunlight and do not sleep in coffins. The movie moves at a reasonable pace, but it's all very boring, bland and lifeless. The story is bad and just stupid, the character is terrible, the dialogue is memorable and there is very little to recommend. Slayer also tries to have some kind of ecological message, as the head of the vampires claims they are killing people only because of the systematic destruction of the rainforest, where they have lived in secret for centuries. Unfortunately, there is no conviction a disposable line to fill the time as a serious statement. There is not enough evaluation content and it is a rather unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The creators do not mess with the jungle setting, I did not expect the fuck Predator (1987), but I was hoping for something more than that. Director VanHook made several horror movies What I've seen was just as poor, I'm sorry but he does nothing here and turns in a thoroughly memorable look and feel film. There is no atmosphere or tension and for real fear, forget it. The blood is restrained, there are bitten necks and some blood splash, but it is not something we have not seen or has great effects. There is also a huge vampire monster creature in the end, but it does not look that impressive and it kills itself too fast. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 2,000,000, this had actually spent a decent amount of money on it, but it's still a garbage movie, it's reasonably well done, but nothing special or memorable. Acting is shitty, I'm sorry, but that's how I saw it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another poor, stupid & boring TV sci-fi channel that I just can not recommend. Not to be confused with the rather fine British "Video Nasty" gore movie The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than this track.
