This film has the look and feel of many "Fresh" directors (close-ups and focus on the emotions experienced by the actors). The point of the film was portrayed from many angles and was well expressed by the relatively inexperienced cast. The point is "Have faith in Jesus Christ and the Morman Church". Oh, and if you read or hear anything that contradicts the teachings of the Prophet, it's just Haterade. (Fuel for hate)
