Debra Winger's "Black Widow" from 1987 is MUCH better. <br /> <br /> This is a lame version and Jane Seymour is usually better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is also pretty poor. Only to play his usual role as a boring, rebellious child. <br /> <br /> Maybe both were from Dr. Quinn, who should upset us. <br /> <br /> If it continues, take a copy of Black Widow.
