This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was about a woman sent into space to save humanity, but it turned out that the prisoner was actually taken aboard a spaceship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. History has always been about having sex. All the footage was not needed - just to make a soft porn movie. Of course, we had to watch the heroin of the movie for about 2 minutes during sex. I do not know what that all had to do with the actual plot of the movie - unless I'm assuming to get men to watch the movie. I only gave it 1 out of 10 because there was no other review. Do not waste your money or your time - it's not science fiction, it's more about a movie young adolescent boys see to see T & A. The creature was shown only halfway through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Bad apology for entertainment.
