There are a lot of movies, especially from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can not help them to love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of them. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I've seen it countless times and made a lot of laughter each time. It is the prime example of how every movie was published in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Our killer name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is an escaped psychopathic killer walking around doctors' offices, and a doctor's jacket that chops people off with a scalpel while he's walking. In the end he comes to a house of girls celebrating a pajama party. One of the girls is the daughter of the doctor who wanted to operate on Randles, and Randle put him in some kind of sexual position. (lol just watch the movie to know what I'm talking about.) Now I know what you need to think about at this point: this must be another cheesy low-budget hack and slash strip like Slumber Party Massacre or Valentine's Day -Massaker be it? NO! This movie is terrible! First of all, the quality of the film changes throughout the movie. Sometimes it looks like it could have been filmed this year, but sometimes it's so grainy and blurry that it can not even be seen. The funny thing is that certain camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not mind at all. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if that were not funny enough), but because he was not talented enough to act and direct at the same time, he only filmed one shot of him as he did with his Scalpel went to the camera, and then the clip was played over and over again if someone was killed. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are utterly ridiculous and unlikely, and those who are between the ages of 16 and 18 look more like they are 25-45. I know Slasher movies generally use adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie that was so obvious. I suspect that the reason none of them are still in the movie business today is because they all died in old age ... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that it never got its again Wanted to show faces that's a good thing, because I strongly doubt that they could get into more films, even if they had tried. All I can do is to hope that one day Tyler will make THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY 2: THE FINAL CONFLICT and all the original actors will return. I'm sure everyone would love that. <br /> <br /> The movie was directed by Stephen Tyler (No, not the singer), who never directed again, and was released by B & S (which I am) sure stands for bull and **** ) productions. Bull & S just released another movie, "Forever Evil," which was pretty awful, but not nearly as bad as Last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible, horrible movie ... Highly recommended.
