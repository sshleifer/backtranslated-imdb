Please do not waste your money on this apology for a movie. The only way to see someone watching this is if they are a hardened fan of Erika Elaniak, but you would rather surf the internet than look at that piece of crap. I would rather dry paint than look through it all. <br /> <br /> They're tempting you with Casper and Erika and making you believe it's a sci-fi Dracula movie, but it quickly turns out to be a farce about Van Helsing's greatness (you get the point) grandson, here ironic for a final showdown between himself and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I believe, if none of the future characters knows who God is, that they have not been taught about him and do not understand when they see a cross. I could have achieved much more with this idea. It's a shame it turned out that way.
