This movie is rubbish, it looked really funny on the previews, but I did not even laugh at the whole movie. Do yourself a big favor and do not waste your money on it, do not waste money on anyone. I gave him 1/10, believe me, I would have given less if I had. I'm a 15-year-old guy, and I thought it would be rubbish to see a good movie coming out and Jay and Silent Bob fighting back.
