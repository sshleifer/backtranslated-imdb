Dear Mr. Dante, Dude, seriously ... the title of the show is "Masters of Horror". Anyway, it's supposed to be an opportunity to show off your horror chops to show the world why you deserve to be called the "master" of the genre. Apparently you misunderstood the exercise. It seems you thought it would be your chance (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your attempt seems disgusting, arrogant and, above all, preachig. <br /> <br /> The only reason ANYONE has called your shorts a high score is that their political views are right for you and the people who invest it does not matter, this kind of policy in the neck to have pushed. <br /> <br /> I do not care what you believe, believe or believe ... I just want those obvious (not subtle) and non-funny (not satire) messages from mine Fright. And while there were certainly other "Masters of Horror" that were big disappointments or where I was just confused, why this director (William Malone?) Is considered a genre "master" ... you are for everything else but the rest The whole point of the series is missing. <br /> <br /> So next time ... please keep your forbidden policy to yourself?
