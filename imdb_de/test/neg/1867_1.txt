All movies that contain "silly sound effects" should be recorded. If there is one thing I hate, then it must be a whoop whoop whoo if someone has hit the head. The only movies I've seen are Ghoulies IV and hobgoblins when they're in the bar, and Pixie beats the man in the red suit with a beer bottle ... or rather, she fans him with a beer bottle because she hits never really. Yes, Ghoulies IV does not suck. But I have to ask myself, did they mean that the so-called "ghoulies" mouths could not be moved if they allegedly talked? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. I can make a better mask from handmade paper, some rubber cement and a handful of glitter. That sucked.
