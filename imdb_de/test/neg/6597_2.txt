Even though I sat and watched the whole thing, I have to say it was not good. It was everywhere that there was a lot of information missing, how things had developed, and in some places even inaccurate. If you do not know anything about Michael, you do not understand anything. You have to rely on your current knowledge of the man for a few bits make sense. The action was a bit dramatic. Flex Alexander did not look like Michael, which was an end to me. He looked literally gray. If you portray Michael as a na√Øve, but most positive, gentle and affectionate individual, it was okay, even if they still made him a fool. "It's much better, but the only thing is that it's up to the" bad " I have no doubt that at some point they will make a big budget film of MJ's life story, because Michael You Rock ;-) !!!!
