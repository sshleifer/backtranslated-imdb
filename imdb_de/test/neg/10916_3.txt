1983 was a great year for Stephen King books making it to the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released within a few months. The Dead Zone was the first choice, but Christine and Cujo were both pretty bad, and it's one thing that is the lesser of the two. If one insists on an answer, I would say that Cujo - on the edge - is the weakest. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, fresh from success as Elliot's mother in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) hangs on a thread. She had an affair with a local worker and is now busy with whether to leave her husband or not. Involved in the marital grief is the young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic, and a pretty nasty child with a chronic phobia of darkness that often leads to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby mechanic's yard to carry out repairs, but when they arrive, their car stops. Things get a lot worse when they find that mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) is not around (he was brutally killed and infected by his pet dog Cujo, a gigantic St. Bernard) a rabid bat.) Soon the dog has arrived caught her in her car and tried everything to get into the vehicle to rip these two hapless victims. The weather is very hot; no living soul knows they are there; the car does not start; and the dog seriously wants his blood ...... Cujo has the potential to be a really tight siege thriller, but never really gets going. I've read the book and it's quite disappointing - certainly for King - so it's hardly surprising that the movie version makes so little sense. On the printed side, King could at least create some tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a Saint Bernard is not exactly scary. The "visibility" of the film medium is a constant reminder that Cujo is a Saint Bernard. You could forget that in the book. At times, in the book, Cujo almost seemed like a monster. Despite the relatively short duration of one and a half hours, Cujo becomes a boring and patience-consuming experience, which is occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as exciting as it would like to be. They've even skipped the horrible downbeat end of the book and ended with a "All's well that ends well" so the audience can go home in a happy mood !!! Chalk this as another inferior adaptation of the king.
