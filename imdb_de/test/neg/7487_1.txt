I thought that would be an extremely bad movie. Throughout the time I saw this movie, I could not help but think about how bad it is and how it went down the drain with $ 3.69. The story was so nervous. They did a great job in the beginning to explain who was in high school with whom, but after that, they never really explained anything. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? It seems you can decide for yourself because you did not see the need to explain it. I basically understood what happened, I think. What I was confused about was everything before, what was the deal with the bloody noses, phone calls etc.? Did this guy come back? Was the woman "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You certainly will not see this movie.
