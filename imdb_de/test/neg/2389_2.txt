On paper, this film has a lot to offer: A street kid who has overcome past traumas, rebuilt his life, and succeeded when the world copied him off. Great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the theater, however, there were a few omissions that cast a spell over the film. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone have to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual subjects or characters in a movie, but when used this way is not just an insult to gays, it trivializes the lifestyle and lowers the movie. If the story worked without this cheap trick, it would have had to be cut. <br /> <br /> Each character seemed to come from the same cookie-cutter form: everyone had one big and one small bug, each character is good-natured whether they succeed or not, and each of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact of the movie is that it never lets the name "pip" pass. comes from big expectations. They give it to you once and that should be enough. The story has enough to do with the Dickens classic to make that fact clear. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves Pip, and how Pip, the main character, learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape , In the end, Pip confronts his dark experiences and films with his life.
