This movie produced for the TV movie is about every clich√© you can find for a catastrophe movie. The only problem is that it is not done very well. <br /> <br /> My brain is still offended by the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is reportedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather patterns data and stock footage of weather riots ala The Weather Channels on this monitor. Why should local news from a washed-up side street give an insight into the global weather? You got me. <br /> <br /> Even the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects that humans know. Watch out for the truck and the plane that look as though they were being rendered on a Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the preliminary remarks in this "film" are made with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, the dialogue is forced and I can not think of a sympathetic character that I would like to survive in the second half. <br /> <br /> The character I hate most is the stupid woman whose husband is cheating. If she raised a finger at any point during the show and was not a helpless woman standing in the same 10 square meters of kitchen all day, her husband would not sleep with a PR representative for a competing energy company. She is so helpless, I want to save her and my misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
