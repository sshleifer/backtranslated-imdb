This was perhaps the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Forget that there has obviously been no research into Detroit (Forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha !!). The writing was terrible, the premise completely implausible, and frankly the characters were embarrassing. I can not understand for my life why experienced actors bend so low and take part in something like this terrible god. Well, I've never seen the original before and I do not know if this movie pays tribute to its original form. In my understanding, the original was not recorded in Detroit. Why they would deviate from it without researching details about the area just tells me that it was more than the occupation that wanted to pay the rent. Do not waste your time with this trash unless you are from Detroit and want some comic relief.
