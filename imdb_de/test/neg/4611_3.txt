<br /> <br /> I thought this movie lacked the dramatic suspense that the first movie had. This is hard to achieve if the movie runs for over a week. The original film led to the last climate scene over a period of one year and was still less violent than the sequel. A good thing about this movie was that the film passed relatively quickly because the plot seemed rash. When Rachel's best friend died, the film did not mention a funeral. Another disadvantage was the involvement of Amy Irving. All her scenes slow down the tempo of the movie. The dialogue in this movie was terrible. It in no way reflected the way children talk. In summary, this film could be a hit, but fell apart after the opening scene.
