I actually saw this movie in a movie theater. At that time, I worked in shifts and went there on a hot summer day during a matinee where I could not sleep. The cinema was air conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was an early multi-screen complex, and I somehow got into the wrong room. I intended to doze by something else. But when things developed, it would not sleep. Shortly after the wrong film started, I was also disturbed by a group of cleaning women who came in and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and it's a measure of the film's appeal that they usually expected the place to be empty, and asked me if I could disturb their presence. I did not do that. <br /> <br /> Within half an hour, the cleaners' conversation turned out to be more interesting than the conversation I paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie ran out of the cinema screen with the cheeseiness of very old mayonnaise. The kind that has little dark, hairy tufts on the surface. I remember especially well that my senses were attacked by shrill strings of music that would erupt with very little warning and even less importance. The cleaning ladies gave an anticipated clue by putting their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> The point was that a city bird in the sticks would live under the burden of a backwoodsman, giving them straight and at the same time even one or two moral lessons. The way you do it. A kind of "expedition". There was a sentimental complacency over the entire production. In particular, the lead actress had an irritating habit of staring at each hunchback with a kind of fierce, blissful compassion, as if she herself were the patron saint of thickets. <br /> <br /> And I believe at one point wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Long before the end, I was intrigued by one of the clean and breathing tails of the cleaner of sexual neediness. <br /> <br /> It is believed that there are some who would like to sit quietly for a few hours and not have to think, is a meditation. The best I can say is that I do not want to share their salad. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this movie as a TV ad, which surprises me. It's just the kind of Pap that gets punished in the afternoons for checking unemployed for unemployment. <br /> <br /> If you are ever on shift work, you should definitely go to the right theater. Or hope for some cleaning ladies.
