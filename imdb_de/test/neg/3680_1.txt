If you had a zero of 10, I would enter it. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of taking money from the public. I do not know how movies like Video or Pay Channel are published. I am disappointed by Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer was there for about 8 minutes, so I can not get mad at him. Only the person who called him a star. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no conspiracy except Gallo, who seeks and finds his friend in the catacombs. Why they searched for the gates of hell, only the director knows. They should keep this film in Moscow and burn it to keep all the homeless warm for the night. There is nothing left to say about this film, which all other reviewers have written. I wish I could forget this movie, it hurts my brain.
