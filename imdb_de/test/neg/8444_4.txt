Obviously, this is not the "piranha" of Joe Dante produced by Roger Corman. It was not so obvious when I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, as the DVD cover art corresponded to the comedy / horror "Piranha" produced by Corman, even the DVD menu (of course no features) matched the cover. Halfway, when I saw this strange movie, my girlfriend and I wondered where are the PIRANHAS? When the movie reached its climax, we realized that we had seen the wrong film when we saw the trailer, which had completely different material. Actor, producer, director) were also completely different. Instead, we got a jungle melodrama about a girl and two guys looking for diamonds and facing a vicious animal hunter. This tame, exploitative thriller is boring and pointless and not very amusing for the old value of the camp. Strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong movie, but I think it's a simple mistake to realize that these are B movies of the same name that were made in the 70's. Reading other posts about this movie, it struck me that I'm not the only movie with the wrong movie on the DVD. How could that be an international mistake? Is there a kind of DVD phenomenon where unsuccessful films try to be recognized by wrong DVDs? WHAT'S HAPPENING???
