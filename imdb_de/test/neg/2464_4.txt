Jack Black and Kyle Gass play fantasy versions of their own band Tenacious D in this comic showcase, an art rock outfit with satirical, barbed lyrics. An ex-runaway, obsessed with heavy metal and a beachside, smokeless slacker pretending to be a rock god and forming a band (the moles on their two butts are the nickname of the group). With a fun prologue monkeying a 1980's twisted sister video, "The Pick of Destiny" is a pretty well-produced movie geared toward older kids. It occasionally resembles nothing more than a variation of "middle-aged Wayne's World," with Jokey-Stoner interludes and a warlike struggle with Beelzebub himself. Nevertheless, Black and Gass have an enormously comfortable relationship (they also acted as producers, co-wrote the script and all the music). Obviously, the target audience will opt for it, though the inspiration is a little low, especially in the second half (around the time our heroes impulsively overtake the bulls in a student driver's car). The music sequences are far more successful than the film's satire, and in the first thirty minutes, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 of ****
