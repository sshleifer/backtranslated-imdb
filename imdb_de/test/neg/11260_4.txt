This is a disappointing adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel "In the Electric Mist of the Confederate Dead." It is handled rather poorly, mainly because of the miscast of the main actors. Tommy Lee Jones, a normally good actor, simply does not capture Burke's "Dave Robicheaux." As Robicheaux's main nemesis, John Goodman does a sloppy job as "heavy." The guy who plays Robicheaux's actor buddy does not look like a former "A" champion captain. The rest of the movie is mainly populated with well-known locals who simply do not do justice to a great novel. <br /> <br /> Jones' movie and performance are way too fast for one thing. Robicheaux in Burke's novel series makes you feel that he usually fits in well with his surroundings, is relaxed and slow. This is like the deep south and south of Louisiana. Then Robicheaux is at times almost manic in his efforts. Jones moves through the entire movie in one quick step. He does not vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. The only good thing is the attitude. Overall, the film gives the impression of a television movie.
