This movie is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the Stone Age. The effects are too cheesy. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, which is why I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes total time span. She would most likely deny any involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, there's no interesting part of this movie except to laugh at how bad it is. Rent this to see the worst movie ever made.
