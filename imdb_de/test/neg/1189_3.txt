If you've seen the show and love the league, you'll be disappointed. I went to the movies with a group of hardcore league fans and we all agreed that this movie was not as funny or dark as the previous three series. In my opinion, it was a money spinner. The writing was thoughtful and the plot confused - no, not confusing, just confused with what it was trying to do. It was a self-reliance of the worst kind of writers who are far more talented than my pathetic critiques. I hope that the league can at least be honest enough to itself and that this film is inferior to the three excellent series. I will not buy it, though I own most of the League memorabilia.
