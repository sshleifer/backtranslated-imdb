Acting made you feel like watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and jumps, so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the scenes is pointless. There is no idea of ​​character development. The score / soundtrack consists of about three songs, of which one is played in particular in about 70% of the scenes. I am glad that I only rented the movie, but I still feel betrayed. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to see some decent actors show terrible performances. It seems that most of the budget has been spent on getting some well-known brand actors into this less than bad movie. This movie is synonymous with visiting a strip club. He tries to inspire and interest you. But just when you think something is going to happen, you are thrown into a disconnected scene trying to figure out how to get there.
