Film Title - Tart <br /> <br /> Review Date - 5/26/02 <br /> <br /> Film Year - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (barely), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> NeCRo's rating - 4 skulls of 10 <br /> <br /> Can contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Property <br /> < br /> An "outcast" Dominique Swain wants to be with the "in" group and then leaves her real friends and joins them ....... many annoying rich people are talking. I think I got what I wanted Dominique was fine, but man, the rest of the cast except perhaps Brad Renfro was bad or at least not interesting or likable. I know some might say that the others were good because they made me hate them ... Trust me ... I like disagreeable signs, but this group is unlikely because they are not convincingly bad people br /> It turns out that the only other people I got it for were barely their own and that's Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the time they had was okay. Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character, although he was small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly attacked by terrible dialogues and very annoying characters that is violent enough !! OK, there was a cracking skirt with a skirt that was ok. <br /> <br /> T & A Nudity Factor <br /> <br /> Hahaha, they could not even add nudity to probably spice up this movie because no one would want to wear their body for that crap. If they want to expose themselves, they should do it in a movie in which they are remembered as their character and not for "oh hey, I heard they get naked in this movie". <br /> <br /> Overall view of the movie (review) <br /> <br /> ok ok I know, I'm proud to be the person who likes the most, if not almost all movies or at least find something good in it. Well, this movie is one of the few that I really struggled to find something worthwhile. The problem with this movie is that it's damn annoying. I already have a deep hatred for the attitude of people who are interested in people's nodding, and that did not help. All that this movie really is is just a bunch of rich people who sit around feeling depressed and stupid. I can not stress the annoyance factor enough. This film attempts to work up the proven "in-group" hotline, which is usually fine with little difficulty. <br /> <br /> Why do not I have a picture from the movie or cover sheet? Well, I felt like this movie did not deserve this fame, so I decided to get a picture of the reason I rented it, and that's just Dominique Swain. Yes, I too was courted by her in Lolita and thought that she was so good that I decided to watch her in every movie she plays. At least I keep my promises and yes, I've seen the majority of their films, a few that are hard to find. She herself is a great actress, and I would actively defend her, but Mann chooses some of the craziest films she plays with. This movie and the smokers are both in the same boat of happiness, but at least smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some really good scenes. <br /> <br /> The DVD box also tries to convince you that this film also has stars by putting the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips on the front of the box. If there is one thing that makes P **** S me, then it is a movie in which the names of the stars are placed on a box to make you think it was great! "Just to have the big names in the movie for maybe 10 minutes between the 2. Bijou actually had a part that meant something, but Melanie on the other side has only two lines ... Granted, I do not like Melanie so much But this is about ethics and not about acting. <br /> <br /> Out of all the mess, though props I have to go to Brad Renfro to perform well with Dominique Brad is in real life Maybe a jumbled kid, but at least he can act The only reason this movie gets any skulls is because I got what I wanted, Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro, and I had the pleasure of undervalued Seeing actress Bijou Phillips, who loves me even more, although I was thoroughly annoyed, I still came out with some positive results, although this time was pretty tough. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing ONLY if you've seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you're an odd fan of Brad or Bijou. About Melanie fans will be very depressed. Even if you're a fan of crappy movies like mine, please do not assume that this will be a bad treat because you'll feel guilty about the money you spend on buying or leasing. <br /> <br /> Some films are "so bad that they are good," they say. What they forgot to say was "so bad that they are good (to renounce)". <br /> <br /> NeCRo
