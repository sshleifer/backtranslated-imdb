If you like poor SE, (some) bad acting and a lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. A really cheap looking movie, but I liked it anyway. Why? Because I like such films. I can not help but smile when I see such films ... What did the producers, actors, directors and SE people think when they made this movie? Do not expect a "chasm" or "alien", just a (very) low-budget horror / adventure movie. But for most, the horror is pretty tame. The last monster is pretty cool, too. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes long, so you can not go wrong there. Maybe you can pick it up in your local video store or watch it on TV. I am sure you will have a good time to see it. <br /> <br /> But do not say you were not warned .............
