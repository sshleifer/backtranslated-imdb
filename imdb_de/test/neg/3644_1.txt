I tried to like this show, I really did, but I can not figure out why someone would like it. The storylines are weak, acting is weak and unbelievable. Each actor seems to have been randomly picked up from the street. It seems to me that the whole show is just an instrument for Jamie Lynn Spears to switch to the movies. Each episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to meet. She is always perfect and nobody is like that in real life. How can humans relate to a figure who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is fair, but she's not strong enough to star in a series. All fans of the show are just young girls who do not know any better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh, but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that's not being rushed to a beach party, please accept my opinion and find something valuable for you Look at.
