The funniest thing about Fortunes is that Lewis (Urbaniak), one of the main characters, has a writer's block and apparently also the scriptwriter for the movie. That's also sad, as I generally guess, it's supposed to be a comedy or drama, but that's the funniest thing I can remember looking at one night. On the way home, two people decide to have their assets told by a "Gypsy", as they call them. These two lives are falling apart while the third friend is standing by. Then nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I could not spoil the movie there, but really, this extremely cheap, bad movie had an idea when it started, but quickly shot down hell. Yeah, I'm tough , Honestly, it was not so bad, it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> The writer mentioned above was annoying to watch, though he may have provided one or two of the only two funny lines. The clich√©d "Ladies Man," the only one who was not told his fortune, was just annoying. The only bright spot was the remaining friend, the married father, who was said to have the luck that something big should happen to his son and that he had to be prepared for it. He was funny, sincere and clearly the best actor in the film. Unfortunately that does not say much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too cruel. Heck, they had the ambition to shoot a movie, got money, and achieved something. Unfortunately, I can not recommend the movie in any case. There are hundreds of thousands of other independent films that have hundreds of thousands of better ideas and executions. This was literally 10 minutes of an idea that was stretched for another 81 boring minutes.
