This movie is a garbage dump, and if you try to start the first one, it's just a farce. The main thing that has failed me is the use of the one-liners from the first, which was once said by classical actors as Sam Elliot can not be reproduced in any way. I mean, when Dalton wades in the first phone call and he ends the call, you stay cool. That was great, but when the jerk calls the DEA agent at home, he ends the call with Stay cool it does not have the same ring it does, it does, there are others, but I can not bother to post it but i hope you get my drift, they should be called this roadhouse ....... ...
