This movie shows the life of a great guitarist who wants to make it big, but irresponsibly works almost to the point of self-destruction. However, "Sweet and Lowdown" could not provide one. The main character, Emmet Ray, is a self-centered, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikely that I do not want him or care for him now. I wonder why a movie has to be made about him. The tempo of the story is slow, which makes the movie a terrible boredom. Even Sean Penn's great acting does not manage to bring the film to a remarkable level. <br /> <br /> I like Woody Allen's films a lot, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
