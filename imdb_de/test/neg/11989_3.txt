I am deeply disturbed by some of the posts I read on the message boards of this movie. People say it's actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best movie so far, it's not a good movie at all, definitely not hell! Far Cry is a clichéd mess filled with bad acting, bad alignment, and an uninspired story with an inferior script. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies are not all that hard to do, because for an action-action movie, all you need is explosions and cannon battles scattered around a threadbare plan, and Mr. Boll succeeds do this. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, all horror games that Boll has incorporated into movies are far worse than these (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry has two things that will do it its best: two good leads and some well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is pretty good as Jack Carver and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female leader. The usually great Udo Kier is passable, as the clichéd villain and the understaffing are damn bad. Towards the end of the film, there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence, which was a shock given the fact that Boll was behind the camera. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie has an unbelievably cheap feel, with poor CGI, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst thing was a sex scene that I think I've ever had a scene with. Not only did the two know each other for six hours, but all he had to do was say that he kept warm in the army by spooning his comrades. He's already got her to undress by merely asking her to undress. Then he pulled himself out of bed and got into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. It's a mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you feel totally bored. It could probably make it worse than seeing and seeing it, but I would personally say that you see a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this deposited chaos. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
