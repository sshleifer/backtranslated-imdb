Seriously, this movie is not. Steve Guttenburg constantly enforces his tough dialogue and then gives everyone the evil eye the whole time. He just was not believable, he seems to be trying to be a moron, and he sucks it. I just remember him as the millionaire with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two ... well, that's a big change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean, and he dies (as usual). Only this time he was not impaled on a boat anchor (Patriot Games), smashed by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye) or run over by cows (The Field). He was just shot, very fast and civil, and that's all I got from this movie, that they did not kill him in a most grotesque and morbid way. How sad is that? I just watched it for the 3 seconds Sean was in, and the rest was garbage. I actually tried to see and understand the plot, but there really was none. Seems a bit like Mission Impossible with the hole: "Oooooo! There's a mole! It's the leader of the group and NO EXPECTED IT! Let's catch it! Let's join the underdog good guys to get away with it!" Cliched and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
