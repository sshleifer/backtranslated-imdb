Laughed my ass but probably because I was stoned. Besides that ... this is by no means a horror movie, there is no horror in this entire movie and the storylines are so huge that even a below average IQ staff member would think it was stupid. In addition, I live in Denmark and have been there all my life and can assure you that Denmark is far too small a country to need GPSS and maps to find back when you get lost. I would appreciate that if you do not really try, you could never be further away from the city or other people than a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I believe that no part of the film, apart from two recordings from Copenhagen, in which none of the actors were, was actually recorded in Denmark. The moor woman speaks Swedish, not Danish. The helmet of the first moor body is brand new. The girl they find in the woods hides under a kind of rock that does not exist in Denmark. That's just stupid.
