"Mararia" really disappointed me. I can not think of it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too hectic and not believable to trigger emotions. Dr. Fermín shows passionless bizarre behavior that you can not really understand where it comes from. I mean, how many times has he ever talked to Mararia? Maybe once? In addition, Mararía never seemed to be a real character, but more like a movie stereotype that only had to be included in the movie (or another title was needed?). Among the best actors was a role that was not really important to the story, that of Marcial, the subliminal but modest drunkard. Of course, the scenery, the cultural delights of the Canary Islands, and other "wow moments" were interesting, but the film missed a documentary (if that was what he intended) and, above all, a solid drama.
