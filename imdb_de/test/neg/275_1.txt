What a ridiculous waste of time and money !!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. The whole hype was a warning. I am disappointed with Julia Roberts, she is by far the most talented actress. I think her ability to really act carried the movie. Buddy Buddy Boys Club was a bit too wrong. To offend the injury yet why Catherine occupy Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to ruin a movie. She lacks the ability to have chemistry with everyone on the screen, not to mention that she lacks the ability to act. The other characters lack chemistry: reminiscent of America's Sweetheart's. She made the terminal "The Terminal". This movie is not going anywhere, what a shame, please do not tell me that "13" is on the way!
