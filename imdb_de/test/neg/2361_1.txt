I can not believe how this cruelty has captured the hearts and minds of a cross section of the "bright young things" of their time, but I'm sure I wish I had not. In my opinion, it is an inaccurate, poorly functioning, weakly scripted, overbearing piece of Gumpf. The short trips to an imagined reality make every humor die. The situations are inconspicuous exaggerations that make the already weak characters even more incredible and disgusting. The romance is boring, the end is unsatisfactory and ruins the only reasonable drug message in the film, and the simple plot ("Withnail and I", "Fear and Loathing") is extremely tested with the uninteresting movement of the film. In short, this film is a blatant visual attack without any hint of skill or initiative. I condemn it to the ash pile of history and pray that it stays there.
