A totally pathetic film attempt on victims of Australian soldiers during the campaign in New Guinea. A total waste of money, even if you only watch it on DVD. Fortunately, the video library provided a weekly free DVD rental, otherwise it would have been a complete waste of money. Probably made by artistic types and full of the symbolism in which today's Chardonay socialists seem so. Honestly, this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave guys who never came back. Someone please provide the funds to make a decent movie that at least matches that of Saving Private Ryan. Hopefully the RSL will have as much distance as possible to this film. The story must be told from all angles to the Australians, the locals and the Japanese - although it is ultimately unlikely that the latter will tell the truth about everything that happened during the Second World War. Basically its garbage, do not see, do not buy. Walk away
