The 1970s was without a doubt the golden age of the Made for TV horror. This is one of those who probably came out as the ABC movie of the week. It is the old story of a house and / or a mind that owns one of the new owners. The film has promises but has never been realized. Everything is rushed too fast. Tension and tension take time to build and grow. And there is nothing new. We've seen everything before and a better one. <br /> <br /> One last thought: I do not understand why Robert Wagner's character would like the long-dead movie star when he's married to Kate Jackson, for God's sake! !!
