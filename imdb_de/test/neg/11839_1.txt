Ok, let's make it clear, I love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. In this sense, it continues. "Raptor" is a really horrible movie, in fact it is not even a movie in itself, as it is cobbled together with parts from "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There's new material with Eric Roberts as sheriff and his busty buddy who runs around confused, scared or whatever it is to try (ill) to convey on the emotional scale, but how can they react to something that is ahead of them Was turned years ago. The producers (yes, Roger Corman, I'm talking about you!) Have even bothered to hire two people from "Carnosaur" for the bitparts, so that cruel death scenes can be reused! So this movie is the cheapest. Look at the 3 original films, there are no Oscar winners, but they have some merit and entertainment value, but avoid "Raptor". Oh, it also has the most senseless sex scene, which lasts almost 10 minutes! Do you think they have tried to unpack the runtime?
