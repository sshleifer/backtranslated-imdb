I'm finishing the Goliath Awaits I ordered from my library. I vaguely remembered the years and wanted to see it with my son. Anyway, the movie had less than 2 hours running time and I thought it was a lot longer than I saw it for the first time. The back of the VHS box says that the Goliath "emits a Nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever." The divers were reportedly on a covert mission to retrieve the demonic document. There was no talk even about retrieving this document. The box also says that the "insatiable cauldron of the bestial ship is fed by human blood." That would make this movie a horror movie, and nothing was said about that in the movie. I can not remember the details when I saw this on TV years ago ... but could the back of this box really be right? Maybe the 3-hour movie revealed more details. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering if anyone knows about it.
