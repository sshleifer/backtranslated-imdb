The maximum risk is quite surprising for someone who has seen more than one of his films. Director Ringo Lam has shot an average action movie that compares to most other medium quality action movies. This is a special predicate of a "Muscles from Brussels" movie. It has a pretty classic style, an interesting atmosphere and last but not least the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme does not make you cry, he does a relatively good job. Of course you can not compare Maximum Risk (oh, what a creative title!) With "Ronin", but after you've seen "knock off" it's the hell of a good movie ... of course in special standards.
