First, Katherine Hepburn as Clara is a serious misstep. She just can not convince as a confident, unselfish, rather scruffy wife who created the writers. But the real weakness of the film is its superficiality in the face of a possibly large piece of drama. Schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder runs "Oh, oh, I have a headache" and occasionally angry word. Suicide? The word is used, but in domestic scenes it is not felt, and when we see him in the mental hospital, he is calm and muffled, smiling and optimistic. A superficial treatment. And Brahms is so sincere and bourgeois - not a sign of his harsh humor, of his love for changing the nostrils of the establishment, not a sign of his tortured attitude to sex and his wives because he spent his youth playing the piano in brothels. And was Clara's long concert career solely focused on promoting Robert's music, or was she actually a notable pianist who wanted a career for herself, a pianist making her place in a male world? Any kind of treatment of the life of great artists is better than none, but this is a standard approach in Hollywood that is on the street and, above all, disappointing, because the real story is so much more dramatic, so much more interesting, more human.
