I had high hopes for this after reading previous reviews, but it was so slow and the plot so easy that I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, a boy meets a girl next door at 11 and both strive to love and be basketball legends. Become apart, but watch the progress of others. Guess what! Both receive scholarships at the same university and become lovers again, until his father is played around with a younger woman. Our young hero, unable to cope with it, falls into court concentration. However, some decide whether to opt for a professional and drop study and guess what Lakers picks up. Drops the heroine because she was not there for him in this emotional phase. So they go their own way for 5 years. She returns from Spain after losing the fun of the game, and our hero marries in two weeks. Mom tells her that she should fight for her love, so she confesses her ongoing love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. He wins, he marries, she wins, he loves her. Well, he won, but decides to throw another girl for our girl. The end makes her play basketball and he has baby-breathing. Sorry 2 is my high score. She has given my partner 0 for a soapy story to those who read Mills and Boon
