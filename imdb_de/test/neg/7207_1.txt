It used to be that video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films released low-budget horror movies on a select market from Gorehounds, which they enjoy eating away. This is acceptable to me because you can see these films from a distance with their crappy boxing and kitschy titles. <br /> <br /> Now we have Lions Gate, who are immersed in the mix, only they have decided that this would be the case Better be in poor saps by putting a "professional" looking cover on it and the same Charge the price like one of their more professional functions on a higher budget. Do not let it breathe! Granted, if you've seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2, you already know what to expect with 3, but there's a place for movies like this and it's not in a video library shelf alongside professionally crafted features. <br /> <I am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget productions that were still a worthwhile rental, but this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The "action" (if you can call it that) was miserable. It was amusing to laugh at the awful line reading for a minute or two, but in the end it was too much to endure and became unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow succeeds even worse. The only possible rescue would be an undressing scene, which is still terrible, but has an award-winning effect over the bloodstream after a girl is beaten or the mannequin is beheaded. <br /> <br /> It took me three tries to get through the whole movie, and I only did it because I paid good money for the rent and felt like I should go through it at least. Stay away - stay far away from this.
