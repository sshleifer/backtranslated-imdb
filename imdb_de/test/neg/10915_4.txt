Do not get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And that's a pretty good movie about everything. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is exciting. But after the first few minutes in which poor Donna and her little son Tad were being held captive by the rabid St. Bernard in their pinto, I began to wonder why she was doing nothing to help herself. She had her foot out the door and push the car back (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a slope) and would have gone to safety, but then it would have been a very short film. Did she put the car in reverse when starting up and hoped she could drive down the driveway at least a little bit? No, she's trying to make a three-point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She managed to get out of the car and look around for about 45 seconds to get to a baseball bat lying nearby on the ground - what a waste of time! I mean, if you want to run for the bat, do it and at least you have something to beat the dog with. But forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, such as a tire iron or something? I did not see her looking into the spare wheel well of the car. Really, why wait until you are bitten and weak from dehydration and your son has seizures before you face the animal? At the end of the film, she was shattered and torn, but by God, she was still wearing high heels!
