I'm a big fan of the vacation franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie, and at least a few of the behind-the-scenes names involved in this project (especially Matty Simmons, producer or executive) produced all four theatrical releases as well as "Animal House"). For these reasons, I thought that this TV outsourcing would be worth a visit even without Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I did not expect it to be very good. I just thought it might be a bit of an amusing distraction. So, my big disappointment proves how bad that utter fuckin 'movie really was. It was stunning, overwhelming, heartbreaking and terribly exploding with the head. But somehow I could not stop looking at it. It's a disease that I have. I can not seem to go out of a movie or give up a TV show before it ends. Nothing has forced me to have more than two hours of my life more than this movie.
