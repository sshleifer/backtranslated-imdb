As a gay man who lived through the period studied in this boring documentary, I was very curious to see how the topic was handled. Unfortunately, the filmmakers wereted an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed light on our collective gay history. This film only deals with the time in New York City and ignores the rest of the country. While I was in NYC quite a lot back then, I can assure you there is a gay life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "a-list" queens who were better in the '70s than anyone else, and here they are nostalgic again and still raise their stance. The film should have at least attempted to address larger issues such as race, alterism, the burgeoning gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image and the rise of "clones", discrimination against subgroups within the community, and the ability to be decent Grow mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). Unfortunately, we did not present any of this and the memories of respondents are not different from my own memories. If you've been there this decade, you'll enjoy the archive photos and grainy home videos of the bars and nightclubs we frequent. If you were not there, this movie will undoubtedly be boring. It should have been so much more, but unfortunately not. Two stars to jog my memory ... I still miss going to the anvil!
