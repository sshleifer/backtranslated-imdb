I'm a big fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice scene haunts me to this day. I am now 33 years old and still remember being scared as a kid. When I heard that they were reworking the movie, I thought it might be good, but when I saw the movie, it's 100% not the same movie. It is not a remake. It's a bad stolen idea. It was completely ruined. The performers Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors, but even they could not save this movie. It was just wrong Even the attitude was completely different. And how the hell did nobody in this town realize that there was war next door? Why did not the help appear earlier? Stupid. No sense.
