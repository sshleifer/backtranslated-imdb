I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is it terribly bad, I can not stand my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick I can not bear to watch this horrible movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there is no reason to watch this horrible movie. The plot is just stupid. The actors that surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really bad and Laurel and Hardy were even funnier in their previous films! <br /> <br /> I warn you that you will not see it, the pictures will keep you tracked for a long time!
