I looked at it on TV years ago when I was sick (I do not know, I tend to be happier with my TV when I'm sick, too much trouble using the remote, I think). <Br /> <br /> As I recall, every aspect of the film - casting, drama, writing, directing, etc. - was ill-advised at best. I would have been able to forgive the historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on Trinity; But it did not work There were attempts to humanize the scientists, but they were inadequate and never exceeded a caricature. <br /> <br /> I did not know much about the people involved in the Manhattan Project at the time, but the images in the film were so cartoonish that I was interested in getting to know the true personalities. And I did. I guess that horrible movie has done a very small amount of good. <br /> <br /> This is not an in-depth review, but FMLB does not deserve either one. You like it when you are a fan of bad movies.
