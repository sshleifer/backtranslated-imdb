I paid $ 2.00 for this crap, I want my money back. It's an ad-grade horror movie that's not that groovy. <br /> <br /> There are many MANY floors in this film, including acting, lack of current horror, lack of nudity (alongside the beginning nurse (porno outfit) and the still-breathing Nude Strobe there is no. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack might be best because it has some good guitar riffs / traces. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, the jock, the jocks- Woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock), the rookie cop / ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth, into which I wanted to slip a few dollar coins into it.) Gap ... or for a field goal ) the mysterious guy and the pure girl. <br /> <br /> The make-up was pathetic with side views of Dr. Ing. Choppers that show a clear "make-up line" and natural skin tones. The cover of the DVD is clearly photoshop / improved to make the cover tempting, since Dr. Chopper looks like an old "plopper". The shaggy women who Dr. Chopper hang around, are not explained ook convincing as the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was very predictable and the abundance of bad-looking FAKE limbs was ridiculous, what did they think .... um, a few limbs around and a few wrong blood and you have a horror movie. Dr. Chopper himself is the stupidest character I've seen in a long time, though I believe that the creator of this movie was craving ideas and maybe too tense. I tried to use the rhyme Doctor and Chopper (bicycle) and thought, "Bingo "would make a fucking movie about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse ..... but that's just awful. all about it is bad ... the lack of tension ... the lack of horror or character development ... the lack of a decent storyline ... the only good thing about this movie was when it was done. This movie does not fall into the category Ã¯ts so bad that it is good "for me too / <br /> <br /> A total of 2/10 the director / writer / publisher should know better.
