This film is a totally inaccurate representation of the true story of Noah's Ark. The producers probably have not even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I have ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the Bible, but the authors of the film gave her the name Naamah. This movie shows the destruction of Sodom over 1000 years ago, and what about Gamorrah? It was also destroyed at the same time it was Sodom. (Perhaps the producers believed that Gamorrah would not be included in the story and the city "Sodom" as in "You know what raises more eyebrows"). It is a miracle that a true Christian wants to participate in the production of this vile, hideous, imitated scorn of the Bible.
