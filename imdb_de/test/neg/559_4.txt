I thought this movie would be a shame for the show. Part 3 was not part of Part 2, and this part has no Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor in this case was not quite as funny as in Part 3, but he was funny enough to make the movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The girl's role was pretty good. She is a lost teenager who needs guidance. I find the plot a bit hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she has just met. Of course he was a friend of her brother. <br /> <br /> I really appreciated the monastery. One might think that I do not like the dancing monks, but I found it amusing. It turned out that they know how to have fun. If these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop music, that would have been another matter. <br /> <br /> Probably the smartest part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks did not 'kill a bug' Miyagi told her that street gangs who are killing each other are stupid, nations, who are trying to annihilate each other, are stupid, but to have respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has also expressed such wisdom in the other films. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10 points. Sure, there were a few things that I liked. It was not as funny as in Part Three, and in Part 2 no character could ever do justice to Sato. This movie has no repeat value. I can not imagine to look at it again, but it's worth it to see it once.
