I love old "monster movies" for the pure stock value. This one will not disappoint if you enjoy this kind of fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is pure stilt shit of the 50s. You get used to it when you've seen enough of it ... the dialogue is very stupid and ultimately forgotten. They are only for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> The "science" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous bird from another world that can manipulate anti-matter ... with the goal of wreaking havoc and eating people ... an alien who has come to Earth to nest To the best scenes in the movie ( that do not contain the bird) include the "scientists" who explain what is going on. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the ridiculous birdmouth. It looks like a new baby bird ... bald and ugly with disheveled feathers. It even scrapes like a hungry, angry boy. However, the bird scared the shit of my three-year-old boy, who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening. It's a bit scary. <br /> <br /> I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (Somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
