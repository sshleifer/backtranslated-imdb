First of all, I even refuse to consider this piece as a music video ... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me, a music video can not be longer than the song itself, and the song must play the full length of the video. To call a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. In addition ... let's be honest ... "Thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely outdated werewolf transformation, the thoughtless Vincent Price poem (just because VP recites it does not mean it's not lame ) and the least threatening zombies I've ever seen. Sure, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but do not forget, it happened at the same time as the A-Team was # 1 on TV. Let's not give too much credit to culture ... One last point about the film's impact on the media on music videos ... What exactly added this to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" have not already added to have? As far as I can tell, it just added the practice of stopping the song for some dialogue or a superfluous dance scene .... So you could say that this video really served to give Puffy the inspiration for more annoying music videos. Not quite my definition of great
