Before you find out if this movie is worth your time or not, I should inform you that I have never seen another adaptation of Carmen. So, if you're looking for a meeting that is rated, among other things, it may not be of much use to you. <br /> <br /> The only time I met Carmen was the car radio when I was traveling on a family vacation through Spain when I was a teenager. I did not pay much attention to it because I did not like opera at the time and I did not know any better. The story has been around for about 150 years. Do I feel like missing out on this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because, if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega, I would have all the adjustments in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Director: Vicente Aranda (who The story was also written together with Joaquim Jordà (), the story comes through the eyes of the original author Prosper Mérimée, a French writer who explored the Spanish century of the 19th century. He tells José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a criminal soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sultry, sexy, startling Gypsy who has the mouth of the devil, the temperament The moment she meets José, she is attracted to his wayward behavior, but she hooks him up, spins him in, and lets him go often, until one day If José is wanted for murder, Carmen persuades him to join her group of Gypsy smugglers, they seem to calm down, she has fallen in love with him, but she meets the charming Esc amillo, the bullfighter. Can José keep his jealousy in check or does it destroy him? <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, seductive story that looks almost like a Shakespeare or Ovid act, depicting an immense passion and emotion that can make us break us and make us do things to do out of character. It is poetic, fiery and above all slutty. I got stuck, I did not know which way it would turn. I've always hoped that José Carmen's dirty little ways could change. I will not tell you if he succeeded or not. <br /> <br /> The summary above is what I took out of the movie, but I was not impressed with the movie itself. It was not until I saw it that I went deeper into the story and realized how Aranda had missed the chance to recount Mérimée's classic. It was a flat, slutty time-drama bug that caused Paz Vega to spend a lot of time partially or completely naked (not that I'm particularly concerned about that!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was bad. Sbaraglia as José did not impress me. I'm still not sure if he was a weak actor or if José should be a weak character. I did not read the book. He's supposed to be a man with a burning desire for Carmen, but he spends most of his time looking confused, jealous, and a bit gloomy. Paz Vega was a little better than Carmen. Her hardened, vicious character has convinced me, even though I have seen more convincing performances in other films like Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She seems too pretty to play a gypsy (not that I've met many Andalusian gypsies), so the role did not suit her in any way. The other actors in the movie were not great either. They seemed to be half-hearted. The story is passionate, emotional? They looked half annoying, as if they could not wait to carry the tight costumes of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> However, the costumes I was impressed with were one of the redeeming factors of the movie. I like the Spanish culture, I like the uniforms of the soldiers, the cylinders and the flamenco dresses of the women. They fit the time well. I can not say more about that. Sorry, back to criticism. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the script was co-written by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà and rendered so poor that Mérimée would turn in the grave. It was boring. The intense passion of José for Carmen (or maybe that was just the acting) was not used optimally. Among the millions of dirty words everywhere were cheesy lines, satanic and devilish names. I know that the Spaniards are partly for the comic swear word, but the movie was full of Puta, "whore", in literally every line. Perhaps it was realistic in nineteenth-century impoverished Seville, but history itself did not need it. <br /> <br /> The editing and camera work was boring and normal. There was only a small piece that I really liked, and when the camera in the air follows a close-up of a fly that lands on Carmen's face. That was good. But the rest? Boring. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's sad to see such a great story being wasted on unconvincing acting and directing. If you're a literature teacher, be sure to have your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. Thanks to Paz Vega, however, only the male half of the class will be interested in the movie. Otherwise stick to the opera version (though I hate musicals). I give this movie 4 just because I love the plot! And Paz Vega!
