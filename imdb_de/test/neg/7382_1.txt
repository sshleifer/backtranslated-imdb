At best, I found Super Troopers amusing (seemed to me to be an enchanted police academy rip-off), and I rented this movie in the hope that it will get better. It was not. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely terrible and the tempo of this movie is even worse. It does not feel like a lot is going on in this movie, or that it really gives us a reason to take one of the characters. <br /> <br /> The actor playing Felix, however, may be totally uninspired, perhaps because of the dialogue he had to work with. In short, this movie just went wrong in so many places. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that independent filmmakers since movies like Clerks seem to think they can make films with long, sweeping dialogues where characters try to be funny. But where dialogues in Clerks drive history, it bothers them hopelessly in this movie. Movies should have a balance of action and dialogue, and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to have tons of funny dialogues, it just does not always work. Especially if they can not write dialogues that well. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and this movie was so cheap that it was shot on video.
