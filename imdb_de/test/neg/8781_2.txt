This movie contains the worst actor performance ever. Spilsbury lacks the energy, to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I've never once felt in this movie that Spilsbury is worried about everything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in the presentation of this man. <br /> <br /> There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot does not force them to be friends, you do not have the impression that they want to get along. Besides, the sidekick has the more interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The story is amazingly bad and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard, you can imagine what that is like. I can not believe that the director would agree. It insulted me as a spectator by explaining every line of action that I had just witnessed. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and the venues looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a cameraman as a director br /> <br /> EVALUATION-2 You may be able to laugh or watch this movie show an alien what a bad movie is.
