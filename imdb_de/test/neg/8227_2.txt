This film was filmed by a few college kids in my former hometown and revolves around a freak named "Luther." Luther, who was recently released (pronounced by an intervener in one of the most ludicrous scenes of all time), runs amused at the local Kroger grocery store, eating the neck of an old woman with his metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther runs to a farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, gets chased and gets killed. Oh, and the chick from the SUPERBOY TV series gets naked.
