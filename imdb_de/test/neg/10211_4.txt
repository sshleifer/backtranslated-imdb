In 1989 wrestling here in New Zealand was a mega-hype phenomenon, and the one who controls the starship on the summit was the orange goblin itself, HULK HOGAN (one of my over-heroes at the time) why I made this movie Admired 1989-90 when he came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a shockingly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse !!! The plot follows a standard WWE (then WWF) about 88-91 storyline that ends in a standard good that is knocked down, contracted and then struck again just to follow that the righteous is all his inner strength demands (gained by eating vitamins, prayers, etc.) to rebuild the epic ..... Pretty standard formula here. It's worth watching if you think only of your youth!
