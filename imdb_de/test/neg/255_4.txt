I am in two directions about FOLLOWING, the film debut of Christopher Nolan. Part of me admires that he cost $ 6,000, but part of me hates being too artful. In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI, a movie I did not like, and I can not deal with the central plot of a man who wants to be a writer following people nearby. Would not it be more logical for someone who wants to be a writer who sits in front of a keyboard and writes? <br /> <br /> Well, I think FOLLOWING gives the indie filmmakers the hope that they will vote for and over $ 6,000 over 2,000 IMDB members for making a movie on a budgetless budget I'll have to ask five hundred members to comment on whether this film will be considered as good if it was not done by the director of MEMENTO?
