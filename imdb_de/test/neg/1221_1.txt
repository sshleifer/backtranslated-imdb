Parrots? PARROTS? I have been on this old earth for a long time than most others and have seen almost all westerns that have produced. The history of the old west is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the worst-produced, directorial and drama stories I've ever seen. There was little historical accuracy, but it was obvious that you had worked on a modest budget that played a crucial role in this insult to the intelligentsia. I am happy that I made this show TIVO. It was bad enough to watch the movie and endure the inhumane commercials. Once again, there was not a single actor who seemed almost convincing. I always hoped that it would get better over the course of the three days. NOT CORRECT! I am ashamed to say that I wasted 4 1/2 hours from the little time I still have.
