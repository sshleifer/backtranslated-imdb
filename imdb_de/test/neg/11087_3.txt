Let me start by saying that I love Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I have seen and enjoyed many Japanese films, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) is ridiculous. The two characters who dominate the plot - the "evil master" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" - are pure types without subtlety or nuance, and all their actions are based on caricature extremes. The movie wants to show terrible scenes of violence and raw emotions, but many of those scenes are so over-the-top that they actually get ridiculous and the overall feel is that of a television movie that's out of joint. If this rare movie falls into your hands or enters your city, save yourself and give it a pass.
