** Might be considered a mild spoiler but not more than any other movie review. ** <br /> <br /> I knew that nothing could do justice to the absolute brilliance of the original "Carrie". It was more a film about social criticism than about lighting the gym. Carrie White was the epitome of a "victim," and her story expressed the helplessness that the truly exploited need to feel. Anyone who invented the "Rachel" character for "The Rage" must have missed the subtleties of "Carrie". "In order for the audience to truly share the victim's anger, it must be a sympathetic figure - a true outsider who is more a victim of circumstances than his own vice." Rachel is too uncomfortable with the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spaceks. " Carrie "and she looks and behaves as if she should stand right next to the" attractive and beloved brigade "she burns in the end, she has just as corrupt a soul as she did, whereas Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> It just does not work, it's not satisfying to see the pretty kids - not even the boy "Home Improvement" - resting in the movie's climate scene, and it's so unnecessarily bloody! There was no bloodshed in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person who says that this movie did NOT have the audacity to kill ... but I will not say who he is If you have the original Like "Carrie", this kind of character dies wrong. <br /> <br /> At least they have not made the connection to Carrie adequately; it explains how it should have been. But that and the arm tattoo, which was pretty nicely done, is just the only thing this movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> Another horrible "scream" issue that distorts the reputation of one of the most compelling movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I did not expect much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An unsympathetic character, a series of irritating pop culture credentials that are thrown in for no good reason, and a final scene that fades in comparison to "Carrie's" Gravestone Shocker.
