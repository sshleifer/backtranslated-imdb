Since I was one, I probably had a mind to hire him. Anyone who actually buys it will enjoy it as a coaster. Maybe a Frisbee? This is a DVD I found in advance where the kids could access it. Since DVDs seem incapable of being housed in this backyard with all the big VHS cassettes, I find it rather annoying that they stick this next to a Disney movie. Yes, going from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost has shown what we all think of Disney, right? I have not bent so deeply yet. There is no acting here. The only interesting thing is the old trailer from 1973 for old erotic films, which I am amazed that he can not be burned to hell. 10)
