The Great War breaks out and Daddy is a brave pilot who does unsightly business to put Jerry in his place. Mummy does her a bit of a nurse, so the five kids are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the countryside, where she leads a secret passage to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written a century ago, they stop writing stories. And there is a reason. The men fly airplanes and author books; The women change the bandages and clean the house. The boys advance with compass and nocturnal vacations; The girls do what they are told and play the violin - bad. Fat kids wearing specs are evil. All children speak in those truncated, vocal flattening accents that are soppy and prime, but which are cultivated by a certain economic class of Englishmen. In addition to the snobbery and the longing for Imperial Albion there are action holes that a five-year-old would not tolerate. I mean that literally - my son asked why his father disappeared before sunset, why the compass did not just fall out of his hand when he disappeared. At the very least, the film tries to target the kids until Eddie Izzard's whimsical and lewd monologue (which is a waste of real comic talent) plays on the credits of British schoolchildren attending expensive public schools in the UK find all those funny gasps. For the other 95 percent of British families who no longer live in the 19th century, Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are all available on DVD.
