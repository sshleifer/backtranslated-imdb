Tom & Jerry visit Africa and dress up in "Amos-n-Andy" fashion. They even act and speak differently, with the use of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks depicted in many cartoons of the era decreasing by default. Apart from the offensive pictures, this cartoon is not very good. Why did you even go to Africa? Apparently only to provide the audience with another Amos-n-Andy and the additionally overburdened cannibalistic representation of native Africans. The only reason why a 2 instead of a 1 was achieved was that there were a few seconds with an octopus. <br /> <br /> It's worth a view that still makes you shake your head and wonders how ignorance could win ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I look at some cartoons that It all depends on whether the cartoon contains good content or whether the sole reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those who are misrepresented: in other words: If you get rid of "Mammy", mix your feet, the bad grammar and black face with huge lips, is there anything else? In the case of "Plane Dumb" there is nothing.)
