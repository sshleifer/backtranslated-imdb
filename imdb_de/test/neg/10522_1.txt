Even my five-year-old was bored. Very predictable and overpriced. In this movie, you could not decide if it was Slapstick or if you were commenting on the state of "Pee-Wee" sports. <br /> <br /> Characters were underdeveloped and could have done more with the connection Father and son both came from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> He did not like the reference to the goalkeeper who slipped the laxative off to his team mate ... very mean for a children's movie. <br /> <br /> Typical mafia behavior was boring and stereotyped. <br /> <br /> The dog was so damn sweet !!!!
