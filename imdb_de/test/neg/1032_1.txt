Although the numbers are higher relative to other sectors of society, I do not reject the extremely high salaries of today's entertainers and athletes. A-Rod, LeBron or Brady also have both offers well with 8 figures or the low-9 range. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually turn their shows into billionaires, huge residuals and fees they currently demand. Even their actors and the entire group "friends" reached almost 7 characters per episode. Letterman's earnings for a show could solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two will take care of many for their lives. <br /> <br /> But all are based on solid supply / demand constraints and the financial benefits they have to bring to their employers. And all do their craft skillfully. <br /> <br /> But then comes someone like Rachel Ray, who achieves an income that goes beyond any obvious talent or skill level. I find them shrill, annoying and with a forced "cheerfulness" that is just as spurious as the proverbial "3-dollar bill". <br /> <br /> A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and meeting plans of their company and their affiliates. One of the key talent sources has hundreds of customers, ranging from $ 5-10K to a handful of $ 200K per gig. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams and, no kidding, Larry the Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There are a larger number in the range of 100,001 to 200,000; The list contained the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even the patron Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I think I have to admit that there is enough demand for their "talent" and offerings to justify their talk show, and there are some who pay more than $ 100,000, first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and expenses Door to door limousines, just a few hours from their weeping patter at the event of their organization. <br /> <br /> I just can not imagine how it could all be possible.
