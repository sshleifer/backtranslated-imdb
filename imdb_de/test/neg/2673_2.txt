This movie is very bad. The only reason I gave him a 2 is why I made him laugh. Without revealing anything, the head of a man in this movie explodes. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I do not think the scene should be funny, but it's nonsense. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it's a shame they had to make such a stinker.
