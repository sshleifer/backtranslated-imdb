4 of 10 <br /> <br /> An unbelievable story with some "haunted house style shocks" that really do not fit. <br /> <br /> Gary Oldham's performance is very unpredictable ... less the quality of the performance than the consistency. His character does not behave consistently. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes violent / loud / almost crazy. It just is not believable. <br /> <br /> Have many 1980s movies been badly dated? Will you be more comfortable in 20 years? <br /> <br />
