Sideshow is a good example of a basically very interesting idea. As for horror films, and especially with the influx of teenage films at the moment, a movie made up of a group of teenagers participating in a mysterious freak show is something to have fun with. <br /> <br /> However, the author opted for a very straight, very boring, very simple story about five teenagers who will be part of the show when Abbot Graves, the mad dwarf, turns them into freaks by playing one used miserable machine that mutates them to beasts <br /> The five teenagers are gradually picked up until the last man is left. His "punishment" is that he is unable to join his friends and thus be "alone." What a garbage! <br /> <br /> The 'actors' are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), no blood (and it could have been so bloody!), no action and no horror (and it could have had so much of both!) <br /> <br /> The director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little more interesting. His experience in softcore has obviously disabled any creativity he has ever had since all settings are the same, with just a few edits and little movement. The quality is bad overall. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually influenced by nudity in movies, but believe me, the only highlight in this movie was a pair of breasts.
