I do not know what kind of chasic movement this movie is about. I saw this movie a year ago. I am an Orthodox woman who lives in an Orthodox Chasidic. Community And I can tell you that this movie has insulted me! It's so far from reality, it's scary! The director could at least hire a rabid rabbi for a brief consultation before shooting a "realistic" film about the ultra-orthodox. For example Meirs Davening (Morning Prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding or a mikwe custom. <br /> <br /> The film contains technical inaccuracies. But they did not bother me. It is the spiritual side. In addition to the Taliban Orthodox are represented. Women are powerless, while men are the ultimate rulers! You're welcome! No one can force a Jewish girl to chuppa against her will! We, the Orthodox, also live by the law (Halacha), which clearly defines the responsibilities of the man towards his wife. Also no punches and no rape! And no man (not a rabbi) may point at the woman in the mikveh. And balanit is not to put your hand over a woman's head while taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse your whole body at once! The director clearly tried to beat ultra-Orthodox! But could he at least do it in a nice and educated way? Love story? Sweet ! But not believable. Dialogues are long and boring. The end was totally shitty. For all the drama, I hoped for at least a nice ending, for all the sitting I had the feeling that I deserved it! Obviously someone has tried to make a nice, soothing movie for less attentive Jews or non-Jews. (Look at these fundamentalists, they are so evil and mean ...) and they succeed! To cut a long story short: I was hoping for a beautiful Kane Level movie, but instead got a tradition that whirled garbage that was unrealistic and misleading. I mean, we live today in a time of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to vote. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka made her choice. Many people from unobserved backgrounds choose orthodox Judaism today. Because in this crazy world religion could be a nice goal!
