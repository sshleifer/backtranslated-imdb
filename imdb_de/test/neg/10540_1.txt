The best thing about the film is the name, as it describes both the plot and the acting. At least they can not say they did not warn you ... A bit like the button labeled "Do not Press". <br /> <br /> Segal has to run out of things that move like planes or trains and ships, but the action remains the same. Under the guise of slowly fighting, but still beating like 40 mercenary types and not even blinking. What baffles me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still can not hit him with a machine gun and 50 ammunition clamps in the corridor. Where do all these bullets go? The only salvation feature in this movie is how Nia Peeples Ja Rule (actually Jeffrey Atkins does not sound so punk) looks down. I could spend days watching this woman as she steps her foot over her shoulder ... especially in such an outfit! It was just a bonus to catch Jeffy kicking, and it's fun to hope that one of those kicks has actually landed. Sorry, it's about time that we got stupid wannabe guy who can not play rapper from the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who had an idea at all? I would not believe it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would go through as witty athletic angels. <br /> <br /> The only surprising twist in this movie is that they do not do the politically correct and have Jeffy come in and saved the day. No doubt, if Snoop (otherwise known by his mom as Calvin Broadus, who does not sound so cool if you call him Cal) in the film, he would have put some signs on her and probably saved Segal's life somewhat ,
