I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and thought that in fact something of comedy would be in it. I'm not black, but that does not mean I can not appreciate black comedy. I know that because I happen to watch Wayans Bros, Good Times, and other shows. <br /> <br /> I saw crap films and did not shed so easily. As for Soul Plane, I did not even bother about it. I do not know if they managed to land the plane and I do not care. It would be unfair to say that I found some parts not funny when I laughed, but I also laugh at Youtube videos about skateboarders dropping nuts, so not much is said. The men in the movie were like a bunch of howling, horny hyenas in the mating season, always and "getting something out of it". And we wonder why all these clich√©s do not seem to go away. In summary: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series look like the godfather.
