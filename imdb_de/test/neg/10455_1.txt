This movie was more than terrible, he was a pimple on the impact of the film industry. I know that every film can not be a hit or even average, but those in charge of this epic dud could have known they had a ticking time bomb in their hands. I can not help but believe that the performers would meet between the scenes and comfort each other because they were in such a huge pile of dung. I can hear it now: "Are you getting paid?" "No you?" I understand that this streak was most likely made on a budget for shoe strings, but even considering that, it could have been even better. You wait for the appearance of a monster / creature and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn. I'm so mad at myself that I spent a 1.07 for that stinker !!!
