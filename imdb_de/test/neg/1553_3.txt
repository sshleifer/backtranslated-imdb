I had to watch this movie for my Canadian cinema class and was told that it was the "best Canadian movie". When I saw that, I really did not agree because I've seen a lot better. I understand that there were Canadian motives and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot (as a spectator) were so disconnected made me not really care about what the movie was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this should emphasize the messages, not offend the audience. This movie shows something about the history of Quebec. Not a very interesting movie; it definitely does not deserve to be placed on such a high pedestal.
