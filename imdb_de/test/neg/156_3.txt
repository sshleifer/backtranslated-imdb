Jack Bender's "The Tempest" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the conspiracy from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. He refers to the problem of slavery and the role of wartime revenge. <br /> <br /> Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan, but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel, who accompanies him in his exile. The island is not by the sea, but in a wetland on the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an alligator hunter, a so-called "Gator-Man", who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. In the period of civil war Ariel wants to join the Union troops to fight slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antonius. When Antony and his accountant Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero triggers a storm. The Union soldier Friedrich loses himself in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love, but Prospero will not accept that. While Ariel is turned into a raven by Prospero, he finds that Antony has pretended to ally with the Union, but plans to betray her. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union defeat the southern army. In the end Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda have to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets the island back. Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly, while Antony's character remains flat. It was not a bad idea to stage the Tempest in the context of the Civil War, but the director may have risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructive or funny. For example, Gator Man simply appears without explanation. That it takes a kidnapping to bring Prospero to mind, and that he loses confidence in his power, shows that Bender was trying to make Prospero more human, but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom is not clarified. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- ---------- ---
