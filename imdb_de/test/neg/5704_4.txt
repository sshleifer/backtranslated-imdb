So much for JUDGE AND JURY, who lives up to her nonsense title. What is good? The lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie you ask? Well, that is perfectly explainable. David Keith is actually pretty good at disguising clowns, cooks, and other phenomena while he's the killer who escaped death row. But overall, it is quite stupid despite some new twists. Unapix has recently released some ridiculous productions, and that just means so much. We, the jury, find this movie guilty because many of us sat nearby and thought it was a waste of our time!
