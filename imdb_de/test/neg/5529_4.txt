Victor Jory never became a star. He is better known for later character roles than for his early leads. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. Your kisses look very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Again, Vivienne Osborne is outstanding. She plays a woman with a good reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The pressure I saw was not clear. What a pleasure that rare films like these show up! And they are still intact in a kind of observable state. That's nothing really special. However, if you're willing to flick through films of his time with similarly intriguing titles, you'll probably find some suprtb films.
