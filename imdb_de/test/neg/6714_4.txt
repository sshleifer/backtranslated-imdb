"The Foreigner" is a story about foreign intrigues with Seagal in the center as a deep-cover agent who has a package that everyone wants and wants to kill. The streak is uninspired, with less of the usual action that Seagal brings to the movie card (fire fighting, melee, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more of a story that is confused, uninteresting, and full of pointless filler. What is to be done seems to be a sign and a matter of course during the Seagal, which looks more and more like a pork chop, which meander through this threadbare film, expressionless and bored and show no improvement of the acting ability. Somewhere near "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below" Seagal Flicks made a dive and "The Foreigner" is just one continuation of this trend. Nothing to see here, except for the die-hard Seagal fans.
