another eli red is there. Self-promoting, bad spelling for a horror director. Victor is as far removed from the new horror icon as Mary Poppins (reference to the Disney score). What is going on here? You have Marilyn Manson opening and closing this piece of crap. Can you even call that a horror? terrible, yes, but horror is a piece. David Lynch should sue her for stealing elephant man prosthetics. Please stop, these fan boys now want to be directors. The video directors already have enough competition in the film industry. When you're online and talking about how great your movie is, it does not come true. Stop the madness. I work in the industry and yes, these films are fun, but rarely entertaining.
