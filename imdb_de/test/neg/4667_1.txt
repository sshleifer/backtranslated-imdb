<br /> <br /> I liked some 80s Hollywood action blockbusters. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the action movie dropped to new depths in the 90s. The worst of it was, I believe, Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is shameless and leads to the worst clich√©s that are meant to arouse the audience. The melodrama is so weirdly sweet and terrible that you really can not wait until Bruce Willis disappears from the screen. Unfortunately, Liv Tyler, who had behaved admirably in a number of distinctive idiosyncrasies conducted by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately chose the commercial train. This film symbolizes the new aesthetics of Hollywood with great special effects and precious little good dialogues or authentic melodrama. This is the norm these days and I wonder if there is a role for scriptwriters in Hollywood. It seems they only use hacks and committees to write the simple scripts. The rest are left to the technology. In Armageddon, there is not a single piece of great, heartfelt human emotion. It just feels empty and bland. I can only imagine a good aspect of this movie. It involves Liv Tyler's father, who does not even appear in the film. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith provides a title song for the film - a ballad that really rises and at least a little bit teases when the credits sound predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for superficiality, lethargy and a decline of the human intellect. I would even rather see the eighth Friday, the 13th.
