I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten years old and I mostly laughed about the horse scene. I should have realized that the movie was as empty as ... I can not find a good comparison. It is stupid and not even funny. The characters of the original, who have decided not to play a major role, have probably made the best choice they have ever made in rejecting this. Why, oh why, did Chevy Chase come back ?! And how in the world did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd get involved in this swarm ?! I'll bet that anyone who has their name even remotely tied to garbage (such as the caterer) is ashamed of salvation. All in all, it is beyond terrible, horrible, and everything else. Avoid it as you would do the Ebola virus.
