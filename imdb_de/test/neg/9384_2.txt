Talk about scary. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode, in which the girl who later was in Firefly is kidnapped, there is entertainment for you, but only if you like these kinds of things. I do not think so, I thought, to be honest, this episode was terrible. Luckily, it's one of the few duff episodes in season 3 and the only Charles Grant Craig episode so you will not get much in season 3. So, overall opinion? Just read the summary above. This is a strong contender (Hell Money says hello!) For the worst episode of season 3. To be honest, I did not really expect much. I wish I could complete this episode Oubliette. That's one thing you really understood: the title.
