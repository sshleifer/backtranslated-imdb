Imagination must come to Jim Wynorski's mind when writing the script. I do not mind if the animal scenes are almost identical, but if the actors repeat from other films, that goes a bit too far. I enjoyed watching Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert get eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie as her tits (feelings of my husband). Jerri Manthey should stay on the survival island, her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she is just down to earth. The scene where the cobra comes from the ocean, then eats the guy for added taste the grubby. At least we know that the next giant serpent kills Komodo before it becomes a nest of eggs. Jerri would be great as a mother cobra. sit back with a 6 pact or a few joints. it will relieve the pain.
