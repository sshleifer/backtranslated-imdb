While this film had some scary moments (a lot of use of music and film to build up suspense), it's obvious that director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy did not waste time researching their topic. It also makes me question the claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a true Catholic bishop. Among the many contradictions: Jacob, the Roman Catholic priest, when we first came Meet him outside the church, he wears an academic garb over his clerics and not the typical Alb, the chasuble or the upper body. Academic garments are usually worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not by Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * James the Priest quotes an obscure and disquieting scripture in which the angels grab weapons. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse does not come from the writings of St. Paul and not from the Bible. I can not even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in demon possession and rejects the request to study exorcism, but does a full 180 (later the same day?) within minutes after dating Isabelle had possessed. Certainly it is possible; but something unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest / psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a more realistic portrayal of a skeptic who has become a believer. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest who became a servant, is the first to attempt an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes the scripture and she quotes back. He says "I see you know Psalm 65" - she corrects him "that is Psalm 67" - they are both wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest who has just done an exorcism - to make the sign of the cross, to call the name of Christ, to apply holy water, etc. - tells Jacob that he does not believe in the church and he do not believe in God. (Maybe he just came into conflict?) Jacob asks him to put on self-made robes and try anyway. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former Roman Catholic priest, crosses backwards (or in Eastern Orthodox style). As a Latin-American Catholic who used to be a priest, he would have crossed his forehead to the sternum from left to right of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read in the little side stories to get something the term that messed Satan up with the whole family, not just Isabelle; But even in the end, it was hard to say with any certainty whether someone was really to blame for the images in their head or if it was all demonic trickery (except the sheriff - it's pretty clear he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the entire movie and I liked the conspiracy with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm just not sure if the movie was like that meant being serious or a spoof. <br /> <br /> While listening to the ongoing commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I tend to think it was a joke.
