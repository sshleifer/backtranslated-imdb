Ah, animorphs. I loved the book series and eagerly devoured it in middle school, and when I heard that there was a TV adaptation, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> Boy, what an end the end product was. I think, for me, this was the moment when Nickelodeon stopped worrying about cool programming and more generic ways. <br /> <br /> So what was going on with the series? Let me count the possibilities: 1. The characters were HORRIFICALLY USED. In the books were the Animorphs between 12 and 14 years, the television cast was at least 18 years old. I remember being horrified when I saw the cast photos for the first time. <br /> <br /> 2. Terrible acting / bad writing. I do not know what it was to blame for, so I hit the lumpy mass that it was. Maybe it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hindered the humor, which is at least cute when he comes from a 13-year-old Marco - not funny. In fact, I do not remember a single comic moment in the group, and there were some. The actors were certainly not helped, because writing in its best form was daring and, at worst, pitifully miserable. <br /> <br /> 3. Sir, they were stingy with the budget. Just the end result of the Andalites should have convinced Viacom to pull the plug ... Their heads had gaps that clearly showed which helmet was the case. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to cast - Rachel was by far the biggest disappointment, far from being the warrior in the books, the best equivalent in the TV series was "Scarecrow". I also know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot." <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Did the music have to be so obvious? 6. Answer yes to question 6, because everything else was dumbed down. Why should not the expectedly less intelligent audience get a fat brick song from a lame rap rock rip-off or whatever the hell? There have been bigger disappointments since then (Iraq, 2004), but in case I did not make it clear - this show was shitty and an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based on.
