I was about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just boring and totally unrealistic. I miss many films unrealistic, but not when it comes to a mystery thing. The evidence gathering and interviewing processes were just weird. I started the fast-forward to see how it ended. And then it got boring and just turned it off and gave it back. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, just was not believable. Peta Wilson has done well in this film, but her character was far out and there was no one for her acting talents to play.
