I really wanted to like this movie. The second movie of the series had that stupid, driving movie feeling that was fun (of course I was drunk too). I have seen this movie with the highest expectation of a similar experience of extreme cinematic art, a-la-Mystery Science Theater 3000. I was wrong !!! This movie is a terrible waste of film and I liked the second one !!!! From the rogue villain with the David Bowie Fear wig to the sticky, vile female villains with laughter that could take the paint off a garage door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. I actually felt bad for Sue Price because the footage was under an actress (that actually says it all). A horrible, horrible movie (that's not a recommendation).
