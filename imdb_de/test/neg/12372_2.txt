This horrible moovie is fun on many levels - the most obvious is the lame, fake bird-doll hovering around the cheap sets without ever flapping them (perhaps on a string?), The model trains and toys attacking cars. The "science" is asinin - a Masonic nuclear weapon? And what about the enormous amounts of Brylcream in every hair? I think the 50s was the Slimeball decade! Well, this bird doll apparently comes from "a godforsaken anti-matter universe," and it's here to nest in New York. Serious. That they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame. I give 1 out of 4 hooves - it's stupid and stupid, but more fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
