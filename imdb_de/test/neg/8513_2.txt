In my opinion, this movie is not good. I do not think it's a good thing to say anything about that, but I'd like to explain it before concluding it's just another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the movie because Costas plays Mandylor in it and that was the main reason why I saw it to the end. I like action movies and I understand that such movies are more action based than story based. I know that they do not go into details when it comes to the credibility of history and events, but even that does not explain why some scenes look ridiculous just because they lack the sense of reality. <br /> <br At the beginning, the film looks very promising: a tough, handsome specialist and his not-so-tough but smart and fun partner need to do a job that's a little different than expected. The story takes place on a cruise ship. A catastrophe happens, the ship is turned over and only a few are alive. During their struggle for survival, they must escape a shark, a professional killer, and the rising waters. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie is pretty violent. The main weapon (in addition to the catastrophe, in which most passengers have already failed) is the weapon that is successfully used in many cases. I personally have a good man to man (or woman to woman, if you prefer) missing. Family fun? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie was shot in a hurry, with no real vision of what he wants to say. From the usual action-movie tricks, with something called love, and no real meaning, this only leads to a bad movie.
