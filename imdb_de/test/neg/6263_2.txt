Cheerleader Massacre should be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; If that's what they did (which they consider to be an actress out of the original returns in a small cameo role), they've failed miserably and made by far the worst episode of the "quadrilogy." Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines bad drama, a dreadful storyline, a stupid killer, boring and boring deaths, boring landscapes and disgusting camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made. Did I mention how bad it was? Do not get me wrong: this cheesy and reserved excuse for a horror movie is not nearly as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it's certainly a horrible movie of an original slumber party massacre. Stay away by all means! This movie is totally rubbish!
