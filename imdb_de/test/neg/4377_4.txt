Well, the hero and the terror is a bit below average in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a real martial artist and gets his butt in this movie, but he's pretty slow and, in my opinion, acting is largely inferior, even though Steve James does a decent job in my opinion. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused why the psychopath preferred to go to the theater at the end of the movie rather than to Norris' girlfriend. Until then, the killer had only killed women. Well, I think it was not as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie that you can pass on.
