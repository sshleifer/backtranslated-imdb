I left with great hopes to "stop" because the "shower" of the director had impressed me so much. Despite some mistakes in Mawkishness, "Shower" is on my list of favorite films of all time for his penetrating insight into family relationships and his generally outstanding acting and directing. And I've seen it at least three times now. <br /> <br /> But "quitting" fell flat in my estimation. It seemed to be a pointless exercise and I was so tired of the unbearable personality of the main character that I longed for the end of the movie. I admit I fell asleep six or seven times, but it only took a few seconds, so I think it's still okay to write that comment. <br /> <br /> I admired the parents and the sister. The device that uses all the real characters in the movie is a beautiful one I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Disappointment aside, I will still strive to see every movie with Yang Zhang's name simply the base of the beautiful "shower".
