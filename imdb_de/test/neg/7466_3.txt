Antonio Margheriti, director of the relish cheeky cult horror Cannibal Apocalypse, steers this gothic-style giallo with the gaping icon of the 70s, Jane Birkin (as well as her massive Conked-French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg) despite the inclusion of such treats as With a tasty bi-sexual French teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye ends with a bleak mess that's hard to bear. <br /> <br The beautiful schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to her family's Scottish estate after many years to discover that a madman is gradually killing her relatives. Margheriti uses a whole series of "creepy old house" tricks (hidden doors, dark corridors, spooky cemeteries, and rooms covered in cobwebs with candlelight). Our end is unimaginative in the extreme. <br /> <br /> "And where exactly does the cat fit in with all this?" I hear you ask. Well, a rather chubby Moggy witnesses every murder, justifying the rather cool-sounding title of Margheriti. <br /> <br /> "Gory, stylish fun" claims the DVD cover; "Boring dunghill," I say.
