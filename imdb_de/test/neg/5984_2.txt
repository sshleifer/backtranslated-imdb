It looks like it is going somewhere and quickly leads the main characters into a circus with three rings of remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys the characters' sympathy. I'm a huge collector of Stoner movies, but that's something I would not consider as a valid addition. Bong water is garbage from the deepest areas of the dumpster, and I would not catch it dead on my shelf. I'm actually convinced that this film was created by a partnership for A Drug Free America. If you're a fan of Jack Black, I'd say you think 5 minutes of the movies are alright as Jack Black continues his heritage of singer songs for Retards. I really can not say enough bad things about this movie.
