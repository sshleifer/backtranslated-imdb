This movie was just so horrible that I could not go through the whole thing without turning it off. It was just so bad! When I saw it, I always thought it looked like a really cheap movie from the '60s or something with those terrible-looking special effects, but then I realized that this movie was shot in 2001. Dialogue and acting were really great terrible and the plot almost did not exist. I did not think anyone would make films that looked so cheap and old again. I'm not sure if they did it on purpose or if they had no budget for this movie at all. It really looks like it was taken with a camcorder at someone's place. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it just looks very cheesy. <br /> <br /> I really do not know how anyone would like to look at this. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 *.
