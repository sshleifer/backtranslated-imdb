When they announced this movie for TNT, I was excited. A travesty from Donald Westlake's "Enough" was one of my favorite stories. After seeing it, I was not so excited anymore. Recently, I had the opportunity to see it a second time with my aunt, and again I was disappointed (she did not like it much and she had never read the book). In this movie they have managed to saturate all the charm of the book and turn it into boring porridge. Much of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him well in other movies, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stuttering, incompetent Yutz. In the book, Thorpe takes a lot of Valium for his nerves, but almost always remains externally collected, which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They've also skipped a lot of the story (apart from a 2-second view of the embassy), in which Thorpe solves 4 murders of the police instead of 1. This is important not only because it's funny, but also to build the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the film, Fred's betrayal in the end does not seem nearly as poignant as it does not seem too close. In the book they become quite good friends, especially on the side of Fred. The ironic is that he is the fall of Thorpe. Fred also suffered a bit from the casting, I love Adam Arkin, but he was not a happy, happy, happy guy like Detective, character traits that Fred possesses in the book, making it more obvious to him to deal with evidence and so more shockingly , Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great, though he did not look much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boathouse scene, which was completely added to the film, was far less interesting than the police who found Edgarson's body after Thorpe had shipped them to Seattle and blamed death on the mob. Kit was fine, although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die because she was getting a little annoying. I do not mind if books change to make movies. I know they are necessary because of their length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter, rather than gloomier.
