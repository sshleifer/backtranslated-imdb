To see "Baghban" is the equivalent of film when you try to eat almost three hours out of a basin of saltwater taffy. This Indian movie is a sticky, sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts like "King Lear" and in the middle part changes to "Romeo and Juliet". Then it's back to "King Lear" for the rousing finale. <Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly desire from life: a woman who loves him, a family that loves him, and a job to retire for a living long faithful service. Although Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four adult sons, they still look like a pair of lovers, cuddled and sighing, each other's eyes beating and whispering each other's ears, almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the whole bloody breed is so happy, loving and harmonious that the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family by comparison. The parents and children joke together, laugh together, even perform elaborately choreographed "spontaneous" song and dance numbers (as with many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama with a large number - in this case far too large. ) a series of music sequences). <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows anything about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss must not go unpunished for long, and that all that joy is just the beginning of a terrible disaster destined for the minds ought to overthrow our unsuspecting revelers. If we know that, we spend the first hour of the film in anxious anticipation, wondering what this disaster will look like when it finally arrives. The thunderbolt occurs about an hour after the film, when Raj tells his children that he and her mother have decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice between the children and their spouses. As King Lear discovers the vipers hidden in the family bosom, Raj suddenly learns that his children are not quite as loving, selfless, and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought. Understandably appalled by the prospect that the children are thwarting their parents' plan, they have devised a program where Raj will live with one of her children, while Pooja will live with another; then they switch off until finally each of the children had the opportunity to take in both parents, and the cycle will repeat itself endlessly. Much to the chagrin of the children, the parents agree with the plan, even if the two deeply fall in love with each other and have spent time together. Thus, the second and third hours are usually spent as the two aging (albeit married) lovers annoy each other while their ungrateful insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are houses. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with "Baghban" is that it lacks finesse in terms of storytelling and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the dizzying closeness of the family unit, becomes so thick in the first hour that the movie almost collapses under the weight of sentimentality. Then, with virtually no warning, the script turns and turns the kids into calloused, selfish monsters and parents into passive, whiny victims of those calluses. Raj and Pooja are a bit too long and a bit too own to make the dreamy, pouting, unfulfilled love piece that is more suitable for lovable schoolchildren than the parents of four adult children. The violet prose style, underlining and emphasizing every emotion, leads to intense over-interpretation and a strong reliance on crooked reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. The musical numbers initially convey a certain liberating joy, but it lasts so long that they quickly lose their effectiveness and only serve to bring the material into unbearable conditions. At least one full hour could be cut out of this bloated production, with no apparent damage done - and pretty good. There is really no reason why this movie should be punished for three hours. Most annoying of all is the seemingly endless Harangue we're putting an end to, a speech in which Raj (who somehow managed to make his experience an award-winning bestseller), teaches us all about the truths of parent-child relationships At least ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" is a juicy, crazy saga filled with more sugar and goo than a large box of sea chocolates. Sample at your own risk.
