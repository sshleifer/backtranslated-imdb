It is not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will receive the Rutger-Hauer status. Some people will expect it anyway. Let him work on his English pronunciation first. If you look at the "journey" of these actors (DVD-Extra) to Paris, you probably want to catch up. Advice to Beau Dorens: Stop your acting career, you will never get there ... To the 2 main characters: Adults, please As generous I would give 4 out of 10 points. <br /> <br />
