This movie is just bad. At first the story is just weird and it's not well written. When you are done, you will have questions. Sometimes that's fine, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> Acting is nothing to write home about. The adults are doing a good job, but the children are not a good job given that they are children. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was the worst. To be honest, I am not sure if this was the main role. I never thought who this movie is about. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some shots that stood out, but there was nothing exciting about cinematography. The sound, however, was better. It was a nice score. A little kind of adventure, although for me it was not an adventure movie. It had some elements of an adventure movie, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to say who this movie was for. Children? Barely. There is too much language and violence for that. Adults I do not know. It had many elements of a children's movie in it. It was like an adult movie in a kids movie wrapper. <br /> <br /> The story was just funny. I have no idea what it was all about. You were thrown in directly without knowing anything, but there was always evidence of something you thought you ought to know. The fact that the children's parents were dead, for example, and that Mickey blamed Pete for it. You expected to know what happened, but you never got it. All in all, this movie was bad and a waste of time. There was no drive in it. Nothing to really push the story. This is not what you spend your Saturday night.
