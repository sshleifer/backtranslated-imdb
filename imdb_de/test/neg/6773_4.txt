I mainly looked at this to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has some twist and turn - it's not a bad puzzle all at once. <BR /> <br /> But why are we throwing a wreck into a circus train and a refugee gorilla? I can mention this without being a "spoiler" because the wreckage of the circus train and the gorilla have nothing to do with the complicated, mysterious conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The bad person who tries to kill the good people has many tricks on his sleeve, but the wreck of the circus train was purely coincidental. It allows a single scene with a threatening gorilla, but then it's the murder mystery again!
