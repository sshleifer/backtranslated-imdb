This movie has some beautiful special effects that rip the Japanese archipelago to a degree that would humiliate Godzilla. The two leads also deliver above-average performance. Apart from that, it's all a bit impractical in this inconspicuous disaster strip. The incongruences in the tempo are bizarre. At one point Hokkaido sinks into the sea and pyroclastic snow falls on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried under an immense tsunami. However, in other parts of the country, people still go for sightseeing and lick ice cream when another tsunami rolls in ... Kusanagi also manages to travel long distances with no obstacles or even a crease in his shirt. Other people come with burns, torn clothes and mud stripes on their faces. <br /> <br /> The Japanese of the film is both touching and repulsive. Kusanagi's sacrifice on his last night with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry that is rarely seen in this genre these days. However, the ill-fated Prime Ministers are thinking about the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is being abandoned by all and, in the end, has no friends, points to a darker paranoia that plagues Japanese concerns about its status in the US , <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the last sequence is a rip-off of Armaggedon, which was edited with a cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> Finally, my own beetle bear - the heavy-handed product placement for cigarettes. This time it's the crazy scientist Toyokawa, who is considered a figurehead for Japan Tobacco. At one point, he manages to glow 5000 meters below the sea surface in a miniature submarine the size of a telephone booth. Give me a break.
