The daytime television of films. Rarely have I felt so little connected with characters. Rarely has I been frightened by such a terrible conversation. Disgusting London-Thirty-year-olds chopping up around the glaring BBC, splashing platey mulch. Avoid this movie as if it were the fall of your grandmother.
