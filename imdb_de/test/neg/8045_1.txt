COC had its moments. I liked the action sequences, but I despised the script and the plot. I hate this movie so much that I only write about the dumbest part. First, the action would never happen. Second, the weakness of the Chinese president was not mentioned. That would never happen. Finally the dialogue. To engage non-Chinese actors with Chinese roles is understandable, but to write dialogue, that is TOTALLY OFF, is stupid! For those of you who have understood the Chinese in the movie, you know what I mean.
