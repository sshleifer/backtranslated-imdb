Optically beautiful with fine music, otherwise this film has a rather banal television quality. The romance between two characters, which includes a cultural and educational gap, is simply NOT plausible. Of course we knew right from the start that our personal heroine heroine would brighten up, win the locals and find true love, but that does not make it any less sad that the movie had to make such utterly anticipated turns. This movie was promising, which makes it rather a pity that the promise was not realized. Maybe a nice blanket under the blanket for a cold night-freebie on cable, but I would definitely not recommend the paid rent or purchase. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful.
