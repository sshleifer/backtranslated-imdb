Eddie Murphy was produced at a point in his career where he had the juice to do what he wanted, and took on the job in Harley Nights, an expensive-looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners / Gangsters who ran a posh club in the 1930s, led by a wisecracking hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and his adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who believe they would they seem to be rightfully taking over the lawn, simply because of their color. This was an idea that probably looked great on paper, but definitely lost something in translation. This was a vanity piece for Eddie, and I think he's a bit too thin here and trying to be here for the whole show. Admittedly, it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on the big screen, but the rest of the big side cast, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmin Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw and Eddies Brother has really little to do (although I'd like to admit that Murphy's fight scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene in the movie). Murphy has obviously put a lot of money into this film, and much of it is shown on screen. The art and the direction are impressive and the stunning costumes should have won an Oscar, but this was a big failure for Eddie, as he definitely wanted to wear too many hats.
