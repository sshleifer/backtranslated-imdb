I wanted to watch this movie because I liked "Kavkazskij Plennik" ("Prisoner of the Mountains") and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov, Jr. and "Vor" ("The Thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Unlike the other films, "The Quickie" was a total waste of time. The story that makes little sense, very uneven spectacle (especially bad was Lesley Ann Warren), really terrible dialogues, bad cinematography, what else could go wrong? I find it amusing that in virtually every film produced in the US, if the same-language foreigners (in this case the Russians) are left alone, they prefer to communicate in broken English (and if they speak Russian) for some reason Reason translators feel obliged to insert a lot of "f ** ks" into sentences that have no obscenity (literal or not literal). At the same time, English-speaking actors choose broken Russian. Why this? To get back to history, most of the film's dealings (eg, betting the house, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) either make no sense or do nothing but confuse the audience. It is too bad that Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my opinion) were involved in this disaster.
