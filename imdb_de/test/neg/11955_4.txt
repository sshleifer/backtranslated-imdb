First, this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons from Kung Fu, with Gordon Liu. I mention this because my Kung Fu Theater DVD mentions a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and further (no idea why) The Young Hero with Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18-weapon style that a monk told some children during the opening, and the usual mysterious manual everyone is looking for, the weapons never really appear and the fights are all boxing. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard of, or any of the other actors. The film mentions another director Wu Yuen Ling and one of the IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen, who seem to be lost after this film. The fights are reasonable and frequent, but not great and the "star" does not have much charisma. The twist at the end is just stupid and the movie seems to end abruptly, as if it got boring. The landscape and the training sequences in the river are a little different than usual. Unfortunately, the pretty sister does not drown the very irritating (albeit acrobatic) boy.
