Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist, and complacent film, in which the Middle East conflict is thoughtlessly used as the backdrop for an action movie set up for a conveniently protected American Midwestern audience. The conflict, as well as those involved, are simply used as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young Americans who proudly kill Arabs for the sake of "freedom." Worse, though, is that the film's action scenes are unobtrusive and unobtrusive, so Navy Seals does not even function as a thoughtless shooting emblem. Charlie Sheen's character (Hawkins) is abominable. offensive, ignorant, inconsiderate and above all racist. He refers to the Middle East as a "T-hole" and to its inhabitants as "rag dolls". Throughout the film, the characters of the Navy Seals are glorified by the use of the Lebanese aborigines as cannon fodder. They massacre these people indiscriminately with a consistency-free attitude. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his language before he shoots him while he makes another witty joke. Apart from being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (albeit predictable) pro-American attitude of the film is outrageous. This can be seen when the Lebanese-American journalist Hawkins informs that terrorists are not allowed to speak because "they are religious fanatics". Hawkins then answers 'yeah, and we are the Navy Seals!' The implication is obvious that zealots are meaningless alongside American military power. Even after insulting the journalist's racist heritage and treating her as a sex object, she demands the inability to resist this disgusting criminal and she still sleeps with him because he is an All-American Navy Seal. This marginalizes the character of the journalist, submitting them to Hawkins' "superior" pro-American stance despite his offensive behavior towards Hawkins. Beyond ethics, this change of action has little faith even as a drama. <br /> <br /> The script is also amateurish. Most scenes are simply strung together without thinking about mood, plot, or character development. For example, the "music video" scene on the golf course is just a bit of an eye-catcher. Even the two scenes in which Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are useless. In one he jumps from a moving car from a bridge just to show his colleague how heavy he is and in the other he chases a tow truck on a push wheel and drives away with his car. Neither scene has a subsequent anti-climax, both are highly unlikely and have no effect on the entire storyline. They are just sweets designed as a vehicle for portraying Hawkins' cheap American exploits, and are a poor substitute for character development. Most of the other scene-development scenes are also poorly filmed and poorly scripted, as this disease affects the entire movie. Apart from the African American Navy Seal and his wife, as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, every other team member seems to be unknown to the audience, so that when the climate scenes roll around, nobody seems to be in anyone's grief. <br /> <br /> In such a movie, action sequences can potentially save production. But they do not do it here. These are poorly directed, badly lit and show poorly performed stunts. In fact, their orientation is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, resulting in not only the scenes being hard to follow, but also a complete lack of fear and tension. Poor lighting only contributes to their impotence. The explosions look spotty, gunshot wounds are unconvincing and one of the bravest stunts in which a Mercedes crashes over a tank looks like a stunt staged on a backlot and then mishandled End of Navy Seals lays down the coins to the eyes of this production. First, there is the obligatory slow-motion scene in which Sheen is carried on his back with Biehn. This was obviously the standard scene that should be the star of the trailer of the movie. Then there is the end itself, when the remaining Siegel team troops, wounded and drifting in the sea, are rescued by a submarine. In fact, this submarine had been home for a long time, but it had miraculously returned in no time. Despite the violent and exhausting torments of the Seals, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues had just been killed and some were still bleeding profusely, they all manage to laugh heartily while blessing America loudly. Predictable? You can easily imagine this end while you watch the opening credits. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Middle East conflict is used leniently as a vehicle for the macho all-American tendencies of the photogenic young leads of the films. Arabs are condescendingly and dismissively treated, and their slaughter in the film is used as a fulcrum to glorify the use of American military power against an inferior minority group in a consistent environment. The events of 2001 have shown that such a complacent and cocky trivialization of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a time without consequences. The Middle East can no longer be written off, because a hole full of rag doll heads is tearing each other apart (to quote Charlie Sheen here); It is now a place where participation can have serious consequences. Today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves in close proximity to home. That's why Navy Seals looks pretty stupid these days. but that should be nice. This is a highly ignorant film whose production values ​​and professionalism are equally suspect. Navy Seals is an ideological and artistic insult to the intelligence of its audience.
