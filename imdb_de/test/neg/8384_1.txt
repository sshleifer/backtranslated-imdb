I can not seem to find anything that's good about this miniseries. Why the hell would you ban chocolate if you could ban something more practical like smoking or alcohol? The fact that it is an Australian program and plays everything in England and pretends all British accents is stupid. Overall, I find this show unrealistic and cheap.
