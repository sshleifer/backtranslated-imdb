For those of you who do not remember watching movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - this came out in '79 (I think enough time has passed so Nunzio thought of course he could just repeat this and say he wrote it - yes, right!). <br /> <br /> Acting here is overkill - the "tough guys" walk around with bowed shoulders to give the impression that they are taller than them. In fact, the "hero" seems to have a passion for snorting to have and roll his eyes in a way to express fears / rage on the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> There's a way Here's the racial message from the Sicilian point of view (mind you, it's the third generation) ... the original "pug" arrived in OZ after the war and in my childhood - yes, I'm an Aussie. So the "wogg -iness" has been heavily watered down - they even sound like real blue Aussies - not a touch of "Dago accent" (there's another slang for you, well!). <br /> <br /> Maori's with sunglasses (Sunglasse s) at 4am - must be cool to get dazzled in the middle of the night and it looks like Redfern ... this is the boring end of this film. Nunzio tried to copy the taste of the warriors, but left too many holes in the story. How about coincidences? <br /> <br /> The warriors had a group of baseball men carrying bats, with white make-up chasing the heroes to a train station and fighting them - the Nunzios gang is tracked by a gang at a train station with wistful Guys wearing whitish face masks. The warriors were falsely accused of shooting another gang member - the Nunzios gang is falsely accused of raping the sister of the great Maori gang chief. The warriors are lured into a room by a group of girls who attack them. The people of Nunzios want to crash into a friend's house where a gang of girls is populated - there are almost too many specimens of the warriors they can keep over here. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that people do not want to see other trains from OZ because of this trio - how about Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all films are made by actors who are so bad that they have to finance their own films. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors on this show, they seem to have taken "the Nun" because they are all so bad - do not worry about this movie! I can not get my money back - so save yours!
