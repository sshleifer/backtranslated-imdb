Vicente Aranda has made a horrible historical film. It shows the bad resources of Spanish cinema. In the film, an unreal screenplay reveals that Juana is a nebulous, facing Felipe, who is only concerned about sex, but having sex with others, not with her. The technical mistakes begin with the wedding ring showing Isabel of Castilla - nobody noticed that? -. Then the voice appears in Off as a documentary, actors and actors in the movie laugh sometimes - look at the sequence when Juana arrives at the council who wants to keep her isolated; The locks are almost broken when they were recently built in the era of the movie, the crowds are just "four" people, the lights are badly placed sense, talking about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
