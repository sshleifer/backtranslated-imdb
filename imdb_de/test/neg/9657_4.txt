I find it amazing that so many people (probably Poles) voted for this film and gave it such grades (mostly tens). OK, the movie was good, funny, but on the other hand it was nothing special. The only good thing about Kiler are the dialogues, which are not comprehensive for non-Poles. The script is primitive, the acting (except Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - terrible. It's too much noise for nothing - luckily it's not included in the top 250. P.S. The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on its way and it's the same story.
