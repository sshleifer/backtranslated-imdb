If you remember to watch this movie, then my advice is - not. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie has not reached the grade on all levels and was a reminder of how awful most Britons (and Irish) are. Movies are. An unforgettable trip is the best thing I can say. If it had been on TV, I would have left five minutes after the start to do something more interesting. I saw this movie with a group of friends and after reading the press preview, he was ready to be non-critical and hopefully enjoy 90 minutes. But, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> As a comedy, that was not funny, as a thriller, the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. As a love story absolutely incredible. Most of all, as a piece "splendidly exaggerated" lacked style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to earn their money against the player ... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but apart from being played by gangsters from the East and being chased to the boys, does Michael Caine leave you cold? <br /> <br /> In fairness, some of my friends thought it was "ok," but if you go I recommend you have a couple of drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical skills safe at home. <br /> <br />
