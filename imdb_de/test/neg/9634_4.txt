HANDS OF THE RIPPER <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian Doctor (Eric Porter) uses a novel Freudian analysis a young girl (Angharad Rees) who turns out to be a daughter of Jack the Ripper and is just as deadly ... <br /> <br /> Unusual gavel horror, in which a respectable socialite waif takes on a beautiful boy, too To attract a touch of scandal, even if it kills everything and everyone with a variety of deadly tools (broken mirrors, hat pins, etc.)! L. W. Davidson's script wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the material's inherent subtext (Porter's obvious appeal to Rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains muted throughout. Some of the Gore scenes are surprisingly vibrant, even for Hammer, and these were cut off from the original US release (despite an MPAA R rating), although the full version is now available as a home video. Porter and Rees perform well, and the highlight in St Paul's Cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and untouched. Director: Peter Sasdy.
