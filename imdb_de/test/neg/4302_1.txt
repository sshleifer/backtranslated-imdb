As much as we are allowed to welcome a movie that deals with people who have different romantic challenges, I can not shake the feeling that this film was meant to be a direct-to-video-grade C porn movie either) A) The actors abstained from doing the explicit scenes, or B) The producers ran out of money to stop the inserts (an amazing thing, if it were true). <br /> <br /> I had to go back to Blockbuster to find out Why on earth had I rented it, due to an admittedly amateurish credulity regarding the cover blips that a startling John Waters Humor festival seemed to imply a sexual theme. Okay, I've laughed a few times and it definitely has a sexual theme (though most of it can not be described as stimulating). However, with some movies, you can rewind to make sure you heard the dialogue correctly. In this movie, you're going to roll forward because you already know what to say. But there is nothing that you can fast forward, so fast forward on the shelf.
