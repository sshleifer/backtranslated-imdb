First of all, I'm a horror fan. But this "Tobe Hooper" production (come on, the man of Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was a fan of standards even. Acting was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the leading actresses were fine. The story was something that we have seen a hundred times, without surprising twists or the like. Never exciting or intense, and do not expect special effects except blood sprays. The creepy zombie kids are white faces with dark eyes and that's it. That would have worked in the early 70's, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone has not done a good job of maintaining tension. Halfway there is a risk that you fall asleep. My vote is based primarily on the lead role, but this could easily have been called Children Of The Corn 8: from the cornfields to the mines ...
