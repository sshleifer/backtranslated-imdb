American tourist on package trip in Asia, who was recently killed, decides to break the law: 1 Ignoring the curfew; 2 join the revolutionary army; 3 Possession and Use of Illegal Firearms ...... etc etc. What is meant to be a political and educational statement about the so-called atrocities of a military dictatorship in Asia ends as a "How To" guide for the disappointed Americans. .. especially those who want to protest that the water in the hotel is not working ... Unfortunately, the authors of this stupid yarn have no idea of ​​Asia ... and it does not seem that a reasonable dialogue is being written. Example: Our human rights hero, who seeks miles and miles of medicine in the far reaches of the Asian jungle, comes across a farmer and asks, "Sorry - does this city have a pharmacy?" Knowing something about the Asian jungle, how ridiculous this scenario really is ... Mind you, I was recently in the Thai jungle and an American asked me ... "Excuse me ... do you know where MacDonalds is?" This movie is supposed to be a serious drama, but ends up as the parody and rip-off of all these "Killing Fields" films that confirm the Asian stereotype of Western "civilization" and are reinforced by Hollywood fantasies like this ..... The basic message of this image is : "We Americans ... from all over the world - only true democracy has a divine right to go to all other nations ... and correct their wrong ... ... screw their environment to ... and bring it teach them something about freedom at .... "(See, for example, The Beach ... at least Leo did it with a bit more style) Of course, Vietnam is another story .... And ..... the educated Asian wonders perhaps why Yankie Gungh-Ho's attitude about Asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity has been to spread cancer ... AIDS. At the end of this picture, the cynical viewer may cheer the Burmese military ... 3 from 10. <br /> <br />
