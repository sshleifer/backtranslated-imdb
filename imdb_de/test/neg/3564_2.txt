A depressed scary teen does a lot of bad things to a socially active older woman who does not like sunglasses or curtains in her windows. He steals various things from her, looks at her, makes pranks and plays unpleasant tricks. Strangely enough, he does not keep any of this secret for her. At first, in one way or another, it does not seem to matter to her that he bothers her. Later, she seems to respect him for his cruel feverish activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical things to keep in mind. One is that the guy looks through a glass pane from the brighter side into the night. In real life, that would not happen. The lighter side of a pane of glass looks like a mirror. He would not be able to see exactly. Everyone at night would be able to see him in his well-lit room. <br /> <br /> Another illogical point is that the scary teen takes on a job as a milkman and his and The only customer every morning seems to be the lady he selects. Easy work if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw a SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE at a public performance. In the end there was not a single open eye in the house. A SHORT FILM ON LOVE is the foreign-language film for those who do not want to read subtitles. Not only are very few words spoken in the movie, but much of the movie is dumb. A certain peace in peace.
