What can I say after saying the one-line summary. Sandra does a credible job, but with bad alignment and action, it can not save her. Too much pre-occupation with weapons. How can the Hollywood guys scold the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time focusing on footage focused on weapons? It's just worse than expected.
