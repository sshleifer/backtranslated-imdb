That's what I kept asking myself during the many fights, screaming matches, swearing and general chaos that permeates the 84 minutes. The comparisons also arise when you think of one-dimensional characters that have so little depth that it's virtually impossible to worry about what's happening to them. They are simply badly written ciphers to which the director can hang his multicultural beliefs, a theme that has been made much better in other dramas both on television and in the cinema. Actually one to see poor performances during a movie, but you have to say that Nichola Burley (as the best friend of the heroine) and Wasim Zakir (as the evil, bullying brother) were absolutely terrible. I do not know which drama school they graduated from, but if I were them, I would request a full refund. Only Samina Awan in the lead role impresses with a cast of so-called British talents, of whom we will probably never hear again. At least that's the hope. Next time, set a different scout. <br /> <br /> Another fascinating thought is the heinous fashion soundtrack with the stars of Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Well, I'm a bit of a music fanatic and know most of these artists, but I did not recognize any of the tracks during the movie (apart from the ubiquitous "run"). B-sides, anyone? We get many, many musical montages that tell us how to feel. These are accompanied by amazingly original images, such as couples kissing on a swollen lake and crawling in doorways. This is a problem because none of the songs convey the mood efficiently, and we realize that the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone. <br /> <br /> The end is probably meant to be just desserts, because everyone gets his comeuppance and there is at least a big shock. But I remained determinedly unmoved because the script had given me no one to choose. It's not enough to tackle a hot-button issue, you actually have to submit a conspiracy that has not yet been thought of for death and people who are more than just show-windows. As it stands, this film is a noble failure. Only the promising lead actress and a few ping-ups distract her to save her from the trash. 10.4. Must try harder ..
