Unusually cold and silly drama by director Sydney Pollack. The Soap Story revolves around adulterous couples who are killed in an airplane wreck and has their spouse find and connect on their own intimate level. Novelist writing is being handled sluggishly, though I thought the performances of Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were all right. The production of Slick is interesting, even if the plot is on the same floor and never generates an emotional impulse. As a result, the highlight of the airport is a big "So What?"
