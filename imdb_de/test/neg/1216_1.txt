I like to see myself as a bad movie connoisseur. I like to think that the movies that most people call are the worst of times I can easily stand. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only remember three films that I had the misfortune to see that I used the fast-forward button repeatedly for much of the story. These movies are The Mighty Gorga, Night of the Seagulls and this little crap Deep Blood. In the world of Jaws rip-off this is out of the ordinary. Deep Blood has neither the realistic plot of the original crocodile nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent or Tintorera's Commentary. No, instead, we tried a handful of teenagers from a random public sitcom who fought against bullies and the local sheriff in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are realized through quick excerpts from documentary films in which actors flit around the water, occasionally with something of something like orange-looking paint being thrown into the water. In this celluloid landfill there is no minute of original shark material. <br /> <br /> Normally, I or someone like me would read a grim review like this and say, "Cool, I have to find a copy of it." This is the same thought I had when I read another reviewer's review on this website, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another .. Let this dust collect on the shelf ... grab the depths or the big alligator to satisfy your needs need something lurking in the water.
