I found the trailer better than the movie. They did their job and made me see UNKNOWN. The interest diminished early. A simple premise in the landscape. Five men wake up in a chemical store and do not know why they are there. let alone know how the hell they got there. Confusion and paranoia bring fear and distrust. The men learn that a hijacker is planning to kill his hostages. Now the men are trying to differentiate whether all the victims are and who actually is one of the kidnappers. The cast includes: Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Pepper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
