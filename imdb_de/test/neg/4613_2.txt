Following the classic horror movie Carrie of the 1970s with this offering is how Ford follows the Mustang with the Edsel. This movie was terrible in every detail. It should have been called Beverly Hill 90210 and Mystery Science Theater 3000, but these two shows far surpass those tricks. This movie was hardly a horror movie. I had about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of lame dreaming and ritual in high school. Wow, what a surprise Carrie's comic friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misunderstood her affection for her love! Wow, the in-crowd is setting up Carrie! Wow, the jocks have a sex contest! What this movie needed was a lot more action and far less tired teenage clich√©s. This movie is absolutely not visible.
