I really do not know why I write this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this: <br /> <br /> Once I've seen some movies, I like them. Over time, my opinion about the movie changes. This happened with End of Days. I liked it when I saw it for the first time. I found it entertaining. But a few weeks later, my opinion changed. To solve this problem, I looked at it again in a house of friends. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I am a logical person. When I see a logical hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. When I see two, I get angry. More than two and I'm shitty. End of Days condemned me after my second visit. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is a bit depressing. Everything is sad. Everything from Arnold's drama to the colors of the film. But dark-looking movies do not bother me, but something else ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his deadly form? If you shoot him, his skin will grow. If you cut off your head, a new one should appear again. Question: What's the point of trying to kill him? I'll tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has an injured villain. That's not the hell, my friends. This is a human being reminiscent of the Bond villains who betray the hero to the whole plan.
