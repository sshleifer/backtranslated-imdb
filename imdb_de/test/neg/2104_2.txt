Oh. Well. Mourning. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie title in the TV schedules and thought, "I have to watch this movie, tear down Snakes On A Plane, it's going to be terrible, but hopefully laughable, well, I was only half right." /> <br /> This movie is currently bad and unfortunately not even unintentionally funny, it's just awful, worse, it takes almost an hour to get something similar to an action - in the first half of the movie you have to we endure some mumbled foreign languages ​​(Mexican or Spanish, sorry for my ignorance) and a terrible acting, as some women puke live snakes for reasons we'll find out later, then we have to endure an even more horrific drama, and we find that the foreign-language marbles are able to speak English anyway, as the snakes eventually release the train and things shift from the sedated to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Low-Bu dget does not always mean "bad", but in this case. What we have here is a movie without thought, a horrible script, a bad cast and not even the feeling of profiting from the few strengths. I give two grades for some decent special effects and a crazy ending, but that still feels a bit too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See this if you want: Stagknight, The Wicker Man Remake, terrible CGI.
