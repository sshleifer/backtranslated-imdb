As we know, movies are not a direct involvement of the story, but it's a shame when making a movie that has absolutely little or no correlation. I wish the director and / or scriptwriter had researched this topic. Everything this movie does is to create a forum for hatred between people while causing a rift that should not be there. In this film, the Sikhs and Muslims were presented in a very negative state, while the third group (Hindus) looked as if they did not exist in the brutal murders of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies, coupled with the sharp disregard for one's faith, as portrayed by 'Gian Singh', were a shame for the highest format. On a positive note, the actors did a great job in their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve C played their roles extraordinarily. I hope that those watching this movie will not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event.
