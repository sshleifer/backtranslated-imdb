If you want to waste a small part of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. It fails on the first post by not being scary or funny. It's a boring gray movie that I think went straight to the video. Hammy and tongue faces leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to see a bad but still worth watching zombie movie, check out Diary of the Dead. Bad special effects, script at school level. Zombie movies work when they have a moral or even political point. This film has nothing, there is no worthy point that underlines the zombification. This is as exciting and convincing as a Republican convention. If you saw the Republican convention, this would be a better example of a zombie movie.
