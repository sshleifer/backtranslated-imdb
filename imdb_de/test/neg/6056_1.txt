I survived the first hour and came back the last ten minutes just to say I saw the end. If you want * true * mythology that will work flawlessly, look for Armand Assante's "The Odyssey". Great storytelling does not have to be adapted - the stories alone are fantastic. I just hope that Sean Astin needed the money. And Sophocles and Ovid must whirl around in their graves - wherever they may be. <br /> <br /> At least at Sorbo's version, the tongue was relentlessly pushed in the cheek - we knew it was mostly Balderdash, but maybe enough interest. I'm surprised that Halmi is exhibiting something so amusing (the TV series) and him could follow something that is next to no quality.
