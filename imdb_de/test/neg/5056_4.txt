History teacher Mrs. Tingle seems to have it for the student Leigh Ann Watson, who has a scholarship for writing schools. She gets another low grade from Tingle, which does not help. When one of her classmates steals Luke's final paper and puts it in her pocket, Mrs. Tingle finds out it sticks out. She threatens the three that she will go to the director about it, but he is not available. Before she reports it the next morning. Leigh, her boyfriend Jo Lynn and Scott go to their place that night and try to convince them not to inform the director. Due to the stubbornness of Tingle, however, these are forced to drastic measures to prevent the disembarkation. <br /> <br /> Was not a fan of it when I saw it for the first time, and after another visit I'm still not one. The writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after writing the successful contemporary teenage horror films; "Scream (1996)", "I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)", "Scream 2 (1997)" and "The Faculty (1998)". He was on the road with success (not to mention the television program 'Dawson's Creek'), but this project would be the end. The difference to this post was different than writing the script, he also gave his directorial debut. The strange thing, however, was that I had found his direction to be competent, but material that he stormed to taste and fatigue. It seemed like you were playing both a black comedy and a straightforward thriller without it gelled. The script is replete with quick jokes, constant jokes, trivial things and tricky references to other films, but the problem is that it's too watered down with so many developments and sour moral currents that disrupt the flow. The broken script had to be stronger and more potent because it's a small production that feels like its mostly limited sets, as if you were watching a stage show. It tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments only serve to turn the story's bad evolution into a puddle of stupidity and futility. The end of the film takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is solid, but more on footpaths, so there's a lack of suspense and the tempo can be tough despite its taut environment. You finally feel it after the half mark, and it shows how small the story is. The performances are tolerable enough, though Helen Moren's classy, ​​icy portrayal of manipulative skill as Mrs. Tingle and an aspiring Marisa Coughlan would not have been possible if we had watched a shabby goodie-to-shoes Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his loose part and Molly Ringwald plays a minor role. The soundtrack has enough energy, but I found it terribly overworked and informal in its decisions. <br /> <br /> Watchable, but mechanically all around.
