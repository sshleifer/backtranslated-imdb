Interesting topic. Pathetic delivery - script and instructions. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, is thawing and undergoing surgery. This is where the fun begins. The underlying problem is that Miles has NO SOUL !!! This is used to explain his quasi-unpredictable behavior, being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I believe that this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the livelier side, Miles prefers a glass or two of brandy, blazing fireplaces, and his young, maturing cousin. The finale does justice to this film. <br /> <br /> Some thoughts: 1. Producer $$$ was there to create this trip. J.D. Feigelson was the scriptwriter and (or only) producer. Looks like he has not learned a lesson about "not bringing an interesting idea to life" when you look at his other written accomplishments. This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! That's really scary. Should be forever "Bottom of the Shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A born-again person without a soul will succumb to a bad entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The score offers minimal support. Not even an in-formal Jerry Goldsmith could save it. <br /> <br /> 5. Earned the 0230 time window on TV and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials + test patterns it was competing against at the time of my ad. <br /> <br /> 6. Thank God I did not receive any sequels to Wes Craven's "Nightmare" franchise. Chiller Too: The Return Return of Miles or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill a career as an actor or scriptwriter. This should apply to the director, but Wes Craven will be released forever due to his one and only good play "A Nightmare on Elm Street" in 1984.
