Uzumaki, which translates into "spirals," comes across hits like Ringu, Ju-On, and The Eye (two of them with remakes ... and much more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters) within this new wave of Asian horror movies )), remains behind the creepy, supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other films, the only thing that remains crazy and not in a way of Tim Burton or David Lynch, but in an irrelevant and boring way. <br /> <br /> It starts with a girl, another child who has a crush on her, her best friend and his father, who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens concerns Uzumakis, people die and you see Uzumakis. Okay, it'll go along, I'm kind of amused by spirals, characters seem to go nowhere, but I'll play along. We find out that the city is being cursed by Uzumakis, people are starting to scream Uzumakis, and the point is that Uzumakis are everywhere, the movie is a disaster, he does not know where to go, except you Power of Uzumakis to show !!!! !!!!! There are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis on her fingerprints, but then there is another scene where she hears that her husband (from outside the tomb !!) tells her that she also has Uzumakis in her ear, by the way, they acted with this scene just ridiculous, not even cheesy, there are also some cool visuals, like the collection, which has the father of Uzumakis and the girl with the Uzumakis hair However, it seems as if it had been taken out of a Fruit Snack commercial. When you eat a Uzumakis fruit snack, its taste is so incredible that your hair changes into Uzumakis. If that were not bad enough, suddenly out of nowhere there is Snail Men .. or ManSnails? What ever?? and you know why? Law? Because in their shells they have uuuuzuuuwaaaakiiiis ??. That was just enough time for a crappy anti-climatic end and at that time I had enough of friggin 'uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki there, sure, look around, how many uzumakis do you think ?? If you want to watch a movie about spirals, go to PI (3.1416). There you will find some pretty cool Uzumaki concepts between the meaning of life and Dark City also has something spiraling about it. <Br /> <br /> This movie could have worked as a music video, it has already gained cult status and that's why I had to see it, but afterwards I'm not sure why people think it's great. I was really disappointed.
