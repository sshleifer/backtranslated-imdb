Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon that kills a director and then his servant before he settles down. This icon, which has some Christopher Lee qualities to offer, continues to persecute her when a group of horror film company students steal her body from the mausoleum where he is. The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and a lot of potential for murderous chaos. But the movie moves into the middle (though luckily not as much as "House of Death") and never really recovers this initial energy boost. <br /> <br /> Many deaths are confusing, it seems people are just scared when they see a floating casket or other strange things. Twice we see how toxic gas is used. The box promises, however, that this horror star is the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is the wrong advertisement, unless he has spent his career playing boring old men taking a nap and looking at "Matlock". <br /> <br /> The general principle of the film is decent: horror social children stealing a corpse from a dead symbol A modern analogy (Vincent Price or Peter Cushing digging up) would make a great movie. Maybe a remake is alright, if that were not too disrespectful. Theoretically, theory sometimes does not work out so well, and this film offers this example. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality of this film (except for the beginning) is the short appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought, "This is Jeffrey Combs", but I felt like I was wrong when the box never mentioned him. But sure, Combs was present. (A note to the filmmakers of this film: Mention Combs on the cover of the DVD.) You sell more copies if you deceive customers.) If you're persistent with Jeffrey Combs, look at this early role. Otherwise, I can not offer this as a great selection for a horror film marathon. Let me suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn" since both are pretty decent and pass the test of time.
