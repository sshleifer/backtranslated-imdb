Most of the positive comments posted here are as detailed as the movie! It takes a lengthy bore to appreciate a wordy and boring movie, one supposes. Some have referred to the film merely as "contemplative", which means slow and without action, but a Dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event that turns into a boring movie whose tone is set in the first scene becomes. Here a young couple is shown a flat by a real estate agent who speaks as expected without interruption and regardless of what else happens. As good as any other character! <br /> <br /> The only silence in this image are dream sequences - the Soviet propaganda snippets of the thirties - and they are also the most interesting parts. Here's something to learn about how the rest of the movie can be viewed. <br /> <br /> The device, filming most scenes in extreme close-up - as if you look through a gap in the blinds - gets old fast.
