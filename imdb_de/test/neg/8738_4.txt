MASTER PLAN: The winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action images trying to capture the flavor of the famous '73 Enter the Dragon '. This is an attempt from South Africa. Somewhat different is the rogue's fortress, which appears from a distance like a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert. The villain himself, a baron or general, is a slightly more perverted version of the "Dr.No" or Han form of master villains with strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He wears the full uniform of the Nazis in some places. His main goal in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in World War II (my army is better than your army). It sounds stupid and it is, though the suggestion of madness and crazy machismo almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles a white 'Bruce Lee' character who has a similarly sleek, lithe figure, though she's obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought he would be a secret government agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend joined Baron's fighter team, but they decided to quit. Of course it is not that easy. There is a strange series of them fleeing the desert with a ruined car with a rigged sail - these desert winds can be a miracle for the journey, it seems the hero joins the team of the villain's rival, and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell, with the hero's rival threatened with rape. The most interesting character is Chico, a dwarf who is an assistant to the villain; He is loyal to the Baron, but he understands the hero's plight. Many of the fights use the hero's ballet-like abilities with lots of jump and slow motion. The sound effects are also amplified and exaggerated to give the blows more influence. There are some good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none is really noticeable. If anyone had to choose, I suppose the best one is the baron's brutal muscle-stooge who was introduced late in the story (he raises the back of a car at one point). You wonder how the hero will get him out at the end, as the brute seems to shake off most of the punches. The acting is very mediocre and goes down to the girlfriend, who for no reason tends to laugh, as if she is standing on grass, though she is very sweet. Some of the practice scenes are also Campy, especially all the guys rolling or rolling over the desert sand. With such a title, there are surprisingly few killings. As Steve Chase, Ryan returned as a traditional agent in the sequel to "Kill and Kill Again."
