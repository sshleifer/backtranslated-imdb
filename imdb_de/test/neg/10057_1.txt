Nightkill plays Robert Mitchum as a world weary investigating the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the worried wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn Mitchum can not tell is that she knows her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover, James Franciscus, sell her wealthy husband. What to expect from a lazy Slasher movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models are based on classic cars, and Smith is constantly staged by Sybil Danning until a giallo-style wrap-up brings the whole sad mess to a bitter end. This is a bad movie. And this movie is sooooo poor. It looks like Halloween mixed with trick or treats. Avoid this. <br /> <br /> Rated R for violence, nudity and sexual situations.
