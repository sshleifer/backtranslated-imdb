I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did a good job and I thought this might be an overlooked treasure. It was not a sweetheart. I do not know if this was right on the video, but it should have been right on the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will like the fact that he appears in a much too short shower scene without a shirt. But no sensible person would like this script. Imagine Memento, played by teenage actors, but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. A typical example: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently the chain of mediocrity keeps alive). <br /> <br /> As if the film were not enough, false memory syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine also depend on one of those unexplained psychic twins that keeps the story moving and baffles the audience. The same twin bond creates a few too many fictional love scenes between Wood's character and the girl of She's All That, who plays the sacred sister of Woods angry cancer victim friend. <br /> <br /> For the weirdness of this thing screenplay, Woods other friends are a Brain Cancer victim and Kidney, a young black boy suffering from a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's dying wish comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. The hackneyed function of this character in the story is regained through its recurrent relationship with walking. Kidney is usually attached to a wheelchair and has several inexplicable scenes where he bumps others. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization may be a small detail, but points out the many other shortcomings of this film. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely hummelig, but never flies.
