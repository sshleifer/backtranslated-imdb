I remember seeing this movie when I was about ten, one of my friends had it. At the time it was just a movie because I was about ten years old and just thinking of another action movie. <br /> <br /> If I look back now as a complete movie fan, this is a terrifyingly bad movie. Whoever produced this film, I'm sure he had a short Hollywood career. Although the lead actor, according to IMDb, seems to have made a couple of films, even though I did not see any and did not really remember him. Anyway, just to say that this movie is really bad, in every way it could be. But I would like to see it again: oD
