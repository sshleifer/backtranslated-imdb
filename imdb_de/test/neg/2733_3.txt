Terry Cunningham directs this sci-fi network original. Not all is good in Washington State and Oregon; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to sink most of the Pacific Rim into the ocean. To prevent the world from plunging into ecological chaos, Dr. Jake Rollin's (Luke Perry) led team of scientists carried along a massive earth-boring vehicle called "The Mole" to make their way to the fiery core of the earth to avert the impending demise. Technical dialogues do not really help or speed this movie. Acting is lame, but then Perry has always been covered. You can only hold him responsible for participating. Others in the cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
