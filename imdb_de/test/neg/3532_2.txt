The stupid government tried again to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments went terribly wrong and burdened us with a half-man-half mutant who pukes a lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he gets excited. Lance Henriksen plays the lead role as an honest scientist who ended the experiment immediately after hearing that it was a military project. However, he returns (and brings the whole family with him) when he finds out that his beloved guinea pig is delirious. "Mind Ripper" is certainly a horror movie that can be seen, but it is very unoriginal and offers just about every lame clich√© you can think of (including the alienated father / rebellious teen sub-plots ... yawning). The characters are like wooden puppets, the stupidest things are said and done and there is a completely pointless dream sequence ... coming from the monster !!! There are a handful of interesting bloody scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert locations are really scary. As always, Lance Henriksen is appropriate, though this is another inferior production he plays, and Giovanni Ribisi has certainly earned a better film for his debut. For some reason, this anonymous' 90s thriller is also referred to as "The Hills Have Eyes" Part 3. "Is it because it's about terrorizing members of the same family in the desert? Or maybe it's because the monster ended up going bald, like the crazy Michael Berryman in the 1977 original, who knows ... who cares ... Wes Craven probably financed this project because his son was the script writer and it has to be constantly discovered that your offspring is as talented as you are.
