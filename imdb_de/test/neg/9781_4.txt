The Bone Snatcher is about a group looking for a missing mountain team in the Namib Desert. If they find them, they are nothing but boned bones and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. History keeps you interested in what caused that. The characters are good enough and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> About an hour and ten minutes, when you find out what makes the bones clean, you sigh "oh, that's really stupid." The film is ruined by bad writing and a not exciting ending. Until then, the movie was pretty good and it's a shame he made such a bad turn. So I can not recommend this movie. I gave it a 4/10.
