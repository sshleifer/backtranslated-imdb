This was absolutely the most tragic movie hunt I've ever seen. The name was not just a misnomer - since the movie has almost nothing to do with piranhas - acting is as hollow and stale as trying to make a conspiracy. When you watch this movie, you can not help but question every second if you have enough and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately, in my case, I waited until the end. That's two hours of my life that I can never reclaim.
