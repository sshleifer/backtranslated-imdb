Usually I love these "Stranger Within" thrillers. Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Female" and "Audition". Well done, they can be a lot of fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and horrors. The opposite may of course apply: badly done, they can be boring and stupid. "The hand that weighs the cradle" is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> The Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another member of their family. But the busy Claire is persuaded by Michael to hire a nanny. One day a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) shows up, and because she seems to be perfect, the bartels stop her. As soon as she appears, her idyllic life dissolves slowly ... <br /> <br /> This film suffers from a variety of problems, but the biggest one is dealing with the villain. Peyton is never credible. Part of it has to do with how she wrote and how she acted. The things she does are supposed to make us nervous, are invented to be ridiculous. De Mornay does not help much. She portrays Peyton as two different people. While it is true that she should be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, De Mornay's performance creates a separation between the two facets of her character. <br /> <br /> But the other actors are good. Annabella Sciorrra is awesome like the asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in the role, but the script unfortunately lets her down. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is adorable as Claire's friend Marlene. Moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately she is on the screen for only five minutes. Curtis Hanson is a good director. The film has some decent shocks, but it's bad in tempo, and the climax, while creating some suspense, is actually ridiculous. Apart from that, he works with a script that at best can be called non-profit as pathetic. Trust me when it comes to nannies, Fran Drescher. This should switch to the Direct-to-Video storage.
