Well, that's a bad movie, if I've ever seen one. In one of the film's biggest years of 1999, Detroit Rock City battles Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for final place in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four grumpy high school teens finally have the chance to see the hard rock cinemas of KISS for the third year in a row. So, if their tickets are abused by an ultra-religious, smoking mother, the miners crawl as they come to Detroit, and I'm sure you can find out the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; The film is extremely extreme in explaining how the four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter) get these tickets: losing their virginity in a confessional; to save a smoked bimbo and your mother's Volvo (nevertheless by Steve Schirripa the soprano); Preventing a robbery in the midst of a robbery for the debts of a 12-year-old; and, of course, get back to basics for MC Ron Jeremy after bringing a full blender with bourbon leftovers. Sounds weird, right? Maybe Detroit Rock City, with all this junk, has a point in how extreme these fans can sometimes go. And we understand that this movie is a comedy; it should be filled with slapstick. But is Detroit Rock City aimed at the right audience? It's rated R, which is the only way to be prepubescent teens - the audience, as I see it, to which many of this classic voyeurs body will hail through illegal denominations. Detroit Rock City also fails to give itself the late 70s. The texture quality of the camera is way too clear and far too bright, so the necessary flair of films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy is missing. This would have allowed viewers to feel more "at home" over time. It's not enough just to dress children in the grunge clothing of the 90s and to put others in "disco infernos". Environment means something you know; I doubt Detroit '78 looked so glamorous. If something positive comes out of this movie, it's the kick soundtrack of the hard rock of the late 70's to early 80's. Van Halen, AC / DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course we must not forget KISS, the band that has been consistently well received. <br /> <br /> What the movie does not noticeably do is wonder why the Knights of Satin's service (it's really just KISS) was so disapproved of mothers in the nation. Sure, the loud skirt and devilish make-up might be part of it; Encouraging young people to explore themselves and have a good time can also be fair causes. But what does KISS say in the music that we hear throughout the film against this highly rebellious group? What sets these hymns apart from rocking and rolling all night and every day from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in a music communication class, not in the movies they should answer, simply because it's KISS and they rock and we have to do everything in our God-given power to see it. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 5 stars
