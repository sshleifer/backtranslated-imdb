The first opening scene, which lasted about five minutes, showed the potential to immediately become a classic, with moderate to good plays, a good movie, a story that maintains the volume, and a hauntin 'in the corner of the screen seen that! "(the scarecrow moves). <br /> <br /> After the fast build-up of the story that would come to the present, it was as if someone else had written and directed the rest of the "movie". The next scene shows how the movie goes downhill like a run-down truck. It looks like the rest has been shot in videos with crappy "porn actors". The set was a law firm with virtually nothing in the bookcase or anything in the office. <br /> <br /> I remember that I only saw crap horror movies to see some naked "teenage girls". Back then, not all Victoria's Secret magazines existed and not things that make up today's great horror movies like acting, terror, suspense, intregue, and so on. <br /> <br /> It took almost fifty minutes for the first person to die. When this happened, I and my friends were so shocked that the worst costume of a "monster" EVER we grumbled through our popcorn on the screen.
