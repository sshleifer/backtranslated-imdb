I think I probably would not hate this movie if I speak Polish. I chose the English version in the first menu, but it gave me Polish dialogues with English subtitles, just like the Polish version. Maybe the dialogue was so incoherent because the person writing the subtitles could not translate it very well into English. To aggravate the problem, some dialogues had no subtitles at all. Acting was pretty bad, especially the female lead, which was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing. When the mob pushed her around, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her bare chest for 15 to 20 seconds. I could not see her chest adding to the drama of the scene or the movie. Maybe the director has tried to increase the number of teenagers in the audience. Much of the film is set in an extermination camp freed by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms did not look like US uniforms. Second, none of the extermination camps in Poland was liberated by the Americans. I think a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated from the Russians. All in all, it's just not a very good movie if you do not speak Polish.
