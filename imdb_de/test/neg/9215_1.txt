In my opinion, the end has completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea that someone suddenly realized that they were the Son of God, and the second coming was a little smart. People believed him and his friends became the new disciples. People went crazy, demons had people, all kinds of fun. Then of course everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to face the impossible task of searching through a plethora of scriptures within five days to find the "Third Testament," but in the end that ridiculous humanistic fantasy became. I'm not going to ruin it, but I'm just saying that it looks like it's written by a teenager who has limited theological knowledge. I've heard that they make an American feature version of this story. I just hope they change the end of the feast for the eyes.
