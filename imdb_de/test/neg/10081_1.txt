When I saw that, I thought I liked the first two and thought that they were very exciting, so this one should be good as well. NOT CORRECT! There was NO tension and they do not explain about the new dinosaurs! When I finished, I had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but then it turned out that he was not written by Spielberg or Michael Crichton. This movie ran through "the movements". I thought this movie had absolutely no plot and I thought nobody should waste their money on it to see it.
