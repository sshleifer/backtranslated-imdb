Honestly, this movie is weak. Very weak. Only capital letters can do something. She works like a compressor for a bad engine ... so if you like red-haired Valkyries - see that. But better find a picture of Brigitte as Sonja and put it on the desktop. It will save disappointment. Well, Arnold is also doing his deal ... but it's definitely not the best role. Other signs - this word is not bad. Sword fights? Monster? Ridiculous. Plot is really a pity. Why did she have to be raped? In particular, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is weak. Although there are worse films ... Without main characters, it would only *****. And if someone is discussing it, maybe ...
