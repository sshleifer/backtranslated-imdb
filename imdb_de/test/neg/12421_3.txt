Wild Rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating because of the really good or at least practicable elements in the story. It's a racing driver (Steve Alaimo) who mixes with a group of bikers called Satan's Angels who hang around until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo is also recruited by the cops to tell them what the angels are up to and where to steal next. It's not even that the movie is really too "outdated", although of course it carries the clearly raw and stupid music in the movie (from the band on stage in a scene to Alaimo's "performance"), if that's what it is could call Drek, to the regular generic score). <br /> <br /> It's just that the filmmaker no longer bothers to use a little more logic, direction, and better actors for the parts. As was the case with the Hellcats, I did not have much antipathy for the movie, but that almost did not bother me. What could happen as unpredictable comes only with stupid things like the name of the city of Florida ("Citrusville" ho-ho). It is not completely unworthy to reach the status of Mystery Science Theater 3000 lately. The commentary is good for the movie, though I almost wanted to hear once or twice what the characters on screen said if it had a value. Wild rebels may be a good time if you have a six-pack and low expectations, but since it is so, I would not see it anymore.
