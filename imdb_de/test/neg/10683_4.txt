I was all ready to hate this, but it turned out to be surprisingly bearable - although the MTV style of filmmaking (shot on DV, to boot) is quite a miracle! I liked the self-deprecating style of the script and its central idea that the female vampire will double as a hitman. In terms of cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the "star" of this dreadful intro "Redemption") has an undeniable screen presence - and is quite sensual despite her age; Christopher Adamson's mutton boss villain, however, is disgusting. David Warbeck has a short role as a doctor (called "The Horror-Movie Man"!), Which performs the autopsy on one of the victims of the vampire. The film seems to have taken a long time when Warbeck died in 1997. There's a lot of nudity and violence, but not much sense (especially since his subplot, which involves a secret vampire society that permeates power structures, is barely developed). The movie is also too long for its purpose and gets bored in the last half hour.
