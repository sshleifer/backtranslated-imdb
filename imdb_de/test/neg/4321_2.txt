I can not believe I've been through the whole movie. A friend rented it because it sounds good through the jacket. For defense, the jacket was right; There was a supposedly haunted room where someone slept overnight. From the jacket it sounded like Freddy, Jason or maybe "The Shining" equaled. It could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of minimalist and / or surrealist movies, you can enjoy it. If you're looking for a good fright movie or some thrills, hire Jason against Freddy IV - you have a much better night.
