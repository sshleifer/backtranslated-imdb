Witchcraft / Witchcraft / La Casa 4 / and whatever you want to call it. How about ... .Crud. <br /> <br /> A gathering of people in a resort on the island of Massachusetts is besieged by the black magical powers of a wicked witch who is killing anyone with cruel, torturous methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) photographs for Linda (Catherine Hickland, whose voice and behavior is similar to EE-YOR from the cartoon Winnie the Poo), a virgin who studies witchcraft, without permission at the Island Resort. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, who is an incredibly rude bitch) is interested in possibly buying the resort and sharing with her husband Freddie (Robert Champagne, who is always chasing other younger women, much more than he does) the pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and grandson Tommy (Michael Manchester, who just looks bored and would probably like to see Sesame Street instead of staring at this garbage), takes a boat to the resort and takes a look at the estate of Tony Giordano's son Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) begrudge. obviously a puppy in the business who gets wet feet. Along with these people is the architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a nymphomaniac) who could help Rose redesign the resort. The captain of the boat is killed by The Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, make-up and lipstick extra thick), and a storm is brewing. The boat goes off by itself (guided by the unseen power of the lady in black, I guess), all of them stuck in the decrepit resort that needs urgent repair. Most victims are carried before their cruel fate by a kind of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension (.. maybe a kind of hell or something) in which they louse with a monster of these monsters, dressed in rugged robes Face tortured. A victim has sown his mouth before being turned upside down in a chimney, while the others light the fireplace. A poor soul is tortured by hard rope wraps tightly wrapped around her flesh before hanging from the snout of a swordfish that penetrates her throat. A man smothers slowly as his veins bulge out (and bleed) and burst the blood vessels of the neck that splash in Hasselhoff's face! A guy is crucified and hammered with nails into his hands before being turned upside down over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim is possessed, her hair is at the end and speaks with the voice of another woman. One is raped by this demonic man with a "sick" mouth, while the infernal hobos nearby cheerfully rejoice. The film, despite its excesses, is mostly boring food for those who really want to see the lowest point in the career of Hasselhoff and Blair, who deserve better. Sometimes almost unbearable, little to no tension building. Clumsy execution of the death sequences that look cheap and ridiculous. Sure, Gore is okay, but most of the movie shows victims after they ring the bell. We have a chance to see pregnant women (who look just like stuntmen in a costume with bad wigs) jumping out of three windows. Oh, and The Lady in Black's reflected face often appears on inanimate objects that the characters can see. Tommy has a small sesame street recorder recording The Lady in Black's bumblebee songs, which are obviously being used for later. For some reason, The Lady in Black visits little Tommy. He's not afraid of her at all, because Tommy is just too bored to show a look on his face, let alone fear. Do I have to say more? This is a real stinker. Pooh.
