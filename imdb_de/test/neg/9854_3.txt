I thought this series would be another entertaining action series with dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. Although I like Jamie Denton, it's hardly worth watching this show unless you enjoy brutally seeing some people and justifying agents' actions under the motto "national security." The show is great propaganda for the current government and spits out jingoism as if we were talking like that every day. After a few episodes, I was bored boring, and I started seeing repetitions of House Invaders on BBCAmerica. Undoubtedly look at CSI and without a trace.
