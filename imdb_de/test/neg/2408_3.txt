As I struggled to stay awake, I struggled with my near-miss to discover a silly conspiracy that was incredibly annoying and got in trouble with a psychotic, radioactive half man or half cyborg named Splatter Murder of her prestigious, politically vocal leader (... for whom Splatter killed himself so he would take the blame so he could become the leader). These face-painted freaks make up a group that express their feelings anarchically, but non-violently, living on dilapidated streets that are abandoned by the "civilized world" and express their concerns about nuclear disarmament. However, most of the film has these five comrades running through dark graffiti-filled streets while Splatter and his punks are following them. Fortunately for these guys, they find a punk chic that helps them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain they are unfamiliar with. This territory where the boys are immersed is a veritable maze of streets and lanes with the idea of ​​making an exit most difficult, especially when crazes and splatters group almost every turn. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was fooled like the others thanks to the HR Giger poster, which is very good. If he had just been the designer of this filth ... that's not the case, and we, the viewer, have a movie modeled on it, of all the movies it seems, Walter Hills THE WARRIORS, except that this movie does not have the style or sand that the movie has. The film has an abundance of listless pieces and lame confrontations between the antics and the punks who are fought hand in hand and are often ridiculous. The setting is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric applications of neon light, but the environment is not the problem. It is the action and the characters in the environment that become tiring. The saddlebags under my eyes were heavier every minute as the movie continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW plays stars Edwin Neal (a rather funny vocalist having an entertaining interview on the DVD I rented for that blazing filth) and Marilyn Burns have "key" roles as opposing members of their faction The Government led in the end to the final completion of a building complex. Neal's figure splatter uses those metal points that emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
