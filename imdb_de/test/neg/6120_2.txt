For any wrestling fan, this is the wrestlemania you should forget. No logic for the matches, a few garbage tricks (doink the clown and Giant Gonzalez). This was an unforgettable PPV, which was something rare for the WWE (F). The logic with which Hogan won the world title at the end made no sense, and many people believe that alone can solidify the nail in the PPV. From the pointless gimmicks of Roman soldiers over plain bad wrestling (doink vs crush is the worst match) to just bad matching (Scott "Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund), how can you make a comeback, and in his, one of the best mat wrestlers first Wrestlemania, a power wrestler who was not yet defeated at the time), this is a PPV that even the WWE has since acknowledged was far below the expected value just for a stinker
