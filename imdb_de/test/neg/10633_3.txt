I saw this movie because I thought it was a classic movie by Amy Adams. Wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it shakes the imagination. It's poorly designed for a person, even the script and drama is just awful. But Johnny Depp also has a lot of bad movies in his stomach. The advantage of this movie would be that Amy sings, and even in this regard, I believe that better songs could be chosen. Amy is nice to look at, of course, and if you're a diehard fan of her, you'll probably see that title no matter what. Do not expect too much. I wish I could have found more, but it was just painful to look at. I recommend sunshine cleaning or doubt.
