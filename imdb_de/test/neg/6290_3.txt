KK should stay singing - the whole movie was a long hole. I can not understand the wickedness of the boys and the romance between Miles and KK - the sex scenes were not inspired either. The end was terrible - unclear - there must be reason to murder. And all the voyeurism of the boy was funny ... The mother always struggled with the boy. And why did not KK teach someone how to speak with diffraction instead of monotone? <br /> <br />
