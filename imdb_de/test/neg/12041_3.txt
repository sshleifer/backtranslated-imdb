"Carlito's Angels" is a parody of "Charlie's Angels" who is not afraid to deceive themselves, but that does not mean that the movie is also criticized by the viewers - it's amateurish and youthful (I think "fast") ) -Motion "stopped to be funny in 1914.) The overtaking rap music often drowns out the dialogue and the film feels longer than it is, though it lasts barely an hour! The girls themselves are hot and loveable, with wonderful skinny bodies, and although they never strip naked, their outfits leave little room for imagination, and by trying out their IMDb pages, I learned that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually going through a movie career Although this movie is bad, she (like the other girls) gave him all the energy, and I would not mind seeing her back on the screen.
