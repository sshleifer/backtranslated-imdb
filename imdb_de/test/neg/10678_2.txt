I will not even comment on this movie anymore. Instead I will make a recommendation for all Euro Horror fans: If you want to see a cheap vampire movie, take a look at Nattens angel (1998). It has everything that Razor Blade Smile lacks: drama, beautiful locations, terrific results and less hissing vampires ...
