First of all, I would like to emphasize that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even when it makes jokes out of minorities. The reason why I'm pretty sure this racist work is not worth looking at is that it does not make fun of minorities to show their lifestyles, their social circumstances or their way of being treated by society. In addition, it uses every stupid stereotype and prejudice to strengthen xenophobic feelings and reservations. It is a pity, but not surprising that the other comments did not understand this point because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
