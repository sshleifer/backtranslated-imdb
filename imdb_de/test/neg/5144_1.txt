Could be the worst movie ever made. At least Plan 9 from space was funny. I can not believe that they persuaded anyone to invest money for it. Complete waste of celluloid. Before I saw this crap, I had some respect for Kristophersson. I think someone needed a tax write-off. Please, in the name of everything that is not shit, stop who did that before they suck again! This movie should be avoided by anyone who is not into LSD, or my crazy cousin who insists we are part of the Native Americans. If you're in the woods and an owl starts talking to you, go to a psychiatrist. It is not necessary to make a movie about it.
