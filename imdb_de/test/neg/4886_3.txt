From the late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo act in movies. At the time, Laurel was definitely NOT a top talent and his humor is nowhere near as good as his contemporaries like Lloyd or Keaton. However, he has created a decent niche for second-tier short comedies. As for the quality of the films, they varied wildly. Some, such as DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRYDE were great, while most were average to below average quality. FROZEN HEARTS is a strange movie. Like many of his films he shot for Hal Roach and expelled from Path√© at the time, the costumes were absolutely top-notch and the film looked very nice. Still, and with the support of people like James Finlayson, they forgot to add humor to the movie. None of the jokes seems to work and the movie looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only the really stupid subtitle cards reveal the type movie it should be. My advice is to see all of his Laurel and Hardy films and then watch the solo films. Next to DR. PYCKLE, try to watch THE SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of his more bearable solo shorts.
