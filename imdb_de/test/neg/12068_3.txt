Apparently, the author and director of this direct-to-DVD Slasher movie is a fan of Friday, the 13th and other summer camps. This movie has it all - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend having fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", the old man who warned them against going there; and, of course, the crazy killer with the machete who continues to chop and hack the teens for no reason ... The whole thing could have worked if shot on 35mm film with acceptable special effects. Instead, the special effects are done badly. The killer walks around as if he's going for a walk on a Sunday afternoon, and the only good thing about this movie is the acting of the talented lead actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - boring and forgotten. Jasper P. Morgan
