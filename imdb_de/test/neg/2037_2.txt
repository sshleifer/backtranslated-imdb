I had nothing to do before I went out one evening, so I did not want to see anything too heavy. I chose the perfect movie. That must have given Barrymore from someone she slept with. The director Raja Gosnell has done nothing but stupid crap, and writing on this is just cruel. At which school can one register without present parents and without proof of age or without school attendance? They had children all come to prom without shirts, in skintight jerseys, donkey shorts, and a girl dressed as Eve, wearing only fig leaves? She announces that she is 25 years old and her brother is 23 years old, but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or espionage? The newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in a minor sex scandal, but does not realize that the teacher is coming to a 25-year-old, so this would be a trap? You allow a camera and have private conversations with minors? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to return to HS with a camera and filmed underage girls for my staffing. I would not get any trouble ??? NAHHHH No problem. Did not she ever have to go to the gym or go to the bathroom? The secondary characters were like cardboard cutouts, which are supposed to accept high school students, and all were a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just embarrassing when she attacks the camera on every occasion. In which world do parents not become suspicious when their over-geeky daughter is miraculously asked by the school stallion for the prom? And they do not ask the man to meet him like all the other parents in the story. If a guy in my school or other school had got my sister to throw eggs at her in her ballgown, he would have been in a body plaster for the rest of his life. This movie is so thoughtful and predictable that it is disgusting and why in the end all (including the alpine girls) cheer for this chick when they hated her two days ago ???? STUPID.
