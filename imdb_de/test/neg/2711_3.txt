********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ************************************************************************ ************************************************** .html years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax lawyer who marries his boss's daughter. Together, they should meet in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus ... <br /> <br /> If you can do it, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to reveal the plot **** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****, the bad guys in the film try to protect their boss by retrieving the information she was charged for the murder for which the Madonna was sent , What villains do not commit the murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! <br /> <br /> Then there is the police chasing Madonna, who follows the bad guys in a limousine, where they stand, the bridesmaids are all tied up! And let's not forget the same bridesmaids who fought from the front door to the front door, still all connected! And I hate to say that, but this Patagonian cat definitely looks like a cougar! There may only be four of them in the New York City area, so they may be at risk there, but I know there are plenty of them in the Rocky Mountains (see "Charlie the Lonely Puma") if you really are one Big cat want to see "in the movie.) And look at the old man who falls asleep ... NAW! <br /> <br /> The plot is there, but that's all there is to this film I was barely out of my teenage years when this movie came out and I was a fan of Madonna, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then it's not popular anymore with me and me seen the fact that she's just a horrible actress (good that she has that singing career she can fall back on), maybe it was a "5" at the time, but over the years it fell to "barely a 2".
