The reputation of QUINTET is no different than watching a group of people play a pun in Portuguese or another language you do not understand. You have the idea that they are playing a game, and if you look closely, you can easily understand the rules. But why bother, because it's clear that you can not and will not do it if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not one who asks an audience to like his films let alone understand them. Sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd, as in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE, and A WEDDING. Films so full of bustle and orchestrated chaos would not be one or two more bodies in the scene. It makes a big difference. At other times he seems to be annoyed that maybe even someone sees his movie. Like in PICTURES or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues created for an Altman audience. With QUINTET, Altman seems to deliberately dare someone to deal with the narrative. <br /> <br /> You can not count on Altman to do the logical or the anticipated, which is sometimes what makes his films so iconoclastic. But sometimes the unexpected is not daring, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET, we are introduced to a young woman who appears to be the last person to become pregnant, and she actually has a child. This last glimmer of hope in a crumbling society is extinguished almost immediately. Altman does not wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this artful, nihilistic and pessimistic story. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is. Courageous? Could be. Stupid? Certainly. With no purpose in mind, he attempts to build a story on a fast-melting iceberg, reminding us how pointless the effort is. <br /> <br /> QUINTET can at least claim to be prophetic. At the heart of the story is a telltale game played by the various bored characters. It is a form of TAG (the assassination game): A handful of people choose each other, each as a would-be assassin and everyone as a would-be victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill a third party. When they die, new targets are assigned. Who lives, wins. All of this happens in an exotic, inhospitable desert. It's, to a large extent, an extreme sci-fi version of "Survivor" - apart from the commercial plugs and the fake "reality". <br /> <br /> It's not a bad concept for a sci-fi epic. A post-apocalyptic locale, a microcosm of the world (the cast is clearly multinational), a game in which nobody can be trusted or not long, and where no one really wins. Literally a cold war. A steel-eyed director with a penchant for dark humor and violent invention might have a field day. The puzzle in QUINTET is not in the game or how it's played, but in why it's all there. If the game "Quintet" is a metaphor for life, Altman seems to see nothing in the material, but the chance to show life as an empty, meaningless game - an obvious as well as untrue conclusion. Given the lively, though cynical nature of the rest of the films, I do not think Altman believes in QUINTET either. And if Altman does not trust his material, why should we do that?
