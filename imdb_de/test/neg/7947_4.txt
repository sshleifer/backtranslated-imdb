I am sure that many people will love this movie. The only woman who shows "balls" (unfortunate unfortunate pun) looks, speaks and acts like a man, the other two women are portrayed either as sexual objects, with one thing in mind: sex / sex sex as the sole property and Dexterity (Iris) - or as freaky pretty little princesses whose neurosis negates any power and professional authority they had before they lost their hell (Doc). The only strength Iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a tall, strong man. Apart from my negative gut reaction as a feminist, I have to give the camera work projects, and Ethan Hawke is great in the first scene. After that his power loses steam. Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. At the very least, the film touches the issue of the duality of good / evil in the criminal mind.
