When I was too young to see the Hammer movies as fresh and new, I discover their sacred horror movies when I find them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them, but it's hard to see the magic of the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry into the Christopher Lee series. The original Hammer vampire story had a lot of atmosphere and a great story to get involved in. Lee was a great Dracula, if possible a pulsating vampire, but in this early case, he is nothing more than a cardboard character that usually stands around looking menacing. The fashionable young people talk like cartoon characters (even though my aunt lived in England in the 70's and says people actually talked to those awful stereotypes). I had no interest in who lived or died among the younger people. They were all pretty awful characters anyway. I enjoyed seeing a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but she leaves the story too soon. Lee and his historical nemesis Peter Cushing give the movie a touch of authenticity, but he can not draw blood from this empty movie. It is D.O.A.
