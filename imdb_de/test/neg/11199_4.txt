I saw this alone with Albert Finney. He is one of my favorite actors and he rarely manages to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just stupid: it's a little boy who's about to be born, but when his mother goes to work, he refuses to come out! This puts God and the entire human factory in crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to convince the boy to change his mind and decide to be born. So Finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the Big Apple, hoping to show him all the reasons for his life. Despite the ridicule of the conspiracy, I could have accepted it if the director I had not tried to turn this typical Hollywood movie into sentimental moralist messages in Hollywood. Directorally, the film was unbearable by a terrible soundtrack from the stick-sentimental music that Hollywood directors can not resist. <br /> <br /> He continued to slaughter the somewhat unconventional story by giving his hand away at any moment. The twists and turns of the story were completely lost in the way the story was decoded. It was as if the director assumed that the audience was just a bunch of idiots who could not see the obvious clues from a mile away. Although Finney appeared satisfactory in his performance, he seemed a bit awkward of place; and the little boy with curly locks, though he was supposed to be cute, was actually quite boring. Bridget Fonda seemed intent on copying Demi Moore's performance in "Ghost" and shook himself in no time. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film has not been successful in the US so far, which is surprising I think it has the potential at the box office to be a modest hit that appeals to both children and sentimental adults , In terms of quality, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not very good.
