I'll be honest and say I gave it up halfway somewhere and then went forward with a few breaks. then I came back here and read a lot of the reviews ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me, and I can not help it, but this cartoon for North American society seems to have a purpose, "she said save himself "and I immediately think of the Iraq. it seems to me that this is a justification or part of it for another "good intentions" invasion. <br /> <br /> The lady seems to me to be a self-indulgent person, and I resented being open about her portrait of trying to pity and "feel" for her. Well, in that case this could never happen, because just as a history teacher has mentioned here, I MUST know how much her family was so rich above average that I manage to keep it (did they play both sides? ) and sent her to Paris !? If this had been done after the biography of a poor girl, I could see how I have certain feelings. But as it stands + its release date, this is a pure propaganda film; What's worse, the cartoon trumps Tings's "soft" side too well for himself to possibly be taken seriously. There are also clich√©s about gays. Well, a woman struggling to win her rights should not have at least a little sympathy for the outsiders of society like her? The message is obviously self-indulgent from the perspective of a ruling classmate. I only give her 2 stars because she is produced and related. A propaganda film obviously has an interest in convincing and manipulating my thoughts. Therefore, he is generally well suited to address certain visual emotions that I can not dispute.
