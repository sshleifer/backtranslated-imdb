OK,. So I went to this loving RuPaul. I still love him, but think a little less. This is a gross movie showing many male genitalia. This is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and purposely made bad. The only fun thing for me is that all the voices are tied to those of Drag Queens, even the voices of real women. This is over the top, uninterrupted, laugh your back end, it's so stupid, badly made movie. I would never look at it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers have tried. There is no rating, but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul did a much better job.
