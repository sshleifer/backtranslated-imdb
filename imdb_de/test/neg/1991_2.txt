I have to wonder if such films are supported by people who are associated with the movie itself, who comes here and criticizes him? How can something so terrible score so much? My parents looked at us as children, much more mature theme films, all with a R in them, until we were old enough. I only remember two movies in which they said "yech"! when they got home this and "catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film is made up of limping doctors and staff in a filthy hospital, sprawling tales, and a pack of downtown people (who look like the 1970s committee look-alike Norman Lear sitcom). The worst part is the "murder mystery," a crazy old man who does "God's work" by killing doctors and others. If he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little feeling. They only care that he comes out where he will be "safe and happy". A doctor who is dead in a heart attack is faked as a man to escape. Oh, my, what a funny movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has not "made you think", giggles or any feeling other than "It's got to get better," but it never does. People wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. Yech.
