The story of the Bride Mass is an amusing and compelling story, and it is a concern of the filmmaker to represent rural Minnesotans with the same respect that is normally reserved for coastal dwellers. However, it's strange to find an independent movie, the brainchild of a single person as obscure and clich√©d as a committee-brewed Hollywood potboiler. I think these characters do not seem to be true to me - I've had lots of meals in small towns but never heard a debate about the merits of various English writers of the 19th century. One could say that the author / director Semans has no more experience with the rural culture than the Coen brothers and much less satirical enthusiasm.
