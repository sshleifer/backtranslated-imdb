The Emperor's Dog (Richard Haydn) is betrothed to Johanna's (Joan Fontaine) dog. However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a turntable to the Emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna's dog. After a revenge attack that banishes Virgil from the city, a psychoanalyst insists that Johanna's dog must face Virgil's dog so that she can overcome her fears. This is arranged and the dogs fall in love. Virgil and Johanna too. The rest of the film passes with romance and in the end brings Johanna's dog into the world. But who is the father ...? <br /> <br /> The dog story is the very weak vehicle that tries to create a story between people. It's a terrible story. There are 3 main pieces of music that are all trash - bad songs and terrible choreography. It's just an extremely boring movie - Bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost roaring, irritating way. It's not funny ............ EVER .......... but it should be. Bing and Joan did a lot better.
