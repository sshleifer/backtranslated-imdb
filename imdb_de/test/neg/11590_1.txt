Where should I start? First of all, the story is shitty. The acting is shit, the effects are really shit, I think I start with the story. The Story for Komodo Vs. Cobra: First, it does not explain how or when the Komodo and the cobra were there at all. Or how it came about. The acting: TERRIBLE! It seems the director pulled some people off the street (which he probably did). And last but not least, the effects: they are so horrible that the Komodo does not even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur that seems incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when the cobra appears. All in all: terrible piece of crap, do not even think about renting it.
