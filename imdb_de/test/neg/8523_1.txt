Spoiler with Plot Explanation: A poor family is thrown in the middle of the war between the bad guy (who comes out of nowhere and no questions are asked) who got confused and Casper, the kindly spirit who wants to avenge his death. With every frame movie it becomes more and more predictable, a big disappointment. The end of the movie is completely stupid, it has nothing to do with the movie itself, I think someone has no more ideas or just gets to the point that the movie is one way or the other, so it could also have a stupid ending. Waste of time, resources and money. Actors play is very bad. If you think about the dialogues, you may find that the family conflict is artificially enforced by poor communication between characters. Some scenes seem to be random. In summary: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Waste of time and money.
