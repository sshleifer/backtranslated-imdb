AVP2 is a terrible movie. The dialogue was meaningless, the drama was pitiful, had virtually no plot and you can not really say what the hell is going on, because of the continuity flaws and plot holes. <br /> <br /> BUT! You will love it anyway. Because it crosses the borders of blood, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They also kill children, newborns and unborn babies in this movie. They'll sit there thinking, "Oh my god, that's disgusting." And they'll surprise you by killing the "sexy chick that keeps it alive" as the predator and aliens fight in the hospital. <br /> It's as if the movie industry said, "We know that what we did in the first Alien Vs. Predator movie was bad, so we'll do it again, but this time we get help from psychopaths with lively ideas. " idiotic and pretty pointless ... but you'll think about it for a while after you've seen it.
