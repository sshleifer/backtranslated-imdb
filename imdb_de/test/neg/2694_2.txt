I saw this movie as a preview of the Telluride Film Festival in Venice. Your response to this largely depends on your attitude to respecting the text of Shakespeare. On the positive side: Pacino performs very well as a Shylock; Lynn Collins is a beautiful Portia. and the movie has a lush appearance. <br /> <br /> The negatives are predictable. "The Merchant of Venice" is perhaps the most difficult of Shakespeare's plays that can be staged today, especially because we are looking at it through the distorting lens of 20th-century history. The romantic action with Bassanio and Portia is no problem. The character of Shylock does this because we lack the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is at the same time a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the merciless quality of the old law. When he says, "Does not a Jew have eyes?" he is a figure; when he announces "I will have my bond!" He is an abstraction. The long passage about music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (shifted here to ribbons and cut up) is the key to this game, by re-creating universal harmony after the disturbing and evil forces (the shylock of the process scene). It is possible to psychologically understand the character of Shylock by showing that he is gradually going crazy and becoming a monomaniac as the process scene rolls around. The key is that at one point he has to stop being compassionate. <br /> <br /> Pacino's power almost makes it, but not quite. The movie can not quite decide - on the one hand there is the right movement in the figure of Shylock, and on the other hand there are a lot of strange footage of abused Jews and Venetian whores with rough nipples (no doubt, to the decadence of Antonio et al demonstrate). Shakespeare wrote no Ibsen-like social drama; He wrote a comedy based on the classic pattern of disrupting the social order and restoring social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love against the law at the center of the Shylock conspiracy sense, the film is a travesty - Radford's surgery for the game and the direction almost force us to remove what the game really means. (Taking the beginning of the final scene, cutting off most of it and moving it away from the rehearsal scene is the most extreme example.) There are a few other significant difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a good actor, plays Antonio as if he's overdosed with tranquilizers. Joseph Fiennes is pretty, but flat like Bassanio. Most actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino, and the actor who plays the duke in the process scene mumble their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final judgment? A nice movie with some good performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. Not really worth your time or money - though Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it.
