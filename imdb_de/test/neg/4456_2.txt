Of all the adaptations of Alistair MacLean's books, I think that's the worst, but do not blame MacLean! It seems that everything this movie shares with the novel is the same title. We have no suspense, no idea of ​​the mystery, no chance to really empathize with the main characters. We spend all that time (or at least I've waited for it) until Charlotte Rampling takes off her clothes (for Charlotte that seems to be a remarkably long time!). A look at the tits of Charlotte Rampling, however, can not save this catastrophic film. MacLean was kicked back into the gutter to endure the hacking of those fierce hacks and nicks-pickers that would apparently hold him responsible for all the nausea that came with trying to shoot his books. Poor old Alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered as he came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the name Maclean, but apparently not a novel of his novel - was a little exciting. The excitement here is waiting for the credits.
