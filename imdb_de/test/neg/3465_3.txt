How often do I have to write the words on this page boring and not funny until I come to ten lines. George is an original actor as alfalfa of the little crooks. This is probably something to Alfalfa. How many times have I crept into these overpaid acting films before I find out that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's crap. You spend millions to produce this film, but you can not see the end result. Renee GoAwayZigger should stop taking the illegal drugs she uses and seek medical help with facial problems she is carrying. At the very least, I hope there are drugs, as she is quite unattractive while speaking from her mouth. This movie was neither funny nor dramatic, and those hacks should just stop messing up. George and Renee, you should be ashamed and stop stinking greedily.
