I have now seen some of Pedro Almodóvar's films, but that would be the most disappointing so far. This movie did not seem to have the zaniness that is usually customary in his films, and history has never interested me. Many Almodóvar regulars are seen in this film, so there is no shortage of talent on the screen, but this movie just seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comedy advantage to this movie, I certainly could not find it, and it resulted in a surprisingly weak movie.
