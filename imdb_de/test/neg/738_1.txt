For a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey, it is hard to sit through this BBC adaptation and throw no objects on the TV screen. If Jane Austen saw this herself, she would be a bit amused and possibly exterminated. By adapting to Maggie Wadey, Northanger Abbey became what she satirized, the Gothic novel (and the readers of gothic novels). <br /> <br /> The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation becomes quite close to Austen's Catherine, an open, portrayed-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply goes along. But the novel's Henry Tilney is not a snuff hero from a gothic novel made up of caning sticks and juicy lines. He's a playful man, an almost handsome man with a chaotic space and a living life (that's right, Henry Tilney is a clergyman, a spell completely deleted from the script, some of the best scenes in the novel, as Henry In the adaptation, much of Henry's personality is lost if these scenes are not adapted, and the look is also lost by Peter Firth not exactly - Henry Tilney is said to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities in the adaptation that gets surprise and disgust - who is the Marchioness and what does she do in the story? Why is John Thorpe less an idiot and more of an intriguer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Romans expects hidden passages and dark tapestries with her romantic visions, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is indeed a comfortable, modern home - another element of satire! Why consider General Tilney drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen fingering her finger, etc.? Katharina's imagination only runs away with her in Northanger, with Henry to gently correct her. And finally, why are so many facts about the Tilney family and Ms. Tilney's death needlessly changed? To make the story more terrible? All these curiosities and simpler things are too strange to be overlooked. <br /> <br />>
