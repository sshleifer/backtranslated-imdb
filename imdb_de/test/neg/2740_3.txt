I just saw Descent. What a horrible movie. Immediately thereafter, they represent a lava geyser. A note states that it is well below the surface of the state of Washington. Guys, there are no geysers so deep in the earth. They thought it looked neat and threw it in the typical Hollywood style. And then there was so much that lava spit out. He dropped a rock and I heard a splash. Steam would have come out of the water before a lava flow could happen, if at all. <br /> <br /> And the acting was also pretty bad. Micheal Dorn has reached a new low in jobs. <br /> <br /> What a dog from a movie. I bet the vote does not go beyond 3.5. <br /> <br /> It did not look as if SciFi Channel would spend too much money on anything other than paint the handsome boy Perry as an attempt.
