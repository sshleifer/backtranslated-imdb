This is not a movie. This is a collection of random footage from a fascinating part of the world that has been dubbed with some random text. The material is not great and the text is not great either. The end product is painfully boring. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, turning on the commentary can provide some entertainment, as the director makes a somewhat confused argument that this is a science-fiction movie. It is also fascinating to read what extraordinary risks and difficulties the crew has experienced in collecting this material. Too bad it's garbage. But I think "The Making of Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating movie, much like "Ed Wood".
