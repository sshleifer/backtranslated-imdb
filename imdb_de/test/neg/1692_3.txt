I was 12 years old when this movie was released, and he got excited. The songs were inspiring and I felt good when I saw it several times in the cinema. I actually had the soundtrack album and played the song over and over. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. I just sat and looked at it with my two daughters, who appreciated it, but my older, adult eyes hated it. It is very poorly addressed in many places, and considering that it was Lionel Jeffries, I really wanted to enjoy it. The character animation was so rough, but the backgrounds were pretty good. I remember the critics back then that it was a bad movie and horrified, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie, yes, compared to what can be achieved now, it was good. But that does not excuse it because it works badly, distracts and eases. The voice of the main child actor seems to be synchronized, which is also very distracting. I can not quite see what they wanted to achieve in their production, all that came out of it was a weak movie.
