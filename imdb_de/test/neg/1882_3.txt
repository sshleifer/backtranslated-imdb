In contrast to the conditions of tenderness and steel magnolia I left the cinema and felt very disappointed. I started to study the characters and their complex mother-daughter-father-daughter relationships. I even cried. But I had no sympathy for the characters with the end. The last act did not seem to match the character of the mother at all. Although the show was pretty good, I found the movie altogether disappointing.
