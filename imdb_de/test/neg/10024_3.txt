Hm ... so, did they even have writers for that? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialogue with my films. And as for Slasherfilme, just a trace of character development is enough. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey offers neither as well as if you think I'm hyperbolic, you just have to convince yourself. Scene by scene, we just bring actors around and look left and awkward, abandoned by any sense of direction. Apart from the fact that they call each other the names when they are separated in the forest (Natch), there are only cases in which these persons say something essential, when a figure explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized by Funk & Wagnalls, dazzling Slasher fare, no?) And another warms up an old campfire story that does not even have anything to do with the plot (wait, what's the storyline?). At other times, The Prey actually bothers to film its characters just far enough with the boom microphone that we can not hear exactly what they are saying. So we get whole scenes in which the actors mumble! Deliberately! Seriously, I've seen more dialogue in a silent movie. It's like the filmmakers sitting down in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the heyday of 80s Slasher excitement, and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I really need a cute idea for a bloody beheading -Gag entire function around it. "And ... well. <br /> <br /> To be honest, The Prey probably had some kind of author on board. I mean, someone had to write down the sequence of scenes and name the newspapers. However, I am firmly convinced that this film had no editor at all. There are impressive breaks, boring tableaux and a zero-tempo feeling. The filmmakers have nothing else to film in the "script," so they fill in the runtime with exhausting taxonomies of flora and fauna that populate the forest where our wild and crazy teenagers are cut and diced. These animals are all recorded in an inconspicuous manner and without attempting atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science movie, it's because it is. I am pretty sure that this is all from nature. All that's missing is a stuffy tale from a National Geographic Knight. <br /> <br /> More exciting shots graciously spared from the bottom of the cutting room: a scene where two men are discussing cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene where a supportive figure walks on a banjo, which feels like a whole minute! One and a half minutes! That's a lot of banjoing, first of all to opt for celluloid, let alone insert it into the final clip! Keep it up, guys! Shortness and conciseness are the true victims of this battle. <br /> <br /> Granted, the film takes (comparatively) a lot of steam in the last 25 minutes, in which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip off of Béla Bartók's "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta" intervenes. Vaudeville Grand Jackie Coogan makes a funny appearance as Tubby, bumbly Park Ranger (this was his last role, if you can believe it). And there are some beautiful bloody moments, including a sparkling neckline and the beheading mentioned above. The make-up for the killer (Carel Struycken, aka "Lurch" from the Addams Family movies) is also very effective and makes him look like a strange mix of Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. And if you love crazy, straightforward endings in the left field, you need to figure out how to wrap this puppy. You make a spit, I promise. <br /> <br /> I usually love movies that are at this level of disability, but the first three quarters of The Prey are so boring that they're pretty boring spoiling the rest. All in all, this is a largely pale and boring matter, and although it's not all bad, it really should only be seen by weakened Slasher completeists. Why are we doing this for ourselves?
