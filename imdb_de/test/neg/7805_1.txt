Unfortunately, I saw this movie because it was the only option at that time and because David Zucker was the director. I saw his previous "Naked Gun" (both parts), Airplane and Top secret !, and I liked it, at least I had a good time and laughed. I do not say that the films I mentioned were masterpieces, but were OK. I can not remember any other dumbest movie than this. It's unbelievable how the Hollywood industry is in complete decadence. If a studio spends money to produce this horrible picture, it's no surprise that such stories are more common on those days. This is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization that produces sex symbols and stupid plans to entertain ordinary people. I can not say anything about this movie. If you plan to rent or buy it, do not waste your money or your time, avoid it in any case. Even if you're an actor fanatic, it's not worth it. In fact, this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid. I will not see a sugar movie anymore. (He plans to lead Scary's fourth installment, imagine that!). Pathetic. Dreadful.
