I expected this to be hilarious and mediocre at best. The only funny character is, believe it or not Andy Dick. The timing was awful for most jokes and gags and the writing was bad. I mean, I know it should be like a blaxploitation, but it just worked. Besides, this whole genre has already been beaten to death with all the austin powers movies and the undercover brother, it just seems old, it just feels like a rip-off from an undercover brother (not hysterical either) is, but much funnier than this). Plus, the direction for a comedy / action movie was kind of boring. I do not know if this will be released in the cinemas, but it is definitely meant for television.
