As a HUGE fan of the Bottom series, I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I eagerly awaited a short laugh and a minute roller coaster ride ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Where I think it's a good start to say that there are hardly any Richie and Eddie on our screens in the first place because none of the jokes and the ones that they usually deliver so well are funny. I still wait for the first laugh After a good 20 minutes. Many aspects of the story were pitiful and it was as if the movie was full of those bad moments they were rehearsing and decided to skip the final cut. <br /> <br /> All in all The scenery and atmosphere surrounding the film are dark and grubby. I think it's good if they want to portray the "terrible" guesthouse the 2 buffoons are trying to run, but for me it's just an even harder damper if you never made that film. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is sometimes pathetic. Fenella Fielding is wasted because Mrs. F oxfur and I have seen Simon Pegg making much better trips. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is blindly drunk because he appreciates the awful puns much more has not seen this movie and expects real Richie and Eddie action that warned you were
