While the prominent and excessive use of the play-like format throughout the movie is in operation, this picture is not disappointing. Rather, it's the unconvincing female performances and the rather boring script that the movie so obviously leaves too much to do. With an idea that had potential, the simple conspiracy is weakened even more by Graham's failure to truly express the havoc her character has been so stubborn. The use of improvised scenes by all actors would not be a bad idea, if only the two main actresses could use this privilege. Since Downey Jr proves, as usual, what a talented actor he is, he blinds the two actresses together in their scenes, which is always noticeable. The senseless but intense sex scene only seems to exist to prevent the film from becoming too verbally expressive and giving the actors a deserved break from talking. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, Two Girls and a Guy can not recommend anything more than Downey Jr.'s impressive, if not inappropriate, performance.
