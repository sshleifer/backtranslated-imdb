A few men are destroyed on a remote island. They are then caught by an insane earl living there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the unfortunate leprosy wife of the count. <br /> <br /> The dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. The amateur actors are all going through the film while a pesky score plays in the background. The different parts of the action are filmed in an unbelievably unenergetic way. In fact, the movie is generally completely lethargic. It always seems to move on. And even if the end is not so bad, you will find it hard at this point. As an example of the Gothic horror of the 60s, this is an example of a bargain in the basement. I can not really recommend it.
