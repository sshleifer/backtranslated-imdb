OK, the box looks interesting, the opening has great music and a bit original, everything is OK. But when the movie starts ... well, it's not my first Videoville movie, I've seen Ghost Lake, and it's very similar to this movie, except it's getting worse and worse here. The story sounded interesting at first, but the whole movie looks like a movie a bunch of students did, with special effects that make me laugh, that look like a mixture of red and white, and the fire effect on the face of the demon It was finished with a program that I could buy in my computer shop. The whole movie is shot during the day (very good for a movie that is supposed to be horror) and there is not a bunch (just one scene and it looks so home-made and unbelievable) and almost no blood (it can be a great thing considering the appearance of the blood show) and a demon for the entire movie. The story goes nowhere, it gives you the impression that it never starts. There are so many useless scenes made just to give the movie the average duration (if the demon looks for the guy in the dog thing for about 4 minutes ...) way too much slow things. Let's just say this movie is a Z series movie and very bad. All the cool ideas have been lost and you get a cheesy movie. It's boring all my time and I'm not the guy who gets bored with horror movies quickly, man, I even like the House of the Dead and alone in the dark of Uwe Boll, and you probably know the name of being one of the worst directors But here it looks too much for some guys who want to make a movie out of fun. Plus for us French spokesperson (hard, I understand English, I prefer to watch film in my native language), as the usual Videoville translation is bad. In the normal movie you can barely see that the actor is not talking (you have to pay attention to your lips, etc.). You just have to hear it and you know it. Very cheesy
