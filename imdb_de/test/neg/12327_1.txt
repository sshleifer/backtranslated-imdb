Audrey, I know that you really appreciate the memory of your husband Ted, but PLEASE do justice to his heritage and respect his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for good reason. We kindly ask you not to collect any more with his stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They are being raptured by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books. I just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what Dr. Seuss is left. Many Thanks.
