I watched this movie and I was getting bored with the stupid plot that went nowhere, when suddenly the story takes an unreal turn and an actor plays himself. Oh, how I laughed. Because it's so funny, right? We know that Julia Roberts plays the character of Tess, and here they make a joke in the movie that the character of Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone who personifies Julia. How well she does that, we will never know, because 99.999% of the audience Julia Roberts not really know personally (and reading about them in the Hello magazine does not count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis turns up! Apparently he is the best friend of Julia Roberts. Well, he's in the movie ... how should I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? I am not at all interested in the personal lives of actors - I only pay my money and expect them to do the work they are paid for. Anyway, they start cracking jokes about the plot in the movie, in which Willis plays (rather unconvincingly) a psychiatrist ... the one with the little kid in it ... you know that? I have not forgotten what it's called. Willis even adds a comment on how good this movie was at the box office - how humble of you, Mr. Willis! <br /> <br /> The problem is, these scenes are not just pointless and terribly selfish. it reminds us, the audience, that we are simply watching a group of actors stumble around and get huge sums of money for little effort. When I see a movie, I want to expose the unbelief and forget that I'm watching actors - I want to believe in the story I'm watching. If you start tearing down the scenery in the middle of the movie, just ruin the illusion for me. <br /> <br /> You know that a television series has jumped the shark when it introduces celebrities, plays itself (get up and The Simpsons, Friends etc) to be counted, but this is the first time that I've seen a movie that jumps the shark. Usually I stay away from such movies (eg Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is, I never thought that the 11 films of the ocean would go in that direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So thrown out of the window with the lifting of unbelief, and the plan now languishing in the movie breaks the most vicious joke of all viewers - the raid actually happened in the background story, and the last ones about 90 minutes of the movie were pointless. Yes that's true. Steven Soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up, point to the audience and say, "Ha haaa ... you had everything ... thank you for your money!". Then give us one-finger greeting. <br /> <br /> Well, right back. I did not pay to watch this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for free. How do you like the apples? Well, that's a twist.
