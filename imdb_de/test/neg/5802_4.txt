First, I want to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, I can not say that it was a "good" movie. I went to the theater with fairly low expectations (something I learned). I am glad that I did it because the plot and development was not outstanding. The jokes were bad humor. But I was in the right attitude to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I was not the only one. In fact, the whole theater laughed loudly. I did not hear anyone complaining after the movie was over. I even saw a man fall out of his chair and laugh! But I have to warn you again, Grandma's boy is not a first-class movie. It's a fun (though weak) movie, and if you choose the right attitude, you'll really enjoy it. Oh, and do not take any children with you.
