A very bad movie, a mixture of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: In an early scene, Soviet infantrymen are attacked by the Germans; Instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they advance on the open ground to fight them, against all infantry tactics. Kate, one of the main characters, is allegedly the daughter of a Belarussian and obsessed with her Russian, but she does not speak Russian; A guilty German airman attacks an antiaircraft gun - but the rifle does not shoot with shrapnel, but with a direct hit in his plane, which does not look like a German plane of the Second World War. To be fair, if they could escape the absurd conspiracy and consequent absurdities, there are some really powerful moments - the depiction of slowly starving people is convincing and moving, but they only show the rest. A film should be avoided.
