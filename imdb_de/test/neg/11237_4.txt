I've just captured this movie on TCM and can understand why George Murphy went into politics, if that was the best MGM could offer him. It's so slow that trying to make it a real movie noir effort is not doomed to failure. It included two of my favorite players in Eve Arden (totally wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the movie). What really impressed me was that actress Frances Gifford was about 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) Without changing the expression on her face - her fainting scene was weird. John Hodiak played his role OK, but the script left him and the rest of the cast very down. I gave him 4 stars mainly for photography. It would have been in the first half of the program when it was time for duplicate functions.
