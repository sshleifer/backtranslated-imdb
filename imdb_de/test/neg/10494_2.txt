If the budget does not allow a Cadillac or Packard or Lincoln or Imperial hearse, we'll talk cheap here. That's bird language for cheap cheap. <br /> <br /> What's in the hair of the forty-year-old teen boy? The guy who looks like a cement head trying a couple of times to run over John Agar, the only fear in the movie is how close he gets. His hair looks like a shoe. A patent leather shoe.

The music was scary. I would try to run away from the music. The monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast. Put some lipstick on the monster and you have Divine's older sister. <br /> <br /> The camera work, the editing and the plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music. > Hello Mr. Agar? We're thinking about making a sequel to Night Fright and ... Mr. Agar? Agar Tom Willett
