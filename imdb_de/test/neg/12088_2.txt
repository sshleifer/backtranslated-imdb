The governess was by far a very pathetic movie. I do not use that word loosely, because frankly it was a bad excuse for a movie. I saw this feature with just a word in my head? "Why"? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene in this movie and it seems like it fits. There were so many discrepancies that led to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters), which ultimately led to a very confusing movie with actors going through the motions instead of giving an explanation. Scenes would occur without premonition, understanding or a complete end. It was like looking at several different ideas together without really finding a solution. Actors set events in motion that did not suit their character or that were really resolved. This was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and complete lack of structure of this film has resulted in all the foundations collapsing and the rest of the film having a real "ripple effect". <br /> <br /> Let me explain this lack of consistency throughout the movie. I would compare this movie to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal containing a zebra. It made no sense and there was no logic behind it. Minnie Driver was the worst offender of this deed. The lines of her character were very fuzzy and almost transparent. She would talk about sex with her sister all the time, but she always seemed to be very open to sexual experiences. She has her first moment of passion in this movie, and there is no pain or excitement. It happens by accident, and it just did not seem to fit the original conversation we had with Rosina and her sister at the beginning of the movie. She is a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention? That was confusing and completely random. Is it obvious to anyone that there are no teaching methods? Anyone who was brained could see that she taught Cavendish's daughter nothing. The sudden and embarrassing relationship that happens to happen between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost made me laugh. I thought I might have spotted something magical in this movie when Rhys-Meyers literally "poked" into the scene and suddenly caused an unnecessary drama. The director (or the author) thought that the original story would not go anywhere fast. By adding this random character we might be able to push the plot a little bit (or confuse the smaller movie lovers). Well, it did not fool me, I saw that it was almost a cut-and-paste character used to strengthen an already weakened story. Do not let me start with the ending that did not match the rest of the story. Again, the author of this film used the "cut-and-paste" method to end the story, and this was the only solution they could come up with. It's sad when actors are forced to do things out of character? But I think that's the name of the game in Hollywood. Fix until it was completely broken or at least salvaged. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was not exciting dribbling. There might have been a few neat moments in the movie where you could see that there was a bit of creativity that would come through some bars of decent old-time music, but there was nothing to write about Grandma. A stronger family structure with some stronger introductions could have made this film a little bit more powerful, but as I said earlier, open scenes that are lying around the entire movie will get a crack in your foundation. What sounds like a solid story will fade over time, and at the end of this movie, I felt the house collapse on top of me. Wilkinson plays his normal self in this movie, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had (I'll have to see a doctor after those pictures were burnt into my eyes? Eeewwww). She also wore the same dress every day. That was disgusting and I could smell her through the TV. Sex and dirty laundry. Now there is a great movie for you! There seemed only a certain potential to float here, but instead it was just garbage. Nothing was answered, questions seemed to be falling like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to prevail. Overall, this could have been a decent movie that brought together the powerful themes of science and love, instead it was just pathetic. I can not stress enough the disturbing fact that characters have gone through motions without any explanation. I do not need cinematic moments that are given to me like a child, but you would have to do something to build a foundation. Just think of the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were as confused about it as I am, will you fully understand the movie The Governess While You Prefer Zebras in Your Oatmeal? then maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Note: * out of *****
