Most of you really did not like this movie ... you were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie ... I can not say you're wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I've seen a lot of stupid, stupid comedies, but this one surpasses any of them. As I watched, I could not stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I saw, and trying to decide whether to laugh or cry, because * REALLY DUPID * was on the screen and people were in the theater left. <br /> <br /> According to the main characters the time travel is accomplished. Just enter a museum and you will actually travel back in time. If you are looking for death, just go to the nearest planetarium. There you meet Lord - sorry, Loydd, and you get important commands ... All the above make no sense, right? Well, look at the movie (I almost never regret the movies I'm watching), you probably will not like it, but you'll be intrigued by the author's ability to produce the final STUPID script. .. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 out of 10 points, not good, far from being the worst ...
