Even a terrible 1 is too much for this movie, anything that starts to end up makes you flinch. I do not think it would be possible to put excessively stereotyped moments in a single part of the head, the numbing, numbing waste of film. <br /> <br /> Prison cell block H meets Thunderbirds as his son. <br /> <br /> I have not even finished watching this and now I'm here .... Oh no, the cheesy clapping of 3 actors and a backdrop that made a kid with Adobe Premiere. This is really the end of my phase "I started, so I will finish it". Oh, joy, the credits have come to save me. (and relax)
