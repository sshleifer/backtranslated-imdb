Who has filled this stupid idea of ​​shooting and producing a movie in Himesh's head that is always hidden under a cap and covers almost half of his face? I just hope that's the first and last, for God's sake! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything to create an aura of his so-called vocal talent, which is nothing more than cruel pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya that completely destroy the beauty of the terms commonly used for love Songs. Why is not Himesh smiling? Quite simply because he does not use Close Up toothpaste! Well, there's this friend of his who pulls him everywhere, and that No. 1 lawyer in town who can sexually wiggle and try Himesh by all the good-looking Germans she met, maybe the male lawyers on this one Part of the world could be that she insults her fate because she is destined to deal with the stiff, unattractive lot every day! The action scenes are filmed as witty as the thief's attacking event planner driving cars over the cars and so on. The bride's father seems to be in a hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her, flying back and forth. The hypocrite, who is above all a hypocrite, praises HR for spreading love among the people of the world as if they were sweets, and on his back he coolly gives his daughter a talk about these show business people. If Himesh has proved innocent, he casts the other guy off as if it were a musical chair game! I have not even seen the poor man's face, right? Hansika in the role of Ria looks as if she needs an eye exam to strain her eyes! The guy in the role of a friend is good, who acted naturally and should be in better films, like Sharman Joshi. Child artist in Trishu's short appearance is sweet but wasted. It seems that today's young generation has gone crazy, as they prefer this kind of ridicule to lyrics and scores and associate gossip with it. For example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. This is a funny music taste and pretty funny. I'm surprised how classical poets like Gulzar chose Himesh to make music. There is a story in Panchtantra that a crow hangs so many feathers of a peacock to look beautiful and talk to the birds; but the feathers eventually fall off and the real dark crow is revealed! Hope Himesh takes a hint and refrains from making such pointless things and wasting precious money he earned by taxing his short nose! His friend tells him, if you cut your nose, how will you sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, at reasonable prices for borrowing the DVD! and correct these spelling mistakes. an extra e in the movie and no e in love! There is also a famous number from the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, with which Mallika Sherawat shakes again, but this time with Himesh winking at her, and conveniently, Ria, his so-called true love, and his new bride are not around Well, that was very smart, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie you've sent to justify Sherawat's presence. But does not she look a bit washed out?
