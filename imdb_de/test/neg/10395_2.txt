I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and the pictures looked scary and I usually do not see any movies that are automatically released on DVD, but that looked so interesting and frightening! I was in the mood for a good scary movie, and possession is one of the scariest things I can see or learn. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism by Emily Rose, both terrific films that made horror breakthroughs as well as stories. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who is automatically obsessed with the get go, so we can not even say what kind of person she should start with. But a former woman who became a priest is a priest and has a gardener ...? I know, I know. Then they go with the priest and Isabella's sister in several other stories, and the priest beat the sister and played around with Isabelle. I'm not sure, then we come to a story with Isabelle's father and his question about the loyalty of his wife to him. I mean, the story goes in too many directions and was not well developed at all. Not to mention that exorcism did not look authentic at all, and more of a kind of fear of a movie I did not like because I could not take it seriously. Who governed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to guide the story well, so I would not really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
