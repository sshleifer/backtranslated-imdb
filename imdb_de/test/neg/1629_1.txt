Even MST3K could not make this painful, long and ultimately gorgeous Drek funny or entertaining. While most bad movies are hilarious in and of themselves, this is one of the few videos in which the word "bad" is literally used lack of history, but the fact that SOOOO stuffed a lot of background into the first half hour is that it is absolutely ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving without headlights. The hero of the film Ator, is no more than a feast for the eyes of this literal Sucker of a movie. Dressed in loincloth and sporting "pecs like melons," as Joel put it, he's more into a fitness magazine than hard-nosed supporters of cheese. If you have an enemy, recommend this movie. If you go through it, I recommend you. You should be able to do it through everything.
