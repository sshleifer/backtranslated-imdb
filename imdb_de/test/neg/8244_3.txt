Oh, hell, I'll tell the secret: This movie stinks! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are a few nice dinosaur effects that were probably really exciting for their time. Now they do not cut it, but they are not terrible. They are just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh about it. So they just sit there and I sit and watch that, not laughing, not excited, just boring. It stinks! <br /> <br /> If I can do my Jay Sherman for a moment, the movie is really good. The box promises cowboys to dinosaurs and is generally very good. Guys dressed like cowboys fight a few big dinosaurs. But these guys are really a bunch of sissies, and the hero is a loser (more on that later) and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating. The plot is a Yawner, and technically there is not much wrong to laugh about. It's just gray and boring. <br /> <br /> After some horrible night shots (filmed in one and a half colors, which I called it), we get the action that some people do things. I got that. Oh, and they're in turn-of-the-century Mexico, so at least they dress like cowboys, even if they do not behave that way. <br /> <br /> So a lot of those people I think are human They go into the desert and trip over these dinosaurs (after finding a miniature horse ... I do not know, let's just go on). Then the movie in the last act becomes a really pathetic King Kong rip-off. By that time, I had lost the will to keep my eyes on television, and I drifted into and out of consciousness. <br /> <br /> The "hero" is played by the man from Beneath the Planet of the Monkey, who essentially played Charlton Heston's role when Heston decided he did not want to take part in the sequel. He was selected, shock, he looks exactly like Heston. That's about all he has for him. I was really upset when he was the hero of the movie. All he does is look, snear, bag the chick in the movie. , Meanwhile his friend kills all dinosaurs, saves the day several times and what does he get for that? No recognition, no nothing! And he dies and sacrifices himself for his friends! They do not even wait for him while they escape! <br /> <br /> Boring, long, slow, with little to enjoy, until the movie decides to copy King Kong's script into his own, you should best avoid this movie, unless you are in pain the scale when you drop an anvil on your eyeball.
