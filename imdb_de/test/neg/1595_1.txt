If I could rate it as zero, I would come from someone who likes shock / exploitation films of the time and Waters in general. I have to say that is useless. <br /> <br /> It's nothing, nothing serves, an idiot with a camera and the effort to prove his wisdom through riot against social standards, all of this is something very special. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely amateur, both in principle and in the execution for the sake of disgusting, obscene with the wit of a Neanderthal, it is useless. <br /> <br /> Someone said Waters probably kissed about the bad press and disgust that others gave with this movie, but why? If I made a short film showing a man in a bathroom holding a shot for ten minutes, he would certainly get the same accommodations, but why would I be proud of it or "giggle"? <br /> <br /> It's because I'm so stupid that I have to resort to it, so I can say, "HA! Take these censors and mainstream! I'm so rebellious, sick, what I want and film it!" <br /> <br /> Waters should not be proud of this mess, fans of waters should not see it, it is useless, that is, without use. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. For artistic reasons, it even fits in with the criteria of art. <br /> <br /> In order to like or defend this film, you have to defend something that was purposely designed as an anti-culture to be pushed for the mainstream audience in a modern way. This film is the top theme of the films , <br /> <br /> Useless and outdated. A poser movie that requires him to be recognized as a rebellion.
