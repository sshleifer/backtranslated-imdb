I know that Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but the claim that this movie is good is just stupid. What was the movie about? What is a parody? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer from Gilliam's screenplay. Totally confused and senseless from one historical age to another. I find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. Is it because they have to praise a film that is vague and irresolute about what it is about? 3 stars for special effects, considering the fact that it is 1981. Roger Ebert has it right in his rating. The film is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam is playing with money just to cover a vague children's train as a historical revue. The film also tries to confuse the potential viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the highest billing.
