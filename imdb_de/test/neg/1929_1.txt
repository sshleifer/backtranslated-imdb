Dear Mr. Seitzman, or for whatever I can be held responsible, because Mr. Seitzman has not experienced his rightful fate to be eaten alive by Rabin Wolverines. I do not know you and therefore can not comment on your character; For all I know, give charities and help the old ladies cross the street. Still, for the common good, I must insist that you never write another script while you live. Put the pen away and step away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to pay attention to asking your wounded brains, I have seen one or two movies in my life and I think you will find my advice helpful: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include love scenes in which over-excited teens name the body parts of their US friends. If you need to enter such a scene, do not call the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey." it causes unnecessary speculation about which cities occupy the nipples. It is also almost incomprehensible stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes movies to reinforce class distinctions. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not knock the audience over your head with exhausted clich√©s. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam are in the rain and they cleanse them of their worries. We understand it. Yes, the roses bloom in the greenhouse of Kelley's dead mother, although every other plant starts to rot. It is a symbol of her love. It is also very painful when applied to the back of the head with a blunt force trauma. For the love of God, Mr. Seitzman, we get it. We all understood it all over the country. Amish people who are hard of hearing, unborn babies - we all get it. <br /> <br /> 4. Do not ask the actors to play mime sequences. Ever. No never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should accept the symbolism? Because the audience can draw the parallel between rebuilding the restaurant and building the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help. Really. We get it. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and remove the following lines and all the lines that resemble them: "I do not remember what we are." "I do not want to lose you." "He's like the rest of them!" (And his episode, "Daddy, you do not even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, she's in heaven and runs around in a field. We get it. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news we get it. <br /> <br /> I have seen dozens of horrible movies in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I would have just gone out of the theater, but an elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" on its side fell from the sky and held me in place. <br /> <br /> Finally, your letter bites you, you owe me ten dollars, and I hate you.
