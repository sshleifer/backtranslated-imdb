Flesh Feast starts at the Miami airport. Ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, also known as a production designer) calls his colleague Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) and informs him that he has just returned from South America where he studies Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) and that he had a big story, but while still on the phone, he gets stabbed in the back and killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, also produced as an executive producer), who was recently released from a mental hospital. Together, they discuss their grisly plans. The news of Cater's death has reached Casey and he decides to take the story into his own hands and investigate. Well, he gets his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon), who does most of the investigation and only reports to him, lazy fool. Virginia tells Casey she has someone named Kristine (Heather Hughes) since Dr. Frederick rents her recreation rooms to nurses. Kristine tells Casey about the grotesque youth recovery experiments by Schuman & Dr. Frederick, who was involved in human flesh and specially bred maggots ... <br /> <br /> Co written, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a pretty bad movie. Let's start with the script by Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for the cinematography (you feel like most cast and crew had more than one job), basically it's awful. The characters are one-dimensional idiots and have no personality. I did not like anyone in this movie. For what it's worth, I like some of the ideas here, the carnivorous maggots, the basement lab, the stealing of bodies from a hospital, and this unforgettable "twist" ending, it's almost worth sitting alone the rest of the movie , Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written, stiff and unnatural it sounds untrue, I mean, there's a scene where a nurse says she "will not let us out", which is good except that she speaks OUTSIDE in the garden to someone. No thought has gone down in history, as no explanation has ever been given as to why carnivorous maggots can restore youth, at a time close to the end, when Drs. Frederick was asked about this point, there is no time for explanations At this point, which sounds to me as if the people who wrote this, also have no idea! Even with an extremely short 68-minute Flesh Feast it is very slow and boring, the bad editing does not help with scenes and shots that take much too long. For example, there is a scene where an ambulance stops in front of a hospital, drives up to the doors, the guy gets out, he goes to the back doors and opens them, etc. etc. Do we really need to see every detail? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on some gloves. Then she takes her off and goes into the other room and puts on another couple! I personally think that Grinter probably did not record enough material, so he stretches every scene as much as possible to improve the runtime. I like this bizarre ending, I really do. Technically, Flesh is an absolute shit, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it must have been small, very small. Almost the entire movie plays in a house. The lab of Dr. med. Frederick consists of a table, some plastic cups and test tubes, ancient-looking electronic medical equipment and a strange screen with funny colors (do not ask). The cinematography is bad, the music is bad and the whole movie is synchronized, synonymous bad sync. The elements of exploitation are also disappointing, there are some maggots, but they do nothing but wobble, there is a short scene where a corpse has sawn off her leg and an OK, the dismembered corpses and limbs are attached Hook. Acting is terrible of all involved and I mean really bad, which makes the garbage dialogue even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes, there are one or two unintentionally funny moments, and this ending is unique, at least once, but this is first and foremost a real amateur movie that quickly becomes painful. I doubt most people will be able to do it, this is a session, I can tolerate almost everything, but even I thought of turning it off. In any case, to avoid, you will be glad that you have done it & if you really need to see it, do not say that you have not been warned!
