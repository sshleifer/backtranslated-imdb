(Can contain Verderber) This movie is the epitome of craziness. I rented it, hoping for a movie so bad it would be funny. However, I honestly can not decide if this movie should be scary or humorous. It combines the emotions in a pretty disturbing way. Apparently this tries to be smart, but in reality it is not. For example, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it starts to play happy music. If we go to Toxico, we have an up-beat, quasi-Mr. Roger's neighborhood music. However, if the little child dreams of falling into "blood" and if it finds the leg, they should obviously be tense. Take a look at this movie and decide for yourself. It's too funny to be described in words, and for that I say kudos. <br /> <br /> "Nose-Dive ... WOW!"
