This is by far the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Shame on Block Buster to carry even that kind of garbage. I never ask for a refund for a movie, but I think this will be a premiere. <br /> <br /> The movie is so bad that after only 15 minutes of watching it I had to stop. <br /> <I had more fun watching one of the blurry YouTube movies than dropping that one. <br /> <br /> The marketing guy for this movie has to have some sort of silver tongue to bring this thing into a blockbuster setup.
