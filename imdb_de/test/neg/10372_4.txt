I absolutely love the first three films, they were great! I got part 5 on VHS 10 years ago and was disappointed. Maybe it was because I never saw the fourth because they were shot in a row. But after I finally looked at a copy today, I have to say that it was no better than number 5. My expectations were not high at first, but that's cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it is PG -13. The acting was unconvincing, the story was quite stupid without excitement and there was not much impact. But the main problem is that there were no kills and no gore (the annoying boy who was killed in his car should be the highlight, but come on ..) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, both parts 4 and directing led Sequel director Jeff Burr, who gave us the excellent stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was nothing but a tribute to the best scenes of all films. <br /> <br /> Overall, Puppet Master is very similar to the Hellraiser series: A great trilogy, but forget the rest ..
