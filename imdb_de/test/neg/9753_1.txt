The actors can not act. All dialoagues were plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his expression ... EVERYWHERE. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new. A street kid gets involved in a professional dance world and it turns his life. That, along with the whole incident in which the little kid is involved, is taken directly from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance). <br /> <br /> and the dance ... In the whole movie there were only 3 dance sequences, and 2 of them were taken directly from commercial. Maybe I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe you have to hear that too. Channing Tatum is definitely not a B-boy. His little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any wow factor, all of which are criteria of a street dancer. The entire jazz and ballet of the film had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable whirls, but nothing more. After the grand finale, I thought, "Okay, now they're getting serious" until the end, when I realized it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit it is certainly difficult to make a good dance movie, but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Served had at least the dance aspect, with the exception of its contradictions with street dance culture. Save the Last Dance was rubbish, and so it was pretty much every musical from the last 10 years (though I was impressed by Moulin Rouge) ... see Center Stage for Ballet, Beat Street for Hip-Hop
