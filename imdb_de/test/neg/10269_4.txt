Typically elaborately crafted HBO production with first-class cast, a rich small town atmosphere and beautiful narrative vignettes, which are characterized by above-average production values. <br /> <br /> But, and that's a huge "but," the various undergrounds populated with some sympathetic, mostly annoying cartoons are paper-thin and dumb for over three long hours. <br /> <br /> The often stupid story moves uncomfortably between melodrama without being entertaining enough and personal drama without being profound. <br /> <br /> Pity, because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 dingy Paul Newmans
