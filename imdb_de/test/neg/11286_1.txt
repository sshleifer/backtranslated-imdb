Cobb. It sucked. I did not learn anything from the man I had not heard before. The performances were exaggerated. A scene where Cobb and Al are driving down a snowy road in Reno looking for women has to be one of the worst conceived scenes lately. It's just STUPID and unsafe. The flashback sequences were awful. And they used the same sequences over and over and over again. If I had once again seen the same attitude of Cobb, if he fights with someone in a base again, I would have become physically ill. When we watch this 'movie', we learn NOTHING about how it was in Cobb's time. We do not know anything about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, except that they do not like him. I thought if I looked at this movie, I would learn something about the era of baseball in which Cobb played. Instead, all I saw was how Cobb hated everyone and how he hated him. Boy, what a great movie (sarcasm). Cobb is depicted in the movie as a constant liar. Which of his stories should be exact? Who knows? Who cares? Nobody will see it after seeing this crap. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure the fast-forward button on your VCR works because you are tempted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully someday someone will make a good movie about Ty Cobb. I liked this movie as much as people in it liked Cobb, which means - I hated it. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE FREE section of the video store. I think I'll get back by fifty cents from the video man, since I do not get the time back in wasting that garbage. Well, what could I possibly have thought about a movie with Robert Wuhl?
