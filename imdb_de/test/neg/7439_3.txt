A pointless deposit in which nothing but malignancy contributes. This is a definite case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's stunned, less complicated and tired mess of a sequel is dubious, uncomfortably trashy to watch and even mild to entertain, but he has virtually no flair, emotion, intelligence or excitement of the original. Instead, we just have another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason seems to be exaggerating the viewer with relentless force far more brainless than anything but the original. Omni Consumer Products, who made the original Robocop cyborg, became a totalitarian force the second time, like never before, ending up with the suspicious Nazi banner, stormtroopers, and tank rental tanks; As for the anonymous old man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is less a benevolent protector and more of a hideous Mr. Burns type who surround himself with feeble lackeys who sincerely believe in the brain of a murderous psychopath in the body of the bring The new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop looks into this mess somewhere, though you're wondering what a good actor like Peter Weller saw on screen in the script. The droll Tom Noonan has nothing to do as a villain, while Nancy Allen as Robocops partner is heavily wasted. There are some fun moments everywhere; For example, the first commercial "Magnavolt", but this is a bad post-processing of the really big original.
