I've heard legends about this "movie" for a while (quotes to not insult movies), when I finally got the DVD with him, I started impatiently to look at them. In the end, all I had to do was go through some of the most idiotic, inappropriate, nonsensical scenes of this senseless childish chaos, to make it end faster. This could be the worst movie I even "touched" - and was connected to Troma for a while. "Manson Family" makes Tromba's contributions appear like daring and seminal arthouse filming. I could go on talking about the syphilitic skeleton of a "conspiracy," the disgustingly bad "drama", the painful, incompetent "directing," the sets and props with their "$ 99 (which I particularly loved)" look Plastic toy pistols used in the Tate murder scene! "Or the vile look and feel of this whole garbage bag (I think it was supposed to be a drugged hallucination;) I have absolutely no idea what drugged hallucination is or is feels, nor do I want to find out - but I think drug junkies with burnt-out "brains" will love this "movie" (they seem to be the ones who did it) I have a lot of movies from different "worst" 50's "Lists traditionally hit by Eddie Wood's lists - and Eddie Wood would be horrified by the sheer inability and lack of talent of van Webber (or whatever) his name is; I do not want to remember it), I've never seen "superbabies" or its sequel, but I strongly hope that "Manson" joined IMDb's review, fortunately this obscure garbage p is not seen enough to ensure enough "1" voices - and so much the better!
