This ridiculous action film is only as a drama debut of future Hollywood starlet Hollywood, Sandra Bullock, so full of holes that one could easily suspect a termite infestation. The plot is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. The production values ​​stink of cheese. In fact, a total lack of production values ​​would have been better ... at least the film seemed a bit slimmer in that way. The ADR is ridiculously bad and omnipresent in the movie. It is controversial whether or not any of the dialogue tracks of the actual shoot were used. <br /> <br /> The performances are mostly awful, though there are a few exceptions. In these exceptions, however, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director obviously gave the actors a bad direction and sometimes made them appear completely uncharacteristic. Bad characters.) Even the constant "weapon sound effects" (magazines are loaded, slides are cocked, etc.) are completely overloaded and, most of the time, not. completely out of sync with the screen actions. Add to this cheesy "Bad Guy" narration distortion for the main villain (mainly so you know he's the villain in that unintelligible mess of a movie), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The Situations In the film, you go far beyond the usual "suspending unbelief" and become downright ridiculous. A lead actor spends a good portion of the movie on a chair before deciding to use the butterfly's knife in his sock to break free. So my questions are ... why did not he do that earlier and why does he even have the butterfly knife? He was not wanted? LAW. This is one of a hundred examples of completely ridiculous situations somehow penned into this 90-minute package. By and large, "The Hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad R-Rated TV movie from the 80s Without the later success of Sandra Bullock this would NEVER have landed on DVD. But it is so, my only advice is to steer clear. Watching this movie can actually affect your IQ.
