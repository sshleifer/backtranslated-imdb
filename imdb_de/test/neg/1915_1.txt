I'm not sure why I did not like this movie that much. Maybe I'm too old or too masculine or something. Who was the target audience? If you like it and you like it, I'm happy for you. Personally, I found it a bit like a pill. The characters were uninteresting and unlikely, the script was just embarrassing and some, if not all, of the acting were not inspired. Mawkish, boring and sometimes disgusting - Surely there is something better. <br /> <br /> Related: Why is it that every time I see Chris Klein in a movie, I feel the urge to beat him silly? Does anyone else have that?
