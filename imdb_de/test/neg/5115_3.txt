This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scott's "Someone To Watch Over Me," a classic. It plays Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the Evil One. It's a quality movie with good direction and great acting. This movie is the opposite. It's the same plot, only without good acting and adding TV movie directions. I have to say, I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She is hot and her romance is believable on many levels. Unfortunately, this carbon copy of Ridley Scott's classic film unfortunately can not be saved. <br /> <br /> Crappy TV movies usually have a certain redemptive quality that makes them at least worth seeing. I think for me the redeeming value of this movie is that Rob Lowe and the lead actress have chemistry. That and I could compare and compare the plot with another quality movie.
