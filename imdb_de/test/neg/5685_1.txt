I have no idea what these people thought when they made this movie. No plot, very limited action and what about the third person commentary throughout the movie ???? Instead of running to the planet to shoot in all these places, they would have had to spend some money on screenwriting and acting. What acting was was lousy. That was 90 minutes of my life that I can never get back. I should charge the director the rental fee for this movie. To the director and the authors of this movie .... please finish now. This film should have a label labeled boredom on the front. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the computer generation. It's OK as a generation. This movie should never have a sequel ... ever.
