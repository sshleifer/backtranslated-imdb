I saw this movie in a show that featured bad B movies and tried to get you to buy. It was basically just a long trailer, but you have a really good idea of ​​what the movie is about. After watching the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverted sense. It is in no way entertaining. The film has two (or should I say four) things that speak for it, and it's not the number of deaths that counts, but the women. They are hot and naked, and Ms. Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in a movie that focuses on T & A and stupid dialogues. This is not even a horror movie or a scare, unless you talk about the actors trying to act. The production value is pathetic, the acting is worse and the writing is the worst. What was the point of making this movie? Scare people? Rip off "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? Try and be funny? To show the breasts of women? Put the head of a guy with wrong hands and legs in a backward outfit? To have a character, say the word "snow" over and over again. Not having real violence, but having enough nudity to cover up the fact that there is no real conspiracy? To turn a movie into a movie no one has ever seen or will ever see? I made a mistake when I picked up this movie. Do not make that mistake either. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie !!!!!!!!
