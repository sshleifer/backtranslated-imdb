How can you make a joke about mafia? It's not the kind of topic to laugh about! A movie nearby can not make me laugh because I'm using Jane Austen's mafia! Comparisons. Mafia! was not a good movie, but Hoods is really worse! In mafia! There were some good jokes, but in this case maybe there are two or three ... that make you smile. Not bad actor, but very bad scenario !! We certainly prefer something serious like the Godfather. I give it * out *****.
