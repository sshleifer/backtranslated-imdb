Rivalry between brothers leads to the main story. Navy commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far man can go into the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test pilot ever and was selected for the Y12. Of course, Dan has a problem with order taking and is too self-confident daring. <br /> <br /> On Dan's second flight, he crosses the comfort zone 300 miles away and his vehicle passes a meteor shower tower. When he returns to Earth, Dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of bad asphalt. He also has a demanding desire for blood, be it farm animals or fellow humans. Short term of one hour and seventeen minutes; Black & white with almost stoic play ... typical for low-sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe complete the cast. Notable little things: about two months after the release of this film; The Russians were the first man in space.
