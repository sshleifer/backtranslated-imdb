To be honest, the movie was so horrible that I loved it. I've never seen such a horrible movie in my life. I was shocked. I mean, I do not even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even keep their own weapons, one minute a man had an M16 and his friend had an MP5, then in the next scene they changed arms. (Do not ask, trust me, I know my weapons.) And I'll never understand her coming from a place that looked like Vietnam to a highway in Arizona, to my backyard, and then to a chemical factory in California I took it. <br /> <br /> Why were you scared of a guy in a Halloween mask wearing a garbage bag for a cape and shooting plastic darts at you? How is that frightening? I wanted to swallow Arsen through the movie. I love how the "skeleton man" accidentally decided to make a killer that day. But whoever made this movie should be turned on its knees and fed to a mound of fire ants. <br /> <br /> Hello.
