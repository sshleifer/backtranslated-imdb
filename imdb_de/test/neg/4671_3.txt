Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie is not action-packed; it is slow and boring. It's not funny or exciting, it's predictable and plays with cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are loud and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clichés. These are sprayed by characters who should only be called "gentle, giant black man", "eccentric genius who is about to crack", "square claw-hero who becomes of age", "cowardly", "luckier." Player who lives by a code of honor, "impulsive princess" and so on. <br /> <br /> And the Scriptures! How many undramatic countdowns did they think fit in this thing? Counting a scene in which people bomb The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the public's concern about whether a jolt picks up his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say goodbye to Liv Tyler in time All work is done, all we have to do is wait a few seconds for Harry Stamper, the idiot, to drop some cotton candy lines, I know Bruce Willis Generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is a disgusting boredom. I thought he deserved the Golden Razzy he got for this role. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is so long, the plot so obvious and the dialogue so available, you can not miss the lame inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes. 800 feet in something the size of TX is less than a pinprick. Walk 800 feet in TX and see how close you are to the center. After all the discussion about artificial gravity on the Russian station, it once seems arbitrary. In fact, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie. Does it make sense that besides Michael Bay, these idiots also give a few shuttles and blow up an asteroid that threatens the Earth? <br /> <br /> The sentimental phone / insurance / cola montages were disgusting. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really. This is boring, stupid and is really in itself. It deserves hatred and contempt because it's all that Hollywood's most expensive efforts have become - a lot of cheap clichés that run from one expensive explosion to the next. Oh yes, the whole thing is permeated by a conservative attitude of Neanderthals over sex, politics and so on.
