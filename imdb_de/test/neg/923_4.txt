When I recently switched to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which caused me to see all episodes of the season, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts. I need reasons to be interested, interested, feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the top I also expected a touch of brilliant comedy moments. This movie has always failed me. <br /> <br /> Jeff lives with Mom, a clumsy sad sack that's a social disaster. He has not had real or even random relationships for many years. He seems mostly unemployed and, as mentioned, his favorite mum. Can things get worse? For sure. Shortly thereafter, he is surrounded by everyone, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All reinforce his "loser" status. Silverman's "fat" experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty" as a means to salvage his career is also in a dead end. <br /> <br /> While the last few moments of the film give an insight into better things for the film journey, albeit with occasional golden shimmer, it was unfortunately missing.
