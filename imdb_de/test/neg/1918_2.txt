Life is too short to waste two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this, unless you are an unsuspecting naiive 16-year-old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better. Boring characters, bad acting (artificial emotions), weak history, slow pace, and above all the flawed existence of these films - nobody cares about the overly dramatic relationship.
