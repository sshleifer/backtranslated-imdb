I took my family to Barnyard last weekend. We were so looking forward to it, but if my children had not been there, my husband and I would have gone. When we came from a farming community, we found the fact that all the male cattle in the movie that drew udders were a bit disturbing. We felt like we were watching cross-dressing cows. It was just strange to hear a male voice from a female body. After reviewing some of the production notes on another website, I felt that the entertainers might have missed that fact. I know this is just an animated, humorous show, but by attaching female body parts to a man, I had to expose my unbelief so much that I could not enjoy the movie as I might have. I know that udders can be funny, but they were definitely overloaded. None of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender-specific body parts, and I would have preferred the bulls on this show if they had the right bulls, if they had to be dressed at all. The kids still enjoyed the movie, though we took the time afterwards to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
