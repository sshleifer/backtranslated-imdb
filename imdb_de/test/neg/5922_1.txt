I mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area could be something else. Unfortunately I Was Wrong There are many issues with "The Falls" that really have nothing to do with low-budget video production. Immediately you have to ask, why all the constant narrative? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow without having to insult yourself with voice-over storytelling. The acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but only contributes to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is annoyingly recorded like an MTV music video, which I found totally unacceptable. The narrative, bad acting and disturbing video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided. - MERK
