Unspeakable starts in Los Angeles. Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) argue in the pouring rain. Jim crashes and Jim crashes. His daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) is dead while Alice is turned into wheelchair-bound vegetables. Shaken by the death of his daughter, Jim begins to visit prostitutes. He then kills her for voices in the head. Um, that's it really. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin. I hate to be unspeakable like movie. There are some movies that you occasionally see and move the "goalposts" in relation to everything you see afterwards. Some movies are so brilliant that everyone else is judged by them, while others like Unspeakable, for example, are so bad that they are set to a new cinematic low. This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am seriously surprised by the overwhelmingly positive comments from the IMDb, although I am not surprised by the low overall rating on the main page. I'm not sure if I missed something For one, Unspeakable has no plot, it has no story, and many things seem almost random. There was nothing unspeakable to maintain or entertain my interest. As a result, it became a test of stamina to get through. The film attempts to shock with some weak scenes of sexual abuse of a torn boy by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person shits himself, she splashes on the floor and her dubious male nurse begins her soiled genitals, hers Feel legs & underwear. If anyone can find such a crap entertaining, I'll cut my wrists now. The characters are among the worst I've had, and the dialogue is hilarious, with some sounding as if it came straight from a dirty dizziness porn of the worst kind. It does not work as a horror, since it's not scary at all is. It's utterly weird and frankly offensive to say it's a serious drama when someone suffers a big loss and tries to cope with it. It's a pointless, lousy, malicious bastard from Troma. <br /> <br /> Director Ferrin films like a badly made documentary, the special effects are terrible and are from the "Let's pour tomato ketchup on our actor's face." The audience will be convinced that they died a bloody death. Apart from a suicide in which someone puts a knife in his mouth, there is no violence whatsoever. Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unspeakable, the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently, Unspeakable had a budget of about $ 20,000 and all I can say is where all the money is went? Oh, a quick note to the filmmakers: If you want to make live sound recordings, make sure your actor does not deliver his lines near a main road that seems to be driving half Los Angeles. Period. <br /> <br /> Unpronounceable in my opinion is total crap. It's probably not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's down here and I can not remember having seen such a horrible movie lately. One to avoid, unless you are a masochist or insomniac.
