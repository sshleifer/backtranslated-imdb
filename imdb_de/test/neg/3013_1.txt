This show is just shit. I do not think I even have to say it or why. Because I already judge by the number of comments, I just repeat everything. Key to the VIP is like turning on the TV and putting Poo on you. it's just as if I'm not exaggerating a bit. These guys are so stupid, not funny, and not smooth with the ladies, that it's not even funny, but it's stupid. I have had four episodes and want two hours back. Where do you find the candidates because they are obviously mentally deficient? If I were the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on TV, I would do the world a favor and jump from the tallest building I could find. How does such a garbage get on TV? especially the comedy network, a show on a so-called comedy network should not be at least a comedy show or be so often funny?
