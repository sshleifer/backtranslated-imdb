Rent this only movie if you feel like laughing (because of stupidity), because this movie would scare a bunch of kindergarten children at a Halloween party! The problem is, there's too much thrills for kids, so do not put this into your toddler video recorder. It starts off with a small promise, giving the impression that the box cover artist actually started this film before the cover design, but then quickly falls into epic stupidity. The "Killer Scarecrows" are awkward fools about as scary as the Wizard of Oz, but not quite as smart. If only they had a brain ...? I got this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / close-out store, and yet I feel a little bit down. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay for it, you can only blame yourself.
