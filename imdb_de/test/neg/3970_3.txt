Parts: The Clonus horror is not as bad as a movie. I have the MST3K version of it on tape and it's weird, but it's still not the worst movie they've ever done. I would go so far as to say it was better than 80% of the movies they made fun of. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money, and decent actors. It could have become a classic if it was not so boring and a bit more exciting. Unfortunately, it was botched in production and landed at MST3K.
