If you are a fan of the original Ten Commandments, this movie will make you cry inwardly. Of course, I am only about half an hour at the moment, but it is so painful that I felt it my duty to warn you of the true Ten Commandments before they are exposed to this bastardization. I did not think it was possible to make the special effects worse than in the 1950s, when the original was shot. However, this 2006 remake proves I'm wrong. I can forgive some lame special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, the melodramatic lifestyle in the film style and the stilted we-are-wax characters come to life and let me hope they rewrite the plot and Moses drown the Red Sea.
