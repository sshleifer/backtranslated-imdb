This was one of the slowest movies I've ever had when I felt uncomfortable. After the introduction, in which we get the backstory of "something" in which a few people in a farmhouse are killed, we are introduced to a white, laid back family who moves to a farm - and nothing happens for a long time. Then they meet this drifter who helps on the farm and nothing happens for a long time. Then FINALLY the girl of the family passed some plotter spirit stuff. Then something more happens, the drifter guy goes crazy and the movie ends. In between, it's all about how this family had to move out because the girl got into trouble at home and has no money, and it's so bad that I could take care of those wretched people. I can not believe that I actually went to the theaters to see that! This movie was not just crap, but also a small hole put out his cell phone, stupid idiots made noise and the movie was shit. THAT'S THEATERS SUCK - Bad movies, overpriced, crappy food and idiots in the theater, I stay from now on and watch DVDs, at least I could smoke when I'm at home watching this stupid movie. Stay home and bake a piece of cake instead of going to a theater to see that typical crap. Stupid stupid crap.
