Now I know that a lot of black humor makes typical black things like gold teeth fun. That does not mean that they are always funny. Do not be a threat, that's an example. The urban film is certainly suitable for satire. The problem is that Wayans and cohorts not only try to satirize the typical "ghetto" culture, but also reject valid statements in urban films like Boyz 'n' the Hood or Menace II Society. I personally think that the creators of this film should turn away from the bowel movements of their white masters. Apart from that, the movie itself is awful. That's not funny at all. The jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the genre of urban film, the filmmakers show their views on the "ignorant" urban (ghetto) blacks. Now there are a few other jokes in this movie, but I think that's the main prize. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is crap and the creators should use their talents to make a constructive comedy / satire movie. You have examples in Men With Black Hats (which was done before this movie) and Friday.
