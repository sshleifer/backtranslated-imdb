It's a space strip, or at least I think that's it. They have received half-naked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station with a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. It's friggin hilarious. The acting is so bad that Space Wuts looks like an Emmy winning movie. The story is simple. Space Prisoner gets the chance to reduce the penalty by investigating a space station that has lost contact with humanity. She finds a doctor who "experiments" with women and an angry alien. She fights against her and so on. It's a movie that makes it easy to moisten your pants with laughter. If you like real sci-fi movies, this is a no-no, but it's a great mood scoreboard for the amateur filmmaker because I can guarantee that their movie is better than this one.
