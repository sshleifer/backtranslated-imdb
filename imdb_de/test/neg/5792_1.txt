This movie hurt my face. I do not understand ... Things just happen inexplicably and they usually cause someone to break into a song and a dance number. I do not understand how people can praise this movie with praise. There are B-movies and then B-musicals, and then Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me run headlong into a wall. The only salvation is that one of the musical explosions proves to be a musical video that alleviates the pain and yet does not justify why it had to exist. The scariest part of the film is Toni Basil's crawl, which accompanies her comic song. On the other hand, she can find the notes she's looking for, unlike the pop music sensations Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say that the sound is deaf. If you want to question life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, buy it.
