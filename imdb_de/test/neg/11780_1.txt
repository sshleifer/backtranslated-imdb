I saw this movie when it was first published in 1986. At that time I was young and enjoyed the normal comedy, d. H. Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech and Chong, therefore, I believe that my judgment is the most "healthy" individuals. <br /> <br /> The absolute best part of this movie was the trailer that was initially played in the movie for the new "My Little Pony" movie that came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was so cruel that it was actually torn from most movie theaters before the first week was over. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that anyone would waste company money on copying that steaming pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money on renting or viewing this "movie".
