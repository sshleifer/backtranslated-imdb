This person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to obscenity, meanness and slander to try to make others believe he has talent. I have often seen that comics have had some effect on everyone, but if anything you can say is related to it, it's a sign of a drugged, distorted mind. I wonder where his twisted and roasted brain will be again in a few years of abuse. Poor man!!! I admit I could not see everything - too stupid for words. The amazing thing is that somebody actually thinks he is a philosopher !!! No wonder self-esteem and decorum are dwindling and perversity is rising. Could it be that the UFC could have been a factor in his subdued brain?
