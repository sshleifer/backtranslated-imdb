Are you kidding me? This is probably the worst amateur movie I have ever seen. The casting was awful, the acting was worse than terrible, and I'm sorry, the guy who had his plate full of food at the picnic speed was somewhere nearby and the demon dung and the chamber pot that was chasing Drew was nothing more than funny. When I heard about the bell-witch, I wanted to believe. I've read some literature about it and thought it sounds like a plausible story is possible. But this movie has just destroyed that. Ric White (director, screenwriter, lead actor, etc.) takes a bit too serious and I think he gives himself a bit more credit than he deserves ... do yourself a favor ... skip it.
