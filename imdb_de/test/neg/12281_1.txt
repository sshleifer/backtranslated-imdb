I had to write a review for this movie based on those who say bloody, non-stop action, great movie. These people obviously watched another movie. Killpoint honestly torn from the word !! I've always waited and waited for this movie to get better and it did not succeed. Some said this movie was brutal and others said bloody, but I can not find any of these adjectives actually appearing in it. I mean, damn it, there are so many scenes where people are shot and there is no blood, it's not even funny! ! I think the best way to go about this is that it would probably have been classified as a PG by the 1984 standards. Now in 2010 there is no doubt that this would be PG. Bad, BAD not in the funny cheesy "B" variety movie !!
