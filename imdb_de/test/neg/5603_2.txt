Pretty. <br /> <br /> Pretty Actresses. Pretty bad script. Pretty common "Let's Strip to our Undies" scenes. Pretty fair F / X. Pretty blatant location decisions (the college dorm looks like a top-notch hotel room - probably because it was shot dead in a hotel). Pretty bland story. Pretty terrible dialogue. Nice locations. Pretty annoying editing, unless you like the flash-cut style for music videos. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad pleasure, but rather an embarrassing one. If you need to see this, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound. They see the pretty people in their black underwear and probably follow the story well. <br /> <br /> The cast may be able to act - I doubt anyone would look smart in the face of the lines / plot he had to deal with.
