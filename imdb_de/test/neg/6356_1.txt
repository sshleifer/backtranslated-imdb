My first question is NOT about the horrible drama, NOT about the awful writing, it's the director. The decisions made in relation to cinematography are some of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Why does EVERY single villain have to die in slow motion? I was about to hit myself with a rubber hose. The camera shots make it so that you can not see what's going on. I was about to turn off the movie because of Jalal Merhi's accent when he joined the sex scene, so I thought he might get better, but not now. If you rate special effects on a rating scale of A, B, C, would I have to set them by a W or something, and did I mention the spectacle? Wow, it was bad !!! And the BAD part of the entire "Expect to DIE" experience is the obvious misuse of the phrase on the cover: "THE MATRIX IS ONLY DEADLIER". Comparing this movie with the Matrix is ​​easily the WORST Comparison I've ever seen. If you have not seen this movie, do not do it unless you are looking for a good reason to hit your head against the wall.
