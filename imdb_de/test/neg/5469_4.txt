The professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and forced to have sex on many days of three hooded women. On his release, the director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him and his girlfriend receives him coldly. The distraught and humiliated Daniel leaves the dance company and travels to find the kidnappers. Daniel has sex with many women whom he suspects may be the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation" is a comic film with a promising beginning that loses its initial power and becomes a sort of too-long erotic soap opera or soft porn chic. The production is stylish, the cover of the DVD is fantastic, but the characters are not well developed and the trauma of Daniel seems to be exaggerated, as most men would fantasize about the dream situation he had submitted. become the sexual object of three sexy women. The melodramatic development with Isabel's disease adds no value to the action; The open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title. It is very clear that the script about the feelings of a man was written by a woman. It was nice to see the still beautiful Greta Scacchi and her make-up in the end is impressive. There is a saying in Portuguese that can be translated into English as follows: "If the rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should have done that and kept me from seeing nearly two hours of a pointless story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" ("The Book of Revelations")
