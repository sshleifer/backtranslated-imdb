Bugsy Siegel was 31 years old when he went to the West Coast. In addition to his dreams of Las Vegas he played with the idea of ​​acting. He was a handsome guy and about 7 years younger than his friend George Raft, so it was not a crazy idea. Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this film and despite the hair color he is too old for this part. Beatty was miscast; Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy who was feared by his contemporaries; Beatty just does not emit a threat. <br /> <br /> This was a vanity project for Beatty who has not come to terms with the fact that he is no longer a leading man. <br /> <br /> The other big annoying abuse is Mantegna as George Raft. Raft had a pronounced voice and behavior that Mantegna does not even try to achieve. It is never believed that Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford both worked through massive use of hair dye years ago, and now it's suddenly a shock to go gray and play characters.
