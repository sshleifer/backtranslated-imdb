The Kite Runner began as one of those "important" films that most people play because they are told that if they want to belong to the elite, they have to be downgraded to an idiotic film of absurd absurdity. <br /> <br /> I have never read the book and have never felt the need because I honestly do not care. Sure, I'm uninformed because I said it, but I really have no interest in copying just one more "pull on your heart, on all other storylines, to get emotions out of the reader's novel," even though it does plays in Afghanistan br /> <br /> That means I've watched the movie. I heard good things about his beauty and how touching it was and decided why not? As it turned out, there was a very good reason why not. The so-called main character was not only completely unsympathetic (I understand he was young and this is a movie about salvation, but frankly he was terrible.) I hated him and not in this good 'antihero' way he was just a stupid, idiotic, selfish character I did not feel anything about), but the rest of the story was so absurd that I could not believe how everyone else thought about how beautiful he was and how he cried and moved her. I'm sorry, but I just feel moved by something that feels realistic. It is well known that sci-fi moves me, even the imagination ... but that? You're welcome. This surpasses many other films out of sheer absurdity! My biggest guy, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you did not tear that off from a thousand other stories? Positive that this particular treat has not only helped to try to bring more tears to your audience (do you know what kind of people are looking for reasons to cry during a movie)? I rolled my eyes as this "twist" became known as I knew it could only go down from there (not to mention Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother") NO, that's not true, that's IMPOSSIBLE ! ") Oh, and it definitely did. Filled with stereotypes to the brim and just stupid storytelling planned. Like "Good guy miraculously escapes bad guy with all adversity with the help of a spunky kid who, despite malevolent habit and no idea who you are, is ready to help with a practical weapon that has a special meaning for you". Oh, and do not forget the oh-so-idiotic "At last revenge on the kid who upset you when you were little, who turned into a psychopathic adult" (trust me guys, I understand that you like acting through movies But this will never happen, you know that kid who upset you in high school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) Oh, and I have to mention the CGI dragons! I think that was at the level of "Matrix" movies and "Transformers" bravo you guys! BRAVO! <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie was only made for western viewers who have a reason to be interested in the Middle East (hey, an overly emotional friendship story will work!) This is one of the flattest movies I had the misfortune to see, it is so deep ... but if you deal with it exactly, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of the American public will do what they want. tell and follow the "It's about controversial material, so it must be good!" Way of thinking.
