I'm not sure what to say about this movie. It's definitely not the worst in the series (there is still "Halloween 3"). The style is just different and focused on other elements than its predecessor. An attempt is made to explain why Michael Myers freaks out on Halloween and starts skipping around. Well, all that stuff about Michael Myers being cursed and the evil cult was a pretty nice effort, but I did not buy it. None of the other parts of the series has attempted to provide any outlandish explanations. <br /> <br /> The film contains a lot of gore. Actually, it's just a carnage. If you have not seen the other Halloween movies, you will probably like it for its blood content. But for a real Halloween freak, this sequel may be too different to be considered good. The tension has been transformed into terror and carnage (exploding heads ..., you understand the point). <br /> <br /> The end (theater cut) is just awful. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then beaten with a pipe, then stabbed again with these needles, then beaten up a little more, until mud runs out of his head (where does this green stuff come from?) Basically, it's nothing more than trash worth $ 5 million. <br /> <br /> But there was one good thing: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance dedicated, a shame. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
