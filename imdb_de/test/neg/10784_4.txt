The orientation of feminism in the Western style to the various subcultures of India has remained largely non-existent. The two entities that belong to the alien realms and threaten (in the name of tradition) never to collapse. Art imitates life (as the claim goes), and popular Hindi cinema is no exception as it reflects an underlying misogyny that unfortunately forms the basis of many of the collective Indian culture. But why? What about the female gender that has hated culture so that women are regularly exposed to the most unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, infanticide, forced illiteracy, infidelity, and the subjugation of the spirit called "Spirit"? Dowry'? Rajkumar Santoshi's recent offer "Lajja" raises the same plaintive question by linking the atrocities against women in three separate chapters / episodes embracing the voyage of her protagonist Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). The direction of Santoshi is not up to par that requires history. He fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity to portray the story of sadness and confronts the problem of misogyny from the side rather than from the beginning. Santoshi recently said he did not make the film for an international film festival, but for the masses of his country. Sadly, the stickiness is showing, and the film often interferes with the action blood gore genre that Santoshi specializes in. The film suffers from its jerky, episodic tempo, and its ending is too thoughtful. <br /> <br /> The female cast gets much friendlier and rounder characterizations than her male counterparts. The protagonist is sensitively played by the brilliantly beautiful Manisha Koirala, who proves in Lajja that she is one of the most competent leading actresses of our time, and when she plays a proper role and set-up, she performs with a truly commendable performance. One wonders how brilliantly she might have blushed if the film had been shot by a director with the appropriate creative intent and appreciation of the problem at hand. Mahima Choudhary shows a commendable performance and continues to show that she is an unrivaled talent. Madhuri Dixit plays as Janki and performs with a never before seen fervor and bliss, which really deserves the name "drama". The role of a street smart performer consoled in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child poses the greatest threat to their cannon in playing song and dance roles, their tent status over the last decade have maintained. What leaves the last and most disturbing performance in this well-feminist saga, that of the incessantly gifted Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film, there can be no doubt about that, but it is Rekha who dominates the acts in a performance that digs into the bones and sends echoes of terror through the avenues of your heart. Rekha shines as ramdulari and renounces vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so authentic and imaginative that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of that part of the film. Comparisons are indeed abhorrent, especially when juxtaposed with one of the great protagonists of the world, but in the graceful presence of this reigning screen legend, the others fade in their shadows. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" has no subtlety of protofeminist dramas like "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar" or even the Hell Queen celebration "Laadla": she fulfills her feminist goals in two early moments: the loud tirade, In the Mahima, her in-laws are being abused for her abuse. Her father, who has committed no other crime than to give birth to a girl. She breaks out and leaves the wedding train in ruins. When she sees her father devastated, she begins to cry and blames herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She complains, "Why did I say something, I ruined everything, it's all my fault!" Her grandmother, who is a silent witness to the abuse, comforts her by saying, "Why are you crying, there is no reason for you to cry, you are not to blame for anything, the guilt is mine before you, because if we had the courage to say in our day's time what you said today, today you would not have had any need to say anything. "In this scene, the meaning of the feminist heritage is made clear through words brought into sight. <br /> <br /> The other, more subtle moment occurs very early in the film, when Vaidehi (Manisha) fled from her abusive husband to the US resort to her childhood home in India. For spectators of Western societies, it may seem reasonable that every abused woman seeks the protective guardianship of her parents; However, this is a social taboo in many eastern cultures, including India. Once a woman is married, she assumes the identity of her husband and personal assets (family, business, children, etc.). For her it is a serious social sin to turn her back on an equivalent for the western woman. It is then considered stained and "damaged goods" whose value has been completely removed by their own actions and their refusal to submit to their role. She is not so much an individual, but a symbol of family honor. Her father reprimands her for her actions, worried that his family honor will be irretrievably marred by the daughter he had already given to another man. His main concern is the upcoming marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a prospect far less likely to be with a divorced older daughter in the same household. He tells her to return to the man she legally belongs to, even though he is so violent and sadistic. He charges against them the age-old adage: "The honor of every house lies in the hands of his daughter." Quietly and thoughtfully, she answers, "Yes, the honor of every house is in the hands of his daughter, but the daughter herself has no honor."
