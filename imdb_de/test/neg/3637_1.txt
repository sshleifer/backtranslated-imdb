For every fan of Nickelodeon watching the network in the '80s and' 90s, there was always something good going on. They had entertaining acts like You Can not Do on TV. You had strange but good shows like Pete & Pete. They even had cartoons teaching morals like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon went down the drain, limiting its demographic development to flat Preteens and offering us bad excuses for new, innovative shows. When I tried to see Zoey 101, I just shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The setting could not be more fake than this one. Each character visits a boarding school called the Pacific Coast Academy and offers everything a spoiled child desires. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to rest in, etc. The kids on this show are rarely seen in class and there seem to be no proper teachers. It looks more like a place to spend a nice summer vacation than work and study while you prepare for college. Each episode consists of boy problems, situations they themselves have caused, and problems that should be resolved. Every character is a clich√©. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems to be perfect in everything she does, and each of her friends asks her for help if they feel they are in danger. Just get them to have no other side. I went through school and I can tell you that nobody is like that. Chase is stupid. Logan plays the arrogant, tough guy. Quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic about what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is good, a tough person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique to these characters and different from other personalities? Is stereotype the best the creators of this show can do? Instead, these actors are boring personalities with the feeling that creativity is lacking in their roles. There is nothing here to marvel at or surprise. Not only that, but the show is clearly designed for the purpose of targeting children in adolescence, who are looking for a phase in which they must develop out of a child to be an adult. During this time, they must learn to self-learn, make their own choices and do the right thing for them. Zoey 101 contains none of these values. In this case, we should believe that it is good to look good and have a stereotypical personality to succeed. I'm sorry, but that's just not true. People can not expect things to be handed over to them, as the actors in the show are, and just let those things sit there. If I assume that things happen in Zoey 101 in real life, I would live in a fantasy world locked in a dream home. Nothing in this show refers to those who have health and money problems. It also does not refer to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> In summary, Zoey 101 is a show by Nickelodeon that is flat in the face. It shows a terrible message for kids, and I think very much that the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, it does not have any morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. A terrible show and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage Nickelodeon has made in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
