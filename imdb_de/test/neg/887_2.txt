To be honest, I have not seen this movie for many years, but the few times I tend to remember parts of it will be understood by anyone who has seen it. It was the first time I saw it as a kid at a YMCA Halloween party in the early 1960s, and it chased hell out of kids, in a funny way. I remember feeling genuine concern about the unknown in the maze. I can not risk giving the end away, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. I vaguely remember that the entire audience of young boys had let out a big scream of fear, followed by laughter as the terrible secret was revealed. The ending was seen by most viewers as one of the most unintentionally hilarious highlights of a movie in film history, yet strangely moving in a way. You have to see for yourself what is not easy these days. I do not know if it's available as a home video or not, but it would still be a great Halloween feature for kids and adults.
