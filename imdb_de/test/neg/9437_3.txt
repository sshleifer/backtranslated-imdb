This is one of the coolest TV shows in a long time. Jose Ferrer played the title character Nemo. He did justice to the part and looked the part safe. But now I realize that the Nemo he was made of seemed more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye from the commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was drowned out by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to overcome his "penguin days" of Batman. Although he does not "chat" his penguin here, he is a crazy professor with no parallel. Only John Colicos of Battlestar Galactica knew the landscape better than a crazy despot. <br /> <br /> I can never remember what the grudge between Nemo and Cunningham was, but it must have been hard, because Prof I never missed a chance to try Nemo, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The effects were nothing special, although the submarine of Prof. Cunningham looked much better than Nemo's. There was also a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians who served Cunningham and did all his bidding. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the entire show was the secret weapon of Prof. Cunningham. The delta ray! He always said "Fire Delta Beam!", Whereupon a fishy crew man terribly overruled the movement of firing the weapon with a shoulder shrug. Really priceless! They do not do it that way anymore, and maybe they do it well. But like other series of that time, for those who remember it will always have a loving, albeit cheddar-covered, place in our hearts.
