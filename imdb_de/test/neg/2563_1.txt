Steven Seagal starred in many action films. Most of them were bad, but not bad as The Patriot. This is a Z-series action-low budget movie. After Operation Delta Force, Warfare, Substitute 2, Plato Run, Base, Ride, Sabotage, etc., the Patriot arrives. Steven Seagal is sure to be considered a bad actor, like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe because of the very bad actors) and the $ 4.25 you spend by renting The Patriot is called Lost Money !!! I give him a half (for laugh) of 5.
