As a longtime Steve Martin fan, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a clich√© script. The scriptwriter must have just borrowed a few videos and taken a piece and a piece here - it's certainly the least imaginative film I've seen in a long time - I knew exactly what would happen so quickly in any scene started. The African-American stereotypes and slave references are also pretty offensive. The worst thing for me, however, was to see Martin in a movie without a joke. He is probably one of the smartest actors and here he was totally sold out. He has to stay behind to be in such a lame effort.
