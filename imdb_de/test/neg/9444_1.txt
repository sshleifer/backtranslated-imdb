Ed Wood, perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time, has left us gems that are so bad that they are rejoicing, unintentionally funny, and therefore charming and innocent. James Lay and his financiers (Mom and Dad) As the epilogue says, Dreamland made a movie that was made as bad as any other Ed Wood movie, but without any charm or innocence the only good thing about this 90-minute waste of time is the certainty that James Lay and his fellows will never change their minds again. <br /> <br /> I have to mention some of the dramatic things that some of the crew needed, to avoid being associated with this horrible image, I'm sure the production controller, after seeing the finished movie, demanded that their name be changed to "Donna Snartlebutt" and "Brutus." Man can imagine "Brutus" with his role of 5-dollar bills, which the crew paid at the end of a day's shooting. <br /> <br /> I will not face the many technical issues with this pathetic little vid I should mention a few comments, but I have some comments that compare this slag with the work of David Lynch. You know you turned out to be a real stinker when you log your mother into the IMDb and post such an amazing BS - no one but violent mental patients could mistake 'dreamland' for 'anything' from Lynch. What a terrible grievance against Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Go back to film school, Mr. Lay.
