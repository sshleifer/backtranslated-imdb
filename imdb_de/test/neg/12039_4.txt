They prove that if the cops can not find the REAL offenders, they will always accuse the parents and blame them for the sexual abuse of their children. In these films, the press is always portrayed as a bunch of animals, and the parents are brought in out of court to quell the hunger of the press to humiliate grief. Has anyone heard of a back door of a courthouse in these films? Here you have a clairvoyant who tells you exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but the police are not informed and no one is aware of his findings. The police are portrayed as a fool who does not know what they are doing, and there is always an outside detective, like Ed Asner, who comes late, believing in the parents and solving the puzzle. <br /> <br /> After the parents are cleared, they also can not spit in the faces of the stupid policemen who are taking them to jail, taking their child away and accusing them of killing their own child. <br /> <br /> It looked like I had seen this movie MANY times before.
