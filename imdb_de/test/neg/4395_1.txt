Worthless movie. A complete waste of time and nothing that I expected. The packaging makes it look as if it came from the American Pie genre (it is not). Rather, it's a ridiculous juxtaposition of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise (let's see how many mix-ups we can turn a bad SNL sketch into a complete feature presentation). It is noteworthy that the directors (because of their comment on the DVD) take themselves completely seriously. I was a big fan of the films that give National Lampoon its name, to Van Wilder. With this I feel completely cheated. In fact, I feel deceived. I was expecting a Van Wilder farce that would re-live my college days, but instead one and a half hours of garbage was served. What has led to my ultimately unfulfilled expectations? Well, for starters, the fact that the actors all appear naked (with a huge sausage covering what needs to be covered) on the cover of the DVD. Add the pictures on the back of the case and the description and you make people think this is a movie it's not. To make matters worse, the movie begins, as one might expect, when half-naked, drunken college students faintly try a photo-stunt, but in the end, it has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, I did not even know that the people in this opening sequence should be the characters of the movie until the directors in the commentary said so. Do not get me wrong, I love plot twists and am surprised by movies, but I hate the fact that this movie is trying to show what it is not. Ultimately, it makes itself a huge disadvantage (artistically, though most likely not financially) because it challenges its audience to confusion and disappointment, simply because it neglects what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, do not lend this movie based on what you see in the case. It's not an ordinary National Lampoon movie. The only funny thing is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other films and TV shows that make their engagement entertaining.
