This is one of those movies that I see every time he walks, not because I like it, but because it's so bad, I can not take my eyes off it (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland") , The first time I watched, I waited and waited and laughed until I could laugh. I did not get my chance until about three-quarters through the movie as they undress the harassing policemen of their underwear and handcuff them in the park in a flattery. In addition, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their mishaps and missteps are not funny ... in summary, it's not a very funny movie! Not even on slapstick level! And what about the reggae soundtrack? It's a movie about two white garbage agents and the music is all reggae. Seems out of place, right? If you like a good train wreck, this is for you. If you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
