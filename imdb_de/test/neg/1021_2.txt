Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good celluloid and actor efforts. A formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on its promise, which this movie does not do. It's an annoying mix of film clich√©s that can be traced back to a thousand different films from the past. It's full of random and empty storefiles that add nothing but aimless actions, like a protagonist's journey to a ghost town where the villains (inexplicably) follow them. This was obviously meant as an excuse for a shooting and escape scene bordering on the absurd borders with people leaping in the doorways and running past windows as they fire each other with pistols. It is believed that someone told Becket that there is a ghost town in the Chilean foothills, and he said, "Oh, great, let's shoot a scene there." Do not even waste your rental money on this. It's a bunch of random trifles from a hundred different films called action drama.
