This is a lousy movie, a pretext for a genre of surprise movies. And a genre that has been done so much better. The plot lags with predictable end. (Yawning) The characters are unlikely and some are so unlikely that they are almost unbeatable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor, is totally wrong here and stiff and dizzy. The others are forgotten. A big part of the dialogue is Sophomoric, again a show-off who tries to be funny. I would not hire the scriptwriter to write my shopping list. Yes, it is so bad, it goes from misogyny to simple coarse, as in a hatchery. With so much talent out there, I'm really surprised that this movie was ever made. It shows the complete lack of imagination of office suits ...
