Solo begins as a team of US soldiers travel to Soth America to blow up a rebel airfield. A robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) that can use any weapon ever made is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human being. However, something goes awry & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians, about which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not happy when he was back in the base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be closed and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main instructions is self-preservation, so he decides to flee to the South American jungle, where Colonel Madden and his men are sent there to retake it ... This Mexican American coproduction was by director Norberto Barba and you have to say, solo is terrible. The screenplay by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason. It is a clich√© after another. Robots were popular when solo was produced in Hollywood and at the box office. Such is the rupture of solo as Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two Terminator flicks, as well as the same basic attitude as Predator (1987). This is the usual nonsense about an emotionless robot that develops a sense of humanity near people. At first, he does not know what a joke is or why someone is interested in another, but in the end, he develops emotions and begins to make friends, sounds to me Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The characters are poor. In particular, Colonel Madden has absolutely no motivation to hate Solo and why he would kill other US soldiers and follow disobedient orders to destroy the soldier. You know, I saw that on cable TV last night for free (thank god, I did not spend any money on that). I looked it up in the TV program and you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a "terrible sci-fi action with Mario Van Peebels," which, when I think about it, is a perfect description of solo. With less than ten words, my TV Guide hit the nail on the head. I mean, it's a sci-fi action movie that certainly stars Mario Van Peebles and it's definitely bleak. Actually enough said. <br /> <br /> Director Barba does not do anything special here. The action scenes are really exciting and the sci-fi elements are virtually none apart from the fact that solo is a robot. So the military is sent to Solo & Colonel Madden to recapture it? I'm not funny, but would not the military have installed a self-destruct mechanism in Solo if that happened? At least, Solo would have had a tracking device inside, so the military could at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not funny, but these people can come up with a walking robotic soldier, but they're not smart enough to realize that a tracking or self-destruct device can be useful if something goes wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes, but that's really pretty weak stuff. Technically, the film looks good and is made competent, it was actually filmed in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action film Agent Red (2000) worked on solo material in this film. Acting is miserable, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot ... William Sadler deserves better, it was only a few years before he appeared in the fantastic Die Hard 2 (Die Harder) (1990) stared. <br /> Solo is a really bad sci-fi action movie that is basically a huge rip-off of Hollywood budget sci-fi action movies like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator. Not recommended and I'll start and pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing movies to watch ...
