In a year when "Singin 'in the Rain" and "High Noon" were released, this overcrowded turkey somehow won the Oscar for Best Picture. Half of the movie is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both seem overkill, though they are a model of restraint compared to the annoying Hutton. Hutton plays a selfish trapeze artist and acts like an overzealous student in a badly produced school piece. Grahame is the only actor to do a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, just a lengthy spectacle, no matter how boring.
