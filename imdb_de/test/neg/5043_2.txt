This movie is like a porn with all the good parts removed. It's like all the pornstars who did not want to bundle their obligations around this dreadful, banal, useless piece of Gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> This is a helpful movie if you are in the mood to torture a beloved (or no longer beloved) person. If you choose to use this film as a torture method, you should use earplugs and blindfolds so you do not go mad. <br /> <br /> If I had the choice between this movie and The 700 Club ... I would choose Girls Gone Wild. <br /> <br /> Overall, better if you have been drinking. But only because it becomes a game of epic proportions.
