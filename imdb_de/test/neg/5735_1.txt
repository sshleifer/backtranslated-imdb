sdiner82 had clearly not seen the movie for decades, and his memory is appalling. His attempts to label Mark Lester's shaving scene as suspect are completely wrong, as are his incorrect comments about the villain who "sneaks into the child's body." Lester is dressed the entire time the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a look. <br /> <br /> The scene is a crude attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body. <Br /> <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's done badly, but not anymore. <br /> <br /> Also the comments of sdiner82 about Savalas' character that accidentally "killed a German family" by shaking their follower's cliff "is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead and was in a car). <br /> <br /> I suggest sdiner82's report says far more about his own, far from liberal thinking, than about this worthless movie. <br / > <br /> The only reason I ever bothered to check it was out of curiosity about whether it was done before or after Kojak. <br /> <br /> The film is a worthless piece of garbage from the 70s But sdiner's review is the worst slander, he sums up his review with pseudo-intellectual "facts," but the only fact is that he's clearly wrong about almost every "matter-of-fact" issue he's discussing assume that sdiner82 has seen exactly what he is looking for te, which is disturbing. Now he can return with the burning of Catcher in the rye.
