I recently watched Shame, directed by Ingmar Bergman. The movie was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also in black and white. These traits allowed me to better deal with the characters, the period and their stories. I did not like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and you did not know what was really going on. At first it was mainly a story of Eva and Jan's relationship. The film also ended in a very depressing mood, as nothing good came out of all the conflicts and changes throughout the movie. I probably would not visit Shame again, but it was a very cultivated experience.
