This movie is really bad. The hero can not play. You see too much that he memorized his walking movements. And believe me, he walks a lot. Nothing happens for 45 minutes. He just goes to places and gets out ..... As if the story was so brief that she had to expand it with useless and boring "look like a Susens" scenes. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are very bad. I counted a lot of "hello" and a few "hold" on the first part. <br /> <br /> Blood is orange like Mercurochrome, which you apply to children's blisters. And scenes do not follow. A bloody neck in one scene, a clean neck in the following. <br /> <br /> The story could have been improved. Yeah, I mean, what the hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial Arts? From where? Is this martial art? Watch how hesitant and slow the movements are !!!!! When kicking and getting hit, martial arts are called. Then I'm Bruce Lee. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I've found is combat scenes: you do not play with zoom and switch quickly from scenes that cause headaches in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many low budget movies that are great. That was just to earn money. Nothing else.
