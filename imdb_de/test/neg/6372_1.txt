I've been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 70's and have always enjoyed the character that's far from the average pure hero and his many different enemies. There were no less than three attempts at animated series for Iron Man, and only the original and part of the second series have ever lived up to their character. So I was confident that this latest version would be good. Boy, I was wrong! The DVD art is very misleading and shows a picture that is not the movie. Torch off good, which is little there ... The art and animation are well drawn and writing and dialogue are generally good, albeit with exceptions. Character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well played. Now for the bad ... Unfortunately, the authors have decided to totally deal with both the origin of Iron Man and the Mandarin. In addition, they chose Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes her almost as bad as live actors in a cartoon. The CG work is often repetitive, and sometimes blatant abbreviations are taken. The CG battles are also awkward, further enhancing the fact that CG and line animation are not well mixed. The movie would certainly have gone better if they had decided to actually draw all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in a traditional red and gold suit for a fight! And it's not even the big fight in the end. All this pulls the movie down and it's never resumed. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) CAN FOLLOW ************ * <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an interestingly unusual stop-motion credit sequence of machines, welding and gears. Then we are introduced to you, which looks like a Chinese temple being restored, and prominently a statue of what fans will recognize as Mandarin. Things are going on strangely, hindering the progress of temple restoration. It's James Rhodes, Tony Stark's longtime friend. Apparently, they plan to actually raise the temple from the ground, although a group is resisting that the erection of the temple will bring about a terrible catastrophe. Rhodes is caught in a raid. Stark, who is shown in a hot tub with a pretty lady, is being briefed on the issues and wants to personally monitor the project and rescue his friend while his dad in the background is dealing with board members who are working to remove Tony. Tony just comes to ambush his armored escort and blow it to pieces. Tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. He is saved only by swift action from Rhodes and a scientist. At some point Stark has to build the prototype of a gray cast iron armor and makes an escape good, but only after some loss of life. The rebels meet a disturbed girl named Li Mei, and the two fall in love. The temple is raised and four elementals (all in CG) appear and begin to gather hidden rings of power. Strong and Rhody find problems at home, but can face the elementals without really having to stop them. First the Aquatic Armor, then the more classic red and gold armor. Eventually everything returns to the temple and Stark is back in the bulky gray armor For a final showdown and a run with what might be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG). Here the story takes a big turn, as it turns out that the Mandarin needs a host body to manifest itself. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle, which is marred by the fact that the Mandarin is little more than a ghost and can only be seen in the last 5 minutes of the film. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Iron Man fan, you probably will not enjoy this excursion. And non-fans may also find the film a bit poor or not.
