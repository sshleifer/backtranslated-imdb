Yes, my summary tells everything. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, try it. But not for pleasure. For studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family-oriented and at the same time "cool". The men always think they know everything, are stupid and finally the great women. Etc. This is especially offensive if all characters are just as horrible and stereotypical. I mean, okay, "Cody" used to be funny, but unlike other "stupid characters" like Woody in Cheers or Joey in Friends, he does not get good lines. His stupidity is "duude" occupied, which is quite annoying after some time. <br /> <br /> The family morale is terrible. Everything for the family. Mother and father are supreme dictators who constantly say between heavy punishment and long-standing education that they "love" their children, and in the end they like to be "barf" by the children again. <br /> <br /> And: There is always a "tender spot" as it is squeezed into the "action" where the (c) (tm) moral education is imposed on the viewers via sex (in a mature person You Can not Have Sex Before You Are 18 (!!) Or Drugs Even church habits are described here in detail The whole concept is directly ill, all made in a half-hearted way to make money If there are people like Karen and Frank gives it, please lock it in and disintegrate the key. <br /> <br /> So, with issues that go as far as rebellious religious propaganda, I think it's just as conclusive as my theme. ..
