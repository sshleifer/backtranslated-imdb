First of all, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. This may make you see it, but it is not bad. It is boring, implausible, badly shot, ridiculously scripted and lacks cool disaster effects. Worse still, it's very patriotic, with no trace of irony or fun that stirs in a sense of Japanese uniqueness and sacrifice. Everyone leaves the Japanese in their hour of need. Especially the Koreans. The noblest characters choose Seppaku - they go down with their ship when their beloved island sinks. "Only Japanese would think so," says the Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If this film in any way reflects the Japanese opinion of their place in the world view, they should first fix the problem of making films like this.
