Bronson took the money and ran with this movie; he must have house payments like me! This low-budget movie made in Mexico reminds me of a few Italians who stink of seas. I heard I do not know if that's true, but companies make these films overseas for tax purposes. I think that because otherwise they should do this movie, it was certainly not money to make. We had a lot of these Canadian stinkers because the government gave tax breaks to start a movie industry. I wonder if it was worth it in other countries like Canada. Anyway, back to the subject, this movie is downright flawed in every way, I think they've got Charles Bronson packing to sell that stinker; This corpse looks very fake at the end. 3.10
