What a gigantic pile of evil-smelling actions! Gods, where to start? <br /> <br /> Well, mix crap that makes a bloody woman who talks as if she either a) painfully chews on some ice cubes or b) I just woke up after undergoing some extensive root canal surgery ), an adaptation that seems to donate that the celluloid has been cut and spliced ​​by using an angle grinder, some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts action, a script that has been allegedly written by a biennial and some of the most disgusting and obtrusive background music, which has ever been used for a movie and prestige, you have Death Machines (aka The Ninja Murders) (though this surprise, surprise, there is actually no Ninja to find in this damn travesty!) <br /> <br /> If it was summed up, if there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly severe attack of dysentery, then this must be sic herlich be the case! Avoid at all costs!
