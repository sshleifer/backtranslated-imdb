Make the fourth theatrical release (of which National Lampoon has renounced its name) like a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once proud franchise. Painless and unsurpassed ... even for a TV movie! The cousin Eddie character has become increasingly less amusing, from the original vacation, when it was fresh and unique, over Christmas vacations, when he was getting too thin, to Vegas Vacation, where it was actually annoying to appear on the screen (but To be fair, there were a lot of things that were annoying on the screen in this movie!). But this attempt to bring the character into lead status is unfortunate, to say the least. The Vacation movies themselves had an ugly death in Las Vegas, and that hope of reviving even the thinnest thread of the television series was completely misguided. Chevy Chase and his company put together a great trilogy when he was in bloom; Now we just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (A little note: The original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses, including Juliette Lewis) - returns to the role 20 years later. You just have to wonder ... WHY? )
