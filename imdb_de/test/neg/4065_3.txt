I've seen three other films that are worse than this, "Outerspace Plan 9," "Side Hackers," and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project." There are so many technical flaws in this movie that the movie, despite a decent plot, simply does not represent credibility. <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between the cars. The killer walks over behind his victim as he moves from car to car and simply pushes her out of the train. In a scene, a murderer sneaks into a woman's apartment. He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her. What is he doing? He turns on her stereo! If I heard that my stereo suddenly became louder, I would be worried. He kills the women by throwing an electric curler into the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric curler with a five-foot cord could be thrown ten feet. In addition, the apartment looked modern enough to have earth outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the most well-known commercial airliners in the world, so I really loved it. First, the cockpit was not even near a real 747, and second, it was not on the upper deck of the plane. I watched in amazement as the pilot and copilot (where was the flight engineer?) Passed right by the spiral staircase and came to the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised that the bullets I would not penetrate an aluminum trolley (good thing for our hero) or bathroom doors, but penetrate the ceiling and cause a fuel leak that leaks through a small hole in the fuselage , Huh Seeing three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> I did not look. Was this a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.
