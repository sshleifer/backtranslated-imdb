The Good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and he has proven it in "Man on the Moon" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But what can an actor do without a good story and directing? He can do "number 23". <br /> <br /> The Bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is poor, overrated director and he has proven it in almost every movie he made. What he did to Batman is a disaster, but probably Batman movies should look good. Well, they did not do it. Instead of Gothic and Macabre, we got Disneyland. Sure, "Falling Down" was great, but can you ruin the movie with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with an excellent script? No you can not. <br /> <br /> And so, good actor and poor director finally met and made "Number 23" ... <br /> <br /> The Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> Das I know it's stupid at first, but ... Fingerling's subplot (almost half of the movie) looks just like the intro of another chapter by Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, quality of the detective story itself, quality of the characters, even colors, mood and music, editing and sound mixing too! Maybe it works for the game, but not in the cinema. <br/> <br /> Mise en scene is so bad that it gets funny. It is not even annoying. Carrey reads down the stairs in the park? Why? Of course it's no, but it looks good. Why did suicide blond cover walls in her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in it, but it still looks good. Guess what it is, it does not look good at all. It looks unnatural instead. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Why is that? Who cares, let's continue with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this fingerling? Private view of suicide? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Scenes in which Walter Sparrow deals with his wife for the weather book are really the best part of this movie. Instead we get Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors has no indication that people live in it, except for the significant objects (shoes, photos, etc.). Good luck. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are not that bad. But what about V.O.? Well, that's another story. "There is no destiny, there are only different choices." Captain obviously to the rescue! "The number came after Fingerling and now she came after me". Cliche. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that an average housewife breaks into a public building in the middle of the night. Successful and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> The dog's subplot pulling the main character to the cemetery. This is an old trick and so pleasant for the writer that it should be banned. I'm serious! <br /> <br /> Flashbacks and similar edits like "What happened in the last episode of X-Files" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. Is that it? <br /> <br /> I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but not. That makes no sense. In chronological order, is weak and unbelievable. The whole time we've caught undeveloped characters is a chain of situations that are nothing but badly written fiction. That might be fun, but since the whole movie is absolutely serious, it's not like that. Too many coincidences is just bad for any story. And the "secret"? It is predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Losing touch with reality is a great topic for a good movie, but I've never seen that in Hollywood's productions. If you are interested in the topic, just look at Polanski's "Repulsion" or something from David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History Of Violence". Both films deal with similar problems that "Number 23" wanted to show. Wanted, but failed
