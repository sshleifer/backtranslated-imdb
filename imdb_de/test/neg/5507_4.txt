Jesus Franco is pretty happy or missing in his films, and I would say that this was a miss, that is, unless you are totally excited. I'll say that the man has an eye for a good shot, even if it's topless women with machine guns that are suspended against the sea. This is quite ridiculous on the whole, and acting is terrible, but acting is the least of what it's about. And what is it about? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women are picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and they're about as sloppy as you can stand, and maybe some. Most Notable (?) Is a scene involving a young woman tied to a chair and an apparently in love German Shepherd, and although what happens is (fortunately) implied, it is probably a scenario that I could do without. I would rank this with Tender Flesh as one of the Franco films that I would rather not have in my collection, though the music is jazzy and funny. 4 out of 10, yecch.
