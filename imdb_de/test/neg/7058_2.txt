When I was about 13 years old, I was lucky enough to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish series of really cheesy stuff. This was the kindest thing I've ever had - but I guess I sold it, too bad. Well, what to write ... Better than "Manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it's definitely worth an hour and a half, as it was done by people who wanted to do it. Acting is not terrible compared to some other '80s garbage - in fact I like the old man, even if he does not seem so Indian to me. But I guess you can not have everything ... do yourself a favor and look ...
