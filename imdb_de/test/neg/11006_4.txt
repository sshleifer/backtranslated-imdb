Director John Madden of Shakespeare in Love Fame gives us another pretty bad movie in Ethan Frome. At the center of the plot is a new reverend who comes to the town of Starkfield, where he learns about the story of the miserable Ethan Frome and the once romantic trick with the maid. The film was adapted by Richard Nelson of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edith Wharton. This film is not interesting, not least because of a very bad script and a bad orientation that makes scenes that are supposed to be poignant, a ridiculous Schmaltz. Other than the film, there are other aspects - the cinematography is well done, Rachel Portman is a good scorer, and while no one is at his best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well. Overall, Ethan Frome, however, makes limited sense and is easily forgotten.
