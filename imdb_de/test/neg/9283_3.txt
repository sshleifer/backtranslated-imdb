Anthony Wong plays the lead role in this as well as in the original (far superior) Untold story, but the similarities stop there. Obviously, Wong does not play his role and instead plays a raving policeman who deals with a rather suspicious woman, Fung (1994 Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun), who is a damn madman. But her tame jealousy, "Want to be with a man who is with a girl," is not a killer as obvious as what Wong played in the first one. The movie itself looks tired and tired of the numbers. Yeung Fan, as an unfaithful girl of physcho love interest, tries to protect herself from total boredom by struggling whenever possible, and Sun has a nice butt, but even that can not save this guy: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD Extras: Subtitled Interviews with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong filmography; a very short overview; Trailer for the film; & Followers for "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
