Anyone who complains that Peter Jackson has made too long movies should check out this CBS "event". There are about 45 minutes of story filled with 2 hours of unnecessary subplots and containing boring TV drama cliches. Bad science is a staple for bad weather disaster movies, so I will not complain about it. Stupid science can be fun if done in an amusing way. What kills this movie is 10 deals, all of which could be cut out without destroying the central conspiracy. The only character you can see in category 6 is Tornado Tommy, although he is a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Note that I did not deal with special effects. Their quality should come as no surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
