This movie is in all probability the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst thing I've ever seen, and I've seen MUCH bad movies. <br /> <br /> Nothing interesting happens in this film. You could literally start the movie, take a quick nap and then wake up knowing that nothing interesting happened while you were sleeping. And I've seen this movie three times and always stayed awake. I think I should be complimented. <br /> <br /> The movie is expected to run according to a formula without variation. Hunters capture the baby foot, are killed by their parents, and the nearby town gets into a bigfoot murder rush. This is surprisingly boring for a Troma release. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it, you will understand why.
