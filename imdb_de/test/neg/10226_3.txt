Not much more than a football knock-off from the Mighty Ducks. This movie was disturbing in most aspects. This has been one of the cases when your parents ask you to bring along your younger siblings so they do not have to spend a few hours on it. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it was too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg had a job at the time.
