The basic requirement of this film is that anyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person. And that a man who likes show songs has a good taste and looks neat, MUST be a homosexual. Yeah, the movie is funny at times, but the basic requirement is homophobic and insulting that the whole movie crumbles into something that's pretty painful. The performances, especially Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
