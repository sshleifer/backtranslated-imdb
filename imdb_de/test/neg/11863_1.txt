I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not when it has no purpose, but to elevate oneself. To beat a group of people without any self-irony is crap. <br /> <br /> There are people who could make concentration camps funny, but who made this movie is even in the VERY easy task of having fun, failed over Turks in Germany. It's a very simple task, but if you miss the German equivalent of an inbred redneck (= inbred Southerners from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals), you will fail in that and in life too. I have heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (this crap that is listed here is an insult to the next worst movie), sucks like the calf that the creators of this movie have in mind Years ago.
