I swear, I did not want it! I chose this only because it looked good on the back! This movie was not scary at all and was actually very confusing. The Demon Wind was used only a few times and people were killed rather cheesy. The one big ray of hope was to see Sherri Bendorf from the slaughterhouse playing in it. When I saw what happened to her, I decided on this little turkey of a movie. A 3 out of 10 NEXT!
