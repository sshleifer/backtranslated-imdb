What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt like I saw a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like the rest of a Star Wars TV special! I found the acting a bit amateurish for most. The costumes were glaring and finished, giving it a Flash Gordon effect from the 60s. The worms They are supposed to be sand worms, and yet they seemed to be "big stalactites" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects were generally quite secondary. I will not even start with the nefarious "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called "Frank Herbert's Dune" was not even faithful to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies". Key plot elements were left out, the names changed and the whole "feel" of the story was "purged". I did not even recognize the Harkonnens! In fact, most characters did not appear as Herbert had described them. I'm starting to get upset just thinking about what a tragedy it was. I am glad that I could not stand the second installment ....
