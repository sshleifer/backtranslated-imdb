This is a horrible movie that is barely discernible from the book, though there are similar acts. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is just 1.5 hours) would be much better for anything else, including the growth of grass. The addition of badly made fantasy scenes makes Catherine seem unbearably stupid. The actress, who plays Catherine, is also bleak as well and looks constantly surprised, even if she should look lovingly in the eyes of her Tilney. Honestly!! The film ends with an imaginative scene in Catherine, in which you do not have to wonder if it happened or if it is just crazy and not in the good way that makes you think, but in a terrible way, that the basically summarized terrible movie. The only good thing about the film is the title that Miss Austen herself wrote. I love the BBC productions in general, but this one is terrible.
