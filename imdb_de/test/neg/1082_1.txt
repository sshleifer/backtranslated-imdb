Well, how do I start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time a few years ago and went on a rental visit. I could not remember exactly why I had a bad feeling. Now I do. <br /> <br /> After I voted for the reviews for this movie, I saw the stats. Apparently this film appeals to 18 girls most. No wonder. You did not pay Charlize enough for Flash, and I think some girls rated Mark Wahlberg's abs as "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly B-stars and even the good ones are terribly abused, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagines this: he can even repeat without making a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the movie, and from there it goes downhill. Once they found that out, they decided to use the finest hour at the end and repeat their gold robbery. All in all, a lot of noise for nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more than before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "Look, I'm also here," which appeared in the beginning, I would say that this film should have a "passport if you're over 18".
