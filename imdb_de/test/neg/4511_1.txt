This is really a reissue that should never have come out of the stable. It has two casts that work in completely different layers. At the top of their game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of the franc is clear. On the crag are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can not imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play so well when Gilbert and Roberts exercise their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins every scene she's in right now. It's as if Father is the best in the ghetto. She is Ann Frank's light. Her run with Helen Keller was thin, but not terrible. That is a crime. Doris Roberts just annoys Mrs. Van Damm. She is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirting, unmet presence at the Acherhuis caused so much annoyance. It had to be played by a woman who could convince us she at least remembered how it worked. Your weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this role beautifully. Roberts was high in a career when this was done, he got a lot of press and many opportunities. Her performance here shows her weaknesses as an actress. James Coco and Clive Reville have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts and, as strong as they are, are totally unable to resolve the damage done by their partners. Reville is a smart actor capable of producing an iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the original film. He is not supported by Gilbert. It drains the color from every scene. <br /> <br /> I read with dismay the comments of those who grew up watching the version associated with these performances. It's a lesson on how to attach the first displayed version to you. I need to reconsider my attachment to inferior products that I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to look at the original. It has very few vulnerabilities and it lies head and shoulders above this mess.
