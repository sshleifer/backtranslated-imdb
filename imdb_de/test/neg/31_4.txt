It hurt to watch this movie, it really did ... I wanted to, even go inside. Obviously shot for very little money, I stopped by and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Although I appreciated the film on this level, acting and editing was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes was a serious one. A 95-minute film should not pull. The reviews for this point are good so far, but I'm afraid the friends and family might have been involved in this case. What about these transitions? Dear Editor, Have you just purchased your first copy of Adobe Premiere and set yourself the goal of using all the stupid transitions that go with this stupid program? Anyway ... a few better actors, a bit more passion and a more engaging cut, and that makes a decent movie.
