Writer-director Patrice Leconte has a universal and potentially bottomless theme - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce despite A-list actors, fine cinematography, and sleek production design. It's all in action, and the plot is ridiculous. "Teach me how to be nice," says art dealer Fran√ßois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) to a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a good actor, but we do not think he could be the egoist on whom the script depended. Just when we hope that the travesty is over, Leconte draws one of his usual cathartic third file, which quickly gets out of harm's way. Like Francois's beloved Greek vase, everyone and everything in this film is a fake. LeCene's sole asset is Julie Gayet, who is part of Coste's business partner Catherine, who looks swollen and sexy despite a major mishap of hairstyle.
