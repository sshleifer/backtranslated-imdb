If the following events sound tempting, then be sure to run to your local blockbuster and lick the movie frantically: <br /> <br /> 1. Awful hairstyles of the 60s, from miserable perms to dodgy duck tails. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst kid actor in the world who just cries and says DADDY with the most annoying voice imaginable. <br /> <br /> 3. Many shots of alligators and monkeys that do not intervene in the movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotypical Indians using blowpipes and talking gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying that they romp around the campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Funny fake plane crash mechanics where the performers actually throw themselves into the corners of the carton set. <br /> <br /> 6. The exterior shots of 5 looking suspicious like a toy jet on a string led around a studio illuminated with blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. Terrible special effects that make the effects used in the first Star Trek series seem comparatively modern. (Special Note: The little boy's blond hair shines, oh dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Laughing editing and continuity, where background elements move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without warning, etc. < br /> <br /> 9. You do not have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get every lady off the street, like an idiot! Nobody will notice the difference! He .. <br /> <br /> 10. An "exciting" climax with quicksand, snakes (more stuff from the archives) and a lot of fake blood. Do not forget to include a stupid "Tribal" song as well! <br /> <br /> However, the more sensible among you will be waiting for the inevitable appearance on MST3K when this classic TV show is revived and you can observe it in the spirit in which it was intended. Any other kind of enjoyment that can be gained from this crap is unthinkable. So do not even try it. 0/10
