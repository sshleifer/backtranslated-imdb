It looked cool on the sleeve of the film, but after five minutes we were not sure if it was a homosexual documentation of West Side history without female interest. The film quality was poor and there was barely enough group combat action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest long enough to watch the entire movie. May God have the souls of the actors and responsible filmmakers for what I can only call my new and only reason why I never want to see (or trust) a movie produced in Australia. I have to write more, so I'll say again that the actors were so bad that I'm sure I could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojans. Please do not watch this movie for your own sake.
