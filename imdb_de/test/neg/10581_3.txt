Here is a parody that entertains people in the IQ range of Homer Simpson. It's a cheap shot for any great superhero, especially Spiderman and Batman. But it does not end there. It gets worse and worse until it disintegrates into a miserable ensemble of slapstick trollop. For those who are interested in the plot, one must only observe Spiderman under the influence of a heavy narcotic. What are you getting? Dragonflies man? A boy wonders who loves the girl next door and suddenly inherits some startling superpowers. The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but do not 'rely on it! It's a bit amusing for kids; For adults, it's a great movie to deliver to the kids.
