This is a really horrible show. It is indeed an example of how little television has fallen since "reality" came into fashion. Tanya is pretty, but she is also very rude and has a terrible taste. Is a house show the place for sex appeal? Obviously, some men like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not pretty, but he is totally rude and also has a terrible taste. It is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone else lives in them. Most people who supposedly look at these homes before making any changes should move to completely new or completely empty homes so that they do not offend anyone. Most of them ... like the "crew" have to learn manners. I can imagine how horrible the British show is, as the British reality shows are even worse in terms of manners and taste. What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and a few years later), it was filled with goodies. Now it's a big garbage truck.
