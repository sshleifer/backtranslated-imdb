The son of the aboriginal chief is wrongfully charged with the death of his father. The evil witch doctor orders him executed. He then comes back as a murder tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can one say about such a "movie"? If it was a horror movie, it was obviously a bad judgment. And for a comedy, it's still not funny enough. I do not know why people make such films. I think you have to be really stupid to see it. Or you may want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree that adds a new dimension to "slow death". Or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills of everyone involved. (Ms. Kilgore!) Or the dialogues and script that were strangely ignored at the Academy Awards that year. <br /> <br /> "Should not we try psychoanalysis on this tree? Maybe the mother was scared of oaks." 2/10
