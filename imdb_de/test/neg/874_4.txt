Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium. Actually, the script would have worked out if the lead roles had been filled with younger actors, but the drama of an aging Diane Lane behaving as if she were a teenager (or even a twenty-year-old) was too much. Every time she (Adrienne) jumped into Richard Gere's arms and then pulled both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face when he probably thought, "Oh, my aching back ... this baby certainly does not weigh 125 pounds! "In any case, both characters were extremely unlikely, especially Richard Gere: a self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner), who after a failed operation was on a" soul quest ", after he got together with a dead female patient (an older woman from a small woman). Then there was her angry husband and son to deal with to explain what had happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to the angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets Adrienne. She has recently been separated from her unfaithful husband (shock) and helps a friend by watching her vacation home on the beach. Of course Dr. Flanner here at the end and both eventually fall in love with MADLY (especially after finding out that he is a wealthy doctor AND a plastic surgeon). Between romantic interludes and a disgusting song / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CD?), They both try to figure out how their lives have been so screwed up. Dr. Flanner was not a big dad and has a son (who's also a dr) who annoys him because he was not there for him when he grew up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at that time than raising an untamed, distracting boy.) To help make a long (predictable) story short, Adrienne helps. Flanner, confronting his inner demons and confronting himself with anger. Husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after "routinely" removing cysts from the face). Dr. Flanner can FINALLY say to the husband (who was sympathetically played by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though the dreaded anesthetist blamed it. "I told him she was too old for that much juice!" Glenn's character (Robert Torrelson) seems to have the excuse of Dr. To accept Flanner. It's hard to say, because his emotional response at this point is so passive that you wonder if he's even going to get the good dr. hear or think about an area that he has to plow. More and more cautious decides Flanner that he must visit his son (who practices medicine in a third world country) to improve his relationship. Unfortunately that means he has to admit Adrienne temporarily. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour to Adrienne (who almost faints like a schoolgirl every time she gets one) and tells her the hardest thing he ever had to do Apparently, the second hardest thing was to apologize to Robert Torrelson for the death of his wife. In the end he gets killed in a crazy mud slide (poetic justice like a mud pack?) And she just has memories of what could have been ... hopefully no further Gere / Lane sequels!
