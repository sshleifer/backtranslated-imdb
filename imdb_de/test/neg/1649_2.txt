Perfect double calculation for the terribly idiotic "Beverly Hillbillies" is this equally detestable, cramped "comedy", "son-in-law". The country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college just to be attacked by the lifestyle. "Resident Adviser" "Crawl" helps her to settle down, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the crazy "crawl" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious "fish out of the water" results. <br /> <br /> The only other comic angle that Steve Rash (aptly named) achieves here is a sexual one. He beats us, but without success. Both comic aspects are bleak, and you know the film is groping when "Crawl" hijacks the combine and writes its name in the cornfield. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the film fails with several family attempts and personal advice from failed "crawls". Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to build some smiles, but little else while the rest of the cast is just food. The problem is that it's almost impossible to like crawl and you'll wonder why Rebecca wants to spend a moment with him. However, if you're a fan of dubious comedy, "Son in Law" is just right. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
