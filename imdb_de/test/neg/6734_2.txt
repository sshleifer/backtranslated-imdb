Coming from Norway (one of the ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was very funny to see how we use trucks from the 50s and live in medieval huts. And since we have very strict laws on handguns, it was fun to see how many firearms in Norway actually were in the five minutes of shooting. Mr. Direct-to-Video has even managed to bring his muffler at short notice, so he has to have powerful friends in inches. Guys - you can hurt the feelings of old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre - old fan with hurt feelings.
