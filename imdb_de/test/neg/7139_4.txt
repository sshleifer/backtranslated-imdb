The Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror movie or horror or grumpy babe. I loved the first and the original Ju-On. I believe that much greater justice could have been done for them. Aubrey only existed to fill in what had to be "discovered" in the ending (which, if you've seen Ju-On before, already know the entire movie), it was really a complete remake of Ju-On, just closer followed as The Grudge. Although everyone might have thought that it would come to America, it was a bit interesting, but it was expected when the house burned at the end of The Grudge and left the second hunger for a new conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Save $ 6.50 and wait for this to appear on DVD, lend it, look at it and decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for falling asleep at 2am. But overall I would say that there are 4 out of 10 points. I'm sorry, Grudge fans, it's just ... you just failed with this one.
