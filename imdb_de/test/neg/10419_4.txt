"Yesterday" as a movie is difficult to evaluate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is hard and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story onto the screen by the actors did not correspond to the camera work. As a person born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film and the honesty portrayal of everyday life for the Zulu. However, this and the camera work are not enough to suggest that the average viewer should watch this movie. It takes an appreciation of the true cinema, and not just the love of films, to recognize the purpose and strength of Yesterday. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the 1980 movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy," which was a weird look at an African culture that meets modern technology, "Yesterday" has no intention of creating a crossover To address the audience. The film is simply not suitable for the normal Western spirit - and I doubt it was meant for the Western spirit. The scenes are long and slow, editing is not pervasive for a 60 mph world and instant gratification. The dialogue is not a cleaver or funny, it's real. Films about health crises are not the best entertainment, and this movie is not entertainment but education. <br /> <br /> This film is best viewed by those who know, appreciate and love the lifestyle and culture in Sub-Sarah Africa. If you do not have a vast worldview to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, you should skip this movie. Do not waste time on it. Instead, look at "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" for your cross-culture ad. <br /> <br /> I give most a 4 who want to see the movie but have no exact knowledge of African cultures. For the viewers with an appreciation for films about human experience anywhere in the world I would give a 7.
