I was not impressed with the Graffiti Artist, although he speaks artistically (aka Low Budget Improvisation). There is little dialogue and at least for me I was disappointed that there was no more recognition or work for guerrilla artists like these. Instead, it was a story covering familiar terrain. Two men, who basically do little more than identify buildings, become friends, partners to tag and eventually experiment with a relationship. They seem like opposites, rather uncomfortable. Little is said about their background and the things that happen between the two young men moving at a rapid pace (although I can understand this because it only takes about 70 minutes). In recent years, there have been countless similar presentations and productions to the point that the independent film realm is saturated with this particular storytelling as much as the mainstream is saturated with it and more /> Much of the film can bore the viewer, the immediate dialogue and purpose needed. The protagonist of this story (at least in detail) performs his routines almost without dialogue, insight, and nothing else to carry the viewer. And for a short film I would have wished that they had come much faster to the point. That annoyed me, except for the typical conspiracy. Still, there was a brief glimpse into the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, though most of it was rather idle. It does not matter to have an indie image, and some are interested in this subterranean, urban art form. You really have to see it for yourself, because it seems to be one with more taste.
