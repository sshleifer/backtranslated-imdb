I had the misfortune to catch this on a recent flight. I had the greater misfortune to let it play on my RETURN flight. Obviously Demi's attempt to gain some "artistic" reputation makes the film a mess because of its lousy acting. A better actress might have done this job, but a simple look at Moore's face shows the void inside. At least it does not ruin American literature this time.
