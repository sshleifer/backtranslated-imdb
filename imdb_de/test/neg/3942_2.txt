Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I'm called attention, it was the trailer and not the cartel. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film was about a video I play that was created by a countess to kill people and to live forever is acceptable. <br /> <br /> First, that very bad films of horror, the blood produces more or less sparks (gossip spreads), these scenes bleed, they are the worst. <br /> <br /> But actually (really) this is a bad movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all aspects. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone, trailer good, movie bad. <br /> <br /> I do not care that they (like) spend a lot of money and time making these senseless films and too bad.
