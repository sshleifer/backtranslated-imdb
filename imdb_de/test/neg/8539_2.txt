I just watched this movie on the opening night. I read some other user comments that convinced me to see it ... I have to say, I was not impressed. I am so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of you some money. <br /> <br /> First of all, "The Messengers" is very predictable and not exactly a thriller. It may be scary for someone under the age of 13, but it really did not help me. The climax was ridiculous and most spectators left the room before the movie was released. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting seemed a bit superficial. Some of the emotional struggles between the family were less convincing than the subordinate suspensory scenes. <br /> <br /> If you've seen previews for this movie, you've seen most of the best parts and a good understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth watching in the cinemas.
