Summary: Ipswitch was once a community of witches and escaped the Salem Witch Hunt by entering into a secrecy agreement. The first-born men descended from these families have supernatural powers and must grapple with the seductive, addictive nature of these forces. <br /> <br /> Well, normally I give films the benefit of the doubt and start a 5 from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for very obvious audio signals out of sync, + 1 for well-done special effects, the Darkling actually gave me shivers, +0.5 for beautiful coloring (I like the dull blue), -0.5 for the stupid soundtrack, +0.5 for the opening sequence - I'm a fan of stylish compositing and eye-catching title design. <br /> <br /> Story / Script: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter rip-off / pastiche, -1, to avoid explaining some plot threads very well (Spiders, Dark ), -1 for boring, predictable end, -1 for unfounded representation, both as words the screen and as mild monologues <br /> <br /> Spectacle / characterization: -0.5 for bad bad spectacle, though it is in the course the film gets a little better, -1 for character development, especially for all women <br /> <br /> Others: +1 for free male and female nudity fun to see and +0 5 for no sex scenes that are usually made for this genre very bad and end up boring rather than hot, +1 for reaching the target audience, teenage sci-fi / horror / thriller fans, even though this movie is not all about one of these genres. Conclusion: This is not a "movie", this is a FILM. There's really nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) clean fun. Many really attractive actors and actresses. Many boys fight in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or thoughtless funny acts, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, exquisitely-produced masterpieces with many layered, allegorical storylines and ground-breaking visualization techniques, you probably will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> With my twisted logic movie gets a 4/10.
