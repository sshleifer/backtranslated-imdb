Yes, it can not be for adults, and some adults find it stupid, but if you do not think about it, it really is not that bad. <br /> <br /> The story has Alvin and his gang, who go across the city world, looking for jewels for a bad man and the mishaps with which they come in contact. <br /> <br /> The animation is so good, and the story is cute and the songs are forgetful, but it's good movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 6 out of 10 or *** of 4 stars.
