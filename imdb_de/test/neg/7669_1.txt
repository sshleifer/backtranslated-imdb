WARNING ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Lord knows I have seen some bad movies in my time, and that makes me just as angry. This is an insult to people looking for a bad movie. The "story" is a stewardess who discovers that her boyfriend (who is otherwise badly played by Robert Wagner) is a murderer, a thief, and just a punk face. After the Concorde takes off, he sends guided weapons to destroy the Concorde. So while the Concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with total stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit and reaches out his hand to shoot at the rocket! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it seems his hand is going to get at least a wind blaze. Then to the final "climax", when the Concorde is heading for a particular disaster and all will die, a passenger turns to his fianc√© and suggests a marriage. A priest happens to be in the next row marrying them while the planes crash! (I do not mind that.) Wow, the guy who wrote the script has been snooping on glue for a week.
