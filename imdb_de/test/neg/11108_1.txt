This is another original sci-fi channel with Rhys Davies, in which it is difficult to decide what is worse, the drama or the writing / ruling / producing (John Sheppherd controls all three) a cargo container escapes and aboard a cruise ship the bloodbath begins. Clich√©d Sci-Fi cast of the robust captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls for a terrorist alarm for the ship (of course I did not believe any monster history.) No dramatic helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here. The budget allows only the entire force of eight seals to arrive in a glass fishing boat and board a boat. Puleeze Even cheesy computer animations of the ship could make you better on your computer. I also loved it when the Seal Commander, who looked through standard binoculars ten miles away, saw three people jump off the ship. If the sci-fi channel continues the original films, I hope they realize that the audience is not a kindergarten grade and buys better scripts and directors. If this was direct to the video, you would find it in the 99 cent clipboard.
