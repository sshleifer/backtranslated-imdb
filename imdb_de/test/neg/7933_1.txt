** Maybe Spoiler ** ** Hard to ruin this thing more than it is, but just in case ** Gee's, I do not see how anyone could have liked this remake !! It was like a "made for TV" show and still pretty lame. Lots of fake snow, bad behavior from topstars, bad action and the crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the hell??!! I did not really think that this would be a great movie, but I hoped for entertainment. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish the next day. I could have easily skipped the rest (but then I would have missed those great pine woods!) I'm so glad I missed that in the theater! Bad enough to have wasted $ 3.50 in the video store. And I'm a lover of police, action and drama films. This was a very smelly 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original every day !!
