A man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr. Sammael (Joan Severance), who claims to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of hell, and he wants to tell strange things. He tells us that he has made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He was to destroy his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day her mother died, and she was to kill six people and deliver the anti-Christ, and then he would flee the pit and be reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but her father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile, the church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy on Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and has to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), her tenant's lover Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself, and eat Jennifer herself and her heart and drink her blood, but she believes that she Has nightmares. However, during the ultrasound she realizes that she has a monster with her and asks her father to end her pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The terrible "Born" is a B-movie (actually a Z-movie) that thinks this is a great movie. The result is a presumptuous and disappointing production with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and directing. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest who is a batsman and a former soldier; a demon in existential crisis, who goes to psychiatry; a father who investigates the virginity of his daughter; two female demons (Succubus?) standing naked like a statue and covering their sexes with both hands; a figure who is a slut and exists only to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes of free and cheap nudity. But the worst thing is acting: the unknown lead actress Alison Brie is a histrionist with ridiculous voices and grimaces. I'm sorry, Mrs Alison Brie, but I hated your annoying idea. I did not recognize Joan Severance, who performs well, as I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character and, like everyone else, she's still a good actress. I think that if the author and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie was a B-movie, the story might have worked better and better. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("The Anti-Christ")
