This movie was so stupid and slow it was always slow. The only good part of the movie was the girl in the tight golden pants. There was no anger about everything and what is a horror movie of the 80s without a small wound. Besides, the killer was not scary at all and the murders were not. But if you want to see the worst horror movie in the world, then this is for you. Do not waste your time the way I've seen it.
