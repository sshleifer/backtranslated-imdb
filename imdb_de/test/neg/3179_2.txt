I like Wes Studi and especially Adam Beach, but who is this film a burden of presumption. Clumsily slow Overly cryptic until disguise, not because the act justifies it, but because there is almost no action. Even less in the characterization. This is almost like one of those creaky old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheaper Monogram studio versions) with lots of red herrings and weird characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now a hermit) and many people, who are killed over art objects that you would not see twice in the mall. Great scenery. Pretty hair on the redhead too, though I've never figured out what she was doing. My wife could not. Sheesh, at least the old B-movies had the decency to be short.
