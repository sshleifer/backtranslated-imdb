From time to time, it is highly advisable for the aristocracy to watch a silent movie about the rough lives of ordinary people, to remember the privileges and pleasant lives they have enjoyed since the dawn of mankind or even before. Compared to the complicated and hard work that ordinary people have to endure every day since the aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly what happened in "The Love Light," the first film directed by Dame France Marion director, to be famous in the silent-and-talkie world thanks to her work as a screenwriter; certainly for her, certainly, because her career as a film director does not impress this German Grafin. The film tells the story of Lady Angela Carlotti (Lady Mary Pickford), a cheerful Italian woman living near by a "painterly misery" (an important difference of opinion between upper and lower grades, aristocrats prefer "picturesque luxury "to live surrounded?); She has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all she gives him is indifference. Fate begins to work hard, and soon the war is declared and the two brothers of Lady Angela come in. In the next role, both are dead. But fate is even cruel and Lady Angela falls in love with herself in the meantime? a German!! Worse yet, she does not know that her Teutonic treasure is a spy, and that the light she sends him every evening from the lighthouse considers her a love signal does not mean "I love you" "but" Sink Any Damn Italian Boat At Sea "Fortunately for Lady Angela, her sweet German spy is soon found by the neighbors in her house, in which she has hidden him strange fact, in fact, because it is for a German is not an easy task to go unnoticed ??), but the German spy will prefer to die before being captured by these Italians. <br /> <br /> From this German love, a half - a teutonic baby is born (the evil fate at full speed?), but a greedy neighbor, who has a certain notion of motherhood, will take his son with the approval of a Catholic nun who has taken the Council of Trent to extremes? a Fact that will take Lady Angela to the brink of madness. <br /> <br /> But now the secret admirer of Lady Angela has returned from the war and you may think that Lady Angela's sad life is finally improving. a tremendous mistake, because Destiny is ready for her, that the returned soldier is blind. But as it is said in Germany, this may be a blessing, and eventually Lady Angela will regain her son and start a new life with her blind sweetheart in a poor Italian village, which should be a happy end to the general public. <br /> <br /> As this German Grafin has said, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion to continue her career as a scriptwriter because, as seen in "The Love Light", she had a lot of the idea of ​​inventing incredible stories, yes! ?? However, filming is a completely different topic, and her quiet debut lacks emotion and rhythm, though Lady Pickford endeavors to seduce the audience with her many shame. The non-existent cinematic narrative causes indifference to the viewer, making this film a kind of film in which only Lady Pickford herself provides for the interest and not for their circumstances. <br /> <br /> And if you allow me now, I have to take with me temporarily My permission, because this German count must send Morse code from the north tower of the castle to one of his Germanic rich heirs.
