The price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too expensive". <br /> <br /> Only after looking at the English translated version may this be the reason for a low rating of this viewer. <br /> <br /> It made the film poorer overall than the story material implied ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments suggest that the subtitle version would be better. <br /> <br /> But some plot elements remained unclear, leaving an unfinished feeling. <br /> <br /> There is also the thought "Is there a series to follow?" (at least at this time anyway).
