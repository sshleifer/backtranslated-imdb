What a horrible movie. Full of clich√©s, confusing scenes, very bad acting and an incredible script. It's hard to believe that the same people who opposed The People. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon have written this junk. Man, that makes my list the top 10 worst movies ever. Did not that guy, that director, if you can call him that, notice that the first problem child was bad enough? Let's do a sequel !! ?? Amazing that such trash films can be shown to children, not to mention that they are released! 1 out of 10 *
