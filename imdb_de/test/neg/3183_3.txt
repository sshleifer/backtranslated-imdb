Before taking a job as a reviewer, I never went to such movies, so I did not know that the soul of the Hollywood movie had a deeply hateful spirit that wants to put its kneeling knees on the screen, either to sympathize with or to revile. Or is this just a bad year? An ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here's another, seemingly sweet, innocent, beautiful woman who became a deadly weapon. The kind that warns us that beneath every pair of eyes and nests is a wild beast that is guaranteed to make everyone's life hell within 80 kilometers. <br /> <br /> This month's copy is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams include a private little house, a backyard fountain, and a mondo home entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first movie for 3 years), the grumpy bartender she picks up one night at McCool to rob is less materially geared. The guy who drinks beer from a toilet butt, prefers to settle down in his dead mother's house, with little comfort, save his snowball collection. <br /> <br /> In the same bar with low prices, the devil In the red dress also meets Randy's cousin Carl (the most amusing Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis. If things go south within a few hours, you enter the widowed detective with a golden heart (John Goodman). The result? Three men suffer from the leopard-studded offspring of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell-Crush's big, bad bruises that make them do things that common sense would normally contraindicate. For example, you should get involved first. <br /> <br /> Several points of view and flashbacks add to the home page news about how easy it is to fall prey to libido, especially if you're male. As each of these men puts their perspective to a familiar, his desire to possess the jewel colors the "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things come together in a rather funny way. But it's a conversation from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butter. MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian director and music video director Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments, including one about a car wash, soap and a tube you can probably extrapolate. It is also the debut project of the production company of Michael Douglas, who has found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo salon. <br /> <br /> However, Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win gold statues because of the one-dimensionality of their exaggerated film noir characters. Some minor roles attract unexpected guests - Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay acts as Hoodlum Utah and his even more appalling brother. (Finally, an outflow for all these aggression.) <br /> <br /> This film unintentionally speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and women - or men and their mothers. But in the end, you would probably find more permanent psychological truths in a Bugs Bunny episode. I'll say it's better, funnier, and more challenging than other gems like TOMCATS, but should we really have to decide what to look for at the lowest level of the Misogynism scale?
