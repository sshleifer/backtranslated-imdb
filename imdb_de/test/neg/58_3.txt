The growl ... <br /> <br /> The scowl ... <br /> <br /> The violence ... <br /> <br /> The reckless voice ... <br /> <br /> The fetish wear ... <br /> <br /> The shaved head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... <br /> <br /> GRACE JONES IS BACK! <br /> <br /> In fact, my sources say that the title role in Blade was not played by the 1980s diva, but by Wesley Snipes. All in all, this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blade is an adaptation of a cartoon character; The transfer from the simplified, two-dimensional world of the printed page has somehow become even easier and has lost a few dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost unimaginable and the vampire does not add anything Genre, like Nosferatu, seems to suck the life out of the audience. In short, the upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful, but is rejected by Blade, half a human, half a vampire. It's all a highlight when Blade was put into a vampire squeezer, some poor martial arts and the most miserable CGI since 1968. Blade must be the least sensitive character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation) Maybe there's one here Trend?). Surely the audience should be on the same page as the "hero"? And though a vampire can be a tragic figure, this does not apply to Blade, he's relentlessly cruel, contemptuous and not much better than the bad guys. I assume that Wesley Snipes has an 'acting career' so that everyone else can be compared favorably. As he growls through his film, he searches for an assignment - even for a pen - to put Blade in the grave. <br /> <br /> As narcissism, Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we get endless shots of a fresh snipes out of the gym for no reason at all. Likewise, no other actor may perform adequately. They like Steven Dorff * CAN * but they have to play the second fiddle behind Snipes' lengthy performance. Kris Kristofferson used to be seen in good movies, here he is reduced to a buddy whom you only like know will not make it to the last roll. And what happens when Blade finds out about it? Yes, you guessed it, he hurries to the scene and takes his revenge in the villain's huge underground warehouse. <br /> <br /> Why can not world domination take place in a quiet country house? They always walk in subterranean cathedrals where Albert Speer wondered if they were a bit grandiose. Many of these plans could now be stopped if the local councils paid more attention to the plans for under-floor development. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is just as boring and uninspired, with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires were made to sink, and maybe they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone comes up with something to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> Finally, there * is * a * Grace * Jones Vampire movie is called Vamp and is about ten times better than this one.
