End of Days, starts pretty well, Arnie plays a losing policeman (a very similar figure to Riggs in Lethal Weapon) and the story looks like some sort of serial killer action thriller that offers good entertainment. <br /> <Unfortunately, Arnie is not as good as we expected, but for Gabriel Byrne, I expect him to choose his roles more carefully. thrown as a devil; This is probably the weakest representation of the Lord of Darkness ever. <br /> <br /> This film gets a little too stupid for me, and the end sequence is, besides being very weak, visually one of the worst I've ever seen. As we've seen in recent years, CGI has been better than this since the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> Pretty much not good enough. 4/10 (Watch it if you have too, but do not expect too much because it will not deliver)
