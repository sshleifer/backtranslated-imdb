Child's Play has created a new genre of horror, THE KILLER DOLLS. Some of these films do not have too much money for production, but I think the only movie that shuns Chucky is this one. Okay, it's a typical product to video or straight to TV, but Pinocchio is not real and the killer is the little girl. The imagination of the children is too big and the movie plays with it. The roles are good and Candance Mckenzie is great. <br /> <br />
