This film was recommended to me by one of my friends, so I expected something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the first half - alas, a movie about a pennant avenging its scathing boss, how original - and the second half in the fast-forward, hoping to find something that justifies the 45 would -odd minutes I had already wasted. But all I got was the end of the 'shock'. <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that this is a movie that apparently can not decide what it wants to say, and says whatever it says (hard to say) you say what that is, bad , Great acting does not save a bad script with characters who do not interest me. <br /> <br /> Well, if I have no moonlight in the movie industry, I would be shocked to discover the stupid politics and exploitation. The screen continues, but my feelings are summarized as above: 'Ho Hum' , <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10, if it had not been for the drama and the papercut scene.
