As I watched BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialogues so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this should be a comedy. A few select dialogues that deserve a belly laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you that she was obsessed!" "Tell me that the devil is in my daughter?!" <br /> <br /> There are many, many more, but you must discover them for yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> The story goes in all directions and things happen that probably should not and everyone seems to be a pervert or some psycho (somehow the priest). And I have not even come to the bad acting. Most notable in this area is the guy who plays Isabelle's father. The director must have just told him that he behaves as if he had a stick in his @ $$, because that's the general impression you get. It's an entertainment value ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is really scary ... well, do not run.
