The factors that others have opposed here - acting, lighting and so on, do not bother me. For the most part, these things were done well enough to transport the film and convey its points. After all, it's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was the dots themselves. Because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its moral is deeply sticky. It is indeed a fundamentalist Christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the "sins": <br /> <br /> * Sutherland's character picked a kid at school when he was still a teenager, which led to his accident. <br /> <br /> * Baldwin's character was used masculine wit, persuasiveness and good looks to nag some women, some of whom he recorded on video. Oh, the pigs! How unfortunate for him is that women are so passive that there are no Gormons, that they have no complicity in the matter. * Roberts' father came back from Vietnam as a junkie and was so ashamed that he got caught shooting that kills himself. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why could not he just become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> * and Bacon's figure chose another schoolchild. How terrible! The fact that he himself was a child does not seem to apply to anything. Children appear to be divinely judged by adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Perhaps many people support this level of moral absolutism. It certainly seems inconspicuous in the comments of this movie. Does everyone just buy this stuff? At the very least, human laws treat children differently than adults and acknowledge that their ethical sense is partially shaped. This film has no such concerns, and I find that rather unpleasant. Similarly, the idea that women are helpless, fluffy creatures before the evil lascivious young men. Or that a Vietnamese veterinarian driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
