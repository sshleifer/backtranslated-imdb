This movie is not that great ... but it's good if you just want to laugh because it's pretty ridiculous. :) There are many mistakes and it is cheesy. I got this movie like it was 5 years ago at Christmas, but for some reason I never gave it away. I guess I just like it for a rainy day, though I only see it once a year. This is a very 90s movie, so it's really funny to see everyone dressing and acting. This movie is good for someone who is young ... although I've been thinking about it, I did not like it when I was 12, but that's just my personal opinion. The movie was really predictable. I wish it had had a few unusual twists, but I think it was an attempt to be a suitable film that everyone can enjoy. I think it was suitable for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a bit unobtrusive but quite appropriate for family stuff.
