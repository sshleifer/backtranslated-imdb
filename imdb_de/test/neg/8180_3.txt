Red Glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director has made some fantastic, denied visions of the future. This film, however, was boring, presumptuous crap. The opening scene showed promise, which promise cover art and description for a surreal live-action Amimae style Future Noir. I feel like I have that with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With Red Spectacles I just felt so uncomfortable that I longed for what the hell was the point. The movie made little sense for me and I could not care less about the people. This would be fine if the movie was an effective art. While the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the huge robot suit that held the huge machine gun in the rain looked cool, he did not look at the movie, which was worth to be seen. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
