Oh my god, it just will not get any worse than that !!! I always love stupid little Sci-Fi-B movies that are so stupid that they're funny, and I thought this would be one of those, but that was just so stupid that I found it utterly regrettable it was allowed to be published. What did these people think? They are obviously not real filmmakers and I really hope they return to their day jobs once they realize that this is the best they can! The theatrical and not-so-special effects were far from the standard for B-movies with the lowest budget. And what attracted the men who are disguised as women, they could not find women who wanted to appear in this crappy thing. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would quote a "0" if possible, it does not even deserve a "1" for terrible. Do not waste your time (and especially your money) with this terrible loser of a non-film!
