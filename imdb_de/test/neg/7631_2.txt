Since so many good movies hit the market in 1995 (especially "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), there had to be a few bombs, and this movie actually falls into the latter category with a boring, predictable storyline and a bad ending , It seems that Antonio Banderas has not been able to find a decent script since "Desperado," the only notable movie he made. Anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell from the beginning who DeMornays stalker was. Her flashbacks to her mother's death were nothing more than an impotent story. Too bad that Dennis Miller was wasted in this movie; This part is similar to his awfully similar role in "The Net". <br /> <br /> The twisting end made me shake my head, as I pretty much did throughout the movie. Plus, any movie that depicts animal cruelty in any form, no matter how wrong it looks, automatically gets its thumbs down. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid it at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2.10
