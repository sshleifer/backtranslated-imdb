What can I say? I just saw this strip out of curiosity, and that's really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this movie is supposed to take place ... Too bad that neither an actor nor a camera from this movie ever arrived in Rennes. You could have picked at least one probable city or a probable forest, but even SEEM like Brittany or Rennes ... And when you call it a movie about Celtic legends, the audience is really a fool. Apart from these details, it could have been a good movie, but it's crap. Stupid scenario, stupid characters and no originality. To avoid in any case.
