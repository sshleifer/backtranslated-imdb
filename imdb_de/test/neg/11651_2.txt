This movie was pointless. I can not even call it sci-fi, as this requires more than just walking in space. "Max Q" is not even set for the entire movie in the room. The story / storyline is not original, the cast is not something to write home about, even though it would be weird in a top cast in a mediocre movie ... Besides, it's not particularly exciting or narrative. At least it is balanced in an inferior way that nothing or no one notices. Everything is just as bland. Normally, I find quality in "Space Flicks," even if it's just half a 90-minute conversation that borders on low budgets, but "Max Q" did not even give me that satisfaction. All in all a complete waste of time.
