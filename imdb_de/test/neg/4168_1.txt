Interesting concept that just can not make it. I saw the full movie but had to read IMDb comments to find out what code 46 means. If / when it was explained in the film, I must have been in a coma or possibly brain dead by then. I only saw it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I knew none of the other actors should have been a clue. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie should not be. What the "Anti-Empathy Virus" - Holy Utility Belt - Batman! Where were The Joker, The Riddler and so on? Why are the women all so ugly? If I want to see less than simple stick figures, I just go down the street. The best thing about the movie was the car accident. It was absolutely believable and not over the top like in most movie crashes.
