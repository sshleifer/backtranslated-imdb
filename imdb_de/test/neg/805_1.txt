Monotonous, dismal and a total waste of time. The plot is incomprehensible (do not think too much about it). The acting is weird and wooden - I could have sworn that they were all professional bodybuilders trying their luck at acting, but that could be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no interesting special effects to overcome this catastrophe, but many fires, explosions, a casual sex scene, etc. The only thing that struck me was that it is after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow becomes atomic. ..Hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? Let's hope that "Iraq" was just a happy choice for Corman and the rest of his scenario does not come true. <br /> <br />
