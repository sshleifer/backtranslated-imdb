Because I would never have seen this movie until the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this film, I could not understand more than about 15% (the fancy English couple in the 3rd story) of what people said. Three short stories, none of real meaning, just some of the most wretched and lifeless people I could have imagined, and a lot of lazy language. I did not find it funny, did not find it funny, found no meaning in it. 4.10
