A high school track star dies after winning a race; Shortly thereafter, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all members of her sister's track team disappear. Who could be the killer? You may not be interested enough to find out. Raw, cheaper, amateurish slasher is almost completely worthless, though Christopher George (like the nasty, hard-hitting track trainer) tries to do so giving him a lift with an intense power. Not even the wound is worth mentioning. The whole thing is lame from start to finish, starting with opening the movie on a track where the montage was set to disco music, and the casting by E.J. Peaker, once a co-star of the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character called "Blondie"! That's right "Blondie". That may mean we should not take the movie seriously, but it's a mess in any case. <br /> <br /> It's a sort of routine slasher filth that makes the "Friday the 13th" movies look like works of art in comparison. <br /> <br /> The only point that interests me is Vanna White's early movie appearance of all of them. <br /> <br /> 2/10
