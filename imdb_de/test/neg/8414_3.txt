This movie is a bad movie, but to get a nutritional value, I recommend watching it back to back with Rosemary's baby. <br /> <br /> There's a lot to learn about how different directors can pull different performances from the same movie actors who play the same characters. Watch Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and her good work in the first movie against the terrible rendition in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. I wonder if anyone involved in the sequel was aware of the first movie and one of them was watching Rosemary's baby before he did that? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is purely superficial, then best avoid this. I have much more to say about this film, but I really do not want to go there.
