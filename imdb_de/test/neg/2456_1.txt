Best regards, <br /> <br /> Is not it amazing what power movies have after first watching? <br /> <br /> I was so excited to see this movie for the first time I've been quitting flatliners with my friends for weeks - mind you, I was a very impressive 18 year old at the time, and mine Taste in movies has since become a bit more conservative. <br /> <br /> Then somehow I forgot this movie until I saw the DVD in my local department store. I remembered how great it was. I thought, "Right, I'll tear you off the shelf when they release the Special Edition." <br /> <br Last week I was overjoyed when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this movie the second time I watched it even more. How wrong was I! <br /> <br /> Conclusion: After 11 years, my view of this film had changed from a very frightening 1st class movie to totally garbage, which is superficially dubbed on the religious and supernatural side of things. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts acting (with the exception of Erin Brockeridge, where she earned her Oscar). I think the problem This film is definitely the director and such a mediocre screenplay. I left this film feeling that it had no real substance or potential, and just a few frightening cheap experiences that were not well done at all. Not even the score of James-Newtown Howard, whom I particularly like as a film composer, captivated and inspired me. <br /> <br /> In 1990, I rated this movie at 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would be lucky enough to give 2/10 at best. <br /> <br />
