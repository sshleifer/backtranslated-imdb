It starts out really interesting - the story evolves around the main character, who runs a "cleaning company" that specializes in cleaning crime scenes. As a former police officer he gets into a strange situation when a job suddenly "officially" disappears. In addition, he discovers a connection to an investigation of police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified the deeper he goes into the background of the story. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in an exciting story with some twists - but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the film loses its touch and at the end there is a completely unnecessary shootout with the 14-year-old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and an unjustified justice from the character development ... why Cutler will not give up because of the friendship ? or let the daughter discover some facts? or ... many possible, much better story evenings are conceivable ... a really wasted end!
