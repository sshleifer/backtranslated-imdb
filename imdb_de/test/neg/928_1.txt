A terrible, horrible, terrible movie. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares in my teens. When I found out that a remake was on the way, I groaned. WHY OH WHY do a good movie? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for missing another classic horror movie. This time, they have replaced a somewhat interesting story with bloody, slow and yawning characters. Someone said earlier that he was surprised Paris Hilton can act. Have you seen the movie? She plays a little trample. Sounds like typography to me. Half of the audience was actually thrilled when she died. That tells you why people see this movie. If this is your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole, this thing will suck more of your life than you want. If I had been alone, I would have let 10 minutes in the boring exhibition. This thing is like a Moron guide to crap filmmaking: bred southern idiots, stupid but attractive leads, copious knives, copious, lush, threatening lorries, I could go on. After watching this movie, I really appreciated Jeepers Creepers, and I thought this movie was a shit. Save yourself and avoid this Crapfest at all costs.
