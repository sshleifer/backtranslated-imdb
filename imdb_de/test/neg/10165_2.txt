When I saw this movie today, I had the feeling that this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides this trading post / saloon in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner for robbery. All he sees is the evidence of a massacre, some corpses, signs of a fight, and no one alive. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, as found in old English murder secrets. <br /> <br /> The reason you find these hidden rooms in such stories is because they used to be priest holes. Catholic families, clinging to the ancient faith in the sixteenth century, built these things to conceal those who were fleeing from royal authorities for their faith. Not something you see in Westerns, but a good gag. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, due to poor editing or writing or both, we never know exactly what brought Wayne to exactly that place. But this was a western and not even a good one. <br /> <br/> Gabby Hayes is here and he is clean shaven and plays dumb. An unusual circumstance for the drunk Gabby. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to figure out what's going on, and see a cordless Gabby Hayes, then watch this movie.
