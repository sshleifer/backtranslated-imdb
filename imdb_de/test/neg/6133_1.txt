Okay, first I should say, I assume that this was only done by a group of friends on a limited budget. With that in mind, it really should not be compared to blockbuster features, and my rating would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> Once there was a chance, it still violated some basic rules of filmmaking to such an extent that both the onlooker and the amateur director jumped in me. A LOT OF. <br /> <br /> Think about: Blair Witch in a car, but REALLY boring. <br /> <br /> Think about it: you left your camcorder on the dashboard and spend an hour in the park at night, then let your friends watch it. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALARM ... IF IT IS HERE POSSIBLE) was at a point where the image rewinds, and you may think you have to watch everything SCARY again. Apart from the fact that this is a pretty good idea for a low budget movie. But the concept is a fine line between really good and really bad, and let's just say it was not really good. There were just too many places where nothing happened. At first I thought that was the director's plan - you should be lulled to safety and then really scary things would happen. But no. <br /> <br /> I've always tried to find good things (and I've had plenty of time to think), and I say the music was kind of cool. And I have to pay tribute to the female lead actress that she was really scared for a very long time. But that's it. The actors, who played "infected" people, looked like they were making fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from the bug with his Edgar suit from "MIB". Chances are, if you watch this movie for any odd reason on DVD or Tivo, you can fast forward it if waiting for something gets too difficult. <br /> <br /> I hate being so critical of something, but at the same time I have seen many similar films and nothing has ever been so painful. If they've just chopped off for half an hour and added something scary, that may be decent. Maybe that's the editor's cut ...
