Waters' contribution to the world of cinema must be sought with a telescope. If something is found (by accident and good luck), it has to be analyzed with a microscope. <br /> <br /> And after it has been analyzed, it is discarded in the laboratory's "Dustbin for Useless Things". A single atom of this microscope is worth all of its films together. <br /> <br /> CB is extremely fit and deliberate. The usual Jehovah's Witnesses: comic strip dialogue, simple plot, moronly cheerful characters, bubble gum pop, overreaction, etc. Waters knows he can not make a quality movie and hides behind the mask of the "deliberately cheesy movie" -maker "- which supposedly turns him into a special kind of "anti-artist." In the world of cinema, it is often misconceived to be an anti-talent, and that's what Waters hoped - and eventually does - it's a scam Charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art, it's a plague. <br /> <br /> Maybe we blamed John Waters for inspiring Baz Luhrman, all those dreadful, stupid turkeys It's like a virus: a Waters creates five new bad directors, and then those five create more, etc. Where will it end? With "Dancer In The Dark", can this bomb be surpassed?
