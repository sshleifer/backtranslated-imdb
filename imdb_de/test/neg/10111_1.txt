Where on earth am I starting with the chaos of Darkhunters? First, the script is one of the worst ever seen in a movie or TV screen, and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. Eventually, the supposedly scary Darkhunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who helps the man he is chasing, is just as annoying as "a cucumber in a burger". I would laugh if I could do it - BUT I'm NOT! Equally ridiculous is how Carol originally had the power to see people die. A cat gave it to her when she held her in a car accident she had as a child. WHAT ???????? <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no tension or threat for a horror movie. This may not be supported by the fact that the entire action takes place in a harsh daylight. Not very atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Third, the spectacle is really terrible. Pinion proves once again that he has to speak in his mother tongue, to be anything like credible. Jeff Fahey is obviously on autopilot, but how can you blame him when he passes as Barlow (as Marlowe-Barlow? We make the joke, it's just not funny). Susan Paterno, an actress I had no idea about, is fine. She does her best with the horrible part she has and shames the other, more experienced actors. <br /> <br /> At no point is it just explained how the HUMAN figure can understand what Van Husen says to her. She obviously has a degree in crazy foreign languages. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, one moment has been well done, the car accident involving Susan. The sfx are believable through and through and if the reason for this would not have been the funny plot, this would have been cheered. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Darkhunters is that British horror can never recover from its endless state when films like this are still made and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague, though the plague would be much more scary. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p.s. The hints in other reviews that the film for some remains too intelligent, are frankly funny. It is a weak defense when some say "you did not like it because you did not understand it". The letters in my name fool you, not me.
