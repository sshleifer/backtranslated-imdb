First, the title "DAILY" is a LIE. <br /> <br /> Every "Daily Show" program opens with a creation date screen, followed by a pause and the opening announcement. On the many days they repeat a Daily Show, they slide the tape and OMIT the date and start with the opening announcement and give the false impression that the show is a new one. That's a lie. It is not mentioned that this is a re-broadcast. And this crap is just a small hint of how insidious and deceptive this show is. <br /> <br /> Also only on 4 evenings a week. This is not quite "daily" - that is from Monday to Friday - another shortcoming, for which I am grateful. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many unsuspecting young people use this fake news program as their main program, often just a news source. That makes them incredibly ignorant and much worse - badly misinformed. <br /> <br /> Although it leans left-liberal, this show can sometimes be politically amusing. The correctness is however small. Facts and information are often cleverly matched to the authors' agenda. It's often hard to tell where the facts stop and where fiction and comedy writing begin. The result is predigested, newly interpreted information that should convince and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> The remote interviews are very controversial when editing. <br /> <br /> It really loses me when it lowers God and Christians - which is too often the case. However, you will never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and his company only attack Christians, it would be considered insulting indignation. The names in the credits explain the source.
