In essence, this is a horrible movie with some features that it can or may not use for you. In "Opening" for "The Red Green Show" for the big screen, the filmmakers have overhauled the rustic charm over decades in and around the Possum Lodge with a gruesome photographed "Road Movie" Faux-Hollywood's "big" musical note and a supreme boring plot that is not adorned with sufficiently good gags to make them as entertaining as even the mediocre episode of the TV series. <br /> <br /> After you have drafted an action that holds off most of the members of the Possum Lodge for the most part of the movie and demands that virtually all sufferers be on the loveable Harold (who is the hero of the movie) the only performers who can truly shine are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who provide satisfying large screen versions of their characters with small screens.
