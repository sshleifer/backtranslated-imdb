During production, this LWT series was titled "Rocket To The Moon," a title that everyone on the set considered kitschy at the time. Then came the news that it had been renamed "Reach for the Moon," as if the addition of this new word would produce heavy metaphorical meanings concerning the characters' relationships and aspirations. This strange lack of subtlety and understanding can be felt throughout the entire fabric of the entire series, and the same tired and boring Love Triangle storyline actually extends over 7 episodes! Any television program that chooses to use the Love Triangle story for a single episode only pushes it, but it's unforgivable to put it on seven episodes. However, there are reasons to look, as the landscape of the Isle of Wight certainly offers a beautiful setting and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham, who meets all the right comedy brands. However, this is not enough. A series of performances are noticeable, especially as you face the static and emotionless wasteland that Jonathan Kerrigan calls his face. I've already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of the "fussy mother" (yes, that concerns the character development and the background story), but I was impressed by the actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast, the classic Films such as Richard Attenborough's "Oh what a nice war" and "The Eagle landed" and appeared on television including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80's, Star Trek and even Sylvestor Stallone to Hollywood (Judge Dredd of 1995), whose performance reminded me very much of the teachers I met - often incompetent men whose lives are marked with a very sad trail - it's refreshing to see that Roeves is still working after appearing in the British film "The Acid House" in 1998, and most recently with Maria Bello and Sean Bean in "The Dark". to look at this series, even if there are very few phenomena. Another actor who does his best to improve the program is Ben Miles in the role of the sex-crazy "typical man" brother (again, what an original character!). As with Roeves, the CV says it all. Since then, Miles has appeared in the Hollywood movie "V for Vendetta" and in the 2001 starred movie "The Affair of the Necklace" alongside Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the pretty capable actors I've mentioned have relatively small roles compared to the dramatic driftwood Kerrigan and Saira Todd, both of whom seem to be in Casualty too long and have not yet learned to act. Even the bearable Frances Gray suffers from such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately the lasting memory I have of her from the set is to the AD because she demands another shot of a relatively complex shot during the movie. Take, she pulled unconsciously 'her underpants from her cleft!'. Familiar faces appear in each episode - children actors from CBBC programs and dramas like "2 Point 4 Children" and other regulars from commercials like "Mr. Ben's", "Lynda" the oxo-lady "Bellingham and others I do not want to remember. Each episode half-heartedly deals with issues like teenage pregnancies, annoying pupils, and rocket building (!) ... things that made Grange Hill better when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointment and wasted opportunity to develop a really interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, they took the easy way for them, both in writing and (mostly) in casting. I would recommend "Waterloo Road" and "The Street" to the fans of good drama - especially the latter, who did it. If you like the Isle of Wight, do not reach for the moon, but grab the holiday brochure - it probably contains more character development!
