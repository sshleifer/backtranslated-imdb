This was the worst movie I ever saw Nielson in. This movie just does not have what it takes to be funny. I think the reason that Naked Gun and the like are movies is that Nielson did not have to be funny. He played the roles only as straight as possible, while the entire comedy was mostly visual. But if you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he is not. The film had only a good part, and this can be seen by some as a spoiler, and the initial credits were animated. If the entire movie had been animated, he might have been fine. I did not intend to see this movie when I saw the ads for it. The only reason I saw him was because the cards were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably the only movie I have ever seen. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a score of -100.
