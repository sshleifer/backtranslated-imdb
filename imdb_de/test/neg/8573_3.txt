I thought this movie was totally different than just another teen slasher. Well, I was totally wrong. There comes a liquid nun from the toilet seat and something very strange. I know that the Spanish culture and its films are a bit different as well, but I did not expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. You certainly faked it pretty well. Why did you make a movie without new aspects? This is just boring and it was done completely without imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought having a nun as a villain in the movie would be something really original. It turned out that it was a teen slasher. If this had been done ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to everyone, but it certainly has a comedy value! It is in some ways like a horror parody.
