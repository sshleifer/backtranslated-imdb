Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was just awful. The poor actors had no material to work with! <br /> <br /> The DVD cover invited you to a flight action movie. They would expect something like Top Gun ... Big disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that you puke. The aerial photographs clearly come from documentaries and some other material sources that were not created for this film. The brands or the fighter models did not even bother about it, and the audience will assume that they did not notice. With a little effort from author and director, it could have been very interesting. In short, it seems to be a B-movie from the 70s. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for these actors who write their name here. You must be ashamed of course.
