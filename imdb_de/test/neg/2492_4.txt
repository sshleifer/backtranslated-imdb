There are many other comments about how bad this movie is. I wanted to point out how this film made the biggest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan Project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Almost all silver in the country was used for the production of wire for electromagnetic separators. If there were two ways to choose between two alternative approaches, they simply did both. The first long-lasting nuclear reactor was lit under the stands of the University of Chicago's football stadium, with students using axes as scram mechanisms. It's a fascinating story involving hundreds of places and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> The other thing that I really did not like was the big moral debate about if we should continue the project after the capitulation of Germany. Okay, we have thousands (mostly) of men who have been working for years to get a really big boom. Does anyone believe they did not want to see it work? At the time, there was some controversy over whether we should use the device, but it was not so serious, clearly not the huge debate this movie makes.
