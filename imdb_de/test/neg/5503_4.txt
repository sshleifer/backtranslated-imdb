The original review that I had planned for this movie may have been a little over the top, so I'd like to start with the good stuff: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, as you would with a good group of People see people when the mood is light and nobody focuses on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful and it is sometimes fun. But horror, my friends, is not. I made the mistake of observing that something was expected with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I will offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. Real horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILER'S SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why should you even make a movie based on a classic story if you do not even try to stay true to the meaning, feel, tone or theme of the original? Listen attentively between the lines of the poorly written dialogue, and you hear the slow exodus of Washington Irving in his grave. I even accept the big-city detective, but ... Ricci pulls defensive fields by the bed? Come on now. In "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" there is not only nothing unusual, but also a historical BUNK. I do not care what neo-pagan ax you have to drag, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant that you sold your soul to the devil to get devilish powers. This fluffy goddess of white-witch worship "an'-it-harm-none" approach to sorcery historically goes back to the British invasion. (Parties who are interested in genuine pagan old-school practices are referred to James Frazer's The Golden Bough, if you do not believe me.) This creates a contradictory element that is thrown into the context of the film the frame for the Sleepy The hollow legend is shaken. So we have a completely different story. If this was the idea of ​​Burton, I wish he had warned us before. I also wish he had a better story than the more pedestrian seen here. And he might as well have given up the Irving claims. And the movie is not scary anyway. Not once. Not at all. The deformed tree came close, but was more than offset by the ridiculous effect of the roaring farce comedy of the Hessian. And finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God never said she was blond.
