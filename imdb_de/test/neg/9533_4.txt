This film was so blurry, wandering and uneven that it was an effort to see it all. (I actually thought that some interesting plot elements could develop.) This was nothing more than a coming-of-age movie for the 30-year-old generation. Total Mist and I have no idea what Julianne Moore was doing, because that was the only reason I took him off the shelf in the rental business.
