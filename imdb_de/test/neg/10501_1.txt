This is the BAD movie you'll probably ever see. It's up there with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort," but if you're a bad movie fan like me, the cruelty of a movie will be the greatest fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make old kung-fu sounds while zooming? WHY does the random guy stuff a Nascar memorial plate in his pocket? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after their death? What's this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh over it. This film has no continuity, no plot, really nothing. Ron Hall emotions are always out. He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast could not work its way out of a paper bag. The special effects ("Short Bus") are placed randomly and are never needed. Most scenes are lit, if at all, with a desk lamp. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY feature to search for its line outside the camera, and it's not even cut out. They just keep filming. In fact, half of this movie is not in the movie at all. It's 1/2 movie, 1/2 Sony hand cam. For most of the movie, it seems they left their boom microphone at home. Not only does this movie have a few storylines, it's a minefield of confusion and psychic pain! But I love it! Thanks, Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it because it's so funny. ($ 1.99 at Amazon, and I was in a hurry!) <br /> <br /> "I have guns! I have guns! I have guns!"
