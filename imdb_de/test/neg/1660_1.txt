Have you ever thought about watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, that's so cool, we'll have to make a splatter horror movie ourselves, I'll bet it's not as difficult as it seems" Well That was probably what went through the minds of young Campbell brothers in 2003, presumably right after watching Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead or a similar independent horror classic. However, this "demon summer" is so bad that it is embarrassing! These young amateur filmmakers obviously admire the horror genre and know their classics, but that does not make them nearly talented. I've seen a lot of lousy B-movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but frankly this is one of the biggest bitches ever made. And it is very sad to be so open-hearted because the entire cast and crew had clearly good intentions. There is almost no script. A duo of thugs simply steal a mysterious book from a bum, and as he reads some passages, one of them mutates into a vile demon that kills members of all youth groups: dorks, hot catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. That's it , of course, for all obligatory clich√©s, like the hot girl who indulges in the biggest dork etc ... The performances are really painful to hear and none of those annoying teenagers uses mimicry! They just stand immobile until the script says it's their turn to interact with each other. I hate that! Some make-up effects are subtle but not spectacular, and the soundtrack contains some of the most horrible punk songs ever. This movie should never have been published ... I can well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production, but it is absolutely stupid and does not have the least redeeming element. Not even a little amateur nudity, damn it!
