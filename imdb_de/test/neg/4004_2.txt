This film is bundled together with "Gli fumavano the Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired in the DVD prints. First, both films are very dark - sometimes it's difficult to see exactly what happens. Second, none of the films have subtitles and you have to watch a dubbed movie - although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better dub. Personally, I prefer subtitles, but for non-purists, that's not a problem. However, these DVD issues are not the fault of the original filmmakers - just the indifferent package released four decades later. <br /> <br /> The film is about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR issue as Van Johnson Garfield looks just like Judy Garland. No way does he look like Garfield. He misses the beard, has the wrong hair color and the wrong hairstyle and is in no way close (trust me, I'm an American history teacher and we get paid to know these kinds of things!). The real life of Garfield was a Civil War general and looked like the boys in the Smith Brothers coughboxes. Also, using another actor to give Johnson the voice to sync is simply surreal. Never before or since has Van Johnson been so macho !! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a convincing general or macho president. In addition to the stupid castings, President Garfield's death was in no way comparable to this film. It's obvious that the filmmakers actually make money out of crazy speculation about conspiracies related to the death of JFK and not Garfield. Garfield was shot dead in Washington, DC (not Dallas) by a lonely gunman with severe mental health problems - not a group of men with guns. In the opinion of most experts, Garfield (more than two months later) were in fact incompetent physicians - who were studying to get a bullet (to no avail) and never cleaned their hands or equipment. In other words, as George Washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodshed on pneumonia), he died due to misconduct. They had no right in the movie ... except that actually President Garfield was filmed. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is almost unrelated to real history, it's like a history lesson taught by someone from another planet or someone with a serious brain injury. Why not be ninjas, battle robots and the greek gods ?! Apart from some decent acting and production values, because the script is absolute cow dung, I do not recommend anyone to watch it. It's just a complete mess.
