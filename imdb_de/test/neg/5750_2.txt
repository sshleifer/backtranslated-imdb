Well, now that all the director / productions friends and relatives have posted their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals, it's time to show reviews from people who actually paid $ 10 for it. " Dear Director Jesse (the only other of his films I've ever seen) suffers from "loggerheads" lack of focus and too many ideas put into an indie budget. I swear, the guy may have more luck with the miniseries. I have always waited for the different storylines to come together, but they only intercept at points that were obviously visible to all but the closest observers. It was like watching a season of Lifetime TV movies put together into one long sketch in the old "Carol Burnett" show. Perhaps an enterprising male worshiper could take his girlfriend with him and then exclaim, "Hey ... remember all the chicks we visited last year ... those about the adoptive mother ... those about the gays ... about the Christian Housewife We went to THREE Chick Flicks last year and now we have to visit Terminator 4! "I think you have to do anything to get a well-known actor to raise money, but what does Bonnie Hunt do in this movie? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this attempted "performance" will not send Mr. Oscar to her door. I mean (spoke of Lifetime Original Movies), was not Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett available? Ms. Hunt always got cold for me, maybe she should have played the other mother? I wish I had chosen "Capote" to fill my weekly gay-topic indie grants ... well, maybe next week. I think there is a good reason why Capote plays a lot of theaters all over the NYC area and this one at one; Let the traders believe that this film is going in the opposite direction, if you do not trust this rating!
