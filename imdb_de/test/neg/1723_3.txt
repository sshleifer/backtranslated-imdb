Not only that the VHS and DVD cover (at least in Europe) shows a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the film, the acting is so bad that the movie is fun. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to laugh a little bit about a movie that should be serious. Look at Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man who teaches you how to turn bad guys over empty cardboard boxes! Too bad about Dennis Hopper, the example of Travoltas in his own "Schlachtfelderde". For those who want to see a good movie about the destruction of the earth by a terrible power, please do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and watch Armageddon for the 20th time!
