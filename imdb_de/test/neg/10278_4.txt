I saw this movie a few weeks ago and I have to say: I was not impressed at all. I connect with the other posters when it comes to good performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the panel I found a review of an anonymous poster that captured some of the key points. It says: "Deed Poll" is a film that raises many questions, but hardly gives a few answers; a movie that is disturbing and above any categorization attempt; an experiment and a very conventional sex drama despite some shocking scenes. The brilliant spectacle of Barbara Kowa and André Schneider make up for the sometimes very impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) big plotting holes and technical briefs (especially in the sound). The boredom that the audience has for 40 minutes remains. "Unfortunately, the story did not fascinate me at all.The protagonists are cold, ambitious people.They take a lot of drugs and have (incestuous) sex.And the direction seemed Often virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: The poor sound quality was enormously disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the movie? What is the message behind it? The anonymous reviewer said, " Somehow, Biermann has made no clear statement and so the film is hanging without news in the air. Therefore, I am the boredom that I reproach the film. The film is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral, and so on. It does not take long to spot the mistakes: the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible for long stretches (they clearly have difficulty with the English pronunciation), the character of the character dumb brother is not very well developed. Some moments are very promising However, in the scene where the callboy is skinned (the only true love scene), an intensity is reached that would make the whole movie happy to see for a long time. As a spectator you have to regret the chances he has. "Again I have to agree, I loved the final scene, especially because of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider's beautifully captured faces, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I suffered in the first thirty minutes Sex scenes, however, were aesthetically staged and cut perfectly.) Overall, "Deed Poll" was not my thing - a good, controversial idea that was wasted - but it was an interesting one to watch How a movie can be made with virtually no money - if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this might have been a better movie.
