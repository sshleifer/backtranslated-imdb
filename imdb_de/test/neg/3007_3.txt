This is one of the most beautiful films of recent years. The fact that this was a virtual target (about $ 1.8 million, the DVD says: you think they funded even less) makes it all the more impressive. Not only the photography, but also the design and above all the places (Eastern Montana), which are at the same time authentic American and beyond the world. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that there is no coherent film that fits. An extremely promising construction of the last 48 hours, in which a rural town was cleared in 1955 before being flooded for a dam, is dubbed with pretentious hocus-pocus alluding to angels and a dying child. And what is presented as a "real world" is a hopeless arc. Note to the Polish brothers: The Coen brothers are funny - they are not. <br /> <br /> Many cineastes will undoubtedly find the rich symbolism and inscrutability of "Northfork" as the mark of some kind of profundity. Demanding types struggle through the night in coffee houses, while Braindead crowds watch "Charlie's Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you insist .... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, only recommended as a case study for filmmakers, because of their 'impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.
