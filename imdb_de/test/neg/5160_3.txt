I should have known that it was a sign of the future when the trailer for this movie bored me. <br /> <br /> After watching some "indie" movies based on the reviews here and then finding them My view is completely different from the other reviewers. I've been wondering if it's possible that I see completely different films from these people, or are they perhaps friends / family members of the filmmakers trying to "twist" their work? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing the homage of an amateur to Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except with lesser actors, a silly score (undermining various scenes) and incredible leaps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two of the players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please, please, please, stop trying "Be" Samuel L. Jackon a la Pulp Fiction. Nobody can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please come up with something original. It's a nasty thing to throw out this stuff pretending to be Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Just awful, and I really can not see how anyone could say this is a good movie. It's a shame that people somehow managed to reach a score of 8.5, just like movies like Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas. There is nowhere near these films; A 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give a 3.
