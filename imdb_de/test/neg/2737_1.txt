This movie is ONLY a great movie if you need something to sit and laugh about stupidity. As a geologist, this film misleads most important facts and uses actors who are too young to even be on their field. It's interesting to see bubbling lava in huge caverns below the surface of the earth. It is also funny, as shown, that seismically active areas are massively destroyed by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. You seem to forget that the building standards in these areas are higher and a major quake would be needed to do so much damage. It's also funny how much they make the shoreline of Washington State and even Oregon look like they're beautiful beaches in Southern California. The jelly-donut analogy is very entertaining, even if its use is wrong. The director would do well to add more comic relief to the two "exalted" graduate students.
