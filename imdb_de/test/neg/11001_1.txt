I had to suffer from this movie three times when I was a zombie extra in the director's new After Sundown movie. When I saw this movie for the first time, the director was standing next to me, and a clearly fake and cheesy-looking hand emerged out of nowhere and grabbed one of the figures. I could not bear it anymore, I laughed right in front of the guy. The film has no direction at all and the only thing that could make this film decent (female nudity) was nowhere to be found. I'm a fan of low-budget horror movies, but that was just too much for me. The worst part was that I had to see it so often. Do not expect the new movie to get even better.
