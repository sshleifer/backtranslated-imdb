Oh dear - just as Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, the 39 steps) could make out this unpleasant, cheap shocker, I'm puzzled. Do not look for hidden depths or deep meanings - there are none. It's just awful, run down and cheap. The only redeemer is the home life of the inspector who directs the investigation - his wife takes herself as a gourmet chef and constantly exposes her poor husband to her vile culinary experiments. That's amusing and I just saved it when I put the movie in the "awful" clip, but the movie as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. I think that was Hitchcock's penultimate movie - maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
