This movie has more on the plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. There are some good benefits, but the subplots are not important and largely unexplained. <br /> <br /> Also, I've found all characters unlikely, and if you can not identify with at least one character, there is not much exciting. All in all, this is a classic example of trying to do too little.
