A frustrating documentation. Louis Kahn's son, who had seen his father only minimally in his childhood because he belonged to only one of the three separate families that his father had founded, takes on the task of learning more about his father's life by exploring his architecture. It sounds like a great idea for a documentary, but ends up being flat and uninteresting. Unfortunately, the fundamental problem is that Kahn's son Nathaniel is not only one of the protagonists of the film - he is also a director, author, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to work well in one of these roles. Although he looks like a nice guy, he does not have much screen presence, so the fact that he's the only constant in the movie is wearing out. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also appears as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer - there are several points on which an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera shows a shot of Nathaniel that offers little more than a blank look and a kind of shy "uh-huh", as if he had panicked something, that he had to come up with something to answer. Sometimes I was embarrassed watching people who had really interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things that they could do with their time) and it seemed to me that they were in the hands of an interviewer, who would rely on her to lead the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's dual role as a documentary as well as a lost son seems to hurt the movie more than helping. One senses that some of the interviewees are reluctant to deal with the negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, presumably because Nathaniel does not know whether he is looking for the truth or just wants to hear nice stories about his father - preferably those who who confirm his hope that his father has really taken more care of Nathaniel and his mother than it seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer could come directly from this conflict. The only person pushing Nathaniel is his own mother, but these conversations feel a bit like a bad teenage drama (are not you mad, Mom? ") And do not offer much help to us (or Nathaniel) Understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from his surroundings. <br /> <br /> What the film really needs is made by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to compensate for his subjectivity and inexperience independent director could do that I have distanced myself from the material, have thought more about what the interviewees could contribute, and hoped to cut out those parts of the documentation process that simply do not work, such as the weird segment with the man claiming Having seen Kahn die (which seemed like Nathaniel was only being sucked by a madman) or all of that with Kahn's first cousin together, who had nothing to say about Kahn or Nathaniel. Too many times, Nathaniel lets him stand up or strangers near a Kahn building button to tell them that his father was the designer. (Ahhh huh, Thaaat is nice, sir. Umm I have to go now.) I understand why these things could be important to Nathaniel and that sometimes it's interesting to show the documentary process, but this is one of those Examples Documentary can be too personal. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I found the score written for the film great! (One of the strangest moments in the whole thing for me was, however, when the speaker quoted Kahn as a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum.The music is played simultaneously Time? Beethoven's NINTH Symphony. A mishap? Who knows? It made me laugh.) Kahn was a great architect, and it's clear he was an unusual person and had a fascinating life story. There is definitely a good documentary about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's search for the father he does not know, but I'm not sure that's an interesting story. Neither does this movie work so well.
