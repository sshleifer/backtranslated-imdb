I have to say, I was disappointed with this movie. Although it is well played and directed, the underlying story trudges too slowly. <br /> <br /> Granted, I would have preferred it in a different mood. I giggled a lot, but rarely laughed loudly; and it was actually a feeling of excitement to find out who won. But unlike another movie my wife recorded the same day (one none of us had heard of before), it faded in comparison. This is significantly better than the average fare. However, if you have limited time (like me) and only want to watch the best and most entertaining videos, save them for later. <br /> <br /> [Rate: 7/10]
