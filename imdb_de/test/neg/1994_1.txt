I've just seen that stinking old kettle on TV. Best with a very large bottle of Dr. med. Seen from Jurd's Jungle Juice, this exploitative cheese festival is hilarious. On the (very slim) side, Raquel was in physical bloom, she looks good and you can see some of her as she plays a go-go dancer; She had great legs, that's for sure. In Los Angeles footage, there is also little interest for screen fans. '69, and in smaller parts discovered actors who evolved. Ron Rifkin ('Brothers and Sisters'), veteran Thesp, delivers an early performance as "Sailor", the "fagot junkie" bartender who advises Raquel on the villain. One could also recognize the shocking security officials in the hit-and-run scene - it's a very early appearance by Gordon Jump, who performed so well in 'Soap' as Piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> <The "conspiracy" of "Flareup" as it is follows the efforts of an exotic dancer (Welch) fleeing her murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic Hollywood sludge from the production line - painting by numbers script, pedestrian guidance, hokey shots, finishes and effects, ultra-cheeky stick music, plywood sets, and related performances. <br /> <br /> The cast is as horrible as the script. While Raquel is able to perform fairly in the right vehicle, this old-fashioned tunic is so bad he has no chance and the audience is not. One of my favorite moments is when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees the policeman from Vegas following her ex-murderer, and asks, "How did you get here?" - which of course he answers "In an airplane". Oh, humanity ... and you will not be able to avert your gaze from the doctor (Michael Rougas), who has one of perhaps the worst walk-ons in the long, sad history of bad cameos. I do not think I've ever seen anyone so bad in one place before. <br /> <br /> Raquel's love interest Joe (James Stacy) saunters through the movie with a fixed look somewhere between confused and embarrassed - and no wonder. This bomb will bring the cast to almost every clich√© in the book, from Raquel's spectacularly awful turn in the dreadful nightmare montage, to the sheer punch of the "romantic" horse ride along Leo Carillo Beach. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** - The only interesting thing in the entire movie is the break-up, where Raquel finally finds himself and plays the title by setting the villain on fire. Whoever was the stunt type, has really earned his money - like Yorba Linda, he goes into a heatwave. But even this pretty spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew goes into action shortly before the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many shitty things on 'Flareup' that it's strangely compelling; I wondered if this could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The answer seemed to be a clear "yes" ... until I saw the movie that followed, Roger Corman's mega-trash "Caged Heat" classic, "The Big Doll House," which takes Awful to a whole new level. I can heartily recommend these two Shlockers as a double bill. You will laugh yourself.
