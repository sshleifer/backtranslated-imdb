The hockey game I play and watch has something called "speed," and the actual squat scenes in this flabby movie never get close to capturing. Add to this a story that is a clich√©, predictable and stupid as stupid, while the music of the 80s stuns your senses in every scene and you have "Youngblood". Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, anyway. Gimme Dunlop, Braden and the Hansons anytime ... ONE out of ten.
