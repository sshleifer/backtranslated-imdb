It's not plot-driven, OK; It is not a character study. there is no action, alright; There is no point, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps it should be the boredom and absurdity of living in Palestine and parts of Israel, in a state of violence, petty disagreements, deep-seated hostility, etc. But mostly it's long, long scenes where nothing happens - or things that look as if they're meaningful (a checkpoint tower that crashes to the ground, an Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, a crouching tiger woman, bullets in) distracting a halo), but if you try to derive a meaning, there is none. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie in no time, and it makes absolutely no difference, except that it may be a little less boring.
