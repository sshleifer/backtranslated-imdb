This is the main problem with this film, along with a large number of Québecois' biggest films: Demandingly made in a sophisticated way. <br /> <br /> It's really sad, but "big shots" filmmakers (Dodge Stratus drive ...) from this province think they have the truth, they know what the little people like. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time a big movie like this (30 million)? !!?) is done, it cuts off many others who will not see their movie because the government's help is missing. Thus it produces mediocrity; Only movies of "friends of the family" are made. <br /> <br /> I'm angry and it's me. I was expecting Nouvelle-France to await a journey in the life of my ancestors, but I was in an accumulation of contradictions: a French accent (we must please our cousins, the language of our Québecois), and there is a lack of historical research is only a few. Add a campy love story and the same music score that keeps playing, and the stupid Québecois viewer opens up to ask for more. I'm glad that this presumptuous piece was not planned like Dodge stratus Big Shots ... It will help filmmakers who are not in the very cautious "movie business" of Quebec. <Br /> <br /> Rent a Cruising Bar instead and have a really good time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for ruining such a fantastic title.
