Bad news for anyone wanting to film a full-length parody of a Lifetime Network movie - the creators of A Deadly Encounter have already done it, albeit unintentionally. All the Lifetime Tropics are there - a divorced mother at risk from a confused stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who cheated on her during her marriage, of course), and a police department that rejects her complaints and forces her to stand up for herself. Particularly stunning is the scene in which the heroine, after experiencing a break-in and attempting to assassinate her mother through her seemingly omnipresent stalker, relieves the stress of shopping! I experienced first-hand the harassment of a co-worker from a fraud she encountered in the church. I know stalking is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.
