<br /> <br /> Very slow, plodding movie with a confusing plot. The only hope of the film to interest the audience is the unfounded nudity that is thrown in at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is in vain and her looks do not last when she's on screen with much younger Peta Wilson. Not sure what this movie is about.
