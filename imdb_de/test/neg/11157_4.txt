As I watched "End of Days," I felt like the filmmakers might try to make it unique to the average Hollywood action movie. Of course they failed, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams was actually trying to direct this time instead of just producing another flat action movie. He tried to give the film atmosphere by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en"), but it feels like a cheap trick to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director and offers nothing more than basic shoot-outs and battle scenes, apart from the lackluster "battle". As a photographer, Hyams shows actual skill and some good frame work and movement, but it's nothing like solid work. <br /> <br /> Writer Andrew Marlowe is the film's biggest enemy. In part, the script does indeed show what it's like to be a good religious thriller, and sometimes it even shows some intellectual thinking (the temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but those little pluses are repressed by a flow of negatives. Generic dialogues / characters, gaping plots and handy plot points that happen to cause all characters to go in the right direction are just some of the standard black holes in Hollywood that fall into Marlowe's script. The shadow of the good movie could have faded very quickly. <br /> <br /> The film is surprisingly well staffed. Arnold, who still has this larger-than-life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the outskirts of the cop with only above-average results. Stay firm to be the invincible hero Arnie. Gabriel Byrne is the strength of the ensemble and brings the role of Satan in a beautiful cynicism. In a rogue role too overreacted, Byrne holds back and adds a little more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak can bring at least a few giggles into the movie, as usual, but he did a better job. Also, look for an outstanding little role from Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams looked like he wanted to separate them from the faceless mass of Hollywood action movies. He was heading in the right direction, but he had neither the script nor the originality to get it there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
