This is by far the worst of the toxicity series. The spectacle in Tokyo is terrible and you can understand about half of it. The main problem with this film are the sudden changes from the original. As if there were another friend of Toxies in this one or it could be the same character, just with a different name and played by another chick. Why is this movie made like a Disney movie? After about fifteen minutes it gets good with the Gore and everything. There are two great murders, then the film is about to shit. After the films have expired 20 minutes, the film is entertained bearded. H * LL IS BEARLY WATCHABLE. Well, if you are not drunk, do not look at this movie. YOU WERE WARNED.
