What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you are getting involved in when you rent this. The quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why are the shots always so close to the actors? And why are they always centered? There is nothing to see. (And the actors are so handsome that she beats.) <br /> <br /> The writing and the dialogue are just awful. This intro scene with the British guy is hilarious. Just try and listen to these words, they make little sense, just go around in circles. The lines in the rest of the film sound as if they were drawn from romance novels and science fiction romance, as if the authors had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they are saying. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. I feel bad for the actors involved in this project. Embarrassing!
