What could have been a great movie about the late poker pro (pre-poker madness)? Stu "The Kid" Unger became a disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can see that the filmmakers have been working on a short string budget. Everything looks cheap. The timelines were a bit strange for me. Casting Michael Imperoli from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice. He looked too old to play with the baby face Stu, he looked way too healthy for a cola addict (if you look at the recordings of the WSOP Main Event 1997, the real stu was so skinny and he had virtually none Nose of too much cocaine he wore these sunglasses to hide them) and I had always expected Adriana to show up and "Chris-tu-phur !!!" <br /> <br /> The fact that he had a son from Angie's former relationship, who had committed suicide in the late 1980s, was also skipped. <br /> <br /> Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten, I kept thinking he would announce that the tunes are playing in Stu's head. As with the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for real Stuey material, you should check ESPN Classic as they continue to run the 1997 WSOP Main Event. Or try YouTube. Avoid this move like a bad beat.
