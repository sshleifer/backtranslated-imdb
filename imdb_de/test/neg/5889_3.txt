Born and raised in Odessa and graduated from the "other" high school in the late 70's, I had mixed feelings about this film in Odessa High School. I am no longer living in Odessa, but I am always a Texan at heart. I did not like the fact that this 80,000-plus city was portrayed as a dirty little town. If I'm wrong, please correct me, but I think OHS is also playing in the stadium stadium and the sign "Home of the Permian Panthers" shown in the stadium was Permian. Every year I would have liked a little confirmation of the city's rivalry in the city, OHS vs. Permian. I'm curious why the result of the game has changed. I think it would have been just as dramatic if the actual result were presented. All in all, the movie was okay, I got a little homesick and remembered the "good old days" of MOJO.
