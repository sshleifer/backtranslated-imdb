Whatever the producer intended, he completely missed. The Lone Ranger is not a camp, but "the" symbol of good in the whole world. And it is a total violation of the character's mind that the only true Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was banned from wearing his mask at public appearances when this movie was released. <br /> <br /> Whelp, Long History In short, the only salvation from this gross (and poorly executed) distortion was that I had the honor of joining Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio this year as part of a tour, which resulted from the bad press about the treatment of Mr. Moore. Needless to say, Mr. Moore's character, integrity and presence far outstripped the film. <br /> <br /> Some things can not be done better. There is only one ranger.
