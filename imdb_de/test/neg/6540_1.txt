"The Puffy Chair" was a maximum waste of 84 minutes of my life that can no longer be adequately retrieved and used (even "The Blair Witch Project" was a better use of the precious moments of life). It has to be referred to as "The Puffy Chair" because only "swollen" chairs can accommodate the extremely "bloated", even important brothers who drool them for public use; and obviously they are so full of themselves that they assumed that the public really wants to consume their slobber. "The Puffy Chair" made "The Wooly Boys" look like a cinematic masterpiece! Valley of the Dolls, Beyond Valley of the Dolls, Pink Flamingos, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, Urban Cowboy, The Blob - all of which would benefit you Time better to look at "The Puffy Chair". The depicted characters are either too predictable or too little in the normal, emotional reflexes to be even nearly sympathetic or credible. At one point in the movie, with the characters in the same town, if you look closely you can see that part of the city is apparently in the south of the United States and the other half is in Maine. This is a city, right?
