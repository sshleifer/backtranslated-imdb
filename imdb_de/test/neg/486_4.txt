Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. After the same stories have been used over and over again, new generation directors come up with different ideas. Of course that does not mean that they are all great. I think Okul is one of them. It's supposed to be a scary movie, but it's not. It's not terribly successful either. So, what is it? Actors are so average, especially Deniz Akkaya is quite annoying the teacher role. I'm sure it could have been better if it was tried harder. Maybe you focus on a topic, how to make it scary or vice versa. This time, the directors missed the target. ** out *****
