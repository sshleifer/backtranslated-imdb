First of all let me say the movie SOUNDED very interesting: A serial killer who copies the works of Edgar Allan Poe (one of my authors of all time). Sounds cool, right? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. And that's no exaggeration. I have seen many very, very bad movies. This takes the cake. And I even prepared for a bad movie before I started the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe the author should have studied a law enforcement procedure: If you have the murderer's name, his entire life story is a criminal record, and HIS ADDRESS, where should you first look? Hmm. , , possibly. , , his house? What?! NO! That's an absurd idea, Anthony! How can you suggest something so obvious and thoughtful instead of going into a bowling alley? * Spoilers end * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good, but the acting is bad or vice versa. , , But that was just all wrong with what you could find. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest pet was how the police / FBI acted. <br /> <br /> For example: Black FBI Agent: "Okay, threatened woman, just sit in this car in an empty parking lot while I go in and see the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to sound." Sounds good to me you?" Morian FBI agent: "Yeah, it sounds okay to me, go ahead, I will not focus on my surroundings, or at least control the perimeter." Black FBI Agent: "Excellent, I would do that!" Honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, borrow this movie so you can learn not to act. , , or if you are a human and want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Half a point, just to make a movie and get it in stores. Congratulation. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
