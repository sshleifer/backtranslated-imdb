Ah, another Seagal movie. No less than a few months arrive to populate the shelves of the video business. As bad as lost? No. But that does not mean much. Like perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to quit, but he has yet to get a last job to be crossed twice by his boss. He ends up in jail and is friends with a gangster who helps him get out of hand and seek a reward. <br /> <It's good to see that Seagal is not playing an agent, a policeman or what he normally plays. We actually have a location in the US in Las Vegas, it seems. Then, as usual, an Eastern European area. There is no wire-fu here as well.Don Fauntleroy does a good job. <br /> <br /> However, most action and battle scenes with Stevie are clearly double. Scenes from other films, lack of realism and logic even a tiny little situation. Seagal and Treech make a so-so-team-inspiring (unintentional) laugh a minute. Looks the rest. <br /> <br /> Several notable faces show up in the slum. Sleepy Kevin Tighe is a long way Nick Mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode for a check-in. No more rappers. Sorry? <br /> <br /> At this point, the action scenes and actions are more predictable and are typically recycled more than ever before an outdated scene that Seagal needs to leave or hang up. He should have come out a while ago.
