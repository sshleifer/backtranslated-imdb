A stupid show in the vein of the others with terrible music and a laughing track that must come from I Love Lucy. I was released from TV for such shows, but won the first season for $ 3.00 on big lots. Should buy the Van Damme movie instead. <br /> <br /> If I was a conspiracy theorist, he believed that a small group of people worked against real families and kept coming up with this affront / propaganda to undermine the family values ​​that I refer to this show Married With Children, Family Guy, etc. But I am not. <br /> <br /> BTW: I'm not a Christian, love the Simpsons and Peep Show. I've looked at two episodes and thought that if shows like these are popular with who they are popular with. Then I remembered all the photos of the Walmart people who got around on the internet and thought ah ha! It is no wonder that our world-time culture is a joke.
