I saw the other 30-40 minutes of this movie on TV recently and I agree that this is by far the worst in the series. Nothing is funny, even Randy Quaid can not save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny in N.L. Euro. Holiday, and he is even worse here. The only funny scene is where they are at the airport and a guy dressed as Santa passes the camera shouting, "Has anyone lost that?" how he holds up a prosthesis ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star out of ****
