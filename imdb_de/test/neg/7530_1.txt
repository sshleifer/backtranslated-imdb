I do not mean to sound presumptuous here, but calling the next cult classic is another example of lowering the standards that filmmakers have for themselves. This film is an insult to everything we consider sacred and not to the good "artistic" nature of the insult. This film becomes the archetype of the PAINFUL dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.
