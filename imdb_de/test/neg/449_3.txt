Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a staunch member. King used to be a bit fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests. The party used to be centrist too, but that was another era. Well, like Larry, it's far left. <br /> <br /> At least 90 percent of all guests who have attended King's Show in the last year or two are liberals sitting there beating President Bush and any conservative they can think of ... night for night. Bill Mahar, one of the viscous ones, is - and you can look up - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV Show. You can count on other left-wingers to be in King's Show every week, but do not hold your breath and wait for a conservative. They are few and far from each other. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the media overkill innovators. It all started with the O.J. Simpson Trial night after night, that's all you've ever seen in the mid-90s. Whatever the last gossip about Anna Nicole Smith, the murder of Petersen or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or any other tabloid, you can bet Larry will beat him to death. Unfortunately, all other networks are doing the same thing now. Larry was a leader in this regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice, such as marriage. I'm not joking; I heard him say it. The joke is that he got married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has few reservations, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is unaware. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil to explain to him regularly some facts of life. Larry will nod, but he does not understand more than when Billy Graham spoke to him. King also gets famous for the "softball" interview, which means he does not ask hard questions. This is partly because most of his guests are politically convinced. People know that the show has a one-hour public relations show on King's Show. <br /> <br /> What this all meant is a heavy decline in ratings over the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal and Boulevard TV mentality and switched from King and CNN to Fox News.
