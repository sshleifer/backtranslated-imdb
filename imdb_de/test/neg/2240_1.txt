Quentin just wrote and filmed a really good movie in my opinion, and that was the award-winning Pulp Fiction. However, most of the films, especially the youngest ones, were real, real turkeys. People still rate him and his stuff today and I really can not understand why. Nowadays there are many other directors and writers who offer much better entertainment in all areas of their films. From that point on, I will not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie. Inglorious was too long and worse, you felt it. The humor was minimal and not so humorous. The violence was nothing new (minus the final scene). The dialogue was sometimes very VERY undressed. <br /> <br /> For some, they will love this movie; and for others, they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought that the topic of Nazis was finally finished with the fantastic German film The Fall of 2004.
