This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The highlight of the film is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> Trading is pathetic. I know that acting is hard work and stuff, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people is as if Michael J. Fox is performing a brain operation. It is shaky at best. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments makes you believe that the movie is being saved as Chris by the acting talents of Dan Gordon. Only Dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was the good show. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked like someone was lighting an orange light from a model in a refrigerator. Sure, there was a bit of computer animation over them, but it did not help. I suspect that the special effects for this movie were created and rendered using a single late 1980s Amiga computer.
