* some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie can not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes are rare. This remake of one of Hitchcock's biggest movies, Psycho, could have been a lot better. <br /> <br /> First of all, the person who pops the movie must have been psychic. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What are you thinking? Unlike the "harmless", almost childlike Bates Anthony Perkins could portray, Vaughn looks like he could be a murderer. To make his bates seem innocent, Vaughn looks gay. Many of the other actors did not seem to fit in with their roles, including Julianne Moore, who just did not seem to fit into the movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from the cruel casting, the cinematography is remarkably shabby, though they have redesigned the scene for the scene. The only thing they added was random shots of objects like clouds or a naked woman, between the shots of murdered characters. These shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot anyway, and again made no sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, this psycho-remake, which could be a decent picture, turned out to be a complete waste of time.
