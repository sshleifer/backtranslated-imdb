I bought this movie at a market three years ago. I have to give it to you as I sit down and look at him. I thought 'OK! This will be another big action B movie. "Obviously I was wrong <br /> I was getting bored and had enough of this movie. Although I wanted to see something happen in the end, I really felt like it annoyed me. The folks behind the movie have brought some well-known name actors into this project. But what did you think? Even these actors could not save this movie. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie .. I felt that this was a waste of money money. A few months later I sent the tape for a good cause. I did not want to see it again. <br /> <br /> Sorry! But if you're thinking of watching a movie and then falling asleep ... I highly recommend it ... Me? I prefer to go to Pro Plus and look at something decent ..! <br /> <br /> Disappointing 1 in 10!
