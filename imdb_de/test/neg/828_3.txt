CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS For about four years I have been an avid fan of Ali G. Sacha. Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy. His best creation in my opinion is Borat in what he does and says to the people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. I did not bother paying money to see it in the cinema. My guess is that I did not expect much, but when I recently rented the DVD, I found it rather sad. The best part of Ali that took Mickey away from others was largely missing and the script, which was a plot, was damned awful; hook up all the car batteries to blow a safe - REALLY !! ?? <br /> <br /> This movie shows that some things can run too long and definitely will not be broadcast on the big screen. The movie also had that sweet end that I had expected from British films. Where did all the good British movie ideas go? However, there were the strange, very funny moments, like the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM the Q, saying "Shaven haven - RESPECT". <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I'm an Ali G and Borat fan, and I enjoyed a lot of his interviews (especially with Anita Roddick from the Body Shop), but this film got pretty cross in my head. If there is to be another movie, I hope it is a lot better than this old Tripe. <br /> <br /> Weasel100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
