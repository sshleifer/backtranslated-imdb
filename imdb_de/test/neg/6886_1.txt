This movie could have been summarized in about 10 minutes. I do not know what everyone else smoked and call this beautiful movie. I have a feeling that a few hours of my life have been stolen and I want them back. I would classify this as a Battlefield Earth category. Yeah guys, that's so bad. It would be just as good to keep watching a two-minute clip of this movie, and it would have the same effect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!!
