I remember all the hype surrounding this movie when Aaliyah was killed. As a fan of Ms. Rice's novels, my first thought was, "How can you make Queen Of The Damned without Vampire Lestat first?" <br /> <br /> Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can now see how they did it. If you've read these books, you can imagine removing the bloody parts of Vampire Lestat, squeezing Marcus and Marius into a figure, and removing everything related to Lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the vampires' theater and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then dammed in Queen Of The Damned in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important part of Lestat's character. His inner agony that he had to kill to live, the fact that he carefully chose murderers as victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> Also important to the story is that we are losing the "Twins History" that are the genesis of Ms. Rice's vampires. And although I'm sure that cannibalism was too intense to be shown on screen, they could have been a little closer, showing us more of ancient Egypt. Worse, we threw that love interest in between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles are basically an American yoni story. For those who do not know, Yoni is another form of hentai (Japanese porn comics). Yoni, however, is about gay male relationships that are told by a woman. I am sure that many men oppose the "gays" of the characters, but in this film they have gone in the opposite direction. Because instead of Lestat pursuing murderers, he is looking for young female groupies. <br /> <br /> And the other mistakes in logic and action are enormous. In the beginning, Lestat emerges from a centuries-long sleep and later asks Marius how he made it through the fifties in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is and says he slept through that time. You wonder how Lestat knows about fashion and music of the 50s, because he himself slept through the same period of time. About Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle nothing is mentioned. I think that's a pity. It's like "Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie I thought was really bad. The only good thing was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was bad, the accents drove me to the wall, and all the really recessed parts of the book were removed, leaving us with only a hollow shell that looked like Enkil after it had been sucked dry /> <br /> If If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire or even some old Dark Shadows episodes. Let this rest a piece in the piece, with a stake through the heart, garlic cloves around the neck and a bottle of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Remember that this was the case before the death of Aaliyah. It was intended to go straight to video, there was no movie release planned. It is obvious why this was so. It's just sad that someone as talented as she is will be remembered for this dog of a movie, rather than something she really shines on. <br /> <br /> I rate this with a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10.
