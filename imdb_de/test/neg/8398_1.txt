First and foremost, I am amazed to see that this movie received a rating of 7 on this website. At first, I thought it might be industry people logging into IMDb and improving the rating. but after looking at rotten tomatoes and seeing that the film has a 76% approval rate, it seems that people have just been seduced into holding the presumptuous crap for depth. I mean, this movie is just awful. The drama is just terrible, but the rest of the movie is worse. At least the drama brings some (unintentional) laughter. <br /> <br /> The plot is a youthful skateboard boy who is questioned along with his friends about a murder that took place in a park where they skate. and that's it. The rest of the movie is made up of the awful spectacles mentioned above, terrible dialogues, slow-motion shots of people, faces of people, skaters that often fit in with music that does not fit into the scene. Maybe that was done to be "cool" or experimental or hip. or maybe it was done in the hope that it would make people believe that it is somehow profound, but it does not work. nothing works in this movie. it is presumptuous garbage. I can not recommend it enough.
