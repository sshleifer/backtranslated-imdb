The animated live-action hybrid version of Gulliver's 1977 travels (or rather "travel" as it only reaches up to Lilliput) has not been released, and it's not too hard to understand why. Michel Legrand has a few catchy tunes, but they inspire lyricist Don Black only to "a simple fact remains / no one here suffers from growing pains."
