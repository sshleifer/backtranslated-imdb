Wasting is just a waste of time. MTV is made for TV movies nowadays. A friend of mine recommended this and I hired to mention unnecessarily that soon I would not pursue any further recommendations from her. This movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use. The problem is that you are not really interested in any of the characters because of the lack of credibility and discipline. This movie is annoying in a word, from the awkward camera angles to dialogue quality and tempo. The 'digital' format tries to be realistic, but distracts attention. If you want a real scope for drug use, you should look out for Requiem for a Dream.
