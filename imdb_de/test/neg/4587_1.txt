This movie will be included in my "Worst Films Ever Made" file. I have a copy of this movie that I watch if I want a good laugh, and that's not a comedy. I am disappointed that such great actors have agreed to be in such a trash. This film is inaccurate (in its portrayal of hockey), offensive (to Canadians), and I was not even so impressed with acting. Even the story was a bit weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're in luck. If so, I'm sorry.
