From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre made a series of very successful Mr. Moto films. While technically they were B movies, they were way better than typical films of the genre. Lorre, however, was tired of doing these very repetitive films and told friends he wanted from the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was thrilled, but his plans to get more complicated and satisfying roles were not realized when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of those movies, and it's pretty obvious that the studio is not much into the movie because I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins maybe ... but the movie did not make much sense anyway. <br /> <br /> It begins with a man agreeing to be a covert agent for the government. He is supposed to infiltrate an island in the US where something strange is missing. Now they could easily have gotten a search warrant for it. Given that penguins wrote the film, the agent picks up the rap for a murder he did not commit and spends a year in jail. He apparently hopes to be released to this island as many probation officers are sent there when the term is over. <br /> <br /> There are still some more serious problems with this idea. First, they only served him for a year before being released - but he was convicted of MURDER and refused to say who he really was. They would never expose anyone in such a case. Second, what if he did not go to the island? He would have spent a whole year in prison for nothing! Third, why not just divers or paratroopers or cops in boats come to the island ?! Talk about a fictional act! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that the evil Peter Lorre has set up his own private jail and occupied it as a slave labor with probationary men. What about the men who have to report to their probation officers? This was never explained, but Lorre used them to mine diamonds, and they were treated abominably. Well, another question I had was that when Lorre discovered huge diamonds there, he was a very rich man. So why not just pay people for the diamonds ?! Why set up your own version of Devil's Island and brutally beat and kill the men ?! <br /> <br /> At some point Lorre gets what he and the slaves of the island are. Unfortunately I did not care until then. Overall good to see, but pretty stupid. Lorre's career only turned out well when he joined Warner Brothers the following year. With films like ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN I could see why his stay in Columbia was short.
