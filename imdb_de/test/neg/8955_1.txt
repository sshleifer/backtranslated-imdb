First of all, nobody with experience in law enforcement (Not ER or EMT but real prosecution) takes this show seriously. Walker would be evicted from any US police because of his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. He's also a cartoon character - no acting skills, unbelievably banal lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how dumb blondes really are. And Trivett is the ultimate black-faced clown. Come on - if you think that Walker is a heartfelt show without prejudice, explain why JT is treated like a jerk, is always the subject of Walker's jokes, never solves the crime and never saves Walker, who should be 50 years old Let's be dead for the stupid things he does. While it may be true that many criminals are even stupider than the detectives who are after them (and most policemen are stupider than dirt), the smart ones Walker encounters never seem to have the point That Walker Must Be Caught The jerk must be taken from his misery. On the other hand, Norris produced the show and also starred in it. How could he deliberately get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are? As if six guys would wait to take him one by one. What a terrible series! It's humbler than any of the crazy westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid, and Wild Bill Hickock, though I imagine most of you here are too young to remember those shows. But just like those shows, Walker TR is just as offensive and just stupid.
