In the early 1990s, "Step-by-Step" came as a boring combination of the ultra-cheesy "Full House" and the long-dead, crazy "The Brady Bunch" classic. The differences between "Step-by-Step" and the two previously mentioned shows were, of course, better writing, an outstanding comedy timing of almost all the actors and a lot of funny situations that were not quite as confident as it's popular predecessor. Granted, despite the big improvements in the basic dynamics of the show, everything was not always spectacular, nor was it that memorable in the long line of crazy family programs! You could say it was just a much better passerby, compared to the migraine-induced "full house" that happened to be "step-by-step" during this period of general popularity. The show, which is now apparently in syndication, is certainly suitable for families, but do not expect that you will not expect much more from watching it.
