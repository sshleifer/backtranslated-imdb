If it is a film noir, noir for glacier swimming must be French. Take a cast of completely unlikely characters, give them nothing to say, score the whole thing with non-violent violence, and you've got the formula for a harder dash. Could be subtitle "Sleazy Hollywood Guys Trying to Make Money With Chinatown Rip-Off". Bruce Dern's one-minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this movie. Incidentally, I did not like the movie.
