Although this film is overall inaccurate, there are some points that can be true. Certainly in his youth he was a wild figure who had played practical jokes with his cadets at West Point and had almost deported several times, most recently graduating in his class (34) and often ruthless in his leadership during the Civil War. <br /> <br /> But history may have made him a goat of the Indian wars. Sure, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was put under command? There is also evidence that he testified before Congress (at great risk to his mission and his command) that he argues about the fairness of breaking treaties with the Indians, and that if he was an Indian, he would fight as well instead of living from a reservation! <br /> <br /> As one character in the 1776 game said when asked what to say about the British to lose the Revolutionary War, the character says, "History will do what it always does. .. it will lie. " Who knows how bad a man Custer was. Certainly he was not the sympathetic character as portrayed by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was totally angry, since he will be portrayed later.
