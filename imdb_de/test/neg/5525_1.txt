This is so bad that you can watch it. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a grumpy spaceship crew passing on a drifting, apparently abandoned Russian vehicle. <br /> <br /> In the empty space of space, the two crafts accidentally collide (!) - and 'alien' like fun arises when a cyborg from the Russian ship threatens our crew. <br /> <br /> The interiors of spacecraft are clearly a factory noise (metal walkways, boiler) piping). In this totally unconvincing environment, "Kody", "Snake" and the rest of our hero crew grimaces, grunts, runs around and fires their shotguns over and over without firing them Define this movie and they're just amazing : <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. The shotguns are crushed. A cigar gets longer when it is smoked. The shotguns are shattered again, just to be sure. The contents of a bottle increase when it is drunk. <br /> <br /> The film moves through the usual clich√©s of intense ham, Poxy camera work and Ed Wood props to the showdown climax.
