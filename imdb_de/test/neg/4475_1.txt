This was one of the worst movies I can remember. I'm sure I've seen worse if it softens me by slamming it. <br /> <br /> The humor is not funny, there are stupid stereotyped jokes, which in turn are not funny. I was a captive audience on the plane and watched this movie. It was a complete waste of time. I enjoyed Martin in previous films, but not this one. The same goes for Queen Latifah, she was excellent in Chicago and in Set It Off she was good too, but that role was awful. I think you can not save decent actors with a formulaic, inglorious screenplay, as in this film. Nevertheless, all involved should have been smart enough not to participate in this film. I'm just amazed that something so badly given the green light can be made, theatrically released and promoted.
