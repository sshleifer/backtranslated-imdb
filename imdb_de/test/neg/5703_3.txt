I rented it because I thought it was pretty good, just through the cover of the movie box. The judge and jury started a pretty good killer who chased the man who had killed his wife with a cool rifle on a bike, but this movie got fatter and thicker over time. David Keith is a great actor, especially when he plays such a role. Too bad the movie was a crap and wasted its talent. Judges and jury were just stupid. I gave him a 3, should have given a 2. I gave him an extra star just because the weapon of David Keith was cool.
