I picked it up because, after spending some time in the Albany area of ​​New York, I met a few people in the movie and happened upon them. The comedy's attempts are lame, the compulsive girl-on-girl scene gets sick, the plot does not exist, acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, and does not even start with special effects. I realize that this is a very low budget movie made by a small independent company. But if you make a sci-fi horror movie with huge bugs, do not make the huge bugs unbelievable. People want to see huge bugs. That's half the fun right there. And if you want to make the gigantic bugs absolutely unbelievable, at least get the actors to refer to that fact ("You idiots, they are not!" They have caught their trick. "Double!"). Be ready to waste two hours of your life so you can never come back.
