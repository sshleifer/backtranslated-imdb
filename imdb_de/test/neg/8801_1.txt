I do not understand how some people can play "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooters. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that does not use any imaginative ideas in its weapons. All the weapons in the game are real weapons, but there could have been at least some cheating that allowed players to access a "supernatural" weapon, such as the mighty BFG in the Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player actually has to manually reload the weapon. This can be extremely annoying, especially during a firefight when you are so close to the enemy. The reload delay also gives the feeling that the weapon performs its task only slowly. <br /> <br /> There are not many signs to choose from. If I recall correctly, there are four types of characters for the terrorists and the terrorists. This means that many of the characters look alike, which really brings the realism of the game to a standstill. <br /> <br /> The game is quite sexist when it comes to the selection of characters. In the early version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman to choose from (in the selection of terrorist powers) that was good for the female players. In the latest versions, however, the female character has been deleted and replaced by another male. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed with the newer versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cards in the game are very small. The largest map seems to be the desert map, but it has standard details. In fact, all cards in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> In summary, I think Half-Life: Counter-Strike is the most unimaginable first-person shooter ever. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games, so why waste your time on this boring game? It's better to play the Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom games. Avoid this overrated and overheated game. <br /> <br /> I give the game a 1/10.
