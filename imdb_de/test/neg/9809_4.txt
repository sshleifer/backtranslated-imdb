Pretty twisted horror movie that has a few good moments here and there, with some spooky blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring for your own good. All the characters are fine and the story, while it has a lot of potential, is quite boring, but the blood transfusion scenes looked startlingly real and were therefore extremely disturbing. It's well done and written decently, and it started off really interesting, but it just could not keep up. Besides, the end was disappointing. Linnea Quigley has little more than a minor role, so I was disappointed too, and Stephen Knight does a good job as a lead, as he was pretty twisted. Also, I got this in a DVD horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a bunch of other horror movies. There's a lot of blood, but it's not all that bloody, and because of its low budget it was done pretty well, but as I said, it could not sustain its interest. This is a pretty twisted horror movie that has a few good moments here and there, with some spooky blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring for myself, I would fit, but I think it's worth it if you do not have anything better close. The direction is ok. Elly Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Vane do a good job here with decent camera work and good work on a low budget, but the pace is too volatile for my taste. The acting is actually ok. Stephen Knight is great in the lead role, he was scary, twisted, sick and performed a very spooky performance. The scariest thing about it was that he looked like a normal person. Linnea Quigley was good in her small role. Christopher McDonald is fine. I think, sin is his short time. The rest of the cast is fine too. Overall, I would have passed, but I think it's worth the clock if you have nothing better to do. * 1/2 of 5
