It starts pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to LA. But everything fits too fast. In the end there is a decent turn but so many scenes that make no sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home angry and is ready to face the people and he takes the time to put on the club as he parks his car in the middle of nowhere in front of his house? I do not want to spoil it for anyone who chooses, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even acting, which was not bad at first, will be bad towards the end. Do not bother, unless you want to see how bad it is.
