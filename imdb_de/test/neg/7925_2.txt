This movie is so stupid that I want to have my $ 2.99 back for which I paid !! First, this movie starts with a bunch of wooden actor freaks filled up with talent, as if they were picked up from the street somewhere, because the "real" actors either did not show up because of the laughable script, or they could not get anyone desperate enough to make that movie Music in this movie is enough to make you fall asleep. Flute music created for dancing fairies in the wilderness would not even be good enough for this movie! And the guy, dressed as Satan, looks like he's all dressed in a K-Mart Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes. When I saw the terrible killers in those bathrobes with Nosferatu faces, I just laughed! It is said that the whole city flees once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I have ever seen. Avoid this!
