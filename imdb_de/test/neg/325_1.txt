This thing, it should not be called a movie, is almost worse than "manos", but you just have to see that it's hilarious. If you see it in the video library, rent it, if you see the 10th anniversary edition, there is a special edition that you can buy for less than $ 10. Acting is so bad and the anger is so fake. After you have looked at this, you will wonder why they have done this insult to the film art. Assuming that your face does not melt like "Raiders" like the Nazis did. If you manage to see this, make sure that you rate this movie as 1 (terrible) so that it can reach the 100s base, as it really deserves a place. I am surprised that it is currently not the number one.
