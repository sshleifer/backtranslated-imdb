WOW, I hate to hear my opinion, but anyone who rates this movie higher than me must have an I.Q. this achieves unimaginably low depths that transcend space and time and connect on the planet "Hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-this-movie". WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's haircut looks like SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPIIIDDD! I actually thought about sending some money to Fred Ward to compensate for the miserable haircut he had in this horrible movie. Of course, Jodie Foster did not have much to do but could still achieve a terrible performance. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who is mysteriously unoccupied) plays the ultimate stereotypical Joe Pesci movie character, complete with mob killing and constant use of the F word. You will not believe your eyes. Dean Stockwell, watching him in the mess, felt bad for me, thinking he was either intoxicated or temporarily in the film. Jon Turturro himself must have been drunk when he agreed with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you think, GREAT CAST! I know, and it was the WORST cast movie I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper directs and stars and is equally bad in both areas. How the man EASY RIDER could have steered, and that is far beyond my excellent imagination. His OUTRAGEOUSLY hit character accent is beyond the terrible and only achieved through the incredibly witty ending. You (Hopper and Foster) are the least interesting couple I believe I've ever encountered in the world of cinema, and you'll be cheered that they'll lose and then go crazy in the end. What exactly are the two who drench in this action-packed conclusion? I do not know, but I know I'll make fun of him if I ever meet Dennis Hopper because he's responsible for this celluloid waste. Accompany me! IAN
