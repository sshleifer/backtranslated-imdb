I can not believe that I really sat through the whole movie! It was absolutely terrible and absolutely scary, and yet I sat down and thought it would have to get better. It did not and I wasted 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is much better in action movies - I loved him in I, Robot, Enemy of the State, and Independence Day - and I do not think he's really expected to have an entire movie as a romantic lead role behind Cary Grant. On the other hand, the script was unbearably horrible and the dialogue was so cheesy. <br /> <br /> I did not like anyone except Albert's character, and even what I found was dealt with a heavy hand. If you want to see a modern, romantic feel-good comedy, look at how a guy loses in ten days or when Harry met Sally. The 40-year-old maid left me with a smile on my face. I even preferred music and lyrics - and yes, I know it's cheesy, but at least it did not take itself seriously and was sweet. I did not like the female lead either - and was not convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think there were two scenes I liked (and definitely not the end that was disgusting and unconvincing!) - Hitch, who called Sarah when she did not give him her number had, was pretty cute and - no, sorry, I just liked the whole movie. Do not waste your time.
