Without a doubt Family Guy is one of the worst shows I've ever forced to watch (not at the bottom, I've seen The Jersey Shore). A popular hit among high school and college kids who mistake immaturity for weeds. This show is unoriginal and outdated. <br /> <br /> As this is called a comedy show, we take a look at their "humor". 1. Random flashbacks / cuts for celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can lead to a crackling laugh. After about five repetitions per episode, it got old. Simple Solution: Every time you hear "This is worse than / how time ...", plug in your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Inappropriately for its own sake. This show is infamous for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall presentation. Solution: Watch South Park. You did it right. <br /> <br /> In the end, Family Guy is not worth your time and does not keep the Simpsons candle.
