I thought the movie was below average. The acting was good, but not great, the story was funny, but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball in this movie. It was not James (Jim) or tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There's a downhill scene where Jonny Cash plays music - the guy was so depressing (not funny) that I killed my mood. After that, the film could not recover. The deportation scene might have been a fun situation, a good acting performance - I even grinned, but the music was no longer appropriate for the scene. The music prevented me from getting involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> I say it had potential but was done badly, I would even say that it was rushed into final production. Reminds of the previous experience of the exorcist: the beginning. The theatrical release was good, I have seen it, but the film explorer: The rule was a lot better. Same story, just another director. The same should be done here.
