First of all, I have to point out that the role played by Wendell Corey played an extraordinary role. Normally, Corey was referred to supporting roles, but here he helps to carry this very flabby movie. Without him and the character he played, the movie would have been much worse - I would hardly have earned a 2 or 3. <br /> <br /> Why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my favorite games is when characters are "too stupid to live". You can not build the key action points on the assumption that your main characters are completely stupid (unless a brain injury is, of course, part of the plot). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazy man who has murdered three innocent people and they know that Joseph Cottens wife is his next target. So what are you doing? Yes, they offer really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense whatsoever (no shooters and no guys with shotguns that are so far away that they're probably NOT going to stop this madman). And if that's not bad enough, the tagged woman inexplicably walks out of hiding and heads straight to the WORST place she could be! Is someone so stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate it when movies have such stupid characters. In fact, I chose Corey since I felt the idiots deserved to die for their behavior! Besides these clich√©d characters, there was also a player who fainted. Sure, when you see your husband shot COULD faint someone, but in real life this is a rare event - people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason. Combining this with the character problems mentioned above is a real nightmare for people looking for realism - something that film MUST have noir films. <br /> <br /> All of these serious issues are even more annoying since Wendell Corey's character is not amazingly well written and designed. It was his chance to shine as an actor - too bad the rest of the movie was so weak that Corey and the plot's basic idea were lost. This is a movie that could use a remake - but this time without mindless characters.
