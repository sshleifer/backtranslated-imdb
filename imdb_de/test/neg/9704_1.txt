Maybe if you never read English literature or just looked at the Hollywood version of a book, you might find merit in this horrible movie. She has the ability to use Shoreditch as a director and scriptwriter. The BBC 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well. The characters in this production are a bad joke, Sutherland as Bennet seems to be a total fool. Bingley also acts as a fool and it is incomprehensible that he is a friend of Darcy. I can not imagine how Judi Dench could have assumed the role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version. Quotes from the book are taken out of context. Huge chunks are missing, the important episode with Wickham is gone. <br /> <br /> Mr Collins, however, is very good and towers above the other members of the cast. <br /> <br /> The only good thing we did not pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and hold a table before wobbling.
