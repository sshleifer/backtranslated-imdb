Yes, because of the video cover of this movie, I wanted to see this movie as a kid. It was called "Screamers" on this cover with the slogan "Men inside inside out!". It was even on the cover with this distorted skeleton that left all kinds of cool bloody images in my head. Maybe some kind of movie about a weird virus that burned a person's flesh, maybe a movie about undead zombies that look more bloody than what you normally get, a science experiment that went horribly wrong, and now strangers Their bones rage with dripping meat. Yes, all those thoughts went through my head, one that was not fish types on any island that was almost nothing and boring. This movie is really more like the island of dr. Moreau as well as anything else and frankly, this movie has also bored me, it's way too much scientist and not enough to kill for my taste. These movies are too much out and not enough blood for my taste. Yes I know, I have a strange taste, but I can not help it, I like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie really is not.
