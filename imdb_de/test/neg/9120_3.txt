I suggest if you have already seen the original American graffiti, you will not see this movie. If you have not seen the original yet, I still do not recommend it, but it will be less painful to look at it. The characters from the first movie are great and in the end you have a connection to them. This film is meant to show how bad her life has become. It's a tiresome job! <br /> <br /> On New Year's Eve 1964, '65, '66 and '67 we have four stories about the characters of the first movie. In '64 we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat) who is now a professional drag racer. He meets a strange girl, Eva, and although his plot really goes nowhere, it's the best of the four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who is stuck in Vietnam, and most of all, he wants to get out. He tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out. In '66, we have Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl who recorded Toad in the first movie. Now she is a smoking hippie and I'm not sure what her plan is about. She had gone to a concert ... it did not happen much. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) have marital problems ending in an anti-war rally and a police action. None of these stories is very good. The script sometimes has very bad dialogues. Those poor characters that I enjoyed so much in the first movie have landed where they are here ... why? Why was this sequel done? I think if a sequel was made, it had to show the Vietnam War, hippies and police actions, but the real issue is that this movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The direction was stylish, but it only makes a big headache. Every story has a different style. Milner's is just a regular (depending on how you see him) widescreen and is filmed as the rest of the movie should look like. Toad's plot was shot in 16mm and is a poor-looking image that is the size of a small box in the center of the screen. Debbie's plot is shot on multiple screens. At one point, there may have been a screen, but for the good majority, there are two to twenty screens simultaneously. Do not try to follow the screens as there is nothing going on anyway. Steve and Laurie's plot has the funniest twist. His style really means nothing and is stupid and pointless. Instead of a full screen, it's a compressed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of the widescreen. Although I do not like the others, at least I understand what they were up to, and it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The music is the saving grace of this movie, not that it could save this! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have beautiful songs here. They do not save the function, they just make it a little better than it is. It is still bad! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a pointless sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this dull sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 110 min. PG for language, drug use and violence
