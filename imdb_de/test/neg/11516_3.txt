"Be With Me" is almost the ultimate background movie. Just leave it in the background. Chat with each other and come back to him whenever you want, and eventually it will end. <br /> <br /> As I watched it alone, I felt I had almost seen the worst, longest and most dripping sentimental beer commercial in the world, when I managed to keep my eyes open for credit rolled; and then I managed (just a) a few moments of awakening to see a thank you to the film's sponsors - including the Asia Pacific Breweries. Aha! Methought: How Surprising * That Is * Given All The Shots Of Tiger Beer Scattered In This Most Memorable Washout Of A Movie? <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the dialogue between people with occasional bites in the depth pushes, but usually nothing is said or witnessed by any particular progress in the overall history of the film. It is as if one could switch off at any moment and return at a later date, and one would really have missed nothing that would have been an unavoidable event or part of his conspiracy in the overall course of the film. So the ultimate "wallpaper movie"! <br /> <br /> Well, I wonder ... Which movie were the ones who saw this movie positively? I wonder and wonder again and again ... It certainly was not the art that would have led to an artless Singapore apology for rolling a camera. "Be With Me" is said to be woven around the themes of "love, tragedy and salvation". All I experienced was boredom, a half-baked script with a clutter of gormless text messages, and the only salvation was what happened when this utterly useless movie ended. What a wistful waste of time! It was also said that the characters in this film were fictional, with the exception of Theresa Chan, who is a "remarkable woman who has triumphed over mishaps". Well, no disregard for Ms. Chan, but given that she was such a wonderful and amazing character, why did the script need to include the stories of other characters without trying to connect their lives? Nevertheless, it proved to be an almost unbearably boring film, one of whose highlights was the end credits. Rather than engaging in the fate of all the characters, I really felt that the movie was trying to do the almost impossible and was obviously falling between stools, as far as it could be a spectator injury. I'm generally an art film house fan and usually do not object to slow steps (no shortage here, believe me !!). I hate films like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but consider, for example, Eric Rohmer a great filmmaker. So I hope that my criticism is put into perspective. Nevertheless, throughout the conception and delivery of the film, there was no redeemable feature that drove the eyelids down slowly as 'Be With Me' passed every minute. Watch this movie if you want to lose time. Otherwise your life would not be richer if you had missed it. 3.10
