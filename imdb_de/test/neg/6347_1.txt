One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Completely ridiculous The story is bad. The animations are completely childish and repressed. The physics of holograms is weird because they are completely wrong. OMG, I even want to believe that this movie has a Disney label. Yuck The actresses are a bit beautiful, but there are so many good movies with amazing actresses who are much more valuable than these. Conclusion, bad movie. Do not bother looking at it. If you are looking for movies with your children, consider other alternatives such as Ratattuile, Monster Inc or an enchanted story (in theaters). Serious.
