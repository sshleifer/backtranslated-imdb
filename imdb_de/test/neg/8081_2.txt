That's this movie. My God, the special effects suck this movie. It's hard for anything to suck more than the plot of this movie, but the special effects manage to do it. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. In Duluth, MN, there are four punk teenage dirt bikers traveling in a forest. One of them is a stupid ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but is stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. Then all five notice that there is a forest fire in which a guy fires tons of gas throughout the forest. All they show us are their boots, and they show, scene by scene, how these boys' boots run around, releasing gas and making fire. In the meantime, the teenagers are trying to escape the fire, only to find that the bootman has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while riding dirt bikes through the woods!) To vent gas throughout the area they are traveling were more fire. He does this several times and the paramedic finally gets him and sets him on fire. I will not spoil the end, but the resilience of this man will make you shout: "WHAT IS THE BLOODY HELL?!?!" on the screen. In any case, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape leads through a mine filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I will not even try to describe the end because it is too ridiculous and you will enjoy it more if you do not see it coming. What you do not want, because you can not wait to see what happens. This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency. <br /> <br /> Is an appearance of consistency too much to ask for? Seemingly so. I can not even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they break their arms and legs while they crash their motorcycles). I think every character breaks at least one member and several more than one member. They then limp around until the scene ends and then forget that they should have broken limbs. There is a scene where three of them who have supposedly broken their legs start to dance. But then her injuries suddenly come back when the action needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally the CGI. If there is a hell, it is to watch the fire in this movie. All they have done for the forest fires is to line the dirt roads with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths and all trees that are more than two feet from the path are not touched. And then they zoom out and show how the whole forest is in flames. It's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that the ridiculousness is pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those guys that are so bad. There are some cases where it descends into the category of painful-bad. Most of the time it stays over the border and is ridiculously incompetent. I can not wait to see the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in a pack of four with this movie.
