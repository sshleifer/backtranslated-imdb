After hearing that some people were involved in the film behind the low-budget films "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "It came from space ... and stuff," I decided to leave the film unseen to buy DVD. I wish I had not done it. The other movies were funny, funny and somehow stupid. While Kraftverk 3714 has no humor whatsoever. And it's so horrible that I get angry just thinking about it. The worst actor, the worst script, the worst available special effects. And the most unsex sex scene of all time. Uhhh And the whole thing takes 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please never make another movie.
