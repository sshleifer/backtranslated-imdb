To describe this film is a difficult task. On the one hand, it's an exaggerated vampire spookfest, complete with cobwebs, sinister music, a hypnotic medallion and, of course, a coffin with a creaking lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one of the dumbest scripts on this site is Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires" and the predecessor of this movie, the modest title "The Vampire". "The movie retains the lack of logic that characterizes the other films. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, this movie is a sequel to" The Vampire, "which I have not seen. But no matter ... you can easily imagine what happened, Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is confused when the well-meaning but misguided Dr. Marion sees the staked-out body of his vampiric enemy, Count Karol de Lavud, brings back (I assume that there is a vampire rule somewhere there must be counts) Dr. Marion complains that all the important doctors in the history had to resort to a kind of burial to advance their medical studies, and he hopes the corpse of the Being able to use vampires to investigate phenomena like the lack of a normal reflection of the vampire At this point, he gives the vampire a mirror and instead of a reflection we see the skeleton of the vampire. ??? Enrique is not pleased and seems determined to distract the events of the vampire first film as mere fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I admit he liked to drink some blood, but that's all!" He states. Also confusing is the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!), Who happens to be Enrique's love object. Martha barely escaped de Lavud from the first film, and apparently Enrique spent a lot of time "healing her mind" and making her realize that everything she was experiencing was not real. <br /> <br /> OK, So if you were a screenwriter for this movie, you'd have to find a way to make someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire, right? Well, how about the greedy cheater who helped Marion steal the coffin? After taking a look at de Lavud's body, he turns his attention to the expensive-looking brooch the count is wearing, and conveniently returns to steal them if the doctors do not look. But damn it ... he can not remove the brooch because of the stake, so ... you guessed it. De Lavud is off again, this time with the dodgy cheater as a human stooge. <br /> <br /> OK, the vampire is behind Martha again and the doctors are really confused by what they believe. First, they want to prove that there is no real vampire, and at the end of the movie they try to get the police to issue an all-point bulletin for a "dead-weight man!" "<br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the story from here, but the filmmakers make some good turns." One of the scenes for the film is a spooky wax museum (is there any other kind of Complete with a full-blown torture chamber ... with real torture and execution gear, the film has a very distinctive style, not just in the camping cobwebs, and a truly gruesome sequence has made De Lavud a victim chasing seemingly endless streets and alleys by chasing next to vague buildings without doors, while lighting up the scene like a German expressionist nightmare ("The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" it seems to be) an influence). <br /> < br /> But the rest of the movie is youthful, especially at the height of the movie, and the special effects are pretty crude even for the year this was done, and the fight with De Lavud i n bat form is ridiculous enough, but the director feels the need to ask us that Martha would faint directly and collapse over a guillotine, positioned so her head is in the perfect spot to be knocked off the blade to be, which can lead to danger of falling, because the safety rope has suddenly started, RIGHT ON THIS MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts himself off the fringe-like rope and shows scenes in which Enrique tries to dodge the falling rubber club. He basically stands still and waves his arms. It's definitely an Ed Wood moment, if there ever was one, especially if Martha seems to revive by herself and gets to her feet wearily as the blade strikes down. Angry! What a relief! As for the craziness, "The Vampire's Coffin" does not have the madness factor "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of this kind of old horror movies will appreciate the atmospheric photography and the fact that the director manages to get some wrestling real chills from this material must count for something (Haw Haw).
