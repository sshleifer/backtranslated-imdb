For the recording I hate spoof movies. Except for Mel Brooks and PLANE! because these are classics and make fun of the stereotypes, not the actual films. I think spoof movies are the barrel of the barrel for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "geniuses" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I chose THE COMEBACKS. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of her films. It was basically every sports movie in a lame kindergarten joke and a disturbing picture of bodily injury that made me laugh and fail. Only someone who is tall would laugh at these jokes. Toilet bowl? Who wrote that? an 11 year old? I was surprised to see that this was the founding of the WEDDING CRASHERS producers, which was actually pretty decent. But the parody attempt was about as funny as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (if it clearly deserved one) was because Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
