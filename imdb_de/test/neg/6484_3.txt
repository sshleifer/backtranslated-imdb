Royal Rumble in 1988 bored me pretty well. The rumble itself is fairly uneventful, filled with medium-sized cards, and a winner who really had no reason to win, and why on earth was the Young Stallions vs. The Islanders the main event? half the amount was left. Jessie Ventura sounds bored by half of the thing, and you realize he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura do not have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie. Ricky Steamboat vs Ravishing Rick Rude. A very disappointing game with too many rest periods and too slow a pace sink here. If it's going crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little and too late. Steamboat wins with DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Next, Dino Bravo is setting a new bench press record discovered by Ventura. Terrible segment, without entertainment value. Ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted it was boring. Controversy or not, I've wasted enough time on this crap. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Womens Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Against the bouncing bomb-angel. This is the best game of the night, no, I'm not kidding! Very exciting stuff for woman's wrestling, and it's going to be hard to find that good stuff, already days off. The Jumping Bomb Angels were long gone and the spectators gained a title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signing agreement between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but there are a few notable bucks for him, probably because it's in Canada. A bit too long for my taste, but it was necessary for the plot. It clarified its point and had some powerful moments, but I kept saying "join me". Both sign and Andre hits Hogan's head on the table and presses the table on top of him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Very weak Royal Rumble, probably due to awkward gait and the lack of star power. I think Vince tested the water with this, and it turned out. Ventura seems uninterested, and I do not blame him. Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win and DDT scream almost every five minutes he was in. And although Duggan got a good pop, I do not think he was the winner they wanted, and where did he take his career? Nowhere. Bret's 1st Royal Rumble, and he showed an impressive show. It was not terrible, but it was pretty lackluster, and it was not enough to do the show, considering that this was the basis of the show. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Standard Hulkster interview, but not with the same craziness, and outrageous comments he normally draws. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre are being interviewed. Andre claims he will deliver the championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 waterfalls. <br /> <br /> The Islanders Vs The Young Stallions. The crowd is completely dead for it, and half of them have been blocked for the exit. It's pretty boring and has nothing to do with the main event. Jessie and Vince seem bored and argue about other things during the game. Islanders win because they take advantage of Roma's injury. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Historically important, I assume, but there is really nothing to see here. This was just the start of great things for The Royal Rumble, and while you can see potential here, there's nothing to see here. I usually recommend it to Die Hard Wrestling fans, and considering this is the first Royal Rumble event, I think so, too, but get ready to get bored
