This is indeed the movie that made Kung Fu popular in the 70's. However, if there was ever a fuss or a halfway interesting action, it does not seem to have aged very well. Long story short: extremely lengthy, slow, confusing plot with ordinary choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every beat and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never end. By the time the movie reached its emotional climax, I had long thrown out all the wind to really care. <br /> <br /> View historic value as a milestone in Chinese Kung Fu cinema Leave your expectations at the door or you'll be bitterly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
