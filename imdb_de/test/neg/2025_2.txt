Screenwriter Steve Tesich's second attempt (following the wildly overwhelmed BREAKING AWAY) is a compendium of clich√©s, coincidences, and sullen melodrama. Maybe he lived something like that; If so, I'm sorry to say that inexplicably he was unable to dramatize anything convincingly. <br /> <br /> In fairness, he has not helped much here by Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done remarkable work in the past (BONNIE AND CLYDE, SMALL BIG MAN), but can not summon up any energy or acuity in Tesich Bring in the narrative. <br /> <br /> The cast struggles as best it can but is attracted to weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathy should be especially reserved for Craig Wasson, whose sullen performance provides for the impending rapid fading of his leadership career, as well as the embarrassingly untethered Jodi Thelen, who disregards the film's most unlikely "femme fatale". > It all seems to be longer than it is and all the points are clumsy and obvious. See Arthur Penn's earlier approach to the 1960s theme, the droll and elegiac ALICE'S RESTAURANT; It is all that is not.
