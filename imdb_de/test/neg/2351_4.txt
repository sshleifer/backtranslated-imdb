The subspecies is located in Romania, where the two American college students Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) with the help of local friend Mara (Irina Movila) study local folklore. There they rent rooms in a hotel and become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle. It turns out that there lives a powerful and vicious vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) who stole the bloodstone from his father King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). , Radu loves the three girls and starts to drink the blood of Mara & Lillian. Meanwhile, Michele falls in love with a man named Stefan (Michael Watson), who happens to be Radu's brother. Michele & Stefan decide to band together and rid the world of the evil Radu ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this movie seems to be well-received by genre fans. I do not call it very well and I really could not see much that I was happy about. Subspecies is a slow movie, not much happens. While trying to stay close to certain classic vampire traditions, all this nonsense is about a bloodstone and a few little monsters that for some reason grow out of the tips of Radus's severed fingers. Subspecies could have been a half-decent movie, if not the fact that it's boring. I really can not remember that well, good or bad. The characters are okay, but some of the dialogues are stupid and there's a scene that bothered me near the start when the girls are in the castle ruins and they say they have to go because it's getting dark, but it does is still the middle of the day. There is also a scene in which one of the Americans finds a coffin in the attic of the hotel and it does not seem to bother anything. I'm not funny, but it's some guy in whose house I had a coffin in his attic. Be very, very worried, if you know what I mean. I do not think I would ever want to see it again. There is no real threat. The plot is weak and mixes classic vampire themes with stupid subplots. I was completely untouched. Not the worst movie of all time, but hardly the best. <br /> <br /> The film looks good with beautiful locations and some local scenery, although you may find that the look is closer to the budget than the creators seek authenticity. Apart from a beheading and some broken fingertips, there is not much gore. For no obvious reason, the makers throw in some average-looking stop-motion animated monsters that really do not do anything or have much meaning to the story. <br /> <br /> Filmed by Charles Fullt's Full Moon Entertainment production companies in Bucharest, Romania, the production values ​​are fine and better than many later band productions. The drama is not great because many of the performers are underperforming while Angus Scrimm, a genre director, has a small cameo. Occasionally there is a bit of style here. Some scenes are strongly reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922), especially Radu's Shadow, who descends the stairs with his long, claw-like fingernails. <br /> <br /> Subspecies is a movie that many seem to like for reasons that I do not see right, I thought that at best it was average and rather boring on average. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) & The Spinoff Movie Vampire Journals (1997).
