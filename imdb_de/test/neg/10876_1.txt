Or that the filmmakers want to believe anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie tries so hard to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everything, from the look of the film, the cinematography, the cut, the dialogue and the drama, is from the beginning in the super-cool mode aligned. To make sure no-one misses how cool this movie is, there's a soundtrack with really cool rock-and-roll songs and a twangy western-surf Tex-Mex guitar that's constantly playing throughout the movie. As a last reminder of how fricky cool this movie is, all the actors have been told to speak in a hoarse voice because, as we all know, that's shitty. <br /> <br /> The plot (if yes, this is the case) one) seems pretty straightforward. As mentioned before, the director and star of the film seems determined not to tell this story. Instead, he focuses on a plethora of nude women and dialogues that are supposedly in a bad mood, but they get tired surprisingly quickly (or do they have a contest to see how often they use the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and could stuff their derivatives in an 80-minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely awful.
