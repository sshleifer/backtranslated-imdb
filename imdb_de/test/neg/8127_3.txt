Let me first say that after watching the movie, I felt I had sold a bill. However, it's not the film's fault that IMDb is first heard as a comedy and as a horror (though I do not know how it happened ... maybe a jerk from the crew of the movie inserted it). Because I'm a fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it out for that reason and I'm so sorry I did. Where should one start? First of all, to go back to my beginning, there is no comedy in this movie. It tries it once or twice, but gets at most a giggle. My reaction was first and foremost to roll my eyes and ask myself why someone thought such tired materials were funny. Again, there is no horror. No second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No tension, very little blood and not much screen violence (sorry, but in a horror strip that just drops off when the good stuff starts, it's a heavy foul). Hell ... there is no nudity. Call me puristic or youthful ... I prefer some in a horror movie if no original plot / premise is possible. And tired as hell "Reality TV show went wrong"? It was done earlier and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... um ... whatever the movie called Edward Furlong. So bad is this movie. I can not even remember the name of this movie, but it was better than this. I also enjoyed the comment that claims the timing is good because "reality TV takes over". Has anyone from the past posted this with a time machine? Are you kidding me? This thing is garbage ... and not in a funny way.
