The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely considered to be the best work by Alfred Hitchcock and, in my opinion, certainly one of the best films of all time. The decision to film a shot-by-remake is therefore somewhat puzzling. <br /> <br /> The original cast was flawless so the cast of this remake had a lot to live on. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a handsome boy and is not very convincing as Bates. I imagine actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job in this role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a good job, but she compares to Janet Leigh over and over again. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson only goes by his role. The best part of this new cast is William H. Macy as a private detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can not build up the tension Hitchcock did. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark and humid and closed, while in this version it takes place in a bright, lab-like environment. And I think the black and white photography of the original has a clear advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Another mistake could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what happens and what happens when. <br /> <br /> I can only say that if it is not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br />
