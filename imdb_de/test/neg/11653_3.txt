Based on the previous comments, everyone seems to either hate or love the movie. I think it would be fair to point out that while this is not a great movie, it has interesting moments. First, it was shot on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I do not remember, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely breathtaking and spectacular. It's beautiful, too, for me who lived in Colorado for several years. Next up is Disney's predilection for wonderful character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better shape than when playing in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Do you remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a "small role" in this film, she is great as always. If you do not know who she is, think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback by Notre Dame (she was one of the Gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun in "Sister Act" as well as the best nun in "The Trouble." with angels ". She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never get the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> Besides character actors and all-star actors, Disney in the 1960s / 1970s may not have the "Best Movies, but if you really see some from start to finish, you'll find that every movie The movie may not be funny, but there is always a comic gem (at least 1 or 2) in every single "live action" movie Disney has ever done Harry Morgan is talking about one of his roaring tones, or Tim Conway fluttering around, or Joe Flynn giving one of his invaluable looks of horror, all is well, the whole movie may not be good, but there are always hysterical moments in each one Disney movie from this time I've ever seen, Disney has always managed to make a person smile despite the stupidity of the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding these comments, I agree with the addition Do not chuckle that make any Disney movie terrible at this time of year. This statement is not quite correct. Rather, it makes it easier for me to appreciate the funny moments and to overlook the weaknesses in the actions. Some live action Disney movies are true classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins) But for those who are not, I can appreciate them for what they were - good, clean family fun at a time when in the movies became vulgar, rude and offensive.
