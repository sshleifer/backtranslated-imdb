My wife and I saw this after running out of Encore-Action this week. It must be the worst horror movie we've ever seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I guessed the lines before they were spoken), hokey special effects, a script that went on everywhere. I think the most annoying part was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot, not to mention the unsatisfying sex scene between two of the young heroines in the film, none of which had any purpose other than to expose certain parts of their anatomy to the cameras. This film should be classified as a comedy, not as a horror, because the villains of the film (spiders) were animated and were not credible in any way. I can not say that I made a movie better myself, but he was very amateur and not even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to a "d" movie or "f" if that's the case. I think, Science Fiction 3000 would have to pass this!
