This is a terrible movie !! Some people told me it was not that bad, but I do not agree! The monster looks incredibly cheap (and funny), but that's something we all knew I was thinking. In addition, the dialogues are awful and the writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> As bad as it gets, this movie is the quality of entertaining. Not always for good reasons, but it's a good "so bad it's fun". <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no "La Castagne". According to a secondary character in the movie called Pierre (described in the film as a French Canadian) there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It definitely made me laugh ... :))
