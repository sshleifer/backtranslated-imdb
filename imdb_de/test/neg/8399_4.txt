... now please continue, because that gets on my nerves. Seriously, the guy behind brilliant pieces like "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other not so brilliant movies, ie the unnecessary "psycho" remake) started with " Gerry "an experimental phase that culminated with the thought-provoking" Elephant ". "Last Days" had some interesting aspects, but was very uneven, while "Paranoid Park," his new movie, also has a good-looking 15-year-old ... and not much else. Some cool references to Fellini (the soundtrack uses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the highlights, but the movie is just too artistic and meaningless to its own destiny. We had much better stories about the time, and "Paranoid Park" brings nothing new. I do not see anything artistic about seeing Gabe Nevins over underwear or showering excessively. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (the little girl from How the Grinch Stole Christmas), who plays his cheerleader girlfriend, have sex for the first time just because she felt they had to do it and then She's done and calls her friend to say how amazing it was (and you can tell Nevin's face how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they start earlier and earlier these days, films like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" themselves (which shows how far their minds are not just in terms of sexuality in general) have shown this better. Gus tries to be minimalistic and artistic, but the end result is boring and uninteresting. His next project "Milk", a biopic about Harvey Milk with Sean Penn, will hopefully bring good old Gus back, because frankly, this obsession with underage kids is almost ... scary. 4.5 / 10.
