Joan Crawford is convincingly disfigured when our story begins, and of course it is repaired. But she is a bad egg that exploits a guy while living out the anti-social philosophy of another man. All this takes place in Sweden, which is really bizarre. It causes everything and all the memorable elements that have to be released from the representation of Anytown USA, but it astonishes the viewer why each remake is burdened and unspecified by the need to Americanize everything. There is action, action, action that is so talkative that you could drown in it, and even worse is a framing device that gives the movie zilk. The photography is occasionally beautiful, with odd angles and miniatures. But it's overworked without ever having to move in.
