The opening scene of the beach at Fircombe, which is amused in itself, unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film - bland and washed out. It's not as hackneyed as most of the others in the Carry-On series, but maybe it does not really bring much fun. It's a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the Benny Hill show, but those looking for attractive women in bikinis and miniskirts while watching some of them will likely enjoy some of the other titles in the series, z. For example, "continuing abroad" or "continuing in the jungle" more. The emergence of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a tool of action that seems rather self-defeating.
