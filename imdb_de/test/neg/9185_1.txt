John Candy was a very popular comic actor. His death was a tragedy, and we all miss him greatly, but Wagon's EAST, in which he plays a hobbling wagon-master willing to take a group of pioneers from the Wild West, is even sadder. I do not understand why it was even published. The story is pointless and weak, and the jokes are not there. It makes me even more sad that Candy's last movie would be his worst movie yet. So let's forget all about him and remember him in his better films like SUMMER RENTAL, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES and UNCLE BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 of 5
