This movie was awful. It's not something that people have to pay to see. It seems that a Christian group has succeeded in converting people. I do not understand why it was released in cinemas and not on television. <br /> <br /> It began like an old-fashioned 1950s B-movie sci-fi movie, but it quickly changed. After about 30 minutes, the characters talk about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It moves quickly into pure religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a sci-fi movie. The film looks bad; bad camera settings and is amateur. <br /> <br /> AVOID IT!
