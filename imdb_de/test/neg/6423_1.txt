Newly released on DVD in the US; Just stay away. <br /> <br /> In horror movies, I usually give a lot of space for stupidity. I will be content with almost everything distanced exciting, supernatural, eerie or just a vague interesting concept. This just stank. I knew there was trouble when Sara's "best friend" in college, who had plenty of screen time, was not even listed in the credits on IMDb! I was not surprised to find no actors, but this character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or whatever their name was) did not seem to exist! <br /> <br /> I'm so embarrassed that I actually paid a rent for this rubbish; deep, deeply ashamed ...
