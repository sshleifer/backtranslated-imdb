This film is an example of small budget, ineffective cast, weak plot and bad conversation. These types of films are meant for commercial breaks and not entertainment for die-hard Bollywood fans. I went to this movie because I thought the gangster was bearable in the past. I appreciate the way a new actress fits into the movie in a very bold way, very much like Bollywood actress Nandita Das. she is good, sexy and behaving well. She definitely goes into her career. Our fellow dog was always good at his job. At least he has something good in the movie. I did not like Imraan because his role has to advise him to improve now, as he has made many films as a new actor and he has been seen as an established actor
