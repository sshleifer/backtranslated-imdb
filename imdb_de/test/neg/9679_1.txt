I saw a garbage from the bible. This is the coronation. To make matters worse, it takes about three hours. A terrible waste of time, unless you want to match the biblical knowledge of your child with the myriad deviations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I should give you a ten-line explanation why you should not watch this movie, let me just say that there is absolutely no redeemable quality for it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of "let's make the biblical report look delayed." The basic logic is that if they spend the money on a biblical film, why is not it worthwhile? Since the basic logic is not fulfilled, something is wrong. The film begins with a disclaimer of the recorded poetic licenses ... that is the understatement of the century. Poetic rape But then poetically would be an undeserved favor.
