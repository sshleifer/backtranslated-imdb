SLOOOOOOOW, lukewarm, badly produced 70s hitters became noticeable due to today's headlines; Nonetheless, due to its surprising acting, lack of directing and stupid clothing of the 70s, this movie is a worthy stink food (unfortunately the MooCow remembers that adidas clothing was the rage ...). This has the same feeling that some of the better 70s sci-fi movies have been achieved, namely "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run". While the premise is interesting (rich people clone themselves to have a supply of body parts to theoretically keep them alive forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone who boring and irritating at the same time. Hollow Acting by Donnelly does not help, but goes well with the rest of the cast. Even such B-Illuminaries as Dick Sargent (TV series "Bewitched", "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "The Dark", "Laserblast") and Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End") "," Killers from Space "," It Conquered the World ") offer only the wettest, liveliest performances.Produced, directed and edited by a number of Nobodies, it is no surprise that" Clonus "does not scare anyone in the least That nobody's attracting attention! To be honest, there's nothing in the faint movie that even Schlock fans would love - you really want to see bad, funny movies from the 70s that have attracted something from Greydon Clark. "Clonus" is no bonus, says the MooCow Even the MST3K version is a Yawner, so continue at your own risk !: = 8P
