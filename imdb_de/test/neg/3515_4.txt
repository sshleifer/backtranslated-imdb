I recently watched this movie on The Sundance Channel and it interested me from the beginning. However, it always seems to take you to get where you want to go, and in the end I feel cheated. In short, Noble Willingham (famous by Walker, Texas Ranger) plays a boat salesman who is harassed by a man who claims to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark, dirty little secret concerning the son, and he (the son) enjoys reminding him. I will not spoil anything for anyone, but three things prevented me from really liking this movie. First, the movie has more bad language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross. 99% of it is spat out by Willingham himself. It did not take long for me to endure in constant four letters. Second, I just could not believe that someone would answer the phone that often, especially when you know a caller is on the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, whether at work, at home, in a restaurant, etc., the phone rings and he always replies that he spits poisons out to the "son" and then ONLY LEAVES IF THE CALLER CALLS Call back in ten seconds! How many of us would do that? Now I realize that if he does not answer, we probably will not have a movie, but I just could not stop the disbelief in this thing. Three, and this is the least criticism, why is the director so opposed to showing us the "Corndog Man" (aa the caller / son)? Most of the time he's just a redneck voice on the other end of the phone. I could have lived with this, if other things had come together, but since this was not the case, it's just another problem. I give the film the honor of being a bit of an original idea and of keeping my attention from the start, but that's about it. Just see it once. However, if you are like me, say "Triple K Marine!" in sleep for a night or two after you finish it.
