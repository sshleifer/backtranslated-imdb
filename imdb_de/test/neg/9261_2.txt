I bought this movie a few years ago (together with "Hawken's Breed") for 99 cents at K-mart. Everything that has to do with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is certainly worth a lot. It was not "Dark Obsession" (the title under which I bought it) was a slight cut above "Hawkens Breed" (IMBD at 2.4), but not enough to even keep it in the house. I threw both movies in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing fails on so many levels that it's hard to curb it, but let's say it's shabby, unbelievable, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even too long at 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this blow looks really bad in his resume.
