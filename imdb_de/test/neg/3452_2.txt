This is a bad movie. It certainly belongs to how not to make a feature film category. Story, direction, acting and style are anything but flat. Story consists of five? yes five? Football matches spread throughout the film, with each boring being filmed as the last while a dysfunctional amateur football team grew stronger. That's it, that's the plot. It's hard to know who this movie is directed at. It is too banal for football fans and there is nothing for teenagers and adults. There is nothing for women, there is not even a female figure. It is bleak and the team is playing game after game after game after game. The story as it is, the dialogue and behaviors seem to have come out of the past Ireland, with all actors gushing Dublin accents from the cod. It does not have to be seen to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Can someone give me back my 90 minutes? High point of the credits at the end, low point too numerous to be mentioned. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
