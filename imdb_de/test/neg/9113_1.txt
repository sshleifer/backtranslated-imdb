I love most of the movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I'd LIKE this movie at least. I'm also a Canadian and this is a mostly Canadian movie, so I was ready to take it seriously. Nothing would have prepared me for the garbage that is Airborne. Steve Guttenberg as action hero? Give me a break. The acting in the whole movie was so bad that I can not sleep tonight. I have only two wishes in my life now. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you will never have to go through this movie. 2. I wish I could get these 6 hours back. Wait, the movie is under 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. Serious.
