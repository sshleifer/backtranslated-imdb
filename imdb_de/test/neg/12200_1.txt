A complete and utter loss of my precious two hours. The entire movie could have been shot in less than 60 seconds, simply showing people being crowded together, a car crashing, people more crowded, people having sex, people crying, and people more crowded together. The slogan for this movie should be: "Come and see how crazy our characters are! They're stoned! They're coke-dependent! They're a mess! Who are these people? Are you really interested? Is that important?" us your money, please, because surely nothing else is important to us! "An absolutely terrible movie, it never went anywhere, you never met the characters (they never said what these people did, about a big house and all) a lot of money to make cars and coke) and it was just boring - you might like the movie a little bit more if you are a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us that is not, this movie is a waste of film and time.
