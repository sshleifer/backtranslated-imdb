Movies about U.F.O.'s are always a nice way to kill some time. On a rainy Sunday night I recorded this movie and expected what a Direct-to-DVD U.F.O. can be expected. Secret. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! About half of the film makes it very clear that U.F.O. The theme is just a fraudulent method to attract unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a Christan movie of an average Christian. No, that's Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind. The eerie kind. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, the unbelieving track is outwitted by their peers with a practical joke in which they think the Rapture has begun ( what is considered by Christians as the event) at the end of the time when true believers go to heaven and nonbelievers are left behind.) When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer. 'just in case we Christians are right'. Well, that's a very modest excuse to become a Christian if you ask me! <br /> <br /> This film is still trying to convert infidels using horror tactics. "Believe in God or you go to hell!" the message is here. Simple but pretty offensive. Especially because this movie is sold as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Suppose you yourself are a Christian fundamentalist, and you probably will not be offended by the topics in this movie movie? I'm afraid that's not it. No, actually I do not lie. The spectacle is terrible, the tempo is terrible, the plot is terrible, especially the end is ridiculously bad. As soon as the movie starts, you will immediately feel that this is going to be worse than you expected and you will be right. In the first half hour at least it seems to be trying to set up a passable UFO puzzle, but then they suddenly bring this Count Dracula babbling about the devil. At first you just think that this guy is just a crazy madman, but as it turns out, he actually represents the real views of the creators of this movie. As you become aware of it, you know how it will end. But actually it ends worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
