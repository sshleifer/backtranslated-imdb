The lines in the title of this review are the first lines of the title song of this film, a wonderfully denounced parody of the (in my opinion gruesome) song "My favorite things" from "The Sound of Music". And this funny little detail is not the only aspect that also makes "The Body Shop" famous. "Doctor Gore" (1973) recommended for my Gore / Trash fans. The film, almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr., Producer, Author, Director, and Leading Man as the same Dr. Gore served, is undoubtedly crap, but there is no doubt that it is amusing and everyone involved, especially Patterson, knew this was not exactly what made them a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a famous but completely crazy plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife Anitra, a model in an accident. Together with his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he abducts beautiful young women to make a perfect new wife out of their body parts ... "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a movie about "it's so bad," but he also has qualities that go beyond the usual ridiculous trash. Mad Science has always been one of my favorite topics, and in fact, it's also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous Gore Trash flicks. Obviously filmed on a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" pays tribute to the "Frankenstein" films, notably James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the appearance of early Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore films such as "Blood Feast "(1963) - only that looks much cheaper and crazier. Obviously, J.G. Patterson's motive was not just to make a funny gore movie: since he was a pretty ugly, weird-looking guy, his role as dr. Brandon Patterson the opportunity to go out with a couple of hot, barely dressed young women (who would end later) as a body part donor in Dr. Brandon). <br /> <br /> Most of the Gore is pretty good in terms of the apparently tiny budget. The dialogue contains some very funny lines ("Get that, it could be the door ... and put on a coat so they will not see you're a hunchback."). In addition to the aforementioned theme song, "Doctor Gore" includes a wonderfully crappy performance by a country band called "Bill Hicks and the Rainbows" - my new favorite band, NOT. For the rest of the movie, I kept wondering whether Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who plays the hunchbacked assistant, are twins or even the same person - they look exactly the same and have two unrelated, obese, red-bearded guys, the To look funny in a movie would be a huge coincidence. Other than J.G. Patterson, most of the actors have never done other films. This is the first movie I have seen of Patterson. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Doctor Gore" is a movie that certainly is not for everyone. In fact, it is total crap. But it is also amusing and recommended for my friends of craziness and cheap storage. Dictionaries should show a screenshot from this movie under "trash can".
