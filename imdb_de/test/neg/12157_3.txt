I waited a while for this movie. On the first day of air in Turkey I watched it. It was a disappointment for me. I planned to watch a historical movie, but the one on the screen was a fictional movie. First, the main character of the film Cengiz Han, the great conqueror, was portrayed as a gentle, calm, even a loser. You can not feel the power in the movie. In the past, the war machine he created was conquered (even more) by the world that was known in those years. For this purpose, Cengiz first combines the Asian tribes. In the film, however, this loser is a poor man in one scene, and in a second scene he commands armies. War scenes were amazing week. In the last battle, the Mongolian horsemen used double swords at their sides and defeated the enemy. :) As a consequence, I and my friends just laugh about these scenes. Mongol army means Mongolian rider. You can not see that in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I do not want to go into the scenes that Cengiz portrayed as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the film, it is acceptable. The scenes in which the old monk saw the future and looks for the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission are really funny. When the monk dies in the desert, Cengiz's wife feels it dead and she finds the body on the continent. We talk about Asia? Again we laughed. There's a lot more to say, but I do not think this movie has more value to talk about.
