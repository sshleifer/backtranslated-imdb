Every time I see a movie like this, I get sick. When I see a movie, I like to see what I see in my daily life. When I look through my day, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, etc. ... How do you make a film and do not think about the possibility that other ethnic groups will pass you by? I'm sure they did not do it on purpose, but watch out. I do not care if it's in Kansas or South Central. Everything I saw was a black sign. That was typical in the 80s. Hello! It's 2007, all rappers, singers and athletes who work as actors. Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to his occupation. Should not actors be more liberal?
