Since the characters begin with "unknown" identities, they are not identified by their name. So you start with the pretty James Caviezel, who wakes up in a warehouse. He finds out that the place is tightly closed. Do not ask - the windows are made of safety glass and it is impossible to come out. Four other awakening men turn it into a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in a "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as Chair "Bound Man" and Jeremy Sisto shot and killed "Handcuffed Man". Oh man?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective amnesia. They think that three of them are kidnappers and two victims - but they do not know who is who or who is who. Forgetting is based on a pipe leak. Do not ask - it happens. Outside, senior attorney David Selby (as Parker) sends his police to solve the abduction, while one of the men's wives, Bridget Moynahan (as Eliza Coles), desperately waits. But the gang leader of the criminal elements, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots", is also on the way to the scene. <br /> <br /> As the DVD says, "As secrets are revealed and clues are revealed (the five men), they have to go against time to find out who is good and who is evil to stay alive." This story, unfortunately, reads a lot better than it appears on film. When the secrets are finally revealed and the memories become clear, there is no great interest in what happened. Although director Simon Brand has a great premise with Matthew Waynee's idea, it puts a strain on investment in the characters who hold the short end of the stick, with little investment. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (01.11.06) Simon Brand - James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear and David Selby
