This movie appears like a square pen in a square hole. A bad vortex. Such a favorable pin could not even be made in a sweatshop assembly line in Chinatown, Mexico. If you try to push the vortex into the hole for which it is obviously constructed, it will crumble into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell of rotting fruit and can not be washed off. Quigly is such a pen. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terribly horrible that it could not be created. A movie like this must have been the result of a natural disaster; some crazy creature that has clotted somewhere in a corner of a damp office and has become eternal and grown until it looked too big and too awful. Only science would be interested in something like that; Anyone who does not tend to study it would get it out of this world. <br /> <br /> It all depends: If you like the first violin evenings in the first year, racism or Coke Zero, it could be just your birthday.
