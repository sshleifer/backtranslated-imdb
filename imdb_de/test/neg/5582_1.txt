It is unbelievable how much a movie can cost so much time and effort, and yet it is disgusting. For those of you who appreciate tedious special effects and unimaginable details in every setting, you will see this movie in awe. Quite simply because Predator Iceland contains none of it. It's a superfluous remake of every horror-monster movie of the last two decades. Now I appreciate bad horror movies, they have a certain sense of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will be included in the Cult Hall of Fame, then my first suggestion is to find some imagination and creativity and to gain talent. Oh, and a few more dollars you can put in your picture. A horror movie tradition was to shock the audience with violent deaths and flatulence. However, the shock will not be delivered for more than a few seconds. To really get a satisfying response from paying viewers, the development of characters should be some recognizable traits. I know, you probably say that this guy does not offer the filmmakers anything intelligent, he just says an amateur comment. Well, that shows how amateurish these filmmakers are. <br /> <br /> Despite the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver background. The performance of Dan Gordon as Chris is great. In a script, he has nothing to work with, yet he can come out of the movie and look like a star. Of all the actors, he is the only one who believes in what he recites. Not only does he empower the audience with someone we can identify with, we also have someone we look forward to getting through the rest of the movie. Gordon shows real talent and the ability to do quality work and overcome a huge obstacle, the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon will hopefully be a star sooner than later. That is, if he can get movies like these that hold him back.
