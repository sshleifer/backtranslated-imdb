Do not get me wrong now, I love a good movie and after seeing The Thin Red Line (and I loved it), I wanted to track down Terrence Malick's two previous films and, after seeing Days of Heaven, my enthusiasm Badlands has practically disappeared. <br /> <br /> I've noticed a lot of rave about beautiful photography, but I saw this movie on a terribly old VHS tape that made it look pretty awful. All I can say is that I hope the photography was outstanding because it would have been one of the few interesting things in this movie. Not since the replacement killers fell asleep during a movie. This movie felt (and it was not!) For so long. The cut was choppy and incoherent, the plot was not there, the voice-over was an incoherent foray, the characters were poorly developed and the whole thing was unpretentious. I know that Malick did not know how to make the movie. He then shot a lot of material that he worked on for about two years to put it all together. This is very clear on the screen. Everything seems hacked, every time a scene seems to gain momentum (or a certain character development), it would be uncomfortable to make boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to cut a story together from residents' inventories. The few good points are the music and the hunting scene at the end, but these things are not close enough to sustain the interest. Normally, I would pass a bad movie without being too loud, but when it's so overrated, something has to be said. <br /> <br /> Maybe a farmer would like it ...?
