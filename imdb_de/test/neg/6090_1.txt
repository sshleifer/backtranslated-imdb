Luckily I saw this movie alone and made it possible for me to fast forward through the worst scenes (actually most of the movie). OK, some things are not all bad, with some good photography (even some of the underwater scenes) and sometimes not so bad as directing. But it still does not save the incredibly bad script and much worse acting. Besides, if I do not consider the movies as "hottie", even the would-be sexy love scenes get boring. Really boring! And for the drama: You know, it's always a bad sign when you reject all the characters so much that you really do not care who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you still do not feel tired of Survivor's reality series, you might find something in this movie that you like. If not, stay clear!
