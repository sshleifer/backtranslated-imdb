It does not surprise me that the creators of this hopeless film could not find a British distributor and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper could not do, that this was a movie that would not make up for its costs. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller about riddles It would have helped if they chose a lead actor who could speak properly, rather than the mumbling Vinnie Jones, who seems to pronounce "riddles" as "Riell" , And it would have helped if the dialogue had not been swamped by noisy places or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The conspiracy is ridiculous: The lost Charles Dickens story helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, but also a copy of Herges Adventures Of Tintin, as the connection between Dickens and Jones does not exist. And we have the ridiculous premise that a budding investigative journalist picking up a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript would take several days to read it, just so that Flashbacks on Dickens can be replayed throughout the movie if they had something in common. What they do not do I mean, if you found a new Dickens manuscript, would not you just go somewhere and read it? The film ends with a surprise that has become compulsory since The Sixth Sense. However, in this case, it does not surprise you so much that you offend your intelligence. If the film suddenly becomes supernatural at the twelfth hour, it might be more acceptable for Vinnie Jones to be a robot. It might not have seemed so intrusive if the movie had been stylish, but it is not. And in several places it seems decidedly amateurish: There is a scene where a table is laid out with a 60's spine technique, but they have not made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of the cut between the cuts is. As a result, you can see how things change at the edge of the frame if you really want to see how things change in the middle of the picture. A good rule when filming is: If you do not understand how to do a technique, try something different. <br /> <br /> The real mystery is why someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place.
