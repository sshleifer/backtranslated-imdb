This terrible, terrible piece of tripe is everywhere. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are some decent actors (Charles Durning, for example), but the director has not gotten any of it. The action has Santa Claus feeling depressed and thinking that nobody needs him anymore. He brings a little girl across the country trying to reunite her father with her mother. It includes a con man in a santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by "The Love Boat's Isaac"), the world's biggest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but not an actor) of hardened factory owners who does overtime on Christmas Eve and a sled race where someone skis one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, it's worse on the small screen. If you see this movie next, run, do not go to your TV and unplug it. You can cook your TV to remove any remaining infections. If you accidentally look for more than 10 minutes, you may need to burn your TV and the cable company will need to install completely new wiring.
