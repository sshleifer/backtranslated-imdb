Do not be fooled by the 'Awards' and the comment below. This is just a bad movie. The way George Katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene shows this dramatically. In the rest of the movie, the character's head seems to be elsewhere. His emotions do not match the things that happen in the movie. The things he says as voice-over do not add anything to the movie. It just makes Zeus an even more spiderless character with his head in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and the movie were composed with a fantasy lack. All parts of the movie have been badly stolen by other modern directors. Let's hope Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
