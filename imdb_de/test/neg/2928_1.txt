Can this "film" be considered as a film? Imagine the situation: someone puts a handy camera on a tripod and in front of a beach promenade and films people walking or jogging along. Then he puts the camera on a beach, buys ducks in a pet store, opens their cages and lets them run in front of the camera. Later, he only films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is it an experiment or just an insult to the intelligence of the audience? What would happen if an unknown director made such a movie? Would we mark his job with 10? I always disappointed directors who believe they can do anything they want as soon as they become famous.
