This is a smart little movie worth to be found and seen. <br /> <br /> He really addresses all of the everyday choices we all make every day, and (like an HG Welles story that I can not quite remember) can live to want to go back. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly, but when you start thinking, it's boring = bang = it's over. And believe me, the "punch line" is one you will remember. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if the producers will offer them for sale - or on the web, but in any case I would be glad that you took the time to get a copy - of this I am for sure.
