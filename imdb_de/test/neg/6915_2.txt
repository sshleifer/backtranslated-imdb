Nobody in this movie has a lot to do. This is probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. The make-up effects for the pianist with Makromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps this from rating 1. The assistant's doctor makes extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in a matter of seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the hospital's next scene. The director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a crazy medical film, but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang it up. If you do not know someone in the cast or crew, I would not recommend trying one of them.
