After a few dropouts we are still waiting for the French horror movie, which the critics will certainly thwart, but will introduce a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline can not be accused of being ignorant of the genre (he's the publisher of a high-profile fantasy imprint, worked for the legendary magazine Starfix.) But why a scenario in which EVERY clich√© is used in the book (except perhaps the Odious Comic relief)? Why make it so predictable? Even the nod towards Argento fails flat. It's not even a Euro-teen movie like the German "Anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that seem to have little relationship with each other and many lots of action holes. The whole "Celtic" aspect is barely touched. And after a painfully predictable "revenge," the script offers us a boring, endless chase in an underground necropolis that seems bigger than the Parisian catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But even a mother would not. Oh, and the writer Valerio Evangelisti should have a cameo, but I searched in vain for him.
