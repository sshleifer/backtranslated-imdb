Six months after high school sprinter Laura died during a race, a killer begins to use a variety of sports equipment as a weapon to murder the rest of the track team. That offers very little style, originality, or decent gore. <br /> <br /> What it does provide, however, are some amazingly awful musical interludes, some familiar faces (including an early appearance of scream-queen) Linnea Quigley) and a bit of nudity (a requirement for any Slasher movie!) , So forget the death scenes - they are lame and rather bloodless - and instead enjoy the movie of memorable manure elements: the quick editing that can trigger migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disco, accompanied by a long heavy rock song "Gangster Rock" performed by the unforgettable terrible Felony; a spontaneous jam session of the students of the school; Christopher George pounded it as chief Red Herring coach Michael; and the cheesy music teacher who follows his female students (who for some reason find him quite irresistible?!?!). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the action increases a bit. with the discovery of the bodies of the slaughtered children under the stands and a rather twisted scene in which Laura's body is in cap and coat, but it all comes too late to save this movie from mediocrity.
