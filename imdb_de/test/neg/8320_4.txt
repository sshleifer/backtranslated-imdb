The brave seems to show that the main character is naturally brave. I would not agree. The more courageous in a situation like the one in which she is brutally beaten up with her fianc√©, who does not live another day of it, is to persecute the criminals without resorting to a totally distorted view of society. Erica, the character of Jodie Foster, is a radio personality whose niche roams the streets and records the action. We have no real depth, apart from 'she had someone she loved, he died, the police are not following her, she's getting a gun, Yada-Yada-Yada, she's getting involved, but not really with the main detective '. into the figure, and so there was something left over from earlier films: the self-justice code of justice, where taking power into their own hands is all there is. But we're never sure if Erica is healthy or not, if the filmmakers take a position in one way or another (to the end, which is a stupid message you take with you anyway, including dog as an overbearing metaphor) Today's New York City, which has become much safer than, say, twenty years ago, looks like you are being hit or hit in the right alley with a knife, or you're sitting alone in a subway car. <br /> It might even a slightly better movie in all of this - maybe in the undercooked subplot with Terence Howard's detective involved in a custody battle of a child who is not his and a wife. He's not connected to a stepfather, and I do not know what it means having parking and being a bad guy - but we have a script that is ruled by both fist and logic. It becomes ridiculous, for example, to see that the logical side of Erica was initially unable to shoot properly, as she was seen in her first shoot in a convenience store at the opportune moment of a wife's assault by the husband - and then The illogical of her Give Crack Shot a shot, shoot at a pimp who bumps a car in the head against her and kill him and duck just in time to avoid being run over. It does not help that Jordon's style becomes a little more than unbearable with the camera: he's called a Stedi-Cam for a 'reason', not because he can swing in and out. The script and direction work out well or work better than they do It can be under the desired circumstances: When looking at the actual hit scene under the bridge, which is recorded by one of the criminals of a normal criminal in a video, a step that is completely disoriented. And when Erica is back on her radio show for the first time, and she freezes as she tries to do her old shit and speaks "out of her heart" about how scared she is - that scene, of Foster's performance The clear direction and the script is the best scene in the movie. But apart from that, there are only a lot of positions in a psychology that's weak: is she a De Niro in the Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We've got her story about scenes, some of them have nothing to do with their radio show, they've been watching how disgusted she is when she walks around at night. They can do nothing but their self-imposed task of clearing the streets. Unlike Death Wish, a film that had more ambiguity and ended up with no response in a revenge scenario, the path of endless violence is just a message that will not be news to anyone who has seen a second of life movie- of-the-week-melodrama. <br /> <br /> The performers are content with what has been given, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating to remain inexplicable (and unintentionally funny, like some of the expected, the choppy plans and the simple old ones) Explosions that Howard had shot after a scene in a scene), and the temptation to go out, gets stronger and stronger. It is a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of real interest and clear conventionality.
