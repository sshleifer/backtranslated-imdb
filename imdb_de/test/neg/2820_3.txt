I'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies. If you put them together, that's my favorite point: awful sleaze. But you will not get it in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is certainly some sort of sleaze in the form of girls who are kidnapped and tortured and tied naked to different things. The shame, however, is not very shabby. It was not very high on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls were the least attractive and did not seem to be as threatened as they were. They seemed to be thinking more about what lunch was or maybe if they could get a crack. <br /> <br /> Forget about the effects, they were extremely lame. The lameness was contributed by the bad spectacle; Effects are harder to believe if not even the actors and actresses participate. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was pretty bad, they could have made some cameramen out of a porno movie and done better. In fact, this could have increased the sleaze factor so much that it is fun. There are many dark settings where you can not see very clearly, and what you can see does not look so good. <br /> <br /> The horror factor is zero. Zero. Zero. Nada Postcode. Zilch. I've seen children's films that were more frightening. There is no camp here. It's just a movie that tries to be shockingly bleak, but does not even come close.
