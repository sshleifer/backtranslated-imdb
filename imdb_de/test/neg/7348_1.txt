I always hated this delayed show. I liked Cartoon Network's shows like "Dexter's Lab" or "Megas XLR". But I never liked that piece of shit. Basically, because it has stupid characters (the good guy or the bad guys all seem to be mental, they have stupid voices (especially Bubbles, it's supposed to be the "cute" character of the show, but it's unbelievably annoying) The storylines are very, very Some episodes could have been interesting, but almost always the show becomes childish and cheesy There was no sympathetic character, the music was terrible and the animation is the worst I've ever seen. "Even a five year old boy could draw better I can not understand why the whole world seems like I love this piece of trash. "The Powerpuff Girls" seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made, fortunately "Foster Home for Imaginary Friends" was far better by the same creator.
