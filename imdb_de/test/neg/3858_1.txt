There is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting for something but man. It's pretty good, and it has been made and repeated many times in film and television. Some are notable, but this urbanized version, bringing in the tired old racism themes, simply stinks. Leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the non-circular script. Chaplin, this guy is not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can not stop dancing weirdly. You have the usual Nazi holdover or neo-Nazi, however we should think, type villain, whose son is of course gay, German accents.
