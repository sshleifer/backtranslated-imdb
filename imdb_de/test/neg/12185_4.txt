This was the penultimate film appearance of Jill Ireland, who died in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer of cancer. Ireland made some waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband David McCallum in 1967 and began her long-standing relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time guardian in the number of deaths reported on the screen, has one of the most enduring marriages in film history. <br /> <br /> 'Assassination' seems to be a movie that was anchored in Cannon's production schedule for Bronson and Ireland. Ireland already suffered from cancer-related illnesses in 1987, and one can almost imagine that the two actors want "only one more for old times". "Assassination" is done inadvertently as a whole, showing the lack of Polish and dwindling funds that would fuel Cannon until 1990. It's kind of nostalgia, though, when you see the couple together one last time and the movie makes you wonder what really helps relationship to survive in the chaos of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a senior secret service agent to protect First Lady Lara Craig (Ireland). The president's wife has a reputation for being difficult to run service agents and doing things in her own way. However, that changes when attempts are made to improve her life, and she has to drive with Killian by car, train, motorcycle, and believe it or not, with the dune buggy to escape potential assassins. There is little surprise here, as Killian believes the killers are part of an insider job that may be arranged by the president himself. Along the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop an unspoken affection in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are actually very funny. <br /> <br /> What really appeals to me is how this movie was promoted on its release as it is still being made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that 'Assassination' is another cold-hearted Bronson shooter. But much of this film - which by the way was rated PG-13 - is funny and reminiscent of a romantic thriller like Bronson and Ireland's Western "From Noon Till Three". Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher ready to blow anything up. What he does, but to a lesser extent than his other 80s potboilers. <br /> <br /> All in all, 'Assassination' is a late work by Cannon and does not really know what kind of movie it wants to be. In addition to drifting from the action to the romantic thriller and back again, there are serious mistakes in continuity. The values ​​of the real estate are cheap and the effects are terrible. Many of the explosions seem like dull work and not on-site. Robert Ragland, who had shown good compositional skills in previous films, partnered with Valentine McCallum in a score that is largely synthesized and better suited to television. Richard Sale's script has a real dialogue talks between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot. There is no explanation why the First Lady is suddenly called "One Momma" or why Ireland is left with a British accent when the character is from Wyoming. Jan Gan Boyd, who is Killian's main assistant, has a kitten-like personality and has been badly misunderstood as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (a former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as assassin Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> By the way, this was the last movie directed by Peter Hunt, who appeared on the scene with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' in 1969, and worked with 'Hunt' in 1981 with Bronson and Lee Marvin. 'Assassination' is available on DVD from MGM Home Entertainment; it will be presented in two widescreen and standard formats with trilingual subtitles and cinema trailers. <br /> <br /> ** from 4
