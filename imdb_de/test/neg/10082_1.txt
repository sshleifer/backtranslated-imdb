How could anyone, who liked the previous JP movies, just keep up with this 1 hour hustle and bustle? There are so many stupid things about this movie that it is amazing !! I remember when I visited JP as a kid, it was my favorite movie and show, acting, SFX, music, directing! All in all, fantastic, JP2 was pretty similar in my opinion, except for some really stupid moments (like the gymnast kicking a bird of prey ... please!), But overall a sizable and sensible cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> But the third does not make sense !! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry has taken over from JP2, and yet it magically adds new things to the franchise that could not be missed on the last two films! For example: 1) The "new" Mega-Spinosaurus - seriously, what the hell !! This thing follows them everywhere, they can not escape their presence and yet you see it in the lost world (the same island) once? Do you hear it? Does anyone even know that? NO! It is ridiculous!. The star character in the last two movies was and always will be the T-Rex. What does the d (urr) irector "Joe Johnston" do? Kill it! Once you see the huge T-Rex in all its incredible, roaring splendor, it will kill you and you'll never see it again - a new Dino in town is the excuse .. where is it from? !! ?? not a single explanation! and do not start with the whole thing with the satellite phone in Dino-belly! 2) Just as you start to wonder how stupid the Spinosaurus is, you see the Raptors. Apart from their new "punk" haircuts they seem pretty believable! * Phew * You will make this movie worth seeing? ... NOT CORRECT! Now they talk to each other !! and the excuse that they are speaking in this film and not in the first and second ... Wait for it ... Evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months after the end of the second film, amazing! Surely they would have had to make unruly thumbs and create tools !! OK, I will not say more about the plot because it gets on my track. So I would like to conclude shortly: Jurassic Park is a classic. JP3 is a lousy jerk for one of the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was really dead after seeing this monstrosity (no pun intended). Avoid this movie like the plague
