There are rumors that a fourth underworld will happen. If so, then the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. In prequels that follow the original films, you always ask yourself in which order you should watch the movies, so it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In that case, I think it's not that much makes up. The third Underworld movie is no match for the other two. They also had their obvious weaknesses, but it lacks a few things, and it feels like you're making money. It seems like there is not going to be a full throttle, which is a pity, because the actors could have used better material for the collaboration. <br /> <br /> The story is fine, but it's nothing special. A nice movie, but Rhona Mitra could not fill the shoes of Beckinsale (yes, she plays another character, I mean the emptiness that Kate B. left) ...
