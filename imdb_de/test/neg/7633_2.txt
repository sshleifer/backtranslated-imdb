Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress, but as for the roles she can play when you can not say anything beautiful ... De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child Dad, she can hardly bear since she grew up and has become a - of course brilliant - shrink. She's having an affair with Banderas, which we suspect (whatever!) Of being a serial killer. Sometimes she remembers Bandera's mother Tippi Hedren's character in "Marnie". But I would not count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and many regents are desperately trying to replace him. Here, the director snatches all the stops a thriller with an unexpected end, but this end is so far-fetched that it is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes the compulsory "conversations with a serial killer" in the tradition of "Silence of the Lamb", murders (humans) and cats), split personality and open ending in the event that crowds should not ask for more, and they were right ,
