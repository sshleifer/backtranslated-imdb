** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) because director Alejandro Amenabar later tried "The Others". Based on a brilliantly measured and frightening creep of this film, I assumed that his earlier efforts would be of similar quality, and I was in the mood for good horror. Instead, I came up with the dullest, most absurd apology for a lame-minded Slasher movie I've seen since the German movie "Anatomy" (which I somehow remembered). The plot has potential but it is thrown away within the first 20 minutes. It is the psychology student Angela (Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper perpetrator), which deals with the topic of violence in films. Due to some far-fetched circumstances that are too stupid to enter, she is in possession of a "snuff" tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela and her spooky girlfriend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked but intrigued by the band and decide to get to the bottom of the matter. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never really give a reason why they want to find the girl's killers (as they resolutely refuse to contact the police during the entire deployment event, even if their own lives are in danger) and The puzzle itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one correct hint (the type of camera used by the killers is detected), and this is a) a really weak one and b) which is out in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "riddling" happens only through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plots of action and a SLEW of terrible, transparent and thoroughly meaningless red herrings that are only forced to refresh the runtime. <br /> <br Seriously - Amenabar may know his stuff about ghost stories, but he's obviously never read a detective book in his life. The key to a good cause is having a large group of potential suspects and gradually eliminating them with skillful deductions and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence before the final turn occurs. In "Tesis," * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD *, the identity of the killer is guessed right now almost instantaneously, and then we have 100 minutes in which the writer tries to throw us off the smell until his ideas run out of hands and says "OK, you caught me, it was him!" Any kind of logic or motive behind the crime - no such luck. You look at the wrong movie if you are looking for it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that distracts "Tesis" from a stupid, badly written thriller is the way he actually tries to make some ridiculous, confused "points" about violence in movies. I have no idea what attitude he is trying to take on the subject, but it seems determined to stuff a ton of misleading, confused psychobabble between the rest of the gibberish and say, "Look at me, I'm political!". The final scenes, in which the "point" of the movie is supposed to be hammered home, are so absurd and pueril that one should not be surprised if Amenabar now feels embarrassed to look at it. If not, he should definitely do it. This is a total "Amateur Night at Slasher House" stuff. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can not believe that I spent two whole hours (it felt like at least six), just to hope that something could happen. The urban legend of "snuff films" (and that's basically what they are, despite the way in which this movie implies that they are a kind of criminal phenomenon that sweeps the world!) Is an area that in good horror can be used as tempting films ("Videodrome" someone?), But it's so easy to cross the border childlike. "Would not it be cool if!" Territory with it (eg: "My little eye") ... "Tesis" reaches a low point for the genre "snuff". At each level, this is better dead and buried. I'll award a 1 in 10 to get nice lighting, but that's all they get.
