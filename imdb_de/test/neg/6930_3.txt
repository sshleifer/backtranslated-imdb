This movie is about the frustrations of filming. It certainly frustrated me with his endless boredom. The scenery is an attractive Spanish coastal town with its usual large cast. The script is written very poorly or there may not be a script. Just all ad-lib. <br /> <br /> A far superior film about the frustrations of filmmaking is Francois Truffaut's "Day For Night" from 1973. He shows all the delays and shows how the cast can behave in a fascinating way. It does not bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director, who somehow has to finish the film.
