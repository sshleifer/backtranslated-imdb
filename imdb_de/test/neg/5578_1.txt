Predator Island starts as six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) as well as Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend some time with Kevin (Michael Wrann) spend. Father's boat celebrates on the open sea. What could go wrong with such a great-sounding idea? Well, for starters, a big green meteorite near your boat could plunge into the sea and an alien life force might come out of it and try to kill you all, that's just a ridiculously stupid idea, right? <Br /> <br /> Contributed, written and directed by Steven Castle. I thought Predator Island was crap and it's simple and straightforward. The script is of the worst kind. They know the kind of horror that's full of annoying teenage characters doing the stupidest things and saying they're full of clich√©s and totally predictable. It just makes sense Suddenly without construction or explanation happen, it is already boring at 70 minutes and it has virtually no entertainment value, not even an unintentional laugh. The film does not really have much of what I would call action, there is no explanation as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's thoughts or why it can be selective in the sense that the person is in a moment the case will be. Normally the next, when history requires it & for no apparent reason they suddenly get green glowing eyes and a sudden urge to become cannibals. There is not enough horror in it, the so-called action scenes are pathetic and I do not want to think again about Predator Island, let alone waste my precious energy typing those words ... Director Castle does not do anything to make this thing visible, and the "special effects" are absolutely terrible, this alien creature guy would not even get into a fifties sci-fi movie. The filmmakers even play Blooper footage during the credits, but this is the least funny collection of mistakes I've ever seen. You can not even understand it, if you know what I mean! Forget about a decent gore, since there is none, there is a bit of cannibalism and a few guts that give the unfortunate performers the gut, so that another unfortunate actor can pick them up and pretend to eat them on an alleged budget I have to admit that the filmmakers worked on a really low budget, which is still no excuse to make such a bad movie. The whole thing looks very cheap and the acting is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island is crap, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is and I just can not see what someone would get. In my humble opinion, this should probably be avoided.
