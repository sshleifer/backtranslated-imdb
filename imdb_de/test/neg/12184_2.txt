In the dawn of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-term partnerships with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also shot two films for former Bond director Peter Hunt. The first was the decent actor Death Hunt from 1981, the second of this indifferent political chase. The murder is quite boring when the truth is known, and in the end, you crave for more passion and tempo, like The Wilby Conspiracy (which clearly resembles this movie) bronson strolls through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose job it is to protect the wife of the American President, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, the real wife of Bronson). Killian believes Ms. Craig was attacked by assassins; She considers him an overpowering, paranoid pessimist. It turns out - surprisingly, surprisingly - that Killian was right all the time and actually someone wants to exterminate her. The two are on the run, pursued by the assassins. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that the wife of an American president is known as First Lady. For some reason, they renamed them "One Mama"! So it's about everyone's guess, but it's an indication of the futility of the film as a whole. Most of the movie's performances are lazy and the script takes a long time to get where it belongs. If I had to name Assassination within a particular genre, I would say that it was a "thriller". I would say that with some caveats, it's a thriller that has few thrills.
