This is really a horrible movie of one of the usual standards. Action, plot, drama, effects, direction - I could go on. Suffice to say that it is poor. It does, however, have a certain appeal. Many totally out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun to look for the Batman references. Um - that's it. Really poor, do not bother.
