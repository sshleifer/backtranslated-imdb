A film about a French girl being raped by street lovers. The rape scene itself is visible in all its bloody details with all the male and female organs and their interactions for the camera. In a fit of rage, the victim grabs her friend's weapon (or was it his brother?), Shoot him and run away with the gun. She meets this prostitute, who has just seen her pimp shot down, they join forces and make their way to Paris. This is followed by a series of crazy, meaningless and wild murders. The girls seem to enjoy more murder than before. A poor guy is shot in the **** hole. Between the numerous murders there is a good portion of sex. <br /> <br /> The movie is not the most violent I've ever seen. I would say that Saving Private Ryan probably had more violence in it. If you are looking for violence, there are many other films. And if it's about sex that you're interested in, I'd suggest one of those XXX movies. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie because of all the hype the media gave it. The movie itself is no big deal, just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a handheld camera. I was surprised that this film had an age limit of 15 years in Sweden. If 15-year-olds can see this movie, they should also be able to watch XXX movies.
