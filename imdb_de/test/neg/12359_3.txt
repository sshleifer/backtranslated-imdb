So one afternoon I caught myself as "What Lies Above" and actually saw it, because the beginning was promising. The heroine Diana Pennington is a mountaineer expert ... but that does not help her if her fiancé Brian gets hurt while climbing. When she leaves to seek help and returns, he disappears from the mountain to never be seen again. Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she does not get close to the snowman's existence. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program. She agrees and they go up with Curt Curt's two assistants: his "bodyguard" Hugo and computer chatterer Tyler. You know from the start that there is an ulterior motive, but unfortunately the twists are not good and lead to a ridiculously bad tracking sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never materialize. The object of the sky that has fallen into the mountains (which does not turn out to be so supernatural), the story of the snowman pass and the most memorable of all: Diana's dream sequence in the middle of the movie. But most of all disappointed me where they dropped the ball. Most of the film is about finding Brian, so for all my life I can not understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was will never be resolved in the course of the film. This was the main plot. That's how the movie started! How do you summarize that NOT? <br /> <br /> I would not say to many people that they are familiar with it ...
