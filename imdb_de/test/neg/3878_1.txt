This was a Hindi movie. Hindi = terrible reasons: cheap dialogues, cheap special effects, cheap directing + stretching a max. 2-hour movie in 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... little %%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Especially for this movie: 1. Dialogues are not funny. They are cheesy and cheap. Although Akshay tried his best acting, which I admire him for, comedy was not funny at all! I only laughed three times during this movie. 2. The first half of the film was useless for the story of the second half. The second half was the actual story / movie. the first half was time away / build up. 3. The characters are not developed properly at all. paresh rawal is clever in the first half, an idiot in the second half / rest of the film. We do not really develop feelings or concerns for Akshay and Govinda. their characters are nothing stupid anymore. They do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. Jokes are funny, but in a very serious scene they are not funny. The figures of the gang and drug smugglers are cheesy and have been used in the last 20 films. There is nothing new about these characters. Again they are stupid because they are funny. stupid = funny, when stupid in the entire movie is the norm. The only character that made sense was Lara Dutta's with a real story. 4. Special effects were crap. in the end, people fall from the head of a fire truck. They notice that they are not really on the ladder in the air. secondly ppl will fly off when the ladder is moving. ppl can not fly off a ladder when it moves ... it falls directly to the ground due to gravity. 5. The whole movie has been synchronized. All dialogues were recorded after the movie. The actors' lips are barely synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap, but I can not remember it. Watch this masterpiece of crappy Indian films by non-intelligent, even stupid directors, and you'll agree with my review. People who like Hindi films, please increase their expectations of the decent quality of Hindi films. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all Hindi films are bad. I like some I did not like this one. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the effort of Akshay and Lara)
