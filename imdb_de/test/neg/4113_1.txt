Man, I went to this movie because of the great preview. It looked like it had a great story and nice special effects. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. I wanted to leave the theater because of those terrible special effects. A cartoon Dino from Cartboard would be even better than this one. The story was good if it had been taken over by a major movie producer. Who would throw in some more money to make the effect livelier. The only thing I liked about this movie, where the plants appear everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse, when the cars in a scene run two characters along the road. If you see these cars, you will see the following: taxi, car, motorbike, tri-pod, big bus. And about four times in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is the "butterfly death", which would set the whole "development changes" in motion. If the guy did not step on the butterfly, the next Dino would have eaten it anyway! This is an absolute bull. If you then change something in the past, the future will be different at the same time. Not in these "time waves" that they did. But hey, if the future changes in a fraction of a second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic. This is just one of those movies you should see if you want to have a big laugh. I spend a lot of money on this movie in the theater. And then they tell me that this movie had a budget of $ 80 million. WHERE WAS ALL MONEY GO ????
