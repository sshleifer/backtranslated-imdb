The books of Frederick Forsyth are always so complicated plotted, with twists and turns and usually a big surprise ending. This adaptation had none of this. <br /> <br /> So much of what was great in the book (the story of Monk and the betrayed agents, the plan to influence the outcome of the Russian elections) was totally lacking in adjustment. Instead, there's this whole new bioweapon story that was a Yawner. Forsyth's protagonists were always in the shadows, always just a little out of reach of the opponents. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of fulfilling their mission. This film was very early on shootings and car chases expressed. <br /> <br /> Swayze's Monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he got during the game, The Movie said. And with all this attention, the time the bad guys needed to catch up with him was surprising. <br /> <br /> Granted, the movie had some energy, which is why I give it a "3" instead of a "1". It was also great to see some under-used professionals like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. I hope someday someone will do justice to a Forsyth movie such as "Day" the Jackal "did.
