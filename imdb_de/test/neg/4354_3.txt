I've tried to watch this movie three or four times, but I just can not get past the fact that it's all terrible. I'm sure it was a brave step by someone to cast Jack Palance as the protagonist, but there is not a single fiber of my being that believes he could do anything, let alone the type. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant author, but that's not obvious here. This strange and enforced mishmash of the '50s hipster dialogue seems to obscure any real meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even the good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane), knows how to express their Deliver Lines - It's as if they do not understand what they are saying. In the meantime, Wendell Corey and Palance are holding a grandiose contest to see who can have more face. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateurish and totally overused. The physical interaction between the characters is stilted as well as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss this vile crowd? It's so hectic and ugly that it improves the robot quality, the quality of the characters, the dialogues and the depictions. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to drain my energy. It looks like everyone got an overdose of Valium every morning when they arrived on set. It's a pretty lousy movie to make Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters look bad, but this movie is successful. <br /> <br /> I can see that he could have been effective as a game on or off Broadway, where intellectuals and beats occur, that they could congratulate the power of the plot and the artistic flourishes of the pseudo- HÃ¼ft-Dialogs had appreciated.
