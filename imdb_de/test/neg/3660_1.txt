If I was a low budget filmmaker, I would probably check this page to find out what people are saying about it. So I hope that the makers of the movie have actually read this! I think you should find a way to repay me for the one and a half hours of my life that I just wasted watching this garbage. Stop making films about something you're probably dreaming about. Just stop making movies. They are one of the reasons why indie filmmakers find it so hard to grow up. Do the world a favor and get a job as McDonalds or something so you can do something more productive with your life! I want to call Blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this movie in their store.
