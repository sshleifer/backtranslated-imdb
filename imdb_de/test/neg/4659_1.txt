This "lock-buster" should carry a government health alert. When you play it on your DVD machine, there is a serious risk of opening a gap in the space-time continuum and disappearing into it without a trace - so bad is this "movie". <br /> <br /> The fact that this film was so successful proves the true desperation of modern Hollywood cinema and the ongoing commission of films that address the "lowest common denominator" - though I'm really scared To think about the "lowest common denominator" that this movie actually depicts appeals to !! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood was doing a kind of test experiment when they shot and showed this movie! I can imagine the meetings in the executive boardroom in the studio ... "How bad can a movie actually be - and still make a lot of money! Holy cow, I did not know we could be so bad !! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only films that are worse than the ones I can imagine (and can trust them to be around) are The Another Day (RIP the Bond franchise as I knew her) and Independence day! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID !!!!
