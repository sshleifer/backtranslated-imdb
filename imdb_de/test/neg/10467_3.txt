Well, before I tell you the synopsis, it's a review without a spoiler. Bone Eater is the worst movie of the year. I do not know how these films even come on DVD. If I saw that in the cinemas, I would be very upset. Bone Eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find bones. It's the 'bone eater' and the more bones it eats, the more powerful it becomes. <br /> <br /> At first I thought, okay, the DVD artwork looks scary and sounds scary. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label, it looked weird. But when I recorded it, I could agree on one thing: the title "Bone Eater" is better than the movie. Tell me, what's stupid? A bone eater that only attacks by throwing a bone, and you disappear? Do not worry that this is not a spoiler that happens in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that 'Bone Eater' has a horse? Do you know what I think is the stupidest? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> The CGI is awful. Yeah, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone Eater' was scary, but once you see the real thing, you think it's some kind of action movie or just a cruel, mean joke. The movie felt longer than Titanic and that was half an hour. As soon as the movie has some exciting moments, it just stops. I admit, the acting was not the best, but it was decent and the violence was not exaggerated, but everything else is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Overall, the bone eater is a movie that you can skip. If you like interesting movies with great creatures, great CGI and suspense, 'Bone Eater' is a movie you can skip. If you like bad movies, no matter how cheesy they are, 'Bone Eater' will satisfy you.
