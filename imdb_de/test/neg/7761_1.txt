I watch family affairs, coronation and West Enders on Uktv every week. Family matters are by far the worst, worst conspiracies, bad sequences, and the worst of a therapy, worse than the Americans, and that says something. <br /> <br /> I find it very frustrating that all of these shows on uktv Australia are so far behind the UK, and if you want to find out why, they're catching you up with a story they've made with double episodes Of course, this never happens: I am very happy that family affairs have room to make room for something better, but at the same time I get to know the background, did they finally realize how bad it was Did people stop looking? Whatever it was that you should not leave us in the balance, why do you feel that you need to keep everything secret from your fans, or are you just indifferent? You should try to keep your audience informed Family matters are only known to havi When the characters disappear and seemingly reappear for no apparent reason, we engage in people and enjoy it, their lives I can understand why family matters should end, even when we are here in Australia, it is so far back that it is easy for the authors to lapse into ideas for new actions, so that many actions are repeated and old ones Return episodes. I have also noticed that new characters are being introduced, a lot of them are really bad actors, as if you were scratching the bottom of the barrel and ending up with the drek, Greetings Vince
