This movie infuriated me because it was only made because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are clearly evil. What happened to the poor man was really terrible and a tragedy. But where was Hollywood when four religious white children were executed after being forced by two evil black men in Wichita to engage in a series of sex actions on their killers and each other two years ago? The celebrities are only suitable for the camera if it serves political purposes. Even Laramie is portrayed in a bad light by this pseudo-documentation, which of course is not surprising, because they are the returnees that must be trained by omniscient and enlightened Californians. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Laura Linney.
