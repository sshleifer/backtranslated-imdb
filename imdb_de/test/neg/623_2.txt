I am an atheist. For me, history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This film was made after a novel published in 1921 that has been updated to this day as if it were a history book. Well it is not. The film is about the novel version of the 50s. Some actors were great, but that does not include the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, the man invents a super bomb, so that God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they have to intervene. The analogy of the devil pursues man, and in defense we have the mind of man. What is the mind of man? And why was the first defendant Adam? At some point you will only receive US propaganda in a fifth-grade history book. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored. <br /> <br /> First we get the story of the caveman. The women are grim stereotypes of girls in need. Real cave women were as strong as men and as resilient. Hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. All this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Next we get Egypt's first pyramid construction. Today, we see a different story and know that there were much fewer deaths and regular citizens. Losing the mentioned amount of lives would have been a national catastrophe, and no one would try to defeat them. As if there was only ONE pyramid. <br /> <br /> The part about Moses and a true God was as if the Spanish Inquisition was in good demand. Inquisition itself was never mentioned in the film. Helen of Troy's evil grimm was so mean that I did not see why so many were interested in her. In reality, it was only soldiers who followed the orders of the commanders and "discussed" a political issue of power. She was just an apology. <br /> <br /> The story of Cleopatra was when I saw that this film was too inaccurate and full of propaganda. Here my brother was much younger. She was not obsessed with poison, had a good education to restore library content, and was politically competitive to crush Egypt out of the dirt. Yes, Rome has burnt down. Yes, Christianity was persecuted. But as they put it, it was as if the Coliseum were building itself and there was no Vespasian who could rebuild Rome. Attila the Hun appears briefly and then we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the Crusades to Russia, which ended in an ironic fight. The knights just went home and started fighting for fun. MANY things are laid like no plush, hygiene and disease in the interiors. Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has too much make-up and looks like a princess. Territorial policy was replaced by an unfair court. The side saddle alone on a stool makes me wonder how anyone could follow here. When I burned down, I wanted to scream "Hura! Now!". Cheap special effects, where is the fire? "<br /> <br /> When they spoke of Leonardo, I was already fed up with the movie: Columbus, Spanish slaughter of America, is screaming Queen Elizabeth" Kick the Spanish Armada "and so on. <br /> <br /> The only reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that he was the last of all 3 Marks brothers and all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians amusing, but nothing more than a smile The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as are plagues (after revival), when they begin to portray revolutions, they become hungry and anarchist.The US Revolution was persecuted by the French Revolution, which is oppression and incompetence bad, but you can not just blow the old way out of rage, you have to replace it with something, so you replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy, we're getting Napoleon and his ambitions to land over to India But they replace his motives with unity and only give him the title "Emperor". The conquests in Europe, the defeat in Russia, are looted to Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The American Civil War, the English inventors (Tesla not included). "Mr. Watson, come here, I want you" made me laugh almost for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was reduced to the final discovery and the comic abuse. <br /> <br /> After 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but nothing of their terror. Adolph's words "I invade Russia, this is my last territorial demand". It was his last territorial demand. <br /> <br /> To build tension, God puts a countdown clock on the "wall" for the last words. Can all the powerful break the universe for a second? There was no need for the chant, but the defense made one last throw. <br /> <br /> Lastly, we see the man of tomorrow as the last defense. Apparently a paradox man, because the bomb of today should go. His toys are a music box in the form of a weapon and a sword box. That is so wrong now? Pens and pencils drew so many weapons plans that they outnumber the atomic bomb. And making music out of a weapon? Blinded egotistical generals make music from gunfire. The man of tomorrow is already a monster. <br /> <br /> As I see it, the defense only had to blame the devil as the true conspirator for the downfall of the man and the case of the case. And frankly, compared to all the barbaric things our ancestors did centuries ago, we're pretty painless these days. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I just quote "Firefly's episode" Jaynestown ":" The estimate that every man ever made a statue out of him was some kind of bastard or another. I have nothing to do with you, Jayne. It's about what they need. "
