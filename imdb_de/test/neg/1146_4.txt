I've just watched National Lampoon's Christmas Holiday 2 on DVD, hoping to see something that at least comes close to the original, great holiday comedy "Christmas Holidays". I have not seen anything like that. You can tell right from the beginning that this film simply could not keep up. It's too bad it has a title that links it to the original Christmas holidays. It's really sad. The movie can not stand by itself. I think too many people will see this movie because of the strength of the title and it does not come close to this level of comedy. Apart from the title, the film connects very little with the original "Christmas holidays" and even less with Christmas. The comedy is very simple and the plot bad. Children may find humor here, but most adults would just giggle here and there. This movie is a flop. Do not waste your time with it.
