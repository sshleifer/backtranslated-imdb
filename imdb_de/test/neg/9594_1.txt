******** SPOILER ALERT ************** I spent 85 minutes of my life watching this movie. most of all, we think it's weird that the producer in the movie was an autopsy doctor with a terrible, unbelievably incredible accent - what was that anyway, Romanian? And why is it that in Denmark nobody speaks Danish except the moor creatures? (Note the Scottish camp leader ...). ? And who cares about the moor creatures? Her pants looked like they were being bought in Banana Republic. Beautifully dressed for 1200 years. This was worse than Scarecrow Slayer (we did not think that would be possible). We basically got through 75% of the movie and searched for gore / death / scary moments. Not found. Borrow the DVD to watch the 2-hour "Behind the Scenes of Bog Creatures" preparation. Who are these people? Are you serious? And the filmmakers are 60 years old. I think that's her holy grail and that's pathetic enough. <br /> <br /> BEST LINE from the movie, no doubt: "Not bad for a girl who has not even gone to school ..." My blind granny, who has Alzheimer's, could make a better movie.
