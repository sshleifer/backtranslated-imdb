The most fertile man in Ireland revolves around Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and still a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy man versus women. For Eamon everything changes when he is seduced by a woman (as far as I can remember a neighbor). It's not that he loses his virginity, but discovers he has a superpower. Despite the protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. The doctor tells him that he has a very high sperm count. His mother is brilliant at an idea that lets us run everywhere at the end of the film. He starts helping women on both sides of Belfast to give birth to babies. First volunteer then with the help of his colleagues to lead a business out of it. The most fertile man in Ireland has fun moments, but had to come up with better jokes and a better script. I could not help but think that I have the impression of a TV sitcom rather than a movie. Kris Marshall is another name on the canvas, but does not seem like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in a movie like that. Just as he's actually in love (I think he was very funny in that case) .. Well, it was okay to watch, but could not fall asleep from time to time. ** out *****
