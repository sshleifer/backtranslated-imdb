There are, in fact, some good reasons why a person should take the risk of going completely mad by this show. The breasts are beautiful, although some of them are not real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on the screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place to just enjoy peace and not to worry too much about being eaten by a rubber khaki. It is always good to know that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god. It's not so much about his acting skills as there are none, but his chest hair talks a lot. There is also no KITT in this series, which is good, as Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview that he always believes KITT is gay. Of course, that could make him look like an idiot, but given the other statements he has made recently, this should not be surprising to anyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this is the kind of show that is completely harmless to humans. This gives us a lot to look at and laugh at, which many deliberately humorous shows really do not bring us. I have to say, it's no wonder Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I like to watch the show. No, it's not a great show, it's actually pretty awful, but I like to watch it. It's basically like a B movie that spans over a decade.
