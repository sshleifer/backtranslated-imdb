Sometimes you just have to have patients when you watch indie horror. If you can just fumble through the slow early scenes, sometimes a real gem turns up ... This was (unfortunately) not the case with "Satan's Whip". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore of a movie without really paying off in the end. I suspect that black and white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, but it's never explained why most of the blood is blue, and I found that more and more annoying as the movie progressed. The story itself is not so bad and in fact has some originality and decent content, but the drama is just pathetic. This, along with the slow pace and absence of any (red) gore, quickly made "Satan's Whip" forget. I'll rate it "4" for a funny dialogue that made me giggle, but unfortunately I could not save that boring waste of time.
