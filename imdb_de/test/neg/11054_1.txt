Jeff Leroy wanted to make fun of Scientology, so he built a horror movie around a similar cult. The phrase is that instead of the frail old L. Ron Hubbard as cult leader, there is a centuries-old world monster who turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty student who deals with the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to make him, with the help of the cult, to clean up his life. It does not take long before he finds out she's just looking for one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was shot very cheap on video and I'm just ugly. The Space Monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks constantly crazy and has no skin) is alternately a miniature of clay and a large-sized animatronics puppet, both of which look awful. The acting and the writing are both terrible and the director does not even try to conceal the fact that this film was made in vain. Avoid that weird, pathetic little apology.
