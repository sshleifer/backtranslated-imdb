I'm usually a very generous voter at IMDb and do not comment on the movies I did not like, but that was just lame. I actually turned it off 15 minutes before quitting to see "This Is It" (because my girlfriend wanted it ... I just chose the lesser of two evils). <br /> <br /> If You Want To Watch This Movie: Think of this movie as a collection of above-average "horror" stories, such as "eerie short stories" featured in an issue of "Reader's Digest" in the waiting room Find your dentist. <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything terrible or funny, I'm not "I want to see blood!" - a person, but this "movie" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" or in any way entertaining in any other way. <br /> <br /> It's probably scary / fun and entertaining to watch the movie poster of "You've Got Mail" for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7 years.
