Princess Warrior is a sci-fi action film with a rather thin storyline - essentially after the death of her queen mother, two sisters, one wicked and one good, fight for control of the throne. The good sister is beaten, so she flees to the earth, where she appears naked in the middle of a wet T-shirt contest in a strip club. The rest of the movie is basically a long chase scene as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister. However, the younger sister is helped by Bob, a kind-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by the police involvement and ignorance of the good sister about the customs and culture of the earth. The older sister repeatedly brings her younger brother, who escapes and flees again. During all these actions there is a cult of women on the home planet who have some kind of space age to bring back the good sister. Unfortunately, a good portion of this movie seems to be pretty boring chases as they drive through Los Angeles (and what was the sound effect when the police car crashed?). The film ends in another physical battle between the sisters with a predictable end. <br /> <br /> It seems to borrow elements from Star Wars (the lightsabers and the appearance of the girls' home planet in the opening and the following scenes), dr. Who (the telephone booth likes means of transport.)) And some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could come from Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Ms. Dana Fredsti (the evil sister in the movie) mentioned in another user commentary "the endless (and boring) wet T-shirt competition." It's really the longest wet T-shirt competition in the world Cinema history, and the only one where the participants were. " They wore industrial-grade cotton-polyester shirts that defy all efforts to make them wet and translucent. "I could not say better, the only thing I want to add is that the music in this scene is just annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is pretty over the top, but that seems like the whole thing The actors who played Vinnie and Vito were just too much for me - I just found them annoying - Mrs. Fredsti (Curette) seemed to enjoy herself and did not take it too seriously, unlike Sharon Lee Jones, who had behaved decently but seemed to take everything seriously, all the police were portrayed as limping idiots, presumably to add a comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary as the whole movie was pretty weird. <br /> < From the point of view of the ratings, this film had a lot of dirty words, some without women and others slightly dressed in thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those looking for nudity, a sex scene that a was presented in a non-graphic, dreamlike manner; and little violence - while there were threats of violence everywhere, the scenes of both swordplay and brawling were exaggerated and too storable to be "offensive" even though the actors seemed to enjoy it a lot. > <br /> I have to wonder who found the names of the characters. Egg (a small egg), curette (a scrape and cleansing surgical instrument), exzema (suspiciously similar to dandruff and pruritus), bulemia (an edema with bumps and cleansers) and rickettsia (another disease)? <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a bad, comradely, low-budget action movie, but it kept me entertained, though maybe I need a few drinks before I look at it again.
