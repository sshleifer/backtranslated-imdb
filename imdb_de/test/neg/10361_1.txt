I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb children go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ... that could have been fun if it had not been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues were not even half an inch of fun. The only thing I almost showed was when the stupid policemen were keeping the teens in either Oklahoma or Kansas. The plot could have been fun if it had not been for a profound interpretation. If you even think about watching this bitch movie, do not do that. How dumb is it that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them that he is gay, how his friend did (just that he did not do that ...) and that this stupid joke about the different meanings of the I laugh at my hair ....... NOT ....... Anyway ... the worst movie I have ever seen !!
