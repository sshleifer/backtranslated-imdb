This * should * have been an incredibly funny movie ... but it falls flat on his face. (In fact, I stopped half watching what I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a secondary motivational speaker left an elephant by his father, whom he suspected was dead before he was born); He then has one week to bring the ponderous pachyderms across the country. His adventures on the way are best only mildly amusing. The comedic talents of Janeane Garofalo remain largely untapped. Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as Jack's mother (who has much to explain), and Pat Hingle is a former circus partner of Jack's dad. - Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first, but that's hard to believe ...
