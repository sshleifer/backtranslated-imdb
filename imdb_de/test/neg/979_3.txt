I can imagine what happened to this movie: A couple of studio males sit around drinking gin-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a movie that bridged the generational gap, which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that would be equally interesting to both rebel college-goers and their parents - perhaps for a variety of reasons, but still a ticket is a ticket. What interests hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism and wild scenery and costumes. What interested your parents? Musicals, Eye Candy, a feel-good script and nostalgia. All right, "Lost Horizon", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can not miss it, right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon by James Hilton may be less of a classic, but not a bad novel. He broadly outlines a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The Valley of the Blue Moon" near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of very long-lived monks. Paradise is invaded by Gilligan's Island-like plan by outsiders (a World War I veteran, a missionary, etc.), each with their own attitude to the situation - what a conspiracy each one's reaction is to one of them to be presented choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the turmoil of the twentieth century. By his own suggestion, it's a soft pop flair that presents Hilton's conservative British views in an "oriental" gown, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As imprisoned, honored guests of the monks, the Castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never forced to work or to pray (not that the monks themselves do too much), treated royally and received simple but luxurious accommodations - whoever would like to escape? In this Central American heaven on earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is rich and delicious, the villagers are picturesque little things and nothing changes. The nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look and even flirt a bit (the reason given is one of the most amusing inaccurate explanations of Tantric sex I've ever read). Even their religion is not threatening: revealed as best of both worlds, a mixture of Christianity and Buddhism, there is hardly any one to insult, except the most enduring fundamentalists or the weird orbs that actually knew something about Tibet (what in the early thirties Years was a huge little number). <br /> <br /> As a Capra movie focused on the adventure / character game angles, he was adorable. and maybe Steven Spielburg could have made it to fly if he had been there. As a Hollywood product of the early seventies, the adventure was over too fast and the updated list of characters too boring to make an impression. Without the sketchy, suggestive qualities of classic B & W, the convent resembles a luxurious beauty bath in white and light blue, and while at least some of the monk's robes strive for historical accuracy, most of the inmates saw it as being on the way to a morning massage and a massage Fango bath, with a few holes of golf in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim would have eaten the story a little and put the very real conflict in the reaction of each character; Only five years later, Brian Eno would have brought the quiet atmosphere to a T; Instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David had the task of writing the songs that combine muzak-like melodies with some of the rugged New Agey lyrics ever written. Of course, at this point in time, each song requires a dance number that ranges from mere forgetting to completely boring, as well as the script that does not have a line worth quoting. <br /> <br /> Tie-Ins There was Legion in this movie - from cookbooks to posters everything was planned to promote this movie, and the hype was that I actually went out and bought the Sountrack album. The only good thing I can say is that I was impressed to write this review almost thirty years later - the next month I read Aldous Huxley and bought a copy of Bardo Thadol. and learned something about the true Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
