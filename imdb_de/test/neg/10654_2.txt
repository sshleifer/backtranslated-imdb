This movie is awful, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity of the Chinese, the film did not show any convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot made no effort to show us more than a cheap common sense ... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can draw from it is that it demonstrates how arrogant a human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The drama and scenery were fine, but the storyline ruins everything, full of cheap clich√©s and hypocritical scenes. I expect not to see this movie again in my life. Skip this!
