Take the secret agent / James Bond madness of the sixties, mix in some of the concepts of Sax Rohmer's female Fu Manchu femme fatale and stir in the most absurd, twisted revisionism of director Franco - you've got the man-hating lesbian sumuru or "The 7 Secrets of "..." - better known as "The Girl From Rio" in the US, reminiscent of "That Man From Rio," which has nothing to do with it, yes, it's in Brazil, we have to, Sumuru or Sumitra, as it is also called, is like a nasty version of "Modesty Blaise", played by the actress Eaton, with the familiar shy smile that most of us in "Goldfinger" got to know Looking out of the camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (but doubling in her lesbian key scene), controlling a whole army of female warriors, colorfully dressed, and governs a city called Femina or something (outside of Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which have previously appeared in Sumuru's "Million Eyes," sound terrific, but despite some intriguing sets and visuals, they follow the same carnival atmosphere, such as the very dated "Some Girls Do," which came about the same Time out and there was also a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed women, usually lined up in a row, is arousing great interest, but after about 15 minutes, you realize that there is nothing but visual adjustment. <br /> <br The plot follows a seemingly secret agent, a man who arrives in Brazil with $ 10 million. He caught the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, who pounded him as the older Bond-type villain) who sent dark thugs in Bowler caps to attack him. This all prepares for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious Sumuru (the criminal lord wants the secrets of Sumuru). Sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that's one of the secrets. That sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond a slow pace. There are many attitudes that could require a great deal of attraction: an image of an arriving aircraft, for example, remains on the plane until it has almost come to a standstill, as if it had never been recorded on film before. There is a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if something unusual. The fight scenes are very inferior, as if the filmmakers had to make the first adjustments. To increase the production value, there is a scene of the real carnival in Rio, which is located in the middle. I guess there were a number of budget problems, especially in the climatic battle, where counterfeit sound effects and smoke mask a lot of wrong actions, such as the lack of real weapons - that reminds of the times when kids came in. Use plastic pistols and claim that bullets are fired and do not fall convincingly. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a figure to get answers, and female nudity, an early account of this kind, after some restrictions were lifted. But most of the time you will roll your eyes. Hero: 3 Rogues: 5 Women Fatales: 5 Henchmen: 4 Fights: 3 Stunts / Chases: 3 Gadgets: 4 Car: 4 Places: 6 Pace: 3 Total: 4
