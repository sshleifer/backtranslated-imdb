My girlfriend and I are totally into kitsch horror movies. Especially those with a lot of unnecessary nudity. When we saw the block cover for this movie at Blockbuster, we thought it would be the perfect movie for the night. We started to see it and did not expect it to be GREAT. After 20 minutes of the movie, we realized that the tempo would not increase and that it was an incredibly boring movie. We tried to get in, but the plot did not make much sense even after reading the back of the DVD box. The movie was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to find out what was going on in each shot. Every violent scene has been very hard to spot, and you can never see the expected violence. This is definitely a movie with no motives, which was shot badly and is very lengthy. Each scene was about 20 minutes from the same thing and I felt that after the first 5 I had understood the point. Skip this movie and watch another Freddy or Jason movie, and you'll be much happier.
