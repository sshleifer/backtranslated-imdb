Nothing but the director's youthful imagination comes to life. This "movie" is nothing but an excuse for the director / actor, with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time of day to play a kissing face and does not exist and the movie undresses while the actor / director / Author / Narrator tells. Do not be fooled by the 'X' rating, there's no nudity and minimal blood pressure.
