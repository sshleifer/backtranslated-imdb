That was unbearable. (SPOILER # 1) Protagonists avoid meaningless disclosure of agonizing truths to their relatives so that they do not give up the status quo and take on the role of antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) The authors would have us believe that the exposure of multiple transgressions by the transgressor poses a threat to the main victim of the transgressions and triggers a retaliatory reaction from him. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes I expected a score of 6 to 8 out of 10 points. It was more like finding out that Lieutenant Columbo's dog is the REAL killer. The story was just not believable and I do not think the best director in the world could have saved it without massive editing.
