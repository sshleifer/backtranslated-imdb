A better movie could have been made to depict the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective and the film gives a good idea of ​​the suffering of the people, especially the children, but overall it looks less like a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest of the cast has worked well without being extraordinary. Should be watched to get a rough idea of ​​what the war with the children of Bosnia has done. If you're looking for a great and gripping movie, Welcome ...... will be a disappointment.
