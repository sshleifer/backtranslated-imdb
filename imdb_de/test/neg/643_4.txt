After seeing this movie on TV, I looked it up in the IMDB and to my surprise, I imagine a user rating of 7.6! This is not a good movie. The processing is particularly bad; The bad way in which the story jumps from one point to another was moody and a big distraction. It's not very fluent. I agree that the acting was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was intriguing enough.
