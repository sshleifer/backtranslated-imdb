Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness is a dark, profound and sustained novel that depicts the futility and irony that takes place in Africa. If you're looking for a great book to read on the weekend, this is not the book for you. Conrad holds nothing back when he describes nineteenth-century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel in search of a great adventure story, I would say I wasted my time, but in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization, I would say that this is one of the most important novels is that I have ever read. Due to the fact that I read this novel in my English lessons and we analyzed each page, I think I appreciated the book more than someone who just read it for entertainment. I'm not going to lie, this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. The film, however, I found tiring and boring. The movie "Heart of Darkness" does not recommend anyone to give justice to the book. The film has skipped many important parts that I consider important to preserve the true message of the story. If you have trouble understanding and visualizing the novel, the movie may be a good recourse, but I would not recommend watching the movie as an alternative to the novel or from another perspective.
