This is a movie that should have been a mini-series because it tries to get too much information in too small a space. The whole story is constantly bombarded with sub-tracts, character launches and meaningless piece information that go nowhere. There is an underlying plot in which a boy meets a girl, she has doubts, but still marries and then her doubts crop up and she goes to see if they really are. It turned out that they were not, but her husband can not believe that she was not unfaithful and that her close friend does not want her because she is not unfaithful to her husband. In all, there are no less than 1000 negotiations and sign-ups that make this action almost incomprehensible. For the first 15 minutes, you are flooded with so many things and situations that you simply stop worrying about it. They do not care about one of the confused and messed-up gypsum that drifts into and out of history like vultures feeding on a corpse. Everyone comes in and takes some interest from the viewer. After half an hour and completely disinterested I stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure curiosity. I could not imagine where it was going, but as if staring at a fire, I just could not get up and turn it off. The production values ​​are excellent, but the resulting film is a waste of time. Wash your socks instead.
