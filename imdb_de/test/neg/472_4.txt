The man with the screaming brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian city. William Cole, a wealthy industrialist, ends up with a part of his brain that has been replaced by that of a Russian taxi driver Yegor. The two could not be more different, but they have one thing in common - both were killed by the same woman. Revived by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common enemy. Bruce Campbell returns to the B-horror movie genre, which gave him his iconic status, this time not just in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately, the laughter did not hit and Campbell has to do what he does best to fill the void in this film. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell he has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to be added to my collection. Although I have seen this movie before the purchase, I am glad that I do not have the "pleasure" of adding it. <br /> <br /> The film first goes awry in history, which at first glance seems like harmless fun, but turns out to be boring dribbling. Which is sad because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it just makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of the funny things that made the audience get what we've already seen ... fight for themselves. Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. It brings freshness and a fun time when the movie really needs it. It is helpful if you are a fan and have been following these henchmen from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to like this movie. Campbell's experience as a director by directing television episodes series Hercules is obvious. Campbell makes sure the movie works well on a low budget. In the end, there are not as many things as you would expect, but the fans of Campbell are definitely behind, unfortunately for this fan ... I will not.
