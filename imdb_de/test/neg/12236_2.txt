There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It's fun to watch different sports movies and clich√©s, but none of them are funny from a distance. Most of the films they parody do not even fit into the movie and are really just theirs for them to attend. Not the main actor was well staffed, but that's really the only good thing about this movie. Also, the different cameos were sort of cool to see, but I have no idea why they would waste their time being in this junk. Luckily, I only spent $ 4 on it because it's not worth spending money on. Just make sure that you have absolutely nothing to do or just waste an hour and 30 minutes.
