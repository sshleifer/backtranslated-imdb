Son of the Mask is a horrible movie. I do not like the baby and I do not like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a sweet couple, but that can not sit through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (so it is said) the film could not end soon enough for me. The only true laugh comes at the beginning with a short appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a repeat of the first movie. Actually, that's just an insult to re-infusions. Why was this sequel done? This movie has cost millions of dollars. Why should I sit with a baby and a dog through a movie and purposely drive my father crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented, but has nothing to do in this movie. I do not bother to be nice to this movie. 1.10
