This series and Elon Gold were hyped in sitcoms for NBC as "the next big thing". Well, they were not. Dennis Farina was terribly miscast as a father-in-law. He just seemed uncomfortable and out of place. The term "private convoy" time! should become the "Dyno-Mite"! Keyword of the 21st century. Well, that was not it. People then asked how they are today (if his name appears). I saw him in an episode of "The Mentalist" tonight. I mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked, "Who?" Not funny. Total waste of airtime. NBC really had high hopes for the show, but it just turned out.
