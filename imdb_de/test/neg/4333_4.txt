The author of "Prince" manages to record a great cast, a decent story, and a mediocre script, carefully putting them together into a boring, monotonous, amateurish mess. Despite a strong central performance by Frank Nasso, the prince, this disjointed film wanders aimlessly from scene to scene and painfully disintegrates into hashish. The result brings relief at the end, where the tears of joy should be. A sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how NOT to direct a movie. <br /> <br />
