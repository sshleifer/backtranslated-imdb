Okay, it's awful, and I mean, terribly easy to take this movie apart. What do you expect from titles, synopsis and actors in Leads like Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my personal favorite Roger Ready? Yes, B-star John Agar is here as sheriff to rid the Texas countryside of a robotic monkey from a NASA experiment that went awry. The movie features terrible performances, terrible landscapes, terrible special effects and terrible lighting. I really do not think it's good to talk about it, unless bad movies think you could do a lot worse if you're looking for something terrible to get through. It is tolerably short and has many moments of unintentional humor. Missing queues, insults from faux pas, off-screen terror, an incredibly insane score, and of course John Agar, who's trying his best to be the core of the movie with a serious performance in the midst of this crap. The beginning is the hardest part to persevere, because it seems like it will take forever for these two teens to find themselves in the woods on the back roads of Texas, where the monkey will soon smell his vengeance in his terrible way. Yes exactly! Night terrors! Bah!
