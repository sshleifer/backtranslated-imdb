This movie was recommended to me, so we saw it together. I would not call it a movie, it's more a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories that are not all that funny. There are several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. He's just trying too hard to build everything in 2 1/2 hours. I left the series without wondering what happened to this and this guy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is just an enhanced version of "Hitch," which has a lot more characters and dancing br /> If this is the best movie this couple has ever made, I am pretty sure that none of his previous interests me.
