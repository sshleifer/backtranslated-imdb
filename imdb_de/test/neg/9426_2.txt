This is a Cold War Propaganda film that is crossed with a soapie. It may have a long-term meaning as a snapshot of 1950s US thinking, but there is hardly anything to recommend in the mawkish storyline, the wooden playing, and the grid style. There are a few interesting photos of long gone planes, but that was not enough even for this plane lover to leave it on screen for the full length.
