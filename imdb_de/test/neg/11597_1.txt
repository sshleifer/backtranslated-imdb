A group of environmentalists travel to an island to discover a secret lab experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover they are too late. Apparently, the government had a scientist test his experiment with a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra that made them very tall. I'm not sure if this movie was really worth explaining or deserving, because it's almost identical to the curse of the komodo, which is also crappy. The computer effects are as good as ever and the komodo roars like a dinosaur that really got on my nerves. Like Boa Vs. Python, this movie is not worth watching and is about as fun as putting your hand on a table. Avoid!
