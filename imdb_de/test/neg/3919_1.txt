Square pigs as a way to efficiently use cargo space is the only smart moment in "Space Truckers." Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper made it worse, see "The American Way," but this movie is high on the "cream of the crap" scale. I think the best way to describe the visual experience is that "Space Truckers" will not please anyone. To be taken seriously too cartoon-like, an almost total disempowerment and a poor character development virtually cause disappointment. The beer and popcorn crowd may be willing to contemplate, but everyone else has been warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for the reasons mentioned above. - MERK
