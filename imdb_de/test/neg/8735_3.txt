First and foremost, I would like to state that it is unbelievably stupid to call your film an "embryo" if it is only a scientific study of fetuses (animal and human) at the age of 12 to 16 weeks. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy, and from then on, the unborn animal enters the fetal phase. Okay, honestly, I did not know all that, but I took the trouble to look, and that's what the creators of "Embryo" least could have done. Do not worry; I'm not just stumbling upon details or being overly bitter, because there are several reasons why "embryo" is a big failure. Actual science can be considered boring and inaccessible. Therefore, science fiction is a cinematic genre created specifically to make the otherwise boring but educational topics more interesting and understandable to a wider audience. By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go terribly wrong, or space missions that encounter evil aliens rather than light years, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects while teaching them useful little science facts. To make a good, or at least reasonably decent sci-fi movie, writers and directors have only one basic rule: DO NOT be boring! If they can not meet that one condition, the viewer can also read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong in the production of Ralph Nelson's "Embryo". The basic premise may be intriguing and even involving, as we are all very anxious to save the lives of the unborn. There were also some very prominent names involved in the production, such as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice does not live here") and director Nelson himself for the acclaimed classics " Soldier Blue "and" Charly ". What went wrong then? Easy. The script is irrevocably boring, clich√©d and the whole thing looks incredibly stupid because the lab landscape and scientific equipment are clearly too primitive to make medical breakthroughs. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays in a very poor performance a doctor who has not been passionate about his research since his death. When his car meets a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything he can to save the fetuses of the dying animals. He manages to keep a fetus alive, accelerates the growth process impressively and trains him to be an extremely intelligent dog. Since his procedure is so successful, Dr. med. Paul Holliston his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus, which comes from the belly of a pregnant teenager who has committed suicide. However, the female subject grows unexpectedly fast and after only a few weeks she is a full-grown, gorgeous and super-intelligent woman. The good doctor, of course, falls in love with her, but the groundbreaking new growth therapy also shows terrible side effects ... In the first 45 minutes of the film absolutely nothing happens, apart from many implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo jumbos and one or two deeply impressive tricks of the dog. While this second half of the film contains a bit of (grotesque) action and excitement, the stupidity of the dialogues and the implausible twists have already ruined the potentially fabulous sci-fi idea. There are some really cool scenes, especially the chess showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-obtrusive supporting role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridicule, and it almost feels as if Ralph Nelson had laid the final catastrophe because it was the general rule in the thriller & sci-fi cinema of the present. The final sequence, including the horrible still shot at the end, certainly does not match the tone of the last 100 minutes of the movie. But still my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and its trainers. An animal with such a mind and talent certainly deserves to show his tricks in a much better movie.
