I let a friend persuade me to watch this movie, and all I can say is - I want to kill that friend. <br /> <br /> That's one and a half hours of my life that I'll never get back I'll regret it forever. <br /> <br /> If you've had the misfortune to see this movie, you'll agree that this is the absolute worst movie ever made EVER! <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie and remember to see it - Let me save you a lot of time and warn you: DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM, IT'S SUCKING !!!!! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails, the attempt of comedy and sexiness - it just seems stupid, trashy and disgusting. Try to have women in the movie who are actually sexy and sexy, and do not look fat, ugly and rude !! <br /> <br /> Acting is as ridiculous as writing. Obviously this was done by totally amateurs. I can not believe that these people were allowed to make such a stupid movie, is not there a law against it? There should be a lot of good "b" movies when you're dealing with these kinds of things, but do not waste time on that crappy Wanna-be movie. <br /> <br /> PEACE
