However, it must be said that there is perhaps more than said in America that it can still be a sensitive issue here in the UK. Look at the whole debacle of gay militarism a few years ago The United States. With "In and Out," author Paul Rudnick grapples with the small-town mentality of Central America and the way the press in the United States (and Britain) make so much of a celebrity visit. You just have to see when Will Young and Stephen Gately from Boyzone have left the closet. The film revolves around Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school English teacher in his hometown People are getting ready for the Oscars when one of the nominees, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), came out of town and used to be a student was from Howards. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a Vietnam epic, wins the award just to call Howard gay during his acceptance speech. This could not come at a worse time for Howard, who is just one day away from marrying his fiancé and schoolmate Emily (Joan Cusack). As you would expect, the media reaction is catastrophic and turns Howard's life upside down. Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but withdraws from the filthy news reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although this was considered a screw comedy, it is obvious that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also satirical. You only have to look at the early scenes of the Oscar cerimonee and the way in which people live it. Brackett's hometown and the school's school board react to his trip. Unfortunately, the film does not live up to the promise we see early in the movie. This is a rather shallow attempt to make a crazy comedy into a social commentary. A good cast is unfortunately wasted on a script that never really delivers the necessary amount of laughter and is by no means as close as it thinks. <br /> <br /> Kline offers us the same kind of performance he has given in his earlier comedy. 'Dave', Howard immediately becomes sympathetic. Cusack is also a good value as Howard's overweight fiancé, while Tom Selleck is a gay news reporter who plays very well against guys. Bob Newhart is also a pleasure as a high school principal at Howard. It's great to see him on the big stage. It's a shame it had to be that way. <br /> <br /> The performances, as good as they are, can do little to save the movie from a rather boring affair offer some amusement. The inspired scene in which Howard tries to look more masculine by listening to a self-help tape. There is not much to enjoy, and when things do not seem to get worse, Rudnick resorts to an ailing final that wavers in an exaggerated mood. I could not help feeling that my intelligence had been insulted. Malloy seems to be too scruffy a character to become the man who uses his ethics before he gets a good story, while Cammeron finally comes to the aid of the film to deal too much with a character to get involved Little to worry about what happens to his former teacher. After all, he caused it himself. <br /> <br /> 'In and Out' is not exactly the same thing. But, considering that Klines work better like 'A fish called Wanda', you can not help feeling that this is a big one Talent is wasted. <br /> <br /> Robs rating: * *
