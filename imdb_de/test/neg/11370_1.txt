Director Jeremiah Checheck, who brought us big budget debacles like "The Avengers" and the remake of "Diabolique", has managed this rip-off of The Die Hard concept, which looks like a Blair Witch budget. A California nuclear reactor is being overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - the terrorists are not Arabs; They are really upset American soldiers dressing up as Arabs! We realize that they do not really want to blow up the reactor, just make a statement. We're not sure what the statement is, but it does not matter. So there really is no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to blow up the plant alone, because he's kind of crazy. So maybe there is a threat. But the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and a good guy is killed too. Let that be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds messy and a bit of a waste of time, then you have the idea of ​​what Meltdown is all about. <br /> <br /> The script never bothers to introduce the characters, or even to give personal details that could influence them or affect the audience emotionally. So one-dimensional characters are left to us: the expert who will not listen to anyone; the trigger-happy sergeant; the slimy politicians; the dweeby engineers. The story jumps from one cliche incident to the next in a formula composition of virtually every action movie you've ever seen. But almost always, when we think something is at stake, the script jerks and we realize that there's nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Like The Hard, there is a policeman inside. not to the bad guys. The big twist is that the policeman is here ... A WOMAN! Oh, and she's hurt too. But not so bad, just enough to wince her a couple of times. Oh, and instead of the walkie talkies that Bruce Willis had, this cop has a magical phone that works everywhere ... even in the ground! If he does not bark at everyone, Bruce Greenwood - his granite jaw - tries to calm her down over the walkie talkie. He even makes a joke, but we fear his face could crack. After all, that's a serious business. <br /> <br /> But most of the time it's scene by scene, where people argue: the military expert argues, it's wise to wait-and-see guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people in the White House quarrel with him; The sergeant also argues with him. The nice Pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Movie and lines like "Stop the broadcast! STOP THE BROADCAST !!!" If you're wondering if the characters actually refer to this stupidity, you may be surprised when you roll off your sofa. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the camerawork to compensate for the lack of production quality in this faux-documentary 21 is keeping Gram's style, which should give the scenes immediacy and energy, but the way they are applied here indiscriminately and amateurishly is, is downright annoying. even presumptuous. Further attempts to improve the pace are made with nonsensical black and white material that happens to be associated with the main action. But that too is presumptuous and annoying in this kind of Blair Witch. In short, the stylistic approaches are very amateurish. <br /> <br /> The music does justice to the visuals - it's synthy and cheap sounds. A bit like a porno movie, but with less melody and much more heartbeat sounds. The graphical treatment is also howling bad: cheesy graphics in large red letters screaming to us "21:28 clock," as if the timer actually makes a difference. <br /> <br /> Meltdown can serve as a marketing concept However, it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - a part of Fox - has put together this cheesy production and invested several million dollars on it. That's what I call a meltdown!
