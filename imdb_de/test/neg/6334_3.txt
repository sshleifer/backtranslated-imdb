Another sadistic and ultra-sleazy revenge movie of the late 70's / early 80's? Wes Craven started a popular trend with his "Last House on the Left," even though "Terror Express" is more like a rip-off for other rip-offs like "I Spit on your Grave" and especially "Night Train Murders". Storywise, this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer. The only thing director Ferdinando Baldi still has to do was to multiply the sleaze factor by a thousand! This is actually just a softcore porn movie that gets a bit rough just before the end. In the night train from Rome run three hopelessly moronic losers amok. They provoke male travelers and sexually harass women. Things get a little out of control and a traveling convict rescues a prostitute who is driven crazy by the three. This is a very tame film and there was not even the budget to buy a few bags of fake blood. These types of films are generally notorious for the brutal rape sequences and discriminatory behavior of women, but sex in "Terror Express" is not at all disturbing. On the contrary, these "rapists" spend more time oral pleasing their victims than getting some themselves! The music is great, the dialogues are unintentionally funny and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. The bad guys are wimps and the train passengers are so motionless that they look like part of the set. If you like your exploitation so grubby, this is your movie. Their hunger for blood and controversy is definitely not satisfied. "Terror Express" should be in the porn section of Videostores.
