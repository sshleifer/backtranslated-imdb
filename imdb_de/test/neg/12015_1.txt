"Problem child 2" was a complete waste of time. The original movie was not very good, but it is a classic compared to this movie. The first film was outdone with the scenes of a devilish child who devastates the lives of all those around him. Here it goes further. And a scene in this film proves this theory. This carnival ride sequence was too much for me. It is terrible. This movie should not have been done. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
