I just realized why the colors and sets in "Sakuran" were so flashy and gaudy and only painful to look at. The story is about a first-class prostitute known as Oiran in Japanese. Her kimono was always flashier and more colorful than other kimonos, so the Oiran noticed. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie only gave me goose bumps. You could not call it acting. It was nothing more than supplying her extensive high school fan base. Hey Anna, good luck, when you get older. Yes, right, an Oiran, a rough and vulgar, violent biker. Have not we seen how you portray this character in a more appropriate movie? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? A vile little bitch is always true to her self, which is exactly that: a vile bitch. Inexplicably, she finds that men are attracted to her and that she has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men, and she becomes a successful, high-class prostitute, even as she talks and behaves as if she were a member of a female cycling group. She is being talked about about her so-called seductive ability, but we never see her in action, probably due to the inability of the main connoisseur to pretend to be a fake, I mean "actress". <br /> <br /> The movie's main character infuriates a wealthy and powerful man by keeping him waiting while serving a much lower customer. Not very earaic, right? How could such a woman ever become an Oiran? Oh, because the previous Oiran himself was killed and the house needed a whore who could charge a high price. Who would pay such a high price for a slut? Rumors are coming around. How could there be no effect on what she did to the powerful? Because the scriptwriters are dolts. They just made a bunch of crap. <br /> <br /> Then an even richer and more powerful guy falls for her (why?) And she throws him for a destitute guy, who is usually cold and distant Respects who she really is (which does not make sense How can someone respect such a worthless person?). <br /> <br /> Speaking of crap, it's as if the director is squatting down and a huge, psychedelic-colored dump is taking over the aesthetics, culture and society of the Edo era. What about such things as sabi, mono no awareness, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a strictly hierarchical society? All that is expected of a director who appears as a senseless, nouveau-riche parvenu. The amazing thing is that so many Japanese who watched this movie squatted around the director and took steaming spoons with that flaming, stinking crap and called out how tasty it was. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango music Violin and bandoneon as a backdrop for the Edo era, when Japan was completely isolated from the international world (with the exception of the 3.7 hectare Dejima)? Why not just answer Anna, the evil ass-biker, on her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character who starts off in a hiss form in his red Ferrari? The music we needed to hear was shrill and anachronistic (as was the art design). <br /> <br /> Near the end, I liked the fact that there are only two or three tiny flowers on the cherry tree. But earlier, when she said that she would leave the quarters when it flourished, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring to telegraph the end so clearly. But why is the old tree blooming? This rich and powerful man was already making the entertainment districts blossom in cherry blossoms, like the mountains of Yoshino in the spring. That did not impress her at all? No of course not. I already know about whores. The boys, who treat them nicely, are kicked in the balls. Maybe whores make it a problem for people to idealize them when they know who they are: just cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Given the director's obsession with goldfish, the penultimate scene should have played a role. A goldfish bowl on a porch was accidentally knocked over. Two fish fall into a stream that kidnaps them to escape behind the walls of the entertainment district. It emphasizes how goldfish are stuck in their shell and can not survive outside (as well as the relationship of the inhabitants to the pleasure quarters). Otherwise, the speech about the fate of the goldfish has no meaning. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees bloomed, but the shortness of the flowers is something special about cherry blossoms. I could not help but think that the dusk would soon wipe off the gentle pink color and warmth of the scene. The sky would quickly change from hints of the shadow to an ever-deepening darkness, and the night would fall. It would be cold, very cold. And dark. That really was not a happy ending, right? The romantic love (in the Edo period?) Could survive and be ostracized in the face of terrible poverty as long as the cherry trees bloom. Maybe a few days, unless it rained earlier. But the unclouded romantic love that we see here? Their existence at this time is incomprehensible. Anna Tsuchiya goes into the shoes of an Oiran? She could not do it. Literally. Look at the scene of her "promenade" where she seems to have the right footwear, but she has to cling to a guy's shoulder so she does not fall on her ass. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give it movie two stars for the Art Direction, but then I realized what it was about: director's diseased dominance. These colors and sets are exactly as the director needs to scream: "I'm most important here! Me! It's all about me !!!!"
