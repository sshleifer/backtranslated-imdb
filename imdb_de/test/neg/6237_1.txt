What the hell was the meaning of this boring movie? it looked pretty interesting at first, but quickly fell flat on his face. If it's a true story, but if you shout aloud, are not there script writers in Hollywood anymore? I've seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made. Defoe can play almost anything, and when I see him in a movie, I have no problem renting them, but I'm beginning to wonder, too, a great actor is slipping; Maybe they are tough or just lose their senses. The dialogue was long and dreadful with heavy eyes, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they had a hit here? maybe ... um ... an Oscar?
