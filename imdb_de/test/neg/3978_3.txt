I have now suffered through parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> Having the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror. <br /> <br /> The story was about a clone headquarter owned by the "man" They build clones to later extract organs from the clones, for the original humans who need transplants. A clone escapes: The government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story somehow licks. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how a movie with the potential of amateurs like Fiveson is destroyed. The only thing he really managed to do was to deal with the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect, what makes a human being a human, and is it okay to raise clones for the biological harvest? Unfortunately, mediocre actors have been selected, and the plot has left the city to the end, where a pathetic attempt is made to summarize it. <br /> <br /> But !! What bothered me the most was the introduction of new characters without actual relevance to the storyline. Nevertheless, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a terrible explosion that only Sir Coleman Francis himself would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting. It's a mystery to me how Fiveson believed that pulling plastic wrap and flowing water would exceed a believable flow, but if you compare the shot with Coleman Francis' gray pasty oatmeal one shot would win that movie. Maybe Coleman has the bad ones Movies changed for me. 3.10
