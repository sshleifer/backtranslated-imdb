The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and frightening story. Ed was really a playful character and his legacy inspired "greats" like The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How was it that such a fascinating man inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel? Ed Gein made belts of nipples, bowls of skulls, lamps from the skin and danced under the moon in suits of human skin. None of this got into the movie because they had to tell us a fictional story about a ridiculously horrible deputy and his rather homely, sex-hungry girlfriend. This movie seemed to falsify the story. What baffles me is that most films deviate from the path of truth and exaggerate history. this seems to do it to minimize it. I just do not understand.
