In this film, there is a loose conspiracy of a man (Bardem) who wants to get funding for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love (the wide-open Maria de Medieros). He cultivates his passionate relationship with his first and true love and eventually gets caught up in his own romantic web. He never gives up his juggling act until the three main characters face each other. The movie is boring, with a lot of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all reactions in the movie are absurd, incoherent and of course too stupid. None of the characters is believable, which makes the movie a bit annoying. Acting is definitely surprisingly good for such a bad directorial film, which makes it a bit more interesting, but if you can, have a look at another movie!
