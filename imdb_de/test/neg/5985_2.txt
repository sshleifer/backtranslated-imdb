If this is the idea of ​​the author and the director of a piece of life, they are clinically manic depressives. A sad, moody movie with omnipresent, aimless and unhappy characters interacting negatively with devastating consequences. This movie is billed as a comedy. What was so strange about losing your home through a supposedly deliberate arson or the drugged, violent rape of one of the main characters. Is this art imitating life? Jack Black was a little amused as a miner, weed maker. But even this section of the movie was full of pathos. What was the point of living with an entourage in the middle of nowhere? If Black's character was so paranoid, why did he acidify with a group of Woodstock people? Is there no end for separate relationships, a script without a plot, and scene transitions without cohesion or logical chronology?
