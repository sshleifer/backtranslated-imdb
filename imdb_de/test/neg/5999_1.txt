I just can not see what everyone sees in this movie. The acting is just terrible, the choice of music is mild, strange, there are not enough fighting scenes, the plot is absent and whatever little entertainment that you could get out of this movie is made by the annoying way of the movie Films destroyed is filmed and gives you a splitting head.
