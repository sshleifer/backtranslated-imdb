An IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive a passable film for the cannibalist. Are there such people? I did not know it. But if you're one of them, then you have a ball. For the rest of you, this trip may be a little hard to swallow (pun intended) even if you consider myself a horror movie connoisseur. I've been an avid horror fanatic for about 15 years now, though I've never been into the cannibal subgenre until just a few weeks ago, and I'm strangely indebted to my short-lived interest in these groaning movies in China for total disregard of copyright laws. You see, I bought a DVD collection of two CDs of Wesley Snipes' films for 20 yuan ($ 2.75), the last cannibal world, the Mountain of the Cannibal God, Alaten eaten, Cannibal Holocaust , Next, showed Nicholas Cage and something called Voodoo Lagoon along with Blade 1-3 in Chinese. Nice. <br /> <br /> As a second installment, I instantly felt sinking as the film opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering through American cities, bombarding unsuspecting Americans with poison darts, and then running off at full speed. Having no way of making movie cannibals scary, it seems that they are now on the mainland. Later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is currently doing a "training exercise". Include your daughters! <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the film to fit into the old, lost sister routine when a young blond woman named Sheila does her own research on her sister's disappearance, which in no way resembles her, but She wants to spend most of the movie naked, so I think that does not matter. It seems that the hapless cannibal we met at the beginning of the movie and were not used to life in the big city had run into the street after a shot and was knocked to death by a moving van. <br /> <br /> The brilliant police find a mysterious film about him showing how Sheila's sister is involved in a bizarre ritual, but aside from the movie, the guy is a complete mystery. The complaining police chief complains: "We know nothing about him, except that he is dead!" Poor fellow, he has to get a headache from all this. I recommend a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is the kind of girl who can throw tens of thousands of dollars as if she's not looking for her sister. Perfect for hiring a happy hillbilly cartoon as the police will clearly be of no help. <br /> <br /> Obviously, nothing new is added to this tiny subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism seems to be almost the background for a completely different bad movie, for example, for saving a missing person from the dangerous elements. It is not difficult to compact the action of this clothesline. All you have to do is follow a few people in a jungle cult from the cartoon who call themselves Jonas call "cleaning." Personally, I prefer to occasionally piss outside. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he's taken a three-day weekend out of the office to appear in this movie. As he pulls out his reliable medical gear to give her an injection, he warns her, "If you do not believe in Jonah and cleansing (through pain), God will help you." Then he gives her a shot and apologizes politely to her as she gasps on the tiny pinch. I really believe in this guy! <br /> <br /> As far as the thrill is concerned, there are many unpleasant sound effects from random shots of animals being slaughtered, and more than enough disgusting shots of slashed and eaten women alive, so I guess the movie is his Name does all the credit. The drama is amazingly poor, as you might expect, and interestingly, the editing is also spectacularly mocked, but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you need to be able to connect with people who believe in absolutely crazy cults to have something to do with everyone in the movie. There are many non-religious religious ceremonies and it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand why Sheila's sister has decided to turn her back on ordinary society. I'm all for individualism and do your own thing, but come on. <br /> <br /> After a while, the movie delves deeper into your feature film of Mill Refugee, before we witness Glory's highly inappropriate rendition of Glory Hallelujah in film history. IMPRESSIVE. <br /> <br /> Note: In this movie, a woman is raped with a severed snake. If you need more reason not to look at it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
