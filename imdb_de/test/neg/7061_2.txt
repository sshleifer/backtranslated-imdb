In a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by Myrna Loy. With her incredibly wild hair and her voice, which sounds very shrill and weird, it's hard to believe that this is Loy !! She bears no resemblance to the refined and funny character Nora Charles she played in the Thin Man films. Instead, she exaggerates so much that you would almost expect her to star in an Ed Wood movie. What a huge difference made a few years in the quality movies she got, as well as in her acting skills !! In addition to the awfully stupid character, the movie also fails because it's just not interesting or exciting - just very, very stupid and stupid. The only good thing about it is the Vitaphone sound system, which makes the sound quality of this turkey as good as possible, which I heard from 1929. This was even better than in most of the 1930s movies - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even the presenter of Turner Classic Movies has described as "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! And after I saw it, I do not agree. The movie is just bad.
