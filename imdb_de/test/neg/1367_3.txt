"The Brotherhood of Satan" is a startling combination of conventional horror elements combined with ingenious characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts when Father Charles Bateman (as Ben) drives west with his beautiful blondes: the luscious Ahna Capri (as Nicky) and the daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things are getting weirder and stranger for the trio as they approach the city of Hillsboro, which is seized by a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When the boring travelers meet Hillsboro, the action changes to the more interesting characters of the film: townies L.Q. Jones (as Pete, the Sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack, the Priest), and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). Their interaction is sometimes fun. Soon everything will be stupid and predictable. Mr. Martin is the challenger (as you might expect); He holds the possibility of a satanic cult for a "cock and bull story," but is (of course) their leader. The end of "Come in, Children" is puzzling. unless it was perhaps the original title of the film.
