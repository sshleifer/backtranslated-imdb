I like the Full Moon Pictures the most, so I ordered this movie from the US because you can not get it anywhere in Germany. I thought it would be as nice and amusing as the Subspecies or the Puppetmaster Series, because they are full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was glad when the movie finally arrived. <br /> <br /> But afterwards When I saw this movie, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can not even say actors) are boring and untalented. The story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy. <br /> <br /> I hope nobody ever makes a sequel or a remake of this terrible movie. :-)
