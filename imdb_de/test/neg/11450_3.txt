I must have been in a good mood to even give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie a 3. What's wrong with it? Let's start with gratuitous sex, though I have to admit that Bonking's rotation style was something I had not seen (or experienced) before. And I think they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The Oakville Tribune seems to be in a green part of the city it was in. (Hamilton Ontario ???) In the scenes on the roof, however, it seems to be located in an industrial area where a steel mill pushes up smoke and flames. Also, the interior of the building - the newsroom - the staircases - seem much larger than the exterior. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our intrepid reporter is finally released, she comes to the building several times. Hardly likely The end is also compassionably predictable ... the classic bait and switch capsule, in which the good proves to be evil. My biggest objection, however, is that it's another movie funded with tax credits for Canada and Ontario. He is ashamed to settle in Canada and proves again that the Canadian film industry is cowardly and opportunistic. The films of a country must offer more than just jobs. They should reflect the culture. Bad enough that the American studios use Toronto as a location for New York. However, it is embarrassing and annoying for Canadian producers (in this case CanWest Global) to do so with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
