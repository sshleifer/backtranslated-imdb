If I had just read the review by Alex Sander (sic) here, instead of considering the rating of over 6 from a selected selection of the ignorant audience, I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well-made horror / sci-fi. Predator was a great science fiction / action mess. I really only blame myself when I 'Alien Vs. Predator 'saw. It also has an average rating of over 6 stars from the movie's connoisseurs who frequently visit this site. <br /> <br /> STOP READ NOW IF YOU HOLD ANY CASES THAT YOU EXCEPTION THAT RIDDEN PLOT RUINS FOR YOU /> <br /> This movie was ridiculous from the start. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship that was overrun by aliens. OK, so maybe they would throw aliens back on the ground to hunt them and something went awry, but how did an alien / predator hybrid come about and why did not the rest of the crew, despite their great technology, recognize earlier? The beginning was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what was and maybe why. From then on, it gets really ridiculous. I always let my unbelief hang over the screen door and enter it on the way out. I could not be here. <br /> <br /> A father and a son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands (from the given point of view) at least 10 kilometers through dense forests. The man and the boy pursue there alone and find the ship and are hugged. Even at this point, you do not feel much for her, especially because the face-huggers are almost weird and frightening in their movements and actions, and the father looks like an irresponsible, stupid redneck muppet. <br /> <br /> A thriller-like scenario is introduced when an ex-con returns to the city near the crash site to be awaited by his slightly emotionless, boring cop from the bus. When I say that I say, I mean a weak attempt with crap actors, and no feeling is played out. A Slasher / horror element is then presented with a sexy girl and the usual allegedly nerdy or somehow undesirable sweet guy, who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, kinky jock guy (American athlete, not a Scottish man). Oh the sweet / not cute boy is incidentally the brother of the Ex-Con. Yeah, they're smart, these fellows, whose names I'm going to explore, to avoid any other shit they expose again. Then a modern role reversal is such a boring attempt on the PC, the introduction of Ripley credentials with a female soldier who returns home to her husband and child. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens next? I will not tell you much about the plot itself (sadly smiles at the downfall of storytelling in the vast majority of recent movies) just in case you've come this far and not the brightest star in the alien-inspired universe are . <br /> <br /> The Predator is stupid for the reasons of the previous poster, whose contribution I read too late. The aliens are boring. The Predator Alien is ridiculous. The plot is sometimes exploitative, unfounded and disgusting. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh, I was shocked. Shocked at how deep some people will go to get something? A scare? A shock? To tickle the pervert? What? If you really want to shock, worry, and be scared of people who are not pregnant or expect fathers or have no soul, why not just let the alien / predator fuck the naughty women and teen girls instead of killing them? The characters have no depth and not the plot. It is badly filmed and clocked. It is being traded by uninterested people, not that I can accuse them. In addition, two quite interesting and good sets of science fiction characters are tarnished. This movie was trash and if you enjoy it, I really have to worry about you. If you have not seen it, then please make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS Did I even mention the way trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while amateurs survive all the time?
