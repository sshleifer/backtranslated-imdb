Here's another low-quality movie from Disney. There is no Disney spirit anymore. The story is boring. All emotions are wrong. It is not sweet or moving. Disney Company was at one time a kind of magical company that provided children with dreams. Now it's all about making money. Shame on the people who use the name Disney for their personal benefit. It is the case of an empire. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
