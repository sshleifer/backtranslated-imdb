As a Christian, I found this film completely embarrassing. The actors suck, the writing sucks, the cinematography was bad and the story was so typical. I can not say that this is a great testimony because I would be too embarrassed to show my friends who are not yet saved. Hollywood has much better stuff, and that's because they invest the best. Christians stop doing their work and think that it is alright because "it is for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people spent a lot of money sacrificing for God. David (or Saul ... I do not remember) spent what today would cost about $ 50 billion to build a temple for God. But nowadays, it is simply miserable to spend $ 30,000 on making a movie to "witness" to people. It is the person, not the product, that influences someone. Do not waste your time converting your friends with this one-and-a-half-hour waste. If you want to make a positive impact with people, show them films like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc., that have something to say and really bring you closer.
