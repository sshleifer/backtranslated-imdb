This is a movie that really scares me. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons did some of their best cartoons - with amazing animations, extraordinary backgrounds, and great stories. In the late '40s, a new style of animation emerged (like the "Crusader Rabbit" series on TV) - an animation with extremely simple graphics to save money. Unfortunately, the cynical trick of Columbia Picture worked !! Instead of the public loathing the toons (as they should), many accepted them and the Oscar employees (AMPAS) actually awarded the movie the Best Animated Short Film Award - which is the legitimacy of an inferior product. In the dollar and sensory world of Hollywood, this soon sneaked into the products of legitimate studios - resulting in pretty shitty cartoons. Later it got even worse, since the stories themselves were almost unbearable in addition to lousy animations and backgrounds for adults. The wisdom and style of classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy I blame partly GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the grandsons of cheap cartoons. The story is not so bad, but the animation is a horror and listening to the child, which says "Boing-Boing" incessantly, is a pain.
