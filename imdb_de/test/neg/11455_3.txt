Cimarron hated to prevail. Although Irene Dunn does a good job with the hard script, Richard Dix's pompous and overreached role is brutal. The passage of time has not dealt well with the character of Isaiah and other racial and religious beliefs, though the film is about the role of women and the abuse of Native Americans. The processing is particularly weak. This is undoubtedly the worst of all "best" pictures.
