I completely agree with the previous reviewer. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the film focuses on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not at her best, and Spencer Tracy seems naive, simple, and too hopeful-both in love and in life. an idealistic role, which was best in 'Boys Town'. If you manage to get through the ridiculous public scene at the station ... whoa ... it's more of a slapstick and not worth an actor in the cast. Not the best spectacle of anybody. Bust and mismatched. The story is empty and various and disavowed submissions are obvious. Hedy Lamarr himself is absolutely stunning, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy can not keep up with the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the movie does not seem credible, at least for that reason.
