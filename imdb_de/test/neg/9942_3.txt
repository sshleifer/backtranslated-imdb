This is one of the many US attempts to recreate an old classic British television program that is more famous than this. From what I see, none of you mentioned that there was a television set in the 50s and 60s called "Secret Agent Man". The original Secret Agent Man played the great Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner, Braveheart, Ice Station Zebra, The Phantom, etc), a man first named James Bond, but declined because McGoohan was a very pious man and he thought James Bond's hat-nesting and violent ways of being against his values. This show was done in black and white and it's too bad for those who have not seen them yet. You miss a lot. The character Mr. McGoohan played in "Secret Agent Man" was named Drake and after completing this show, he embarked on the very popular, if sometimes bizarre and controversial TV series "The Prisoner". The character he portrayed in "The Prisoner" was that of an agent whose identity is not revealed, kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who is responsible for the kidnapping. What he does know is that his kidnappers want to know the reasons for his resignation from British intelligence, and on this island the population has no names, but they are labeled with numbers and Patrick's character is given a number that is "6". It was argued that his prisoner was actually the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself denied it. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original Secret Agent Man spawned. It was written by Johnny Rivers, a famous pop musician of the 50s and 60s, and from what I've read, some of you think the song comes from this version of the show. That is very wrong. It was Johnny's and comes from the original TV series, so let me help you clarify the facts. Those who complained that the name of the show is stupid, in England the name was actually called "Danger Man", and in the US the name "Secret Agent Man" was baptized. For a supposedly stupid name, the show was good enough when it aired for the first time. Admittedly, this current show has little to do with the original, no main character named Drake in this one, and I think they did their best to make this show their version "Secret Agent Man ". However, the renewed version of the original title song is used to say that this show was actually intended as a re-version, even though the re-version of the original series was inferior.
