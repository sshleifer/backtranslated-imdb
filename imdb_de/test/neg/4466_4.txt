After seeing the previews some time ago, I was looking forward to seeing Steve Martin in a comedy I thought might be a Keeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was, the previews were the only funny parts of the movie. The rest of the movie was pretty much a junk, scenes that were made to die, and characters that we've seen a thousand times. <br /> <br /> This movie proved that you can spend enough money on the table to persuade everyone. Steve Martin is a favorite of mine, but this one was a big clunker. The only actor worth watching was Eugene Levy; He was the best of a powerful lame group.
