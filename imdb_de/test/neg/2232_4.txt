If I look at it as a stand-alone feature, I can not say it's a pity at all, but where I stand, the sequel and the original "Lady and the Tramp" do not match! These are two completely different films with different style, different language personalities, different narratives and the only thing they share with each other are the visuals (eg the Jim Dear house, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and none of them have has changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for years after the release of the original for a kind of continuity for memorable songs like "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not do you any good! Almost every song has some pop and these good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and their cats are good to see but somehow they seem to be replaced by new ones, not to mention Peg does not seem to their voices are pretty annoying. Even Lady and Tramp do not appear often enough and what about Scamp?! He is so spoiled! And treat his father Tramp with the utmost disrespect and then run away without remorse, even after hearing how much he misses home! And they called his shameless getaway an adventure! I'd say Scott Wolf really did release the abusive bad boy in Scamp, who wiped out the typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters just make you angry; Trusty sounds sick in bed after Goofy, Jock (Jeff-dumb-Bennett) - and his VOICE - sound neither Scottish nor worth listening to! Zap it as far as possible to free our poor ears from its voice, and as for the stupid, feather-plagued, EXASPERING JUNKYARD DOGS !!!!!! Someone put her down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> "Lady and the Tramp 2" It's not terrible if you do not have a tough day yet, but I expect much more charm from a sequel to a real classic - Scamp is chavvy, his girlfriend Angel and his weak action. Nevertheless, I think you should try it at least once, as there are, as I said, much worse movies.
