This is a movie that has aroused any interest or praise just because it is a lesbian piece. The performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the GLBT area of ​​interest. The totality of the observable value of the film is collected through the modest tension over whether and when the family members of the partners will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. The best element of the film is probably the beautiful landscape of New England, although the film plays mostly inside. It's hard to imagine that any viewer watching this movie, not seeking confirmation of their GLBT lifestyle, or wanting others to be acknowledged, even through a poorly recognized drama, will be able to appreciate Treading Water in any way. It's a terrible movie.
