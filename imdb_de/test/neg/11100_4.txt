That was actually a pretty boring movie. I think the problem with a French horror movie is that the French are easy to scare or something, because this movie was not only so scary. The special effects with the ghost of the mummy looked like they did not even belong to the movie, as if someone would use them in post-production to refresh them because the actors barely react. <br /> <br /> The plot somehow meanders, which is the opposite of real storytelling. I suspect that was based on a French television series in which they had to be combined into a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mummy is taken from the lair at the Louvre, which seems to have such a weak security that this girl and her friend can invade her several times. (So ​​people always steal the Mona Lisa!) The friend and police officer of the 1960s version of this film meet and try to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure if that's the case Mom should be a villain or not. He kills two guards in the course of the movie, but only wants to go to the afterlife.
