[WARNING: Include some spoilers, though it's a documentation.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentation because I like the work of directors D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, including MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM., All the fantastic documentaries I can highly recommend. When I saw this ultimately boring and uninteresting review of Depeche Mode's 1988 tour, I realized they had nothing to work with if they wanted to cut this movie together. The band members were certainly less than in front of the camera; Undoubtedly, the contest to add fans on a weeklong bus trip was added to liven things up a bit. Really, now I mean, come on. Who would have thought that a concert film of a synth pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? Granted, I like Depeche Mode's music and Martin Gore writes good melodies, but when you see them in concert, it never seemed to be interesting, and this film is a positive proof. If you're not a big fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary ... it's a complete waste of time.
