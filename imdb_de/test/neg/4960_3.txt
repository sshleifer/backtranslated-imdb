It's terrible garbage. I liked 'How do you want me?', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's Standup Act, but I put this with 'Hippies' and 'Planets Of The Apes' ('The Reimagination') under 'Great Pedigree' 'went badly wrong'. I suspect it appeals to the same people that 'Withnail and I like'. It is over-written, but too little, a luvvie-ish air permeates it and Bernard Black is simply a less stock Withnail. And I thought it was careless before * Dylan Moran became the writer. But the set-up has such a strange potential that in the first two episodes I did not even notice that it is not in the least quiet. <br /> <br /> The things they should say / do * should * be funny, but somehow they do not manage to sign up as more than a little amusing, or "I can see someone writing this down thought this would be funny. " I try to say that the situations / remarks are mildly humorous and yet too banal / gentle / self-conscious surreal to be created and portrayed in a sitcom. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. Avoid.
