I sincerely wonder why this movie was ever made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production in a Berlin version, in which all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with Turkish words in between, is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is essentially limited to "fuck you, bastard," and acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from that, ethnic tensions in Germany can be an interesting topic, but I know that in Germany there are no gangs shooting in the clear light of day in the middle of the street. And if that's not enough, there's also a serial killer who kills Turkish children and paints them white. To create suspense, we see the serial killer and hear him laugh at Schubert's lullaby, but we will not see his face. <br /> <br /> I do not even think that they actually shot in Germany. There are some street scenes that are obviously in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in these shots. It is probably Bulgaria with a few German characters here and there.
