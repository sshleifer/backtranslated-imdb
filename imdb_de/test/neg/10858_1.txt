Larry Bishop, the author / actor / director, focuses too much on camera, music and visuals. The film draws on meaningless wanderings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no other purpose than to bore and irritate the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride from beginning to end of the movie and get into a horrible smoke screen. To hell with the ride. The movie is a bomb. <br /> <br /> The winners are presented as weathered vigilantes seeking their own form of justice for what they consider to be lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the vengeful leader of the pack. Ghent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but secretive. Deuce, performed by David Carradine, should have passed the ride, and even the ticket buyers (if you decide to watch the movie, you'll apologize, but you'll find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lewd and venomous character who is full of contempt. <br /> <br /> What baffles me is how this film, with all its constant confusion and vulgarity, has made somebody invest in a movie ride that's absolutely nowhere to go. Ticket Buyers, take my advice: do not pay for the ride. Please do not make the same mistake as the investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes of the film are confusing and incomprehensible. The dialogue, which quickly turns into meaningless monologues, makes no sense. The entire movie is driven to hell to go nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is in the middle of chaos. He too should have made the trip. There are beheaded heads, slashed throats, and naked women wrestling. It's clear Bishop does not know where he's going with the movie. He is completely lost. But at the end of the ride you will not mind. Mama Mia! Stay at home. And do not take the ride with you. I rate this movie 1 in 10, but this movie is so awful that it deserves a zero.
