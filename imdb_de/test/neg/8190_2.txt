I have not seen many movies that are worse than this. The plot, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! The story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. Every time you think you've missed something, no, that's the way it should be. And why on earth is the character Jenny Garth is so in love with in this no-no-loser guy (who's actually playing with Russel Crow in the movie Cinderella Man)? Well, of course it's not a Spielberg ... I have to write ten lines to be posted. This movie is really not inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic movie to feel comfortable with a lousy story. So if you want, you have a ball.
