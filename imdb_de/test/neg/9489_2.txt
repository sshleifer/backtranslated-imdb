I saw this one evening with my parents-in-law when it appeared on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it. <br /> <br /> Look, I can enjoy a chick movie now and then, as long as it's good. However, this is a bit uncomfortable, unrealistic and easily predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's scary how quickly a woman can accept that her eyesight is taken from her. Well, they say, love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The neat and tidy happy little end almost made me gag. And how often did we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It did not even happen, not twice, but THREE times!
