This is the stupidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous. His wife and child think he is crazy. Then they do not do it. Then it turns out that it is him and I think they knew it all the time. There's a dog named Ned who's causing some trouble, and I think it's all his fault ... and Jim Carey too. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took that role ... this is a career hitter. I think the target audience is 11 and 12 years old. And that adds up to 23. Or maybe for 8- and 10-year-olds, which also gives 23. Or maybe for really stupid 23-year-olds. Or maybe really stupid 32-year-old, because the 23 is reversed. Or maybe 46-year-olds would enjoy it, because half of them are 23 years old. I think it would be more entertaining than this movie if you search the Internet for information about the number 23, unless you wanted to see a comedy.
