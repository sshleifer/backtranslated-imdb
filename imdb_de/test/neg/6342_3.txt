To be more specific, I do not think it's as bad as it could be. Although the actors (famous to half-known) did not do a very good job. Blame the directors? Could the script be difficult to say? If you're looking for a lot of cool guns and action, this is not the movie for you, but you're running around with many vintage Ww2 weapons. A little fun :) Well, I think I could say more, but it just does not feel like it's worth it. If you're desperate enough or a hackman freak, you will not see it any different! <br /> <br /> Live well and thrive
