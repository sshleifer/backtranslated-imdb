I expected this film to be shown before the election. CBS 'last shot when he dug up Bush. This movie was just awful, but I'm still looking at it. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think CBS has the same people who "provided" the memos to do the half-cut in half the sequence. What about the bad friend act? Can acting or dialogue be more like an Ed Wood movie? Whoever came up with this script, please do us a favor. If you want to see decent B grade disaster movies, read earthquakes, tides, etc. Avoid this mess of a movie. Note to CBS avoid this crap. Let's run CSI again instead. Better action and more credible.
