First of all, I just want to say that I'm a big Naruto fan. I love the anime and manga stories. The first movie just confirmed that Naruto is about great fun, great action, great story ... But then came the second movie. I was very hyped because the first movie was great. But it did not satisfy me a bit ... The story was lame, action was not great ... especially compared to the anime series ... the same goes for the quality of the animation. I thought it was very bad ... Could the story get any lamer ... ANY ??? Where is the Kyuubi of Naruto? Not once does he become a demon ... I mean ... COME !!! My advice is ... look at the show (up to Episode 140, then it's just fillers) and then read the manga, because that's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> Everything and everything I gave him just because it's Naruto ...
