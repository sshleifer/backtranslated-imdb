It is boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the bad and brutal murders? Where is the tension that should scare us? This is as if you would see Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> It's really lame. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the writing ... maybe the direction. Maybe it's about acting, maybe editing, maybe cinematography, maybe special effects, maybe make-up. <br /> <br /> Maybe all of this has done something that is barely able to keep your eyes on yourself /> <br /> I wanted to get scared ... not bored. <br /> <br /> That did not scare me ... it did not even interest me ... I had more fun watching microwave time instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not bother buying it ... and if you happen to see it on TV by accident, there is no need to put the kids to sleep.
