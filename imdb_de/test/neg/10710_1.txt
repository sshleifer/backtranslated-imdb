Warning: this could damage your movie. Watch if you agree. <br /> <br /> To think that as humans we can not learn from the past. The futuristic society described what Hitler believed in extinguishing a race of people (in this case men) for the benefit of society. It made me sick in my stomach. Also, the plausibility of a Y-bomb is crazy. Even in war, our self-preservation drive will prevent the extinction of humanity. We've made mistakes in the past, such as Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki '45, but that's why we avoided a major bug in '63 during the Cuban missile crisis
