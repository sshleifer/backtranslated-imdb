What a shame, our first movie is so bad .............................. hi sham, what's in this movie (it's terrible!) and the director :( there's no story in this movie I slept watching this movie It's a disappointment and the majority of the crew is not from Saudi Arabia It should be a comedy movie, but it lacks the essential elements in comedy. <br /> <br /> I know there are first experiences with cinema in Saudi Arabia, but I expect better from Kaif Al Hal Film is the presence of some talented actors who have not helped much text to explode their talents ... Finally, I want to know what you're saying about this movie guys ... is it bad or what?
