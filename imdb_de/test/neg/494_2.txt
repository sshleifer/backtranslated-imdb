I do not know any idiotic rock'n'roll clich√© that is not used in this movie. Ouffcourz, rock makes life just sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels that ride with you. Say it stupid boy. The filmmakers seemed to have read too many stories about Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue. I have seen the everyday life of an ordinary rock band up close and there is nothing to do with reality in this film. If you are successful enough, your life is touring touring. This means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you have to be fresh, sober and clean in the evening. After the live you have some time to relieve your stage stimulation. Then you have some time to have fun. But it is not a luxury or a dream. Artistically, this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogues. The end of the movie was funny - the main character left the heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yes, what a moral. Real 90s.
