I am surprised that the comparison between Mind of Mencia and the television program The Awful Truth, which ran a few years ago, has not yet been made. Accompanied by controversial director Michael Moore, the show started in exactly the same mansion as this show. Moore interacted with the audience and introduced segments, namely short documentary films and skits that had tried to ponder current issues. The difference? Mencia rarely performs on the surfaces and reactionaries. What he says and does is often shabby and rude and offends the ability of his listeners to make decisions for themselves. There is a difference between being "nervous" with whom I have no problem, but Mencia is trying hard to achieve that, and in the end seems arrogant and with little support. He occasionally scores points, but often, to reach them, one has to sit down by a pretty, absent-minded, nasty shocking humor.
