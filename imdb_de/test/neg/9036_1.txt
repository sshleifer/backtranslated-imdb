I love the beach boys and their music. So, being a filmmaker, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys movie sounds great. Well, WRONG! I actually turned off HDNET, the channel where the movie was played because it was so bad. Someone mentioned above about editing ... well, he should have looked at the monitors at least during the shoot. I do not know if someone else caught the mustache when he was kissed by one of the guys after he kissed his wife. Have you ever heard of resuming a scene? Acting was terrible. The direction was terrible. Make-up was terrible !!! Maybe the worst make-up job I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's "fat" cheek looked like pl-ado. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first time I commented on IMDb for the first time, and I know it really does not make a difference. !
