Driven around on Bootlegs, sometimes thought an urban comic legend, the first FF movie is as bad as anyone fears. I think Marvel Comics now pretends it does not exist, which was released in cinemas earlier this year with the 2005 release. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of nasty Marvel super-low-budget adjustments (Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies). "Low budget" is a too simple description for this FF image. Due to virtually no money, the representation of the powers of the super four was limited to very fast shots (Mr. Fantastic), quasi-animations (Torch) and fades (Invisible Girl - easiest). The Thing thing was not bad and probably half the budget; The facial part was especially convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; The other 3 are okay, though Jayny sometimes behaves like a spaz to show his "fiery" mood. The dialogue is comic-style, and it's the supporting cast that ends up failing when it tries to get it to work. Dr.Doom is way beyond melodramatic and unintentionally funny, and his two main hand men are a case study of how not to act or write dialogues. <br /> <br /> The story? Not so good. It was quite faithful to the origin story of the FF (more than the later major budget version), and although the non-budget was again constrained, e.g. As the actual crash landing, it held the essential components of the How you discovered their powers in a remote area - it is the best part of the picture, you have to wait for half an hour. I also found music strange in places; When the 4 are immersed in these cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is hopeless. Even without a budget, the story could have survived without the jewel-like character (much like the Mole Man villain of the books); it spends too much time with him and his underground gang as well as the blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climate fight with Doom & his men starts off well, but becomes a terrible mess while the torch runs a laser beam (cool animation, which, however, belongs to a cartoon). Fans can laugh at the bad FF FX and the funny story if they are not depressed and outraged first.
