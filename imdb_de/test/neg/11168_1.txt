Stay away from this movie. The fact that you read reviews tells me that you may already have been stained by the awfulness it carries. This is a really horrible movie ... so let's get to the problems. Writing and directing: It would not surprise me if they were treated by a group of overactive schoolchildren who have watched "screaming" and "I know what you did last summer" too many times. HUGE GAPING-Plotl√∂cher abound; While I can not congratulate them on this movie, it's nice to know they've finally made pots. Actors (or their lack): Only the best for this movie ... the best extras ever shown on a screen, now with their debut in the voice role! As a disclaimer, I must state that I am able to see and enjoy everything. I can see a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and grin at Bubble Boy (yes folks, it's true); So if I say something to avoid, KNOW, I'm not kidding.
