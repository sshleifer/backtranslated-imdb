After the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to be next to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children turned out to be a warm welcome and now has a dedicated fanbase. And the reason for the movie's success is understandable, with lush graphics, fast-moving combat sequences, and some cool characters. However, if you did not play FF7, you probably will not enjoy this movie because the storyline is taken out of the game without prior explanation, and you probably will lose yourself even after playing the game. Second, there is no character development. Without the knowledge of the game, your opinions about the characters are limited to "cool" and "not cool". Of course, the film is almost guaranteed to be entertaining for FF7 fans, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool to see all the characters you love from the game and presented in a stunning computer animation. One last complaint, the movie, in my opinion, tried to stuff too little in less than two hours, and therefore the last half hour seems to be terribly rushed. If you've played and enjoyed FF7, it's a rewarding watch, though nothing special. If you have not played FF7, it's best to play it before watching this movie.
