This must be the worst show I have ever seen. I've always liked Chuck Norris in movies, but why do we have to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick as threatening as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought that the show was limited because how many times can you kick a man in the face and make him interesting. I know an African American who looks like this trivet guy and gets kicked once a week. He is all attitude. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is the man who deserves all kudos, I think this show started off great, but lost its power as time went by. <br /> <br /> You should have canceled Chuck's kick
