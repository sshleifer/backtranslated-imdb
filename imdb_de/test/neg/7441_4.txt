Then the announced update is shot through the head. Given the sad state of this movie rather fitting, a sequel to a movie that obviously did not need one. <br /> <br /> What's really irritating about Robocop 2 is that the creators obviously did not understand why the original was the original first and foremost so good. Robocop (7) was a witty, pulsating satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is thin, especially with regard to the boring, shooting finale, which arouses little interest and neither possesses the energy nor the spirit of the original. The counterfeit ads, which are now somewhat tasteless ("Warning: continued use causes skin cancer"), seem to be considered retroactive. And to call a new designer drug "Nuke" is by far not as subtle or funny as the family board game of the original: "Nuke ?? em!". <br /> <br /> The stop-motion animation ?? the weakest element of the original? is used extensively, while this humorless sequel does not include a credits sequence, making it look even cheaper and hurried. Ah, humorless? You could say. But what about the funny mayor or the way Robo is reprogrammed to distribute platitudes? Yes, these are lighting attempts, as is Robo, who puts himself on the point of the film with a screwdriver ("we're just human"), but he's unlikely to laugh. Like the rest of the movie, they are solid and idiotic conversational attempts. The third and final film of the series (imaginatively labeled Robocop 3; 5) let Peter Weller go to replace him Robert John Burke, who performs well in a modest role. With weakened language and violence, this was an obvious appeal to the kiddie market, a blockaded robo action figure. Since his social conscience is too over-the-top and Robocop's newly found armrests and jetpack are too stupid, the final film was never a masterpiece. The flowing direction of Fred Dekker and a flowing tempo make this observation a pleasing sight. <br /> <br /> Robocop is the movie. Robocop 3 is the sequel that you can see when there is nothing better. What leaves the second movie in the middle is an unsurpassed smell of a picture. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say except for the pound signs that pop up. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, as cartoonist Frank Miller and his partner Walon Green are not the writers who were Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. A tragic waste of a good, albeit limited, concept. 10.4.
