Great themes, directors, and cast somehow make for a truly abysmal film told in this flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular at the time this movie was made. (And hello, this is NOT a film noir!) The lackluster, too complicated, overpopulated story has no bow, no focus point, little excitement and staggers from one scene to the next without apparent purpose except as a valentine for the supposed and most dubious one Cooperation between the US and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me hate this film is when Montalban and Mitchell make a brave escape from their kidnappers, presumably to keep Montalbane's injured partner from being a jerk with one In the machinery, Montalban says something like "fast - we have to try to save him "but instead they lie down on their bellies and watch for about 5 (!) minutes of screen time as the machine rolls over on Murphy and FINALLY (or suppose - the machine simply stops, another racket recognizes the presence of the two "Savior" and shoot at them as they run away again.) Scene over. The whole thing is so horribly filmed and absolutely anti-climatic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (allegedly Montalban, although he is not in the movies for more than half of the movie) who does not even try. Gosh, Ricardo, do SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> I know it's Anthony Mann, but hell, not all his movies are classics. How bad does an old movie have to be here to get under 6?
