Important spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick, disturbing movie ... just like the sick, twisted director Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I do not even know why I rated this movie as 2. It is not the fault of the actors. The performers have certainly portrayed their roles well. It's the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written. This was the standard for a really sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I'll never watch another movie being written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick, twisted, stinking, stinking divergence. She looks, speaks and sounds like a biker bitch whose brain was roasted by drugs that have worked hard for 20 years. You can clearly see what kind of person she is when you look at her in the DVD special features of "Watching: Observing Observers." You can see and hear them yourself. It was just as bad as I had imagined when writing this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not shocked by bad language, though this director certainly speaks like a sailor. This goes far beyond a simple bad language. worse than any other movie. The level of implied sado violence and perversion that she incorporates into every character she writes is of the genre that is even illegal under p0rn standards. This perverted, disturbing thinking is evident in her own personality and the things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. This is a snuff movie. <br /> <br /> Be sure to hear their narrative about the deleted scenes and choose an alternative ending. This director / writer is really sick. I can not believe anyone would blame her for a movie, much less pay for it. You can be sure that I will never see another movie to which she is connected. In the thousands of films I've seen and collected, there are only a few directors and writers who have earned this kind of boycott. It's offensive to anyone I've ever seen when making a movie. There were some bad directors and writers, but no one could compare with their sick, twisted mind. When I saw this movie, it was just a murder that was raging after another. After surviving the hotel murder ... the sick policemen shot at drivers and brutally kicked them ... the holiday home with the bad parents (who had no business in the presence of children) ... followed by the drug Addicts ... the film then went over to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers. <br /> <br /> When I saw the serial killers, I began to wonder what a really sick mind this movie wrote. These were my real thoughts when I saw this movie. I really wanted to find out which writer had such a sick mind ... because this writer needs to be seriously used for long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out that it was the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized that my assessment of the writer was right on my nose. On the DVD, she was actually the sick, twisted person I imagined writing such a disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> While the little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins really stole the show ... I can 'I do not think her real-life parents have tolerated this sick, ill-tempered director to get into to be near her daughter. This film is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and needs the director some serious treatment in a psychiatric facility. <br /> <br /> As for the end of the film ... the alternative end should have been the result of this terrible suffering. There was no sense and no use to the movie or the story or the flow of the movie through the death of the other character. I'm stunned that every studio has actually distributed the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the film reached the audience was the clever wordsmith and creative portrayal on the trailer. This trailer is not representative of the movie you are going to see. <br /> <br /> Apart from the kid ... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverted, violent sexfreak, and her characters are mirrored in the minds of the writer-director who created them. But if you look closely, even the parents of the holiday family; the sick policemen taking pot shots; the serial killers pose in alternating roles; Policemen in the station; and even the station dispatcher ... each of these character roles contained a sexually twisted, violent pervert. I'm not sure if any of the actors saw them talking about filming and the Canadian city's filming in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> This director has such a personal essence of spiritual deviation that, no matter what she writes, each character role contains the same copy-mark. The only character who did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Look closely and you will see that in every character. Then listen to the director's lecture and read what I tell you about her mental state and psychological issues. She would not be tolerated in too many decent homes unless she was from a Hollywood movie family. Thankfully, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much filmography ... less than a handful of things. As she copies these disquieting traits in all her characters' roles, we're not likely to see many of her films written or staged unless her dad, director David Lynch, helps her. I would recommend staying away from any movie she's dealing with ... and I'm not sure if her dad's movies are better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
