Geesh, I never thought I would write the above four words. But actually she is the highlight of this little movie. <br /> <br /> When the movie was packaged when I rented it, it's supposed to be a comedy about a kidnapped girl but no medication keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. All we have seen of Spelling was for years as Donna Martin in the year 90210 and an endless parade of boring, lifeless television films. It sounded like a chance for her to expand a bit, and considering that she could not have a financial reason to make this film with her TV hit and her rich daddy, I thought she'd taken on the role, Budget Jewel. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, the part of Spelling is small and that little bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. When she's not on the screen, the film creeps so much that I could have sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were on the band. That would have been so much better if Spelling's action had dominated and she and her, Phil, the least irritating kidnapper, had been turned into a romantic comedy.
