Although I'm usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although the film has some delightful moments, it falls flat overall. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where is the movie set? Italy or an Italian troupe in New York? Why should one make a historical film if he does not convey an attitude? If you want to see a well-made, inspirational historical film about theater, visit Tim Robbins THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. This film has many pluses, including a good performance by John Turturro.
