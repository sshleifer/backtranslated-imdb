When I saw this movie, I think I was a freshman in high school, and I still feel like charging Master P for the full hour and 20 minutes for me to take my life, that I'll never come back /> The guy who has already posted is perfectly right. Master P is a wannabe gangster. Like all the other rappers in the country, he has made millions sell rap CDs to young, impressive white children in this country. It is well known that the mob was not black and blacks were not allowed to belong to it. Unfair as it could be, rappers can not handle it. This movie draws Master P as a gangster named Nino? The script is terrible if the acting agrees. Absolutely unbelievable During the search I got a link or something that said that he wanted to shoot another movie called "The Black Sopranos". <br /> <br /> Please spare us this and stay with Nickalodeon. You are not a white gangster, you are not even a good actor, Master P, please stay with your music to hear who is listening these days ...
