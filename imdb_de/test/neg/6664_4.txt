It's not really as good as the other Dragonballs. The rogues are actually rip off of other Z-rogues like Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. With Baby as Friezas clone, Super 17 as Cell clone and the Shadow Dragons as Buus clone (s). The story is also very bad, because it is about the shrinking of Goku. SHRINKAGE!! He wants to like SHRINKING, to like the size of an eight-year-old, just to get it started. Let's not forget how weak the characters become. Gohan can not become more mystical and is even weaker than Pan. (It's sad, I know). Speaking of Pan, she was so cute at the end of Z, now she has lost all that cuteness and has become an irritating, crying little girl whose only purpose in this series is to get in the way. Goten does not even have a purpose in the series and trunks ... Well, I do not know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, avoid this series. It does not even feel like Dragonball. Although I will be fair, the end was really good and is actually quite sad (at least for me) and the title songs both at the end and at the beginning are better (Japanese, not American). Could have been better if Toriyama San had worked on it.
