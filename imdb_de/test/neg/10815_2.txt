I can not help but forget this incredible scene in Alien when the alien jumped out of one of the men's breasts. Or even in Predator, when the invisible monster sneaks the confused soldiers and cuts them to pieces. These two films brought fascinating ideas to the usual creatures. Back in time for cheesy B-movies, watch big men go around in fake suits, killing people in small towns. Now realize that the two films have revolutionized this genre above. The cave does not improve it. It's not trying anything new and the worst part of it all is that The Cave does not even have a good blood. Shame on them, shame on them all. <br /> <br /> Walking around in sexy spandex are the one-dimensional characters of The Cave. All this does not seem to matter if they witness the death of their colleagues. They just keep walking without knowing the evil creature lurking in the dark. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have the two brothers, the black and the sexy scientist. The rest (with the rest I mean all who face cruel defeats) is even less exciting than the others. We have the Korean assistant, the risky outdoor chick, a Russian scientist, and two divers, both of whom have no sense of emotion and are stupid enough to walk alone. This film is extremely clich√©d, as all but the black, one of the brothers and the scientist come to an end. It also seems that only Americans can survive the terror as the Russian and the Korean die. Do not be offended if I reveal details. There is no real surprise anyway. <br /> <br /> To be straight, find this cave. They go to the cave. They get stuck in the cave. They begin to die in the cave. One of them is infected in the cave. More die in the cave. They come out of the cave; Just to find out that one of them has a parasite that turns her into a ghastly monster, which she really does not seem to care about. That's the simplicity of the lackluster plot. It does not even try to be original. It even has the part where they decide that their leader is not capable and divides. We have seen this way many times. <br /> <br /> I know, in a movie like this, people do not care about the performance, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is just so bleak. Cole Hauser was especially straightforward and does not bring me to Eddie Cibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut is undoubtedly the best in the movie. His performance is actually decent. He portrays the man who calms everyone down. All other actors are average at best. In a show like this, that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Now for the reason why we go to this film genre; of course the action. To my regret, the action was boring. The death scenes are all boring, the whole movie was fucking good. There is hardly any blood. Either they disappear and are later found or they are attacked and die without bruising. The death of the Korean was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing. The bad things overshadow most things that are good. A good example is to say that the special effects were done well, which they were. The only thing wrong is that everything gets dark, because everything takes place in a cave. It was extremely difficult for me to distinguish between the cave walls and the monsters. So it was pretty hard to see the creatures at all. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about the monsters. They all resembled each other and were not scary at all. <br /> <br /> The Cave is the directorial debut of Bruce Hunt. I do not see what he wanted to achieve with this film. He obviously made a big mistake. Almost everything about this movie stank like a stink bomb. A stink bomb is probably even more enjoyable than seeing this mess again. Only the most forgiving moviegoer will forgive this. I gave up all hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "What the hell was that" for the third time.
