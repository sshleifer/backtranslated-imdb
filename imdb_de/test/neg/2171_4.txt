Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment to me. I had heard how great it was and how important it was. It just did not hit me. It had a sombre plot and some moronic and sadistic Indian characters that are disagreeable by today's standards. While most of D.W. Griffith's films have depth and intelligence, this feels more like a formulaic program image. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in roles before the birth of a nation, plus some of the productions The fight scenes were pretty good. According to future Griffith cameraman Karl Brown, the audience stood in his seats and cheered as soon as the cavalry rode out at the end. I did not feel anything. And I think I saw Griffith's early work with Biograph. This movie is just not what it used to be. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is that despite all its shortcomings, many Griffith's touches are part of it. He treats his protagonists pretty well and the scene in which the Indians surround the cabin that commemorates the pinnacle of Birth of a Nation, a far superior movie that would radiate shock waves in America just over a year later.
