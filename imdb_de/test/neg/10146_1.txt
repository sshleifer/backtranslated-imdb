In my opinion, the whole video part of this movie was absolute garbage !!!! The used soundtrack, however, contained the music of a big heavy metal rock band. I realized that this is a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written !! and I'm curious to see what the rest of you movie friends out there think, if I can remember, I'd appreciate the feedback, collecting old movie and obscure movie soundtracks. It's a very time-consuming hobby, but it's very rewarding. I have seen that the music of this band is sold in Germany for about fifty dollars per album on the net. Not bad, Hugh?
