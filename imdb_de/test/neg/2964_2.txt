My wife and I remembered that this movie was a lot better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we saw about 22 years ago. We both agreed that we probably remembered the television series that was forced to actually complete the plotlines in their one-hour segments. This film leaves many loose threads, as others have already mentioned ... basically, the plot of each main character is unresolved.
