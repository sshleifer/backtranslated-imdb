I saw this movie last night, a satire of reality-style programs that seem to be making the rounds right now. What can I say. I absolutely hated it. About as interesting as the drying of paint and maybe one or two just a few amusing moments. <br /> <br /> Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I'm definitely not a fan of the Survivor and Big Brother shows. This had been a video / DVD, or if I had watched in the cinema alone, I would have Definitely not more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
