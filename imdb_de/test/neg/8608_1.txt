So why on earth would I see 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. I saw and enjoyed Vegas live. I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic that manages to preserve extreme jealousy. I only know Crook from the biggest comedy of the last 10 years together with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. As Gareth, he was just funny, and I was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So, I and the friend went to the multiplex last night and the movie was very funny just because of the mediocre nonsense dialogue and the joke that Ferris and Dave had was filled with enthusiasm and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They're for better things (they've already done better) and I even think Vegas would make a decent direct actor. The mundane scenes in which he says he misses his wife were almost almost touching, even though the ** SPOILER ** had a scene at the end, where he was brought back by his wife, that had to be extended, it was just not to believe. Throughout the film, Vegas seems to miss his wife only two or three times. <br /> <br /> The film was grotesquely funny and plain old, well, grotesquely, when sex was mentioned. I add, not when it was shown on the screen. Tolly's explanatory explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even a little weird and I just felt a bit sick. Completely unnecessary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy, who rubbed his nose before showing a close-up of the bogeys on his finger. Only if he pulled his nose, he would have made a smile, he was a pathetic character and would have made him look as deep as possible, but showing the snot nearby was just not necessary and had rank. <br /> <br /> A scene I had to do with sex was Vegas three-way. His Blok conversation with the second guy only showed the fact that the threesomes are not endless ecstasy. Not that I would know. <br /> <br /> That's all I can really say. I'll end this, and that's actually my main critique of the movie. This should revive the British film industry. It's not a "trainspotting" that's for sure ... it's not even a "love" (you'd have to have a heart of stone to keep it) and Â£ 3 million could really be turned into a better project plugged. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a wonderful, little known British comedy and was made for far less than 3 million. I just hope the BFC will learn from 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and will not be so unfounded in the future. Although the terrible reviews that this film receives only improve the revenue of the box office. :-)
