Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father may be in trouble. Sheba, a private detective and a former police officer, helps her father. But someone stops at nothing to bring their father out of business. An attempt to show that her muscles are going awry, and Sheba's father is shot down in cold blood. These guys have messed around with the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, then Pam Grier Lite is the best I can imagine, with really bad acting. For a Pam Grier movie Sheba Baby is incredibly tame. It's not nearly as violent as some of her earlier films. Gone are the exaggerated pictures of Pam putting a small revolver or razorblades in their afro. Pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew can not hold a candle to some of the real villains Pam faced in their previous films. It's strictly on the numbers and feels almost like being on TV. As for bad acting, the villains Pam faces are as unnatural as I saw them. Therefore, characters like Pilot do not seem as threatening as they should or need to make the movie work. <br /> <br /> That does not mean there are no moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I have I have not enjoyed (Pam in a wetsuit and Pam swinging a spear gun). It's just that the film fails in comparison with Pam's other films like Coffy, Foxy Brown and even Friday Foster's final observation - maybe after September 11, 2001, I'm just more sensitive to those things, but I do not remember a time Not even in the safety flap of the '70s, when you could take a suitcase full of rifles in an airplane. When Sheba flies to help her father, she has an arsenal in her luggage!
