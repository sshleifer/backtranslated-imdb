It just did not look like GI Joe to me. When I saw it as a kid, I just did not care. In fact, the part I liked the most was the opening credits. They change so many facts and turn the story around. Cobra Commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptiles in the Antarctic or somewhere where it's frozen over. Although I always thought he was a normal guy, considering that every time you saw his eyes in the series, it was surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue that had his face here. It's just too much crap in this to try to make this spectacular movie, but for me it just ruins what I've seen the series for.
