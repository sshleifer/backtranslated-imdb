Maybe I'm alone here, but that's a crap show. I'm sorry, but I got lured when I heard about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I did not know about the show until months later and honestly did not gain in appeal), but I gave the show a fair shot. Spike tries to make himself what he is not, that is, he tries to be human. Fox did not even bother to hide the threads when they took him out of the box he had come to. His sketches try too hard, he himself is not funny and the writers struggle to write material for a non-talented host. There is too much good television to waste your time on this show, and Fox ..... Fox we had some good times, but you have to pull yourself together and try something original instead, just another "me -to-be-to-be-network.
