I did not make any big assumptions about the fact that this was certainly a very, very free adaptation from the work of Eça de Queiroz, and I have to say that this free adaptation shapes the book as many possible good ideas and characters. The problem is the way that without any care, no taste, just a rumble of bad taste clichés is made everywhere. The script is so fake and the characters so unreal that little actors like Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto, and others look small than they have lost themselves in a web of anything but cinema or storytelling. To my surprise, the newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves remain brave at their performances, but you can lose them like a confused boat with no direction. And when it comes to the direction, this film seems to be missing something, where is the director? Everything tastes bad; The frames are whatsoever, and whenever the handheld camera is used for no legitimate reason, there is no lighting design that should form environments (and no excuses that everything is a dark, real story). The problem in this "try to be" movie is that there is no or very, very bad taste. It is sad to see how Jorge and Soraia melt into such spurious and extravagant sex scenes painted here and there as closing the narrative gaps or serving as transitional motifs. Maybe in 2002 Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the Carlos Carrera adaptation of the same book by Eça and learn how to build a true film.
