4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie was not funny at all, nor was it worthwhile to put emotions into the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the funniest ... The rest of the cast do their job, but the story never gets really deep and there are many holes in the storyline that are never filled. It was not fun, though it was funny sometimes. <br /> <br />
