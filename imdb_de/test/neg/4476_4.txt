Talk about your wild life. Hardly a B-movie, but what's the hay ... crazy sci-fi and lesbian sex. From the perspective of writer and director Cody Jarrett a cheesy piece of fun. A chemical company disposes of waste that causes mutants in a fish farm. The hot Kristi Russell plays as Dr. Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent to investigate this environmental problem. She's having a lesbian relationship with bartender Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and her love scenes are about as good as this movie. A man-sized frog causes chaos; caused a car accident, raped the chemical company's daughter, raped a girl under the stands at a football match, attacked a runner in a football game with a stiff arm, raped a nun ... everything was shot twice before being shot twice in the chest. The special effects ... well, not specifically; a guy in a frog costume with no genitals to prove himself. Hard tadpoles, do you still want to see it? Carry on, bribe every witness of secrecy.
