Impressive! Here's another direct video scarecrow movie that makes cinematic masochists happy. If the cheap looking leader does not say you have a long drive, then the devilishly tragic "writing" will be sure. <br /> <br /> A diabetic is tied up with a legendary scarecrow as part of his introduction to the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes crazy and starts people. Do I have to say more? This movie is made up of cheap effects that seem to have been edited with iMovie (note the scary color reversal) and actors who were apparently not good enough to appear on a Cinemax special. That's actually not fair, as the actors did not have much space to go around the abysmal screenplay. Parts of this movie seem like a parody, especially when a character uses his guitar and starts to play the worst song ever thought of by humans, with the worst lip-synching ever done. The "Gore" here is also a big disappointment. In most B movies like this, there's a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to make up for what's missing from the story and the drama. Here's the stuff so cheap that it's not even fun. This movie makes "Jack Frost 2" look like a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is the "worst you've ever seen," then you probably have not really studied the world of straightforward B horror. Regardless, this movie will make you very nervous no matter what background you have.
