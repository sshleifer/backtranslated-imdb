I really liked this movie. Number 5, the movie's star robot, is struck by lightning and something happens to its circuitry. He behaves and thinks more like a human. The robot repeats commercials that he learns after watching TV. He then applies these statements to his circumstances. Number 5 is fast witty and funny. The character mimics the voices of stars, tries to dance in Staying Alive like John Travolta and many other things. He has a proverb for most of his circumstances that he has learned by heart. The actions of the robots are really good. Number 5 wants to drive Stefany with all the qualities of a man, cook and delight. The way the robots move and line up is really hysterical. I am disappointed that the authors could not keep this clean for all viewers. This movie has a surprising ending that you would not expect. I hate movies that swear even though I like them, but I rate them worse. This movie had words of promise. Jesus Christ was used as a swearing word that offends me, it is used at least three times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been a wonderful movie with all this offensive language. There is no sex in this film, some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines.
