A day in the life of a weak taxi driver sometime around Christmas: The taxi driver picks up a fare ... they have a "really revealing" interlude ... he pays the fare ... he picks up another fare ... another Interlude ... and so it goes on for 90 minutes ... nothing convinced (or interesting) for a minute ... SKIP IT!
