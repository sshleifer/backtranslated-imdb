This is a movie about people who receive a love letter. Nobody knows who was sent, and nobody knows who it is for. A good cast, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a completely nonsensical conspiracy. For example, the Capshaw character, one of New England's leading citizens of a small town, picks up an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the city's fireman, who's crazy about her. If that is not the epitome of stupidity, I do not know what is. Just an example of how stupid this movie is. It's a pleasure to see Kate Capshaw jogging, but you can tell right away that she has never run a day in her life. Another, obviously stupid part of a stupid movie.
