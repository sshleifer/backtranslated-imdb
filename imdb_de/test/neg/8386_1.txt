I saw this movie last night, though I thought I was renting a blockbusters horror movie and getting it out. The opening scenes were so lengthy that the conversations between the characters seemed to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The story seemed so bad to me, it infected him HIV and then he goes with someone, but she is killed by the man she has infected (I think she's done it a long time .) Time for different people) When he then dumped the body, it was just the man she would meet. He was in the woods and saw him take the body off. Then he chased them (did he ever bury the body ??) and they got into a car and somehow found them from a different direction from where they came and killed the guy. <br /> <br /> I think the severed head was the only good thing in the movie because it was pretty realistic. and then, when the woman ran, she happened to fall in front of him so he could stab her with a spade !! And then done! <br /> <br /> What a relief, It was the most futile movie I've ever seen ... please, divert it well, it's just done so badly, I only counted 5 different people, and the scene where he kills her is so unrealistic and they just swear in it and that's it !! That's it from me ... <br /> <br /> STEER WELL CLEAR !!
