STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back and giant Omni Consumer Corporation continues to swallow everything on its own Way is as the construction of the new Delta City continues, and a new threat that must be addressed in the form of Cain, a cruel drug master with delusions of Christ, who spreads a deadly new addictive substance on the streets called Nuke , As he continues to struggle with the memories of his past life following him, the galvanized hero sets out to pull down this villain - only to be hacked to pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a reckless OCP businesswoman is proposing plans for her new Android - a staggering, growling beast of a machine that needs an equally disagreeable, power-hungry test - which fits Cain perfectly. After a brief disruption in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and fix the score with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a movie that surprises you every time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those movies that just can not be done anymore. That said, it's not surprising that a sequel was made - it's even less surprising that this sequel really fades compared to the original. The director of Empire Strikes Back, Irvin Kirschner, has designed an awkward, slightly incoherent and overlong film that can not capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard he tries. And it does in any case, the funny ads from the first movie, which have no end, stop, the corporate satire wants to be a little sharper and the action rushes as fast and furious as before, but with blood and blood even worse as the first movie. The first film made a name for evil, bloody acts of violence (including the genitals of a man were blown away and a man torn to pieces), but although this was more memorable, the violence shown here is sadistic and unfounded with nature a very unpleasant and mean tone. <br /> <br /> But overall, the film leaves a general sense of apathy - why look at that if you could see the original instead? **
