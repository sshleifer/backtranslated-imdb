I'm a big fan of science fiction movies. When I saw this movie in EPG, I thought I would have a nice evening. What a disappointment ! I could not imagine such a bad presentation of "special" effects in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you make special effects of a desert helicopter if you can film a real helicopter at a much lower price (I think)? And those killer "Muppets" ... well, I could do better than a few hours in the garage. You can expect your film to have a low budget, but I do not think it's reasonable to have a low film for every budget. As for the movie's "star" (I use a lot of quotes today ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the guy is not even a distant actor. Maybe he should have stayed with the martial arts films. All in all a horrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Maybe not. A sincere 1 in 10.
