Bad script? Check. Terrible effects? Check. Terrible actors? Check. Lame direction? Check. <br /> <br /> After watching the DVD box in the blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, I put my $ 4.28 on the line and rented this "movie." My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored. On a late Tuesday night, I decided that this would be the perfect time for me to see a horror movie. What I got instead was the worst movie ever made. By that time, I had always declared "Slumber Party Massacre 3" the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you're the guy who wants to see a movie because you've heard how bad it is, that's the case with you. If you do not want to lose the irreplaceable minutes of 4.00 and 80 minutes of your life, stay away from this trash. <br /> <br /> One more note: I have noticed that some "actors" appear here and post comments on the whiteboard. How can you brag about being in this movie? They were all terrible. I mean really bad If there was an American idol for actors, you would all be laughed at in the first episodes. <br /> <br /> peace. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
