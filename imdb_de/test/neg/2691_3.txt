I must admit that although I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I've never really been familiar with this piece. And what I really can not say is if this is a bad adaptation or if the piece is just a bad choice for the movie. There are a few nice things, but the execution is very unwieldy and the plot is obvious. The theme of the piece refers to the type of debt. The financial idea of ​​guilt and justice is used as a metaphor for emotional issues. This becomes clear when the question of the rings becomes more important than the deal with Shylock, which unfortunately goes into the garden variety Antisemitisim, despite the bard's best attempts to save him with a few beautiful monologues From Jeremy Irons worthy turn I did not think that there was a decent performance in the group. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight whining at the end of each statement, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to variations of the standard scene "Pacino gets angry", which his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is absolutely embarrassed to the point that I thought they'd tested her right out of the picture. If she's incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we should not laugh about. With Joseph Fiennes trying to look straightforward and complicated, it's hard not to make damning comparisons to Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in Shakespeare in Love. The big problem, however, that everything in this movie is overruled is a lack of emotional focus. It's really hard to say if this movie is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy or a stupidly funny drama. A good summer stock performance would certainly bring more laughs to the material than this gloomy production. The actors seem embarrassed to try humor and do not know where to put dramatic and comedic accents. All this is essentially the fault of director Michael Radford, who seems to give the impression that the material is much heavier than it seems to me.
