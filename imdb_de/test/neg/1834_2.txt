There are endless horrible horror films. It seems like people never tire of frightening and inspiring. Unfortunately, these attempts succeed only very rarely. This unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. The story is very predictable, most actors are very unimaginative or just failed special effects of very low quality. It was very exhausting not to turn off the DVD and go to bed. Why, on earth, would someone with this limited number of foreign films released in the US want to import this drum? As a coronation, there seems to be an "anatomy 2" for those who have nothing better to do. I'd rather see the paint dry.
