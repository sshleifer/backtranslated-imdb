This film is a very bad example of unimaginative storytelling trying to hide behind an "art film" facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) because of the psychological depth of the characters and internal conflicts is missing. Everything in this film is presumptuous, from the beginning to Bela Tarr, to photography, acting, music, history and editing. If you are suddenly forced to watch close-ups of "charismatic" -looking Hungarian compatriots in their boats for no reason, the soundtrack tries to convince you that this should be a dramatic moment, even though they are only on the way to the burial of the local alcoholic That's one thing. Setting totally unmotivated scenes of rape as a shocker is another thing for which I have absolutely no understanding. This film makes a great effort to immerse itself in a particular genre of artistic (Eastern European dramaturgy) films, but lacks the subtlety, observational skills, and "soul" that other directors have.
