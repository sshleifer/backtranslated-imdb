The only Bela Lugosi sitting in a big armchair with a huge book in her lap looks at the camera. In a terrible vocal language that sounds like he's mocking a Shakespearean reading, it's slowly sounding, "Man's The constant gripping of unknown things that pulls out of the vastness of time brings many surprising things to light (giggle); are not new, the signs of the times "(keyword light, which is accompanied by thunder, which then continues to rumble for an amazing 86 seconds). <br /> <br /> And that's the beginning of what's probably the worst movie ever made. This "movie" is almost impossible to describe. Narrated in semi-dokudrama style with an invisible narrator explaining the plot ... as it is ... The story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) disguising himself; hence the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead, it mainly consists of a random selection of vignettes that may or may not affect Glen or the cross-dressing motif. A long sequence consists of an unknown woman wriggling on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today call S & M. Then Bela appears at irregular moments for no apparent reason, babbling more insane dialogues like, "If he's wrong, because he's right, and if he's right, because he's wrong, pull the string, dance to it." Huh? <br /> <br /> Approximately 20 percent of the film's visuals are made from footage, accompanied by a VO that relates to the story, not the visual. Therefore, we see stock footage of: busy city streets, highway traffic, a thundering buffalo herd and a playground full of kids. But it is getting worse. In a cross-dressing film, we have 58 consecutive seconds of footage from a foundry furnace producing hot steel and 84 consecutive seconds from World War II combat scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest items are botched. In one scene we see a headline saying "Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl". Under the heading, which was clearly glued or glued, the article is about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman talks about "planes, why it's against the will of the Creator," in a voice that sounds like it's just inhaling helium. Except for the performance of Lyle Talbot, the spectacle is uniformly awful. The production design looks cheap and is monotonous. (But you have to love this sticky wallpaper). The editing is sloppy. Most of the background music is only suitable for 1950s-style elevators. B & W cinematography has far too much contrast. And the costumes look like they're from a thrift store. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that "Plan 9 From Outer Space" looks like "Citizen Kane". I just do not know how to make a movie worse than Ed Wood's "Glen Or Glenda". But fortunately Bela Lugosi is in it. Every time he opened his mouth and looked into the camera with those big, arched eyes, I fell to the floor and laughed.
