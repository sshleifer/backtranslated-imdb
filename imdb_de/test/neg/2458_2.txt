What I saw after this movie was a guilty conscience. The film itself has a pretty intriguing plot and premise, but unfortunately it's a movie you can not see without being bombarded with pornography. If you plan this and have a moral problem with degrading the marital act for the viewing pleasure of a public, you make a big mistake. This is not the kind of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip on your DVD player. At the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character is a video that records his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. This and other similar films appear at unpredictable times throughout the movie. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of women. Ironically, they made several women into prostitutes. I only gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because they would have handled Balduin's promiscuity better if it had been an interesting movie.
