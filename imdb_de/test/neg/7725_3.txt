I saw the first house of the dead and expected that a root canal would be more comfortable, and if it was not so bad, I was very surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I got my hopes that the second one might be ok ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Apparently I'm one of the few who have seen this movie thinking it was bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I should take another look at it and force myself to see what all the people who have given good reviews have seen, or ask me if I have the wrong movie have seen. Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did an excellent job in roles that were far below them. They deserve to be in better films. <br /> <br /> The special effects were fine and some of the characters were sympathetic / hateful and that made a bearable clock, but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time. Oh, and I have to ask because I wondered all the way through the movie. Did not anyone know how to close the doors behind them, so zombies would not just go into the rooms? Only once did it happen (zombies wandered in) and I thought that was a little more comfortable ... Soldiers entered a room, leaving the door wide open, ignoring the door so the zombies could just go in if they felt so (with the hapless "livings" who can not find escape), and yet they were followed only by zombies. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? But maybe honestly ... If I were to fight for my life, the last thing I would do was to enter a room and leave the door wide open to allow zombies to swarm in and eat me. <br /> <br /> That's really the only thing that bothered me throughout the movie, and for the most part, the movie was a bad sequel to a not-so-devious original.
