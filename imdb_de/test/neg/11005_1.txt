I went into this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video library to pick a movie, and my friend returned with it. I promised not to laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes, I told him that I needed to take back my pledge. We kept watching, hoping it would get better, but no; There was a constant rape. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst ever to get involved in the film, and certainly deserves a spot on the IMDb Bottom 100. I really do not know how it came about. The lighting was bad. I saw better acting in elementary school games. There is really nothing positive to say.
