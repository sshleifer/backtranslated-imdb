SILVER CITY (2+ outta 5 stars) As a big fan of John Sayles' work, I've been sure for years that this is the worst movie he's ever made. That said, the movie is not exactly * awful * ... just very uninspired. Sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, selling out of youthful ideals), but does not bring them together in new or meaningful ways. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time. He sounds clichéd and forced into almost every scene. The movie looks and sounds like episodes of a television series that has not survived the third episode. There are tons of big stars on the hand ... and they try their best to bring their bits to life ... but the material just is not there this time. While filming a campaign, a hopeful governor (a bad and obvious George W Bush stand-in) discovers a corpse from a lake. An investigator is hired to try to warn people who have deliberately arranged to discredit the candidate. However, he soon realizes that deeper and darker (and more clichédish) secrets can be discovered. Sayles has done so much better in the past with films on similar topics (Lone Star, Matewan, Return of Secaucus Seven, Men With Guns). It is a shame that he once went too many to the well and found spoiled water. A good line delivered by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser, that's already established, so try to be good, okay?"
