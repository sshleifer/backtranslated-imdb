I have the same opinion about Underworld as the previous comment. <br /> <br /> I've been reviewing the film's 1.5 hours, wondering what this story is about, and especially why the author and / or the director made certain decisions for the plot. Overall, I found the film unbalanced, consisting of strange negotiations that (IMHO) had nothing to do with the movie. When I write a thriller, I would say that you want your viewers to be surprised at the story, not the way the story is made.
