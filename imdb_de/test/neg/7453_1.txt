You know, I was very surprised when I saw this movie. It was broadcast once during the day when I was ill, and since I had nothing else to do, I kept watching. This is by far the worst movie ever! But to my surprise, I kept watching. I sat there and said that's awful, but I did not change the channel because I was so amused how bad it was. Maybe it was the guy who looked like Big Tom of survivors or the terrible mustaches and mohawks that had those characters. The girls were not half as bad, but if that's what you want, it's much better. Oh, and there are "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like ninjas, bad acting, funny (and terrible) dialogue and two twins that are a half meter tall and kill everything in sight, then this movie is for you. It is so bad that it is good. However, I only had to award one out of ten points. I could not have made 10 there with Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
