This is not exactly a complicated story. It's not a puzzle or a conspiracy you have to spend watching because you have missed an intrinsic part of the dialogue. If you claim that a movie has to be seen several times to "get it", this may apply to very few films, but this is not one of them. This kind of film has substance and it's so hard to miss an important part of the dialogue or a subtle nuance to record details that you may have missed. This is not true for Goya's spirits. The main flaw in this movie is the lack of details. It jumps from one figure to the next, but there is never enough content for a scene to involve the audience. Because of this, you do not associate with any of the characters. They do not come to the point where you are interested. Either the lead actor has disappeared, as if the movie seems to be redeeming itself, or their actions are despicable and you are not ready to do so anyway. Goya's refusal to help Ines very much is a good example. His refusal to commit himself continues to reflect the overall sound of his role. The only characters you might feel for a moment are Ines when questioned and then tortured. After her rape by Lorenzo, every focus on her character has almost disappeared. After that, the only other profound involvement is the best scenes in the film, which is about Lorenzo's invitation to dinner with Ines's family. Her fathers all try to get Lorenzo to sign a confession and bring his daughter back. Then, as things develop again, they disappeared from the movie. I read a lot of comments here about the film not knowing what it wanted to be, etc. I found out that basically, it was not that much of anything. After Lorenzo's return and the chance contemplation of Ines's daughter by Goya, everything seemed to be fictitious. Without a lot of story writing, there was no effort to really investigate the turbulent times they lived in. The essence of who Goya was was not realized, except for his actions or lack thereof. This proves that he is more selfish than anything else. As far as his art is concerned, the film seemed intent on examining some of the paintings he painted, but again wasted another opportunity to examine the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. In summary, the film had no cohesion. He roughly lacked the substance to dive into the historical environment he covered. When you were done, you felt that what you just saw was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by moving from one thing to another without properly involving the viewer in one of them. You can not stand this anymore, assuming it improves with an additional exam. It just is not enough to lose time. It's not about missing something, it's just proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good are simply not there. As for the best movie ever made? It's not even the best movie I've seen today.
