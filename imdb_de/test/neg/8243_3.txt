I loved the Carry on Movies in general, but this is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced. There is a lot of talent on the screen and some are better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jacques and Peter Butterworth are fine, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just cheesy. Joan Sims gets away well, but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey, it's just sad. When you think of the sad end of his career, the movie is almost too depressing to watch. The homophobia of the movie is evil and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other films in the series, the film in England is very clear. The sea side looks cold and there is hardly any attempt to create illusions here. It looks like a cheap production. You'll be surprised how unhappy you look, especially if you loved the show.
