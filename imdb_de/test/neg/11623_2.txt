the worst sequel I've ever seen. really horrible songs that are annoying given the fantastic results and story of the first movie! What ruins the film for me is the fact that there is no John Cleese. So Jean Bob could not even be in the movie and the new bad guys are terrible. It's really annoying how this old woman can piece together a simple sentence without repeating her words over and over again. but being fair that Uberta does not shut up is a bit weird. But it was her 50th birthday: why do you strip her like an 80 year old? I wanted to give a 1 here, but now I think ... I could give it a 2, but the story is still not as good as the first movie. it is similar without the humor of certain characters. Overall, I did not like the movie at all because of the disappointing music and the lack of vocal talent: I had changed the voice of Prince Derek and Jean Bob, the new villains, the disappointing storyline, the annoying habits of some characters, and the very simple animation.
