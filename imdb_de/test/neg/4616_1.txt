I had never gone out of a movie before this movie. I had entertained the idea a few times, but this time I did, looked at myself to see the end of another movie, but had to come back and see the end of anger while waiting for my friends. They told me that I would not miss much while I was away. The entire movie has generally offended me so much that I can not even describe it. My gut feeling told me to get out of the theater. It was an inward reaction to a horrible movie. At the center of the story was the cruel actions of some objectionable teenagers against vulnerable and disturbed others. There was no ray of light, no responsible or sympathetic person who offered contrast. I found that even the "good guys" of the movie did nothing for me, stupid, stupid, vain, or simply ineffectual, disgusting. (Not in a kind of "I am reckless" but rather in the portrayal of disregard for humanity). Apart from the repetition of this scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) had potential, but sometimes they were only distracting. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually, I can find some good things to make up for the not-so-good of a movie. I'm not saying this movie did not do any good, but I say no matter what that may have been, I can not remember all the other crap that drove me crazy. I am really sorry for that. The best parts were perhaps the clips from the classic original.
