Cult starts 20 years ago on the 'Quinling Mountain Range, South China', when a man named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds an ancient amulet that is said to have magical powers, to California, where Quinlin has built a cult and the members act to sacrifice themselves when one of them (Cazzy Golomb) pervades his evil scheme ... Jump to the top of five college students today: Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel) Michaely) & Morgan (Victoria Venegas) explore the events of twenty years ago, known as the "Quinling Massacre" for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to kill himself, which releases the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for rather weak reasons. He sets out to accomplish what he began all those years ago by claiming souls to eventually inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil.

The script of Benjamin Oren, which seems to take itself very seriously, is a grim supernatural story about a cult leader returning from the dead to end what he had started a few years ago, assuming that The characters involved now have connections to what happened years ago & it's as boring as it sounds. The characters are bland and forgetful, the dialogue as well, there is no real horror or exploitation in it, it sometimes goes slowly, it's predictable, it's a clich√©, it gets completely out of hand in the end and does not make much sense if you think about it. History never captivates or captivates you, it's never exciting or particularly interesting, and I would be hard pressed to call it an average. There is very little that I could recommend Cult to, do not worry about this. <br /> <br /> Director Knee is fine, but the movie looks like it was just made for television It's completely forgotten everywhere. There is no fear, there is no atmosphere and there is no tension. There's no Gore either, sure there are a lot of blood spatters, but no real special make-up effect gore scenes. <br /> <br /> With a purported budget of about $ 950,000, Cult looks cheap, though it's not as bad as some low budget horror movies I've seen recently. Acting is not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Cult is a bad movie that did not do anything for me. I would try to call this average. There are much better horror movies.
