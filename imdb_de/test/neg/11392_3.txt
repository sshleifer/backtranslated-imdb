This weird little movie starts with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and is beaten every day. He likes to wear clothes and his obese mother Angela, who is a dressmaker, does not think she's wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but is ignored and when the two return to their car, they are harassed by the other kids and showered with eggs. Bruno's dad Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is completely disgusted that his son is a sissy and practically offends him. Bruno meets a new student at school, Shawniqua (Kiami Davael), who is a free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley in cap-guns. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother takes care of him when Dino refuses. The movie begins with a very hard and disagreeable look at all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with Bruno, who wears clothes because she practically encourages him. Dino was told by his mother as a little boy that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now does not want to help Bruno when he needs her. The Catholic school that visits Bruno is very unruly, and all the kids go around wild and even call Shawniqua the word "N". As soon as Shirley MacLaine enters the film, she becomes more family-oriented (so to speak). **** SPOILER ALERT **** The end of the spelling bee is unbelievable and "wellbeing". Hugs and cheers for Bruno as a reporter follow him and take his photo for their papers. Meanwhile, Shirley MacLaine behaves like the "hard old broad" who snaps at everyone. There's one thing about MacLaine's character in the movie that nobody mentioned in those comments, and she's got to do with the male nature of her. I think the character of Helen could be a lesbian! She is very tough and strong and at some point in the movie she shares a shot of whiskey with Bruno while smoking a cigar. I do not remember anyone in the movie who mentioned who her husband was or if she was married at all! That's why I think her character could be gay. Many other good actors can also be seen in the movie. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan should have looked at the script before signing. I think when they heard that MacLaine ordered it would be an honor to be a part of it. It's probably hard for most people to find it very hard to feel remorse or understanding of any of the characters and the topic. The actors are not bad, but what exactly did MacLaine want to aim for? Tolerance to a boy who wants to wear clothes and freedom of speech? We get that in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I tried not to flinch.
