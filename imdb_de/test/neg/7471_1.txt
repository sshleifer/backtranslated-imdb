"Grande Ecole" is not an artful confrontation with mixed sexuality, but, if you need it, a movie for an X-rated channel. Although I suspect that there is nothing in this film that could harm a willing viewer, the plot is simply an excuse for the man-to-woman and man-to-man connection that results in the unconvincing context of a competition between a Paris school future CEOs and a large school for those seeking a higher degree in the liberal arts. There is also a break in the cultural conflict between high-status and lower-status youth and a social conflict between native French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that's missing is a woman-to-woman coupling that could easily have been arranged with a slight twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is slightly higher than the usual pornography film - but to be honest, "Grande Ecole" is nothing but pornography with artistic aspirations. I am not hurt by sex. It's just repetitive and boring. Where is the Hays Office when you really need it?
