I rated this with 3 out of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to spend your time seeing an anorexic actress, Carly Pope in this movie acting like a fool, do not bother. <br /> Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young college student who is fascinated by a puzzle game that leads her into subway tunnels under the city - a danger to even a well-armed man alone. <br /> <br /> There are various intrigues in the film - a crazy classmate who seems to be following Sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs a kind of unusual hole-in-the-wall business that seems to be located in the Behind a ghetto lies a nerd-like fool walking around the cynic's workshop and a woman named Emily Gray, back in jail. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is a solicitor who deals with Emily Gray's case. <br /> <br /> Several years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was sent to a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some reason, they let her out, although it's obvious she's still at risk. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily has ever given her is crime: I've never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, do not expect that you'll ever get a better explanation because you're habit.
