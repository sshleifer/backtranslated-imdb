Would another translation have made it chillier or more frightening? Are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? Is it important at all? You may have heard that great actors can make the phone book exciting. Well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. <br /> <br /> If it's not about homosexuality, murder, dismemberment, psychopaths, insanity, deviant psychology, then it's about drama - acting, which is helped with much dialogue. The dialogue is actually exciting. <br /> <br /> For Englishmen, "Twelve Angry Men" is the better choice. There is a little more interaction and you can judge if the action matches the dialogue. You do not have to wonder if you miss something. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Andy Warhol's "Empire" to those who like this movie.
