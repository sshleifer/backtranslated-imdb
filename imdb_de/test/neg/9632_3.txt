I've seen this movie a few times and I've never really liked it. I'm not a fan called "Nu Horror", so I can not be fired because of that. I thought it was a bit grubby, I think what irritates me about Hammers is the sexplo aspect, not the sex, but the sexploitation. I'm surprised how many people rated this movie so high, so I'll take a look at it again. But for me it was not scary, it had no atmosphere, just a bit "Omigod, look at these nasty / dumb prostitutes from London and this little innocent Anna who is being raped by another bad man, ooherh!" I suppose the movie did not have any depth for me at last, just a bunch of vicious, enigmatic men and women just for the stimulus value. It was, in a sense, Victorian England, but the sets are too clumsy and boring to convey a sense of Victorian menace. Roger Corman's horror on the other hand, that's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. For me that was just exploitative, flat footfall.
