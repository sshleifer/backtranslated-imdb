I just watched this movie and am disappointed that I did not enjoy it a bit. It's so slow. Slow and uninteresting. This child of Harry Potter plays a shy teenager with a rude mother, and one day the rude mother orders the child to find a job so that it can accommodate an old man who apparently has no place to live living with his family Therefore, the child goes to work for an old lady. And this old woman, who lives alone, teaches him girls, while driving and in life! I could not understand how an 18-year-old guy enjoys spending time with a terrible woman in the 80s. I'm sorry if my comments on this movie bothered the people who might have enjoyed it. I could be wrong, because I am not British and do not understand the social and family structure and way of life. Mostly the movie is made for the British audience.
