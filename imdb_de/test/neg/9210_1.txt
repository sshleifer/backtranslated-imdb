There must be a 0/10 option for these bilges. <br /> <br /> It was painful to watch, but strangely captivating. Captivating, because it seemed incredible that a movie could shit so much. I always thought "it has to get better". It got worse. And worse. <br /> <br /> As on earth, people were tempted to produce such a categorical piece of trash that I'll never know. The most surprising thing of all, however, are all those reviews that I see from people who really love the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very, very, very bad. The worst movie ever!
