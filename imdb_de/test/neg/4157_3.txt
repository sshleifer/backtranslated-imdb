I like to think that I can appreciate a movie that is a bit unusual, and I love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like extraordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so incoherent that the only thing you'll think about when it's over is how it's possible for you to spend 90 minutes of your life wasting seeing that. <br /> <br /> A film of this kind needs a movie driver to be bought by the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why are you making the decisions you make? This film makes a very weak attempt to do so and fails. There is no chemistry between these two actors, both of whom are outstanding in their ability to feel comfortable in every role. Why did you fail here? I have the strong feeling that they did not know what their motivations were, and if an actor does not know, the audience can not follow. <br /> <br /> In summary, I have seen Macromedia Flash videos being offered more in the way of stimulating thoughts, at least I have more interest in the transformed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man does everything for a violation of "code 46" would risk.
