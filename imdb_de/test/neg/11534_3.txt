As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the "Millennium" series) and of course Lorenzo "Renegade" lamas, I had at least expected something from this film. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the drama is bad and the computer graphics used for most stunts do not work. Sometimes it even looks like they took some pictures from the Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is too shit. Unnecessary funky camera work initially only distract attention (from the cheesy dialogue) and give the film a cheap, video-balanced look. It works in hip-hop movies and Jet Li movies, but does not seem to be appropriate in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was 11 years old then.
