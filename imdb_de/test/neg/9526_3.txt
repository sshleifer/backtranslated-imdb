As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships as well, I can not just see the movie as a movie. In a movie, there are some great, wonderful shots of the ship, most of which were made on an existing ship - except for those in the catastrophe scenes of course, and a certain space below deck. But in terms of the story and the dialogues I can only call that big crap. None of this would happen on a real sailing ship like this. No wonder the film had a bad impact on the existing ship - if I did not know better, I was not tempted to go on a sailing trip. In any case, I recommend for Europeans to switch off the ship as soon as the ship runs aground. After that begins the over-emotional, very American part that I could not stand. The pictures are really great, no wonder in a movie by Ridley Scott, but if you can avoid hearing the lyrics, the lyrics will be much better.
