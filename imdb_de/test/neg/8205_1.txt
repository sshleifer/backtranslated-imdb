This movie shows what you can do when you have a camera, some paint and cardboard, a toy ship, a few friends who have acted in the theater of the community, and the wrong idea that you can make a movie. The end result is an unsurpassable waste of time that you can skip unless you take it out of the DVD player and throw it through the window first. <br /> <br /> The acting in the opening scene (especially by the plump Lee Morgan as "Captain") and the toy ship "plunging" into the rocks before the end credits are a good indicator of what you are after I feel like Boyette thought he was saving some money by washing dishes at the same time, and the funny thing about the bad movie is that it's funny That "Dungeon of Harrow" apparently (perhaps by accident) inspired the spin of "Manos: The Hands of Fate." Yes, it's the same lame one. "I was the victim, and now I take the place of the crazy rogue Ironically, the ironic ending is that two awkward, talentless filmmakers could turn two equally wretched horror movies filmed in Texas away. <br /> <br /> The monotonous nerd Russ Harvey is a noble in a great family line ( why?) si They were great, never hinted at and boring as they complain of the death of their family line and their coat of arms, even before his ship crashes (we also cover a threatening narrative throughout the movie). Unfortunately we are not so happy. The toy ship of his family bumps into a sink in a styrofoam, and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and a woman conveniently dumped on a crazy county island. Meanwhile, the Earl is visited by a wicked ghost dressed in a Blackstone's Magic Kit who attacks him with various dolls (spiders, snakes, bats ... all the sick things). The Earl (William McNulty) exaggerates worse than Shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical maniac. <br /> <br /> I would also be angry if I had to be in this disaster. The woman is immediately killed by the count's cruel dogs, and the two idiots are captured by his servant. The count accuses her of being a pirate (evidently his worst fear), often beating his servant (apparently his greatest pleasure), Fatboy being tortured, a woman being a servant, and a lazy leprosy girl Countess is in the dungeon (she digs the Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and scary thing in the movie), many inhuman conversations at a dining table, the Bubbly Captain is killed on a miserable getaway (that means a sloth will kill you) Pack of lions fighting looks). , , It's all an ugly haze for me. I spent most of my time using the fast-forward button. Anyway, the joker and the nurse take a break and think they are being rescued by three boys in a rowboat on the lake (yes, we're supposed to think a lake is the sea) , They do not do it because the nerd's hair has turned gray and he scares the would-be rescuers. I think they just took the opportunity to row out of that vile movie while they got the chance. They go back to the castle, the nurse starts to rot as the countess (and her belly at that time), and we end up with those two preparing to get into the castle. , , DUNGEON OF HARROW !!!! Sheet! <br /> <br /> I love old, lousy horror movies, but they have to be entertaining. I feel torn off even at the low price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. The Mystery Science Theater would have a difficult time if it's fun. I was picked up by a couple of nutty reviewers who said this movie has atmosphere and some scary moments. Not correct! Avoid this trip at all costs and do not even waste a dollar if you find it somewhere in a dollar container. This movie makes Corman's "The Terror" like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
