To this day, Malcolm McLaren says that he had the idea that Sex Pistols was his idea and that the band members were his puppets with whom he could make money. There is a good reason for him to do this, that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some facts. <br /> <br /> * McLaren was actually addressed by the band to become a manager, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> * The pistols were a real, organic band and were not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious also went way back. This is something that has led to an unfair criticism of the Pistols when compared to traditional boy bands. <br /> <br /> * The band and no one else has written the songs, recorded them, played live, created the ad and gave the interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not trigger Bill Grundy's incident. The pistols only appeared on the program because Queen had moved out. According to the band, McLaren huddled in the back in case arrests were made. Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not released. <br /> <br /> * John Lydon (Rotten) was far from outsmarting the Sex Pistols, and indeed sued him in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers comes from McLaren's boast in The Great Rock & Roll Swindle. This indicates that McLaren is not too bright despite his affects. <br /> <br /> * The layoffs and subsequent payouts from A & M and EMI were again not technically mature. <br /> <br /> * McLaren boasts of the money he has earned with the band. If he had been competent, he could have done much more. It seems he did not even organize concerts properly. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's claim at the beginning of the film that he invented punk rock can be refuted in about ten seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, but the best known. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. The only parts to watch are the band's original recordings, which were later used much better in 'The Filth And The Fury'.
