Impressive. I have recently seen Demon Winds, and I do not think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> Never before has humanity seen such a baseless change in make-up without a damnable reason. Or similarly, so much bad zombie make-up (?) That you'll be hungry for these green Halloween marshmallows. <br /> <br /> Or so much naked old lady. But then there was "The Shining". <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateurish that it has almost a bit of charm, just like the dialogue. The last shot of the movie is just so stupid that it's indescribable. It's like a drunken college student who has teamed up with some buddies and decided to throw Bruce Willis-type dialogue along with a (presumably) teenybopper dialogue from an Elm Street movie. The result is staggering, and it would be really funny if that was what it meant. <br /> <br /> Ah, what's up? I will laugh anyway. <br /> <br /> Hell, get together with your friends and look at this. But make sure you are drunk first. Or you can go crazy. Especially if you are a college film student. <br /> <br /> Cheers.
