When this show started, it was pretty interesting: we saw what the crabboat fisherman had to go through during the crab fishing season. Soon after, however, he lost focus on fishing and focused almost exclusively on the drama in the fisherman's life. Episodes have become nothing more than "the captain does not like the new greenhorn" (this happens far too often), "someone is injured or ill", "a fisherman gets problems at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat" I do not know how people can see the newest seasons, since each episode is essentially the same as the ones before and after it, and that show should be moved to another channel and renamed "Crab Boat Drama," or better yet she would have given a perfect one off segment for Dirtiest Jobs. <br /> <br /> Should the Discovery Channel not have learned its lesson after American Choppers?
