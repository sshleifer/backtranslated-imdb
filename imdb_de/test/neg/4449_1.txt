Just to save you time and money, I'll tell you that this movie is not worth the match and that it would be necessary to burn it. Do not waste your time. Actually, it would be better to forget that you ever thought to look at it. I've seriously seen better B movies in a language I can not understand. Anyone who has ever given permission must be sewn. The only positive thing I can say for this movie is that it could be a great story with a new script and the right director and actors. Let me break it. A virgin becomes pregnant by a demon while the baby in the womb wants to feed on humans. They try to make up for the fact that this may be the worst film ever made with cursing and senseless nudity. All in all, it was not worth the dollar to hire him.
