Farscape has received a lot of praise, but I do not think it's that good. It certainly has a distinctive look, but it lacks anything else: history, purpose, direction, excitement; They call it. I'm a big sci-fi fan and want me to watch all the sci-fi shows I can. I'm almost finished with the four squadrons of Farscape and I'm not very happy at the time. The series has some good things - especially Claudia Black (who unfortunately is missing in the first episodes of the fourth season) - but there are very few and very far apart. Overall, the show is riddled with many very stupid things (like fantasy elements instead of SF-Ditto) and many episodes, especially. In the fourth season, we are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured. And you just have the feeling that there is nowhere to go. They are mostly just undirected adventures with thin, long-running plotting lines that slowly develop slowly. Well, sometimes it's a bit tighter, but it only lasts for a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> In terms of effects, there are a few impressive things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the show seems to be in the same style of effects that honestly grow old. Extraordinary and unconvincing puppet aliens march the show a lot, and I prefer (by far) the episodes in which normal, human-looking characters take center stage in the show's most stylish, intriguing and interesting characters; despite their human appearance, they succeed in being a convincingly foreign culture. There are some really cool episodes, especially. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton disguises himself as captain of the peacemakers, invading and eventually destroying one of their secret bases. Such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but I can not give the show a total rating of "4". Apart from the Peacekeepers (who are a bit self-determined themselves) totalitarian and militaristic to be truly nuanced), the show simply does not provide anything important or significant that you want to know or see. OTOH, it has some good ideas and is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> Of course, that's just my opinion, but as a seasoned science fiction fan, I believe it counts for something and can be different help. There are not many good sci-fi shows; Star Trek (every series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre sci-fi shows, you may also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
