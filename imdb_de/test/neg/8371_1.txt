When I saw it, I was preparing to write a blatant, crass critique of this "movie" (it's actually a video), but then I saw someone already did it. I agree with him pretty much. But on the other hand, it looks like a lot of effort, and millions of lira have gone in, so I think you have to give them some credit for it. Anyone who still does not know the Lovecraftian world and tries to convey it will probably think ... Well, I think that's not only really bad, it makes absolutely no sense. I thank God that I've read part of the other review (a bit confusing, maybe?), Showing that this guy also made "The Shunned House" (which looked very bad after the DVD box) and keep mine Thinking about any further disappointment with the brilliance of HP Lovecraft.
