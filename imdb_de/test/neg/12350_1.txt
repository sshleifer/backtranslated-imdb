Not a balanced position. The director should not express their opinion as truth. The film has some criticism of Fujimori, but he always gives him and his family the last words. Few Fujimori critics were of the opinion that the only reason for the inclusion was that the film offered both views. This is not the case. The film shows hardly any of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him credit for leading the assassination of the MRTA insurgents who conquered the Japanese Embassy. It is well documented that the CIA has done the planning. There are even pictures of a well-known CIA strategist on the site, published by the magazine Caretas and other newspapers. <br /> <br /> The fact that such known information was not used by the director gives us some possible conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and deliberately and wrongly decides to give him the honor; The director does not want viewers to note that CIA and Fujimori have worked together. or it was just out of ignorance, as the director is not Peruvian and was not present at the time of the events in Peru. <br /> <br /> The statement given by other commentators that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> Also, the film's actual support ratings for Fujimori were the highest I've ever heard of.

Ketin Vidal and he had full autonomy of Fujimori and Montesinos. The first government of Fujimori recorded an improvement in general economic development (GDP). However, this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that was not conducive to the country in the long term. During the regime of Fujimori, the gap between rich and poor continued to increase. In his second term, the economy suffered and there was nothing else to privatize, and at the end of Fujimori's second term, the economy was close to collapse. In terms of investment in the infrastructure of the Fujimori regime they fall broke the paternalistic pattern. They were created to increase support for Fujimori, but should not take long. These structures had to be continued, but Fujimori did not provide civilians with political power to demand further investment. In fact, the Fujimori regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization, such as unions and grass-roots groups, and the growth of informal, unorganized labor was immense. Eventually, the director decided to spend most of these editions film talking to Fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (media, business owners, military, etc.) that were so prevalent that it was impossible for that Fujimori did not know it.
