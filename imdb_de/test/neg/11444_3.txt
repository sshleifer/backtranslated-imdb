This movie has it all: It's a thriller, a chase movie, a love story, a mob story, a comedy, a road movie ... well, actually that's nothing. <br /> <br /> All the while you are waiting for something interesting, but no, you still see the same boring, uninspiring and superficial clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the starcasting lacks credibility. A hit man with his quirks, a girl that's hard to get mob guys who are tough and incompetent cop yawn ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend not looking backtrack. If you want to watch a good movie directed by a famous actor, visit Tommy Lee Jones's "The Three Funerals of Melquiades Estrada". That's what I'm worth, to be seen.
