Let me first mention the fact that, despite the title ("stories" in the plural), there is only one kitchen story. I'm not so sure if Isak died in the end or not, because in one of the last scenes HIS PIPE is lying next to the two cups on the table. There is a reference to Tati on the DVD cover. The film is said to be "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very funny: reminiscent of Tati!") The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on pantomime and silent, dead panic to achieve his comic effects and his critical -satiric views to convey its "modern" society of the 50's Of course, the "kitchen" takes place in the fifties and offers some (rather weak) satirical references to the absurdities of the bureaucracy, and there are some long moments when none Words are spoken - but they are not all these little details enough to turn "Kitchen" into a "Tatiesque" movie, I have to admit that "Kitchen" sometimes deals with the false objectivity of scientific research against the "truth" of "Dossier" deals with human subjective feelings: In general, the film was painfully slow, and hardly anything happened - with hardly a "dramatic impulse": the parts involved were during the first about 15 minutes and set during the last hour If the hour or so is was the last segment - FINALLY !!! - interesting and moving. It might seem that this is a short topic of less than an hour, inappropriately extended to about 90 minutes. Now, to build (a "scientific" observation of the behavior of individual men in their kitchen): At first it seemed promising - by recording the coming and going of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine which new inventions are most useful. However, this premise quickly turned out to be a prologue, an "excuse" to introduce the very subject, which was only fully developed towards the end, focusing on loneliness and invaluable friendships. Pity ! I really wanted to have this movie. Yeah, it seemed so promising when I heard some odd little "anecdotes" that were actually there and that I enjoyed - like burning a man's nose hair (instead of scissors to cut it off). The "investment" of stacking a huge amount of "valuable" black pepper in a barn, the role reversals (the observer becomes the observed), the mouth of a man emitting sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse that becomes the catalyst of half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of driving the right or left side in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance each of these very close neighbors has to its individuality affirm?). Am I the only person who did not fully enjoy this movie? Does that necessarily mean that I'm wrong? Perhaps it is almost universally praised that "fine points" were actually "too subtle" for me? Perhaps ... Could my individual views on this film ironically reflect the very core of the film itself - what is the indispensable need to have the right to differentiation, to affirm individuality, and not blindly follow the trends and opinions of society? Each of us has the right to have different personal views and not to counteract the demands of the "dictatorial" demands: Often we have other alternatives that allow each of us to be useful to us society respecting its internal principles. In short, being true to oneself - the way in which Folke ("scientific observer" of Isak) gives up his job by preferring to stay in the house of his new friend Isak and join him in the duties of his farm help ... and so "Vive la différence", as the French say!
