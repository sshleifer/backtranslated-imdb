I just saw it again yesterday and, to put it briefly, "style instead of substance". We can already assume that Jerry Lee Lewis had to have much more than what is shown here. The Jerry Lee Lewis character in this movie is not portrayed as a real human for the entire hour and a half and more than a minute, but all the other characters are just a pencil stroke because they are not cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's start. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin Jimmy Swaggart sneaking into the Black Jazz Club, and we see Jerry's inspiration. Could be possible. We see how the two cousins ​​choose different ways of life (also possible). Then we cut to Jerry Lee, who plays the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid), and it's exciting and a bit scary. Cut to a scene in which he meets his second cousin Myra for the first time. From then on, the whole thing becomes a retrospective look at certain events that are played in the style of a news role at full speed. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie is not a bit entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that Jerry Lee did. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at it, an indicator of his great success in the coming years. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most important character in the movie. She teases, she sobs, she chews gum and plays coquettishly and that's it. There's never a reason she was the third Mrs. Lewis and spoke of wives. Where are the first two? For that reason, this really can not be classified as a biopic, but rather as an inaccurate news item. We see Jerry playing his first song on the radio, we see his second single in the top ten, we do not see his third song. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable sinking. Absolutely no basis in reality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a minor quarrel: The film plays from '56 to '58 and Myra still says: "I'm only 13" to the end.
