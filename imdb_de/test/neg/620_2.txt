I could not. I was bored, not only because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was just a b-movie about cannibalism, but because I saw a strange subtitle movie that did not bother me at all but was still dubbing , <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were terrible. When the back of the plane comes off, you can see that the model is hollow when it "breaks away" in counterfeit snow. Most of the film takes place on a stage that is clearly not real and looks almost like a game, as the "sounds" of snow are heard everywhere but not really scene. <br /> <br /> "But how are they going to eat? They have no food," says a military person (it's never clear what this guy does or why he's responsible for it) that I'm convinced No one ever really said anything or even thought about food because they were worried if people were going to live, not how they would eat. It was just a stupid line indicating that they had to eat the bodies to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the bodies, a man finds a shirtless body that, although he lay in the snow for a long time, he is not frozen from afar, in fact his flesh is very flexible and fresh. He cuts the fresh meat off his back, it's not frozen or cold at all, and it appears for five minutes. I had to stop there. The remake "Alive" was a far superior movie about trying to survive in a terrible situation where the real survivors were certainly praised, while I can not imagine any of them saying anything nice about this version. It was just about eating corpses and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
