Serious! You just have to watch this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It appeared during the time when everyone was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The Little Rogues, Mr. Nanny, etc.), but lacked charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by anger, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who only shows fatigue and fatigue, possibly with the tired clich√©s that this movie enjoys. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the biggest flaw in the movie was not acting or filming, but writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, though this film lacks the warmth that IL 'Walt has made. Junior's dad (John Ritter) infuriates you without doing anything, just because he lets Junior run around unsupervised and only warns him severely when he ties a 200-pound monster to a chalk board. <br /> <br /> In addition, Junior's grandfather is particularly distressed. For those of you who saw the first one who felt sick and did not see the second, "Big Ben Healy," as he is called in this movie, is still a total shower. In principle, he steps into John Ritter's house uninvited, settling in Junior's room, even though he says he hates Junior and does nothing to hasten the speed of the film or to support the film in any way. Rather, he ticks the audience off as a lazy, free loader. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are introduced to a multitude of new characters, such as the complacent, vile Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, who lights it first and then gives it to Junior, who simply kills her staring at big eyes. Also Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film and plays this time in the new elementary school of junior the disgusting headmaster. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to convey the point, I'll just say: This film smells! <br /> <br /> 2/10 Stars, because the actor's beliefs shine through the film, though the script is shitty.
