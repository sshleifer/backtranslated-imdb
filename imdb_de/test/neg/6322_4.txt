A lawyer from New York plans to get rid of his senile mother after meeting an attractive, available woman. Screenwriter Robert Klane, who adapted his own novel (the kind of paperback children he would buy for the dirty parts), seems to have no knowledge of mental illness: for him, it's just an excuse for annoying comedy and skatlogic jokes. George Segal - who played mainly in war and espionage figures in the 1960s - had become one of the greatest comedians in the US at the time; His crazy reactions and batty reactions only compete with his mother. Segal goes along well with Trish Van Devere, and her moments of connection (though laughable) are really the only sequences to be attracted to. Ruth Gordon, adorable as she is, is just too much - and more of her is less. This is one of the worst directorial and cut films I've ever seen by so-called professionals. Promising scenes that ultimately do not fully unfold are arbitrarily separated from other moments that beat endlessly and destroy the blatant, rickety film long before it ends. * 1/2 of ****
