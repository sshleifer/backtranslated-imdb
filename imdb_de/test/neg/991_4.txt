Since their entire career was just a pale impersonation of the Beatles, it's no wonder that the Monkees, shortly after the big fiasco of the Beatles "Magical Mystery Tour" with their own threadbare and creative quagmire of a movie called "head." Both films are not so much a story with an action (although MMT has tried to define an action), but they are a mixture of skits and snippets interspersed with music, songs and outtakes. <br /> <br /> "Head" has no conspiracy, except for the pre-fours who try to free themselves from the "box" they are in (ie, the guy, "Monkees", and the surrounding commercialism) and yet always find themselves back in the box Most sketches involve breaks in the "fourth wall" and go into other, seemingly disconnected scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to showcase their other talents, the film hops randomly - also to blame the various directors. <br /> <br /> The film, like Magical Mystery Tour, is now being excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements". Phooey As with MMT, there are too many people with access to too many drugs who are trying to do something artistic and make a mistake. Like MMT, "Head" has some smart moments, and some relatively unknown Monkees songs are pretty decent. It's developing a bit more charm than MMT and is a bit easier to sit in, but it's not ironic that it, like anything else the Monkees, was just an imitation of what the Beatles had done first ... even when it does to lay an egg.
