Since I'm not a special Western fan, I've been watching this mainly because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in a role other than "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show." Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a salon in the Arizona Territory in 1868, who is about to marry the unscrupulous Indian agent (Dean Jagger.). Balls performance was okay - nothing really more than that; She did not blow me away. I managed to make the role very different from the one I'm used to - there was little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, though the movie always wanted to maintain a softly amusing feeling. (A typical weird line - "There are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows any of them!") I did not find the story so convincing, though I guessed the Indians were seen as victims of the US Indian agent It gives typical shootout action and many horses - so typical Western. Regarding Christine - we can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage will end. It's just a question of how to get there. If you like Western, this would be a pretty typical one, with a little humor. If you're not big enough, you'll miss this genre. I'm not big on the genre. 3.10
