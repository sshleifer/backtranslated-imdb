What a waste of a film the film industry no longer dares to make a film that could only have to do with the ideas of the man. His theories and his development have virtually nothing, instead the most boring history of domestic life and relationship with a daughter, a cumbersome script, great freedom from Darwin's life, a dialogue given to his character, and I hardly believe that he would have said that. Darwin never gave up his belief in a higher power, he may not have believed rightly in the established Christian concept of God, but he was not an atheist. what this movie implies. What would have been a worthwhile and much better movie would have been if they had started with the release of On the Origin of Species and created a story of the Great Revolution that led to it, and an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides were. instead, we got a boring, mostly made-up drama, a great injustice
