Be warned, the next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in every production, flee. Fast. <br /> <br /> Kelly proved to the world after his last movie "Southland Tales" that he is a presumptuous director. It was forgiving and confused. Not much has changed in "The Box". <br /> <br /> I can imagine what Warner Bros must be like, and I bet the studio executives did it all right: a full-feature movie based on one of Richard's "Twilight Zone" Mathesons old short stories , <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Do not read on, unless you want this movie to be TOTALLY spoiled for you: Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses the button. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Arlington steward (Frank Langella) has an alien who uses his body as a vessel for "experiments" where the fate of humanity rests. His face is startled because he was struck by alien flashes that killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all those tests with the red button. Since Norma pushes the button and knows that someone can die, she obviously has to bear the consequences of not seeing someone else's life as her own. In the end, she and her husband (James Marsden) decide to kill Norma instead of her son growing up deaf and blind. Kelly dances around the "message" of his movie and tries to get the audience to find out What is the moral of the story? Obviously, every person with a brain at the beginning says, "What if I was the person who dies?". Richard Kelly does not allow his character to have this normal, HUMAN CONVERSATION. In fact, they avoid it all together. They both seem to have been educated to work at a prestigious school and also for NASA. Why should not they both be better able to LOOK OUTSIDE THE BOX ??? <br /> <br /> If he had the main thing Characters actually have this conversation, the whole movie could have ended right there! Instead, we must watch as weddings go on forever, NASA and NSA are confident that Arlington Stewart will take over these government programs, teleporting to show Marsden's life beyond our world, so it will be "easier" to kill his wife, and drones are controlled by Steward, who can be anywhere at anytime. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is the tempo. Nothing really happens. It's a jumbled up mess of ideas that are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's unbearable how this movie is marketed. The commercials make it look like "saw" and even use the music of these films to sell it. In fact, you get a slow, boring, ridiculous (yes, half of the theater laughed at the acting and visual effects) and a chaotic film that is neither imaginative nor interesting, nor self-contained. At some point, Cameron Diaz and her son are kidnapped and suddenly she is on her way home with her husband in the big black car of the NSA. Where did she go? Why did you take them? Do we really care? You will not be any more. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really do not care what happens to one of the characters. They will die for everyone to die for the movie to just end. See everything else that plays. Do not waste your time or your money.
