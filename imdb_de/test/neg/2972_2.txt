Hollywood has made many strange movies over the years, but that's no stranger. WHY this movie was made, I'll never know, nor how Paramount would have thought it would sell 1947 tickets a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a British spy who in the days leading up to World War II tried to get a poison gas formula out of Germany. Ray Milland, a good actor, plays the role like an escape from Monty Python, all exaggerated in preschool English dialogue. In Germany, he meets a gypsy woman, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him, of course, to take cover as a gypsy. She plays her role as the typical Viennese gypsy caricature of the operetta, just like the other "gypsies" in the film. But there are also Nazis who are not funny at all. And then Milland finds he's starting to think like a gypsy, and that's not being treated as a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Every time the Nazis show up, the film music plays Wagner, which in itself is funny. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a comedy, or he could have taken the plight of the Gypsies seriously and made a serious showing of how the Nazis treated them. Both are indicated in this film, but not pursued. What we have left is a truly strange mix of genres that must have embarrassed everyone involved (except the director). <br /> <br /> Bizarre.
