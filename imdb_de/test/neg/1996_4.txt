Chuck Jones 'Odor-able Kitty' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world? Type of. There are some key differences between the Pepe we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the stealthy cat that Pepe amoriously persecutes in 'Odor-able Kitty' is clearly male. Pepe is also exposed as a fraud whose real name Henry is at the height of the cartoon. His French accent disappears when his wife and family appear. Pepe is not even the main character here, the focus is on the cat disguised as a skunk to deter his enemies. The plot largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon, but Pepe's aggressive advertising lacks the usual wisdom and direct camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is not nearly as good looking as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, "Odor-able Kitty" is a pretty ugly and awkward cartoon. The main source of interest is the concept that was original at this stage, before it became the template for all subsequent Pepe Le Pew comics. This subsequent development has had any effect on 'Odour-enabled Kitty' and seems to modern viewers like a rather boring Pepe Le Pew Short with a weird surprise ending. As a kid, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, who appreciates his subtler, verbal and witty humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. "Odor-able Kitty" feels like a kid again!
