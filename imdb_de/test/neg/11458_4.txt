I am glad that this was the last of the 40's Universal Mummy movies. The films all had different qualities and this movie was definitely one of the smaller ones. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this is a very slow movie in which nothing interesting or exciting happens. Maybe it would have been better if the mummy had made it into the movie earlier. Instead, the film now spends the first 20 minutes explaining what has happened in the previous mummy movies by once again using archival material from that 1932 "The Mummy", which is followed by the fourth mummy movie, The Mummy History of 1932. The film just never knows how to find the right tempo, and although the movie takes little more than an hour, it still feels a bit like it. <br /> <br /> Of course it does not help that the film helps has a rather simplistic and actually little interesting story. The film also feels pretty disconnected. The first and second halves of the film are not really related and they seemed like two separate films. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr. is still there. For the third time he repeats the role of Khari's mummy. Too bad that he has so little time this time. Unfortunately, he gets very little interesting to do, which is also a big waste of the mummy figure itself. The movie is also full of dozens of stupid actors playing around with stupid accents. It seemed so unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to talk with such an accent and it gets pretty distracting and annoying in some places. <br /> <br /> The mummy movies are the least worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
