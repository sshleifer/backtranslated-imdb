Follow these steps: Obtain a copy of this movie and a friend. Put the friend around $ 10 that he can not stand the whole movie. They can not distract their gaze or be distracted by something. Now take care of your friend. Win or lose, you receive $ 10 in entertainment. <br /> <br /> It annoys me endlessly when people watch a movie and quickly give 1 in 10 or summarize their thoughts with "sucked it". , (And when asked, "Why?"), They answer, "Just because." Arrgh.) That's why there is this movie. The only purpose for me is to say, "There, this is a terrible movie! THAT is 1 in 10!". <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely awful. <br /> <br /> While the current trend of film parodies is forcing them to become more and more formulaic. This film remains inferior in every way. It is not funny. It is not entertaining. And for some of the parodies it is completely inaccurate! Terrible spectacle. Unpleasant dialogue. A witless story. Terrible "special effects". An INANE gag after another. And to make matters worse, there is not even a superfluous nudity that makes it somehow worthwhile to flee. <br /> <br /> This film jumps past idiocy, stumbles over stupid and lands first on Moron. Even I, who loves a good movie "Check your brain at the door", found me physically excited when I saw that. This movie is not even "Hard Ticket To Hawaii" so awful, it's good, but it's bad. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have actually asked a friend to view this as described above. Not only did he not make it to the end, he had a headache and needed a few minutes later because he felt a little bit sick. True story. <br /> <br /> I could not emphasize this review ... a resounding 1 in 10!
