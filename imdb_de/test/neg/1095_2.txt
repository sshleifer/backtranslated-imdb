The main character of this sex-filled lover, Mel (Ethan Hunt), remarks several times, "She deserves more than that!" The "you" he refers to is Ginger, played by the beautiful Brandy Davis, who deserves better. Brandy deserves more than this movie, his lame script and the perverted mel. A guy who can get out when he sees his dream girl having sex with another guy, even in the virtual world, does not deserve her at all. An A- for the simulated sex scenes, an F for the script.
