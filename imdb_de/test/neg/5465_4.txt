The Book of Revelations starts very well. Daniel, an egotistical dancer, is abducted, abused and sexually raped by three masked women. After that, nothing else happens. There are some signs of rediscovery, but the film has neither an explanation nor a real ending. Daniel's reactions to the abuse are very simple. He stops dancing, has sex with every woman nearby and finally starts a relationship with a very simple and ordinary woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen a good amount of art-house films, but there's something missing br /> <br /> The main lines are fine; However, some characters do not seem to be fully defined.
