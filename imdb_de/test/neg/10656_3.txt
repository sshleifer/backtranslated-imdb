He finds the story of a man's love for an innocent baby with a deformed face and on the other side of the world a flat, self-centered "valley girl" who shares a date of birth and makes a big difference in both lives there. What a great and worthy story. But writing and / or ruling and / or editing the screen is so bad that the joy is taken away from the story the most. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding the mother to the evil witch and back faster than a raging bullet, and for what purpose? Conflicts, conflicts, conflicts in no time. Katie (The California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mother and all, including the poor lady at the check-in desk at the airport, Lin's adopted father, who is the kindest and most considerate man alive, and his wife and his biological son more settled Conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story, but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fight was over. There were too many inexplicable or illogical events, many of which did not contribute to the story. My wife and I kept looking at each other and wondering what such a good cast might look like and what a great story should be.
