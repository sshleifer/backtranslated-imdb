Lately, I have watched many westerns from the 1930s to the present day. There are some great spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie had all the elements of a decent Western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. It's a parody of the genre, and to me, the way it was done just did not work and made for a disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can easily be divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is great; it has a great opening scene, and an interesting story is developed by a bounty hunter (also known as a stranger) who pursues a bandit who is pursuing a large banking program, partially guarded by a banker. Over the course of the film, these three characters form changing alliances to get the money. The virtues of earlier films from this genre are subtly funny, but the comedy does not disturb the overall story. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, the comedy surpasses the top and essentially ruins the movie. The turning point is at the exact point where the barmaid is rooting for the dwarf to stop shooting the customers while waiting for other patrons who seemingly remember the four corpses that surround the place. From this point on, the film shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comical undertones to a stupid parody. <br /> <br /> There are three terrible fistfighting scenes (one on the river, one on the market and one in the baths) that follow in quick succession as if you were not bad enough. The fights are so fake that it's ridiculous, and since the sound is out of sync with the picture, it gets worse. In the market combat scene, the banker hops around on hidden trampolines and whirls on poles as he is in the circus; it is clownish. The worst part of these fight scenes, however, is the music; It's this carefree, sparkling mix that's more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes practically derail the main story. Overall, the movie was disappointing because as a decent western, it had a lot of potential, but the comic turns just screwed it up. If you want to see a good western parody, read "Blazing Saddles". If you want to see a good western spaghetti, avoid this movie.
