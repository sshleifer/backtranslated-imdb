Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. The crime is controlled by core trackers, android murderers sent by the United States Computerized Judicial System for the execution of the guilty party. Intelligence agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who founded the USCJS) from the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly tries to divert Phillips into his private circle, but the SS agent escapes after seeing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends in Core Tracker. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly. "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first in a series of sci-fi / action hybrids run by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment, a powerhouse of action films in the 1990s. Other Pepin films include "Hologram Man," "T-Force," "The Silencer," and "Dark Breed." Pepin films usually start with a big action sequence that takes about 10 minutes before the action can be triggered. The script for this movie contains some storylines? It's never clear what the plot is that the heroes are actually trying to stop. As far as acting is concerned, Don "The Dragon" Wilson may be tough, but can not work for beans with little charisma. His co-stars are much better. The best bet of the film are the action scenes that throw impressive artillery fire, an enormous body count and not just one, but three moments in which a vehicle flies through the air, hits and explodes the ground. The visual effects are limited on the cheap side and the music score is restrained and shrill.
