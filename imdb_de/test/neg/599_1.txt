I would have given this LESS than 1, if it were possible. The entire film should lie on the floor of the tailor shop. What a miserable waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... put together the most beautiful cast you can find (which, of course, is in direct proportion to the talent they lack) ... throw together the thinnest plot you can dig ... and Viola! A hideous piece of garbage that the director and / or producer should be ashamed to give their name. How much BAD can the horror genre get? And do not use "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many great low-budget movies ... in fact, some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget. If you do not have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror movie, do not make a movie for God's sake !!!
