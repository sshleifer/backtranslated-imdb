I looked at the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of Bacon, I have to say that this film is a flawed, but ambitious version of the real story. While capturing the true horror of bacon and the murders, this film makes the following factual mistakes. 1. Bacon did not inject drugs at the scene, as shown in the movie. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and a pill-poppy who rarely took drugs via a syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived Bacon's massacre did not roll down the stairs and under the couch in the living room as shown in the movie. That would have been impossible. In real life, she hid under a bed, while Speck methodically eliminated his eight victims. 3. The film shows bacon as violent and brutal in the women, as soon as he meets them. Not true. In fact, bacon was initially calm and gentle, and reassured the women that he would not hurt them. That way he could tie any one of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker in which the movie portrays him. Robert Ressler, the FBI profiler, interviewed Bacon in the 1980s and said that Bacon not only knew why he had committed the murders, that he was not interested in why he wanted to know, and he could not know why. Bacon was known to be of sub-average intelligence and not the philosopher king who tells this film. If the story were not so tragic and terrible, the voice-over would be laughable. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is appropriately threatening and cold-blooded, though I do not think the real bacon was so violent. Undoubtedly, he was a very violent person under the influence, but he was also known to be a pretty straightforward cheater, allowing people to calm themselves from the victim. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as a surviving nurse is the best in the movie. She is a very good actress. If you are at all squeamish, you will not see this movie. It is very vivid and disturbing.
