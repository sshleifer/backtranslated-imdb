Hercules: The TV movie Hercules - A very twisted and blundered version of the story about the Greek superhero. Paul Telfer makes a good attempt to play this hero. Sean Astin renews his Sam Gamgee image by playing Lupine, a diced character, to make the whole thing a buddy movie image.

An unexpectedly good performance comes from Timothy Dalton (one of the smaller James Bonds) as Hercules's father Like Paris Hilton, something that has just repelled me: unfourtunetly, someone has distorted and mocked the original story into a sombre and sometimes incomprehensible story, and the special effects do not help, while the Hydra scene does justice to the original story, the Nemean Lion and the Harpies are just ... well paralyzed, I think the creatures and effects of the Power Rangers have come to my mind at least twice, and the Golden Hind felt fast and very computer-generated, and he got Cerberus out of my favorite parts of an original one very cool story: The film can not decide whether it is Greek, Roman or American, and he has almost ruined the original story, a classic epic straight to DVD. - C
