When this show first came to Disney, I started watching all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite shows in Disney, but this show somehow turned into something that is disturbing and disappointing. Take a look at some teenage shows. I have this garbage. The first season was very unique as it showed Sadie, who loved science, animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I do not like the second season because of Ben. He annoys me and pisses me the crap. The action in the second season is also shit and is just terrible
