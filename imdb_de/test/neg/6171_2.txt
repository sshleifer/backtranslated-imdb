I'm so disappointed in this movie that I can not express it. I was so excited when I started to watch this movie when I saw Mickey Rourke all in leather and played the Third Rock From The Sun kid like a psycho. I thought, wow, this is going to be a winner twisting the Natural Born Killer's style. And it got better. The production value was great, the direction was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great and the plot was good, the plot, well, what was it? About halfway through the movie, I pulled my hair out and yelled, "What the hell is going on here?" and I mean that literally? Nothing makes any sense at all. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhggg !!!!
