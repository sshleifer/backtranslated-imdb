This movie is on my list of the worst movies ever made. The story is broken and it's hard to understand what's going on or why the characters are acting. All movies have to have an inner logic, and this movie just does not have any - history makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana, who waste their talents in this film, are a crime. Faye Dunaway is lucky because she plays the victim and is killed early in the movie. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland has to be an amazing actor because he looks good despite bad direction and bad writing. His performance is believable and he manages to stay in character despite everything. <br /> <br /> If Lady Agatha Christie were alive, she would laugh! The movie is so bad!
