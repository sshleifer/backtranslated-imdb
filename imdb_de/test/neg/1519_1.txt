The premise of Bottom crossed with Fawlty Towers sounds great! Ade Edmonson & Rik Mayall, however, have managed to create a movie that hardly seems to slow down. Ten years ago, Rik Mayall's insane gaze and Ade's nonsense were funny, now they are just annoying. <br /> <br /> The movie had promises - though the worst hotel in the UK is not a new idea - but failed. The saving graces were competent performances by Simon (Spaced, Big Train), Pegg, and Helene Mathieu, and the movie is only 90 minutes long. Sorry guys, but you have really reached the bottom
