This film has some shortcomings, and most of these shortcomings are missing in everything that happens. Perhaps the best film showing the rudeness in Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie in which nothing happens and you do not care about anyone. Like life it starts, it moves and then it ends. A few humor attempts are made, but everything is very flat. An occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that he might be wasting his life doing something other than watching this movie and the one rock song they've bought and used in every single case of a good movie. This is free and repeats on Comedy Central because nobody has visited it, nobody wants to see it, and it's a bit better than dead air. Not to condemn with a faint praise, but the only rock song of the movie is worth listening to. Too bad that the movie is not worth seeing.
