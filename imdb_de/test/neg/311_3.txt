We were thrilled to rent this after reading a few reviews and finding it to be doing so well. Well, we brought it home and could not believe what we saw. It basically feels like it was written by a hardened perverted old man who could not help putting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime movie that lacks plot and humor. The main character is everywhere ... in a moment he is like an immature little child, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic and then a perverted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is the inappropriate sexual content. I have no problem with sex and dig out a movie that has good sexual energy, but this is only presented in an unpleasant way. Nipple briefs, close-ups of a girl step (many times) in white panties or bathing suit. It was completely out of place and it seemed as if the person writing it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We expected something of a mature nature, but we just looked at each other and asked what the hell that was. Apart from the wiggling of cartoon tits and bad dialogues. If you want to see some cartoon characters and step motives ... this is for you. If you are looking for something different, this movie was empty. The characters and dialogue were just irritating. <br /> <br />
