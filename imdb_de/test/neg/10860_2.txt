Quentin Tarantino was once a relatively successful filmmaker. Unfortunately, he does not only make horrible films, but also has names like these. <br /> <br /> A supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s, this lightens new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I enjoy it when in a movie a blouse falls off more than the next man, but even I felt nice of sleazy watching this. To use a word that I never thought I would do it is mysoginistic (you can not even spell it) Our point of view is not as damaging as a will. <br /> <br /> That's just awful. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror.
