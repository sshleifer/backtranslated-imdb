This is another notorious Mexican horror film: Although the Spanish-language original version is quite tame, the English version (prepared by Jerald Intrator) has included all sorts of blood and nudity that has similar roles in THE CURIOUS DR. HUMPP [1967/71] - and was, like the US version of this film, previously available on DVD via Something Weird / Image! <br /> <br /> I looked at the original first, and although it was not a big shock, it was pretty captivating - especially with a familiar act like this: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty to save the life of his mortally ill son; he even has a mighty, legged assistant (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who played a strikingly similar role - albeit in a more sinister vein - in THE CURSE OF THE CRYING WOMAN [1961]). I know that several Mexican films mixed horror with the genre "Lucha Libre" (wrestling), but I had never seen one myself; This element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are, perhaps thankfully, separated (that is, the wrestling sequences are performed competently, with some of the moves being extremely amusing). <br /> <br /> The son of the doctor turns into a monster (looks like The Incredible Hulk, whose mud was sprayed over his face!) after a monkey heart has been transplanted into him - but then, if this through Ms. Wrestler replaces a Komatosen, he stays that way and grows up with a pair of fangs (if he had not realistically turned into a transsexual ... though I think that would not have been very interesting) !! The climatic roof sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and gets killed by the police is reminiscent of THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942). However, my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the movie are when the doctor trying to comfort his son tells him that he will soon be healed, only to turn his back on tears soon - and also the impatient gaze Gives his crippled assistant (as the latter slowly stumbles into the car) as they try to chase the monster that escaped from the lab. The alternate nude scenes work for the movie (these were done by Cardona herself for a wilder Mexican version entitled "HORROR Y SEXO", but the reputation is largely due to the added material that exaggerated violent acts such as an eyeball, torn from his socket, a scalp, and even a person's head is torn off.There are also several graphical surgery operations, which, however, lead to embarrassment: While it became clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair Hands constantly holding an oxygen mask to the patient's face! <br /> <br /> The film is also supposed to be a loose remake of Cardona's own black and white horror movie DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but I did not see it I can not say how much of that was actually stolen for NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES ...
