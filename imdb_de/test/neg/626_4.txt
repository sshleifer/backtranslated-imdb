Irwin Allen's first adventure into the Star Spectacle was an All-Star Disaster. The history of humanity contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as blond Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon, Peter Lorre has been dining out as Nero on the scene for weeks, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as Marilyn Monroe's roadshow, these are just a few. <br /> <br /> The movie is also known as the last movie that showed all three Marx brothers, although they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is the confidante of Christopher Columbus, Groucho euchres the Indians of Manhattan Island as Peter Minuit, and most amazingly Harpo Marx is Sir Asaac Newton, who discovers gravity when an apple hits him on the bean. <br /> <br /> Keeping all these representations together is a story in which humankind itself is judged. A super H-bomb is to be discovered and released in the world population. It's coming on Judgment Day. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its proponents and critics. For the prosecutor speaks Old Scratch, who has produced with Vincent Price for centuries, the worst in humans. But man also has his good side, and who better than Ronald Colman can show the man from his most civilized side. Colman and Price argue in front of Cedric Hardwicke's The Judge. In these three persons you have some of the best speaking voices the English language has ever known. When the movie is with them and they bring out the exhibits for their case, it's a pleasure to hear them. When the focus is on each story, you want to scream in pain. <br /> <br /> What Irwin Allen went for, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately busy with some of these casting decisions? If it were a satire, it just will not come down to earth. <br /> <br /> This was Ronald Colman's farewell film, and though it's hardly anything I'd like to do, I do not think of a man who could have explained the reason for civilization any better. <br /> <br /> So, when you look at the history of humanity, you will go through some of the exhibits and keep every moment that the advocates put in front of the judge.
