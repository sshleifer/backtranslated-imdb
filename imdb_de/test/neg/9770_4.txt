I have a big fight. As a surreal story, this movie might have been great (as well as it's rated by some here), but mixed with the actors (director and relatives who are here for financial reasons I believe). .. although one calls this spectacle, it is not just part of the word, it gives it a new meaning! A whole new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in surreal movies (there are some that I really like, see for example the Japanese Strange Circus), you may be able to overlook the mistakes (see above) and enjoy it more. After all, there are great ideas! Lots of great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while we saw this (with a group of friends), almost all of us just could not stop laughing ... of course not the director's intention! Again, everyone has their own preferences, as you can see from the high rating of this film, but I would recommend the film only if you know what Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or is a fan of him!
