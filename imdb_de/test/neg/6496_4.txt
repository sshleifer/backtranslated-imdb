Most critics have written devastatingly about this Michalkov movie, but I wanted him to see himself. And unfortunately they are right. The film had the biggest budget in Russian film history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes that were apparently shot close to the Kremlin - but in the end it seems to be a nice, sweet nothingness. One could not believe that this director used to do masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the plot do not convince, neither Jane nor McCracken or Andrej. Only general Radlov worth mentioning. It stays on the surface all the time. Politically, it is for me a glorification of the army and especially of the Russian army with values ​​such as honor and duty. And after living in Siberia for at least half a year, my Russia is much more than what is portrayed in Michalkov's film. Regarding "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director as a 10-point movie without question, one of the best I've ever seen in my life, I was totally disappointed. We are sorry. Nevertheless, Michalkov's unique talent for delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there.
