How do I describe the horrors? !!! First of all, a few points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt - I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. <br /> <br /> Second, I forgive some scenes and plot points. However, it has no big story. <br /> <br /> After all, I do not like these kinds of art films anyway. <br /> <br /> This film was shot by proto-author Luis Bunuel He was surrealistic and Dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements that were critically popular in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surrealism was the art school that made things hyperrealistic, but often with a Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on the alleged first word of a child - Dada or father. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, it was also made by a group of communists (or as they preferred) term socialists). Bunuel and his group of other filmmakers and artists had worked on a series of symbolic ideas and problems in Spain and France between the wars. Dadaism and Surrealism influenced many artists - The Police (Doo doo doo dao da), poets Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (Floating Hats in Space), Salvador Dali (Melting Watches) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember most about this movie: A girl meets a cow; her eye is slashed by a razor; Clown men frolicking in a meadow. There is not much conspiracy, as I said, but then that must be the point. <br /> <br /> This was attacked as porn and would be back today. One of the trademarks of Surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.
