The photography is complete, the drama is pretty good, but in virtually every other section, the Greek tycoon is a bleak bore. The film is based on the love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis and is a shiny, but completely empty soap opera, as it can be found on TV all day. Viewers who like the entire "celebrity magazine culture" (paparazzi photographs and gossip stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find much appetite here. Those who prefer movies with a little more substance and craftsmanship and quirkiness will find the 107-minute runtime an ugly slap. American President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline) Bisset) work in Greece. Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), a ridiculously rich Greek shipping magnate, sees Liz at a party in his elegant mansion. Although both are married to another woman, there is a direct attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his yacht, Tomasis Liz announces his wishes. Some time later, President Cassidy is murdered on a beach walk. Liz is shocked and saddened by his death, but it does not take long for her to seek comfort in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasi. After all, the two are married and their love affair becomes a popular topic of conversation for the newspapers, magazines, photographers and jokers of the world. <br /> <br /> It's a little amusing what force the producers of this film have been doing to deny that it was a dramatization of Kennedy Onassis's story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the movie draws its inspiration from. Even Aristotle Onassis knew that the Greek tycoon had treated his love life in Hollywood (if rumors were to be believed, he actually had the hand to allow Anthony Quinn to play Tomasi!) J. Lee-Thompson is not really the right kind of director for this kind of movie? He is better suited for action foods like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex. but he leads the procedure with an uninspired professional appropriateness. Quinn is very visible as Tomasis; Bisset looks beautiful as an object of his wishes; Franciscus uses his toothy smile and a veneer of integrity to make a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but there is little the actors need to do at lower levels. Similarly, Tony Richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface finish as it moves from one exotic location to the next, but few scratches prove that there is nothing behind the film's glossy exterior.
