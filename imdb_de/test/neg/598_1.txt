This movie probably started with a good idea, but that was it. When I read the cover on Blockbuster, I thought it was promising, but it was based on the overall idea of ​​the film. The film started with a professor talking about how we can see creatures from other dimensions in the future. There was no explanation for how that would happen, but that was okay, I thought it would evolve in the movie. It was not In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with their tubes taped to their heads. Next to each are two attractive women. The men ask if they hear that or if they see it. We conclude that they believe they see ghosts or other creatures that appear invisible or hallucinate. The women do not see these creatures. That was good for the first five minutes, but this scene continues for a full hour. It is briefly interrupted by flashbacks that have no relation to the so-called "plot" of the film. We are also presented to a man in a lab coat and seemingly Middle Eastern terrorists. What is this about? We will never find out. The flashbacks make us believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform devilish experiments on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the film, the terrorists finally do what terrorists do? You blow up the lab, but why? What's the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many incoherent thoughts and ideas that there are too many to list, but another noteworthy aspect is the fact that the man in the lab and the terrorists step into the room throughout the movie and step out of the room and not only the young men try to escape or even leave the tables they are lying on, even though they are not strapped down! The creators of the film often bring cockroach cameo appearances, but we never know what that has to do with the storyline. I'm sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time I spend driving to the rental business and then looking at it. Take my advice. Do not rent it.
