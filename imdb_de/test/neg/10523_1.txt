Okay, we went along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explained to our son adopted from Russia that this was exaggerated acting and dramatization, so we could come to the dog who plays football (as he plays football). But the last scene, when the dog returns to its original owner, put my son over the edge and he cried for 15-20 minutes: "He was replaced !!!!" This from a basic child. I DO NOT recommend this movie to families who have adopted children. It shows adoption, orphanages, and adults badly - and in the end, though they win the game - the dog with whom the boy has become engaged - and that's too much. PLEASE be careful if you have adopted children, and take care of families with biological children, as the impression of adoptive children is not positive and paints a clich√© that is unhealthy and evil. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family reaction to this movie ...)
