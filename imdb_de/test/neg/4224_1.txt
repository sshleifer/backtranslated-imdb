A desperate attempt to make a science fiction thriller "Film Noir", but the film misses. It has no credible plot, some of the main characters were a joke (NOT Lars Bom, he's cool!). I would like to maximize the "Bandwidth Access Restriction". I finished it in principle, but went home feeling like I lost two hours of my life ...
