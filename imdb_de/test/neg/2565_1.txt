I do not know the rest of the viewers in this movie, but I'm dead tired of Steven Seagal movies. When Above the Law came out, it was a great action movie. Wahoo Now in Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal from Above the Law. I'm sick of seeing no character changes. It's the same character, over and over again. He has to change. This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. To call an action film is almost worth too much, because there are too few action scenes and they are far apart in the film. I suppose they wanted to do some drama, but it was a pointless attempt, since the movie is nothing more than the regular squinting Steven-Seagal that we've seen thousands of times before. Get a new look and lose the ponytail is all I have to say. I definitely can not recommend watching this movie in any way, eating anything, hell the principle that Seagal will do a great job.
