Some nameless aliens who were on a faraway ship from a distant planet sent the giant robot Kronos to steal the world of his energy. In Mexico, there is a prototype for opener, and if it proves successful, more will be sent. For this one Kronos, it would certainly take a long time to accomplish this task. <br /> <br /> For reasons I can not explain, the aliens can head the leading scientist John Emery, who telegraphs Kronos telepathically to him, first capturing first targets as Emery is later killed and the monster seemingly without Emery As a controller works well, the reason the aliens needed it at all is a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> In any case, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, who work under Emery, are not fooled by nature. And, of course, they have a plan for dealing with the angry metal giants. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect movie for the fifties. The bad guys are never seen to be out there just to undermine humanity. It's a perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be prepared for it in the future. <br /> <br /> The players look like they have an old time, as many clich√©s as the authors could write. It seems to me that Kronos is the kind of movie that Ed Wood has done with more care for a bigger budget.
