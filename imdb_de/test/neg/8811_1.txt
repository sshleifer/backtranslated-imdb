There were so many things that were wrong with this film, I have trouble getting them all to the point. What really bothers me, though, is that if Jigsaw was lying on the floor in the bathroom, what happens if Zep never shows up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before he got into the bathroom? Is Jigsaw just standing up and walking out? Could not the guy in the middle of the bathroom be a puzzle, but another part of Jigsaw's game? What if Zep kills wife and child, how does Jigsaw bring him the antidote to the poison when he's in the bathroom? Why is the doctor waiting until the last minute to finally cut off his foot? It was too late, it was past six and as far as he knew his wife and child had already been shot, it was not the best time for heroic deeds. These are just a few questions I had about the movie, but I miss something or all, as I have only seen the movie once. Please help!
