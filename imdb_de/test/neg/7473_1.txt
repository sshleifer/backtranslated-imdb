I saw this on a drive-in when I was nine years old. All I remember are a few scenes (the ones in which the main character Elle is being chased by a man in a mask) and are scared of spitting. If I see it now, my opinions have changed. It's a pathetic "horror" movie about a victim of Gloria Grahame (sad), who has to deal with a young, talentless girl Elle, who is sent there after her mother, the tramp, was beaten to death with a hammer (shown graphically). In the film, adolescents (actually actors in their 20s) are beaten, tortured, killed, starved to death, attacked with meat splitters, raped, etc. etc. The brutal killer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse. There is NOTHING to recommend about this crap. The plot is stupid, all dialogues are bad and action ... the less said, the better. How did this disease with a GP rating (now PG)? It would get an R now. Worthless. One last thing ... a truly repulsive turning point points to incest!
