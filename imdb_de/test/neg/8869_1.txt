I think I have a good sense of humor, but this "movie" made me stunned in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad it just could not have gotten worse. I did not even laugh at the sad jokes in this movie. I've seen and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this movie will always be the one I remember best - in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason someone wants to see this is if he wants to go into a coma for a short time. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever.
