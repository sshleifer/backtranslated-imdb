I'm sure the idea on paper looked good and I liked it the first time I heard about it. This movie often goes along and falls flat, and when I look at it, I want it to end. The beginning and end of the film of the bookend that Lou has asked a troublemaker is resourceful at best, though I found the great cop part humorous. However, I found little reason to laugh with the lower part of the script, which was thrown together for these two great comedians. I thought it would be a mistake to put her in a musical, and it smells like "Wizard of Oz" (with the songs and the black and white color format). I would recommend this movie only to any die-hard A & C fanatic. Everyone else will be disappointed and they have many better movies.
