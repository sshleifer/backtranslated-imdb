In all performances, this series has been made since the mid-forties. The cardboard boxes, the lunar kings with flashes sewn on their aprons, you know the drill. This is a Rocky Jones adventure in which the space cop deals with the intolerable Bitch Queen of the planet Offeecious, a Commie planet that does not join the United Planets. As the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that Offeecious is on a collision course with this other, vaguely Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to blow up the other guys instead of clearing their land. This leads to a moral of the effect of "The greatness of a nation is not in their own country, but in their people," which is brought home five or six times as part of the Climatic Talkfest. The constant Nasenrede of the BQ over "OffEEEEcious" relieved some serious space effects. Is this a TV show?
