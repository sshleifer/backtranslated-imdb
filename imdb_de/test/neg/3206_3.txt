Critters 4 starts and I quote "Somewhere in Kansas 1992" & a repeat of the last minutes of Critters 3 (1991), while Charlie McFadden's recurrent character (Don Keith Opper) shoots just the last two remaining Critter eggs The Universe, by which we know would extinguish the entire critter race, which violates an intergalactic zoological law or the like. Charge's bounty hunter friend Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Counselor Tetra. He is a high-ranking intergalactic council official and orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs, but to place them in a capsule that will soon land nearby. In fact, you land very quickly nearby. Charlie lays the eggs in, but he's also trapped in the capsule, which I suspect cryogenics will freeze him, since it's never really explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are "Somewhere in Saturn Quadrant 2045", where a salvage ship encounters the space-drifting capsule (the credits are barely finished & Critters 4 already steals all the ideas and scenes from Aliens (1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the stranger, anyway pod & try & earn some money from it. With the help of his crew, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe), the pod was successfully salvaged. They contact the intergalactic council and advisor Tetra to go to an abandoned space station where a trade in the pod and its contents is made. Tetra tells Rick explicitly not to open the pod. In a true horror movie tradition, Rick opens the pod, thaws out Charlie and the critter eggs that hatch, kill Rick and flee to the space station ... Co-Produced & Directed by Rupert Harvey I thought Critters 4 was a pretty useless movie, rounding off the critter series with a whimper instead of a bang. The script of Joseph Lyle & David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©d, the space station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a matter of hours. The protagonists have only neutralized escape routes early so they block the race against the time to save themselves, the constant arguing and arguing among the crew, the splitting of the people and the loser who becomes a hero and saves the day , Many plotters seem to come directly from aliens and it rips off Star Wars (1979) with a sticky garbage compressor scene. The characters are not better and you probably will not worry. While the other Critter films can not be described as Comedy Horror Part 4, it seems to be deadly throughout. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, uneventful and boring. It's over 30 minutes before the critter eggs hatch. After this short sequence it is almost the hour before their reunion. Why are you doing a critter movie? This can not be due to the expensive special effects, because they look like glove dolls anyway. How can a critter a few hours old operate an entire space station and give the earth a direction? How do they even know what the earth is? Why did Capatin Rick want to open the capsule at all? What is the scientist and a rubber-alien thing that is mentioned only once? Why does the intergalactic council want the Critters so much? Why send only four men? Why is this perfect-looking space station completely abandoned? Critters 4 looks cheap with threadbare, dark, unimaginative sets and even steals pictures of Android (1983) for ships and space scenes. Critters 4 was apparently so low that the filmmakers could not afford any optical effects from Android looking seriously outdated. Mostly only two critters are used, although some start to hatch more, but it's pretty late in the day when this happens. They are barely visible to most of the film, and the impact on them is the worst of the entire series. Forget about any blood or blood, as the Critters kill only two people during the 90-minute runtime. Acting is pretty bad, with Angela Bassett's exaggerated melodramatic response to some Critter eggs that are particularly worthy. If you look at Critters 4, it's such a cheap and unspectacular production as you might (can not) see. The demise of Critters 4 has finally saved the universe from the critter threat. Let's hope it saves us and our local video stores from the threat of Part 5 ...
