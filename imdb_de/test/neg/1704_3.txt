This movie, if done right, would have so much potential. Parody movies are always fun, and people like them because they are carefree, stupid and stupid, but fun. This movie was funny in some places, but it could have been a lot funnier. The acting itself was fine with all the actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seemed a bit empty, and my summary title says it all about the effects. No real green screens were used for this movie ... Backgrounds were added that just looked awful. No wonder this movie ran directly on DVD. It was not all a total loss, it is funny and will make you laugh (AT, usually not with).
