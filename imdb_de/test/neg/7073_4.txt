Teen Tamara (Jenna Dewan) has a hard time. She is ridiculed by all the popular "children" because they are shy, eloquent, frumpy and because of their interest in witchcraft. All football players and cheerleaders are particularly angry with her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school newspaper. In addition, her father is drunk, her mother is not around and she is secretly in love with her supporting English teacher (Matthew Marsden). The beloved children made a gruesome prank to humiliate them, accidentally kill them during a fight, bury the body in the forest, and make a pact to keep silent. To her shock, Tamara goes back to class the next day, seductively and uh, dressed to kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge on all involved. She also takes time out to get her sexually abusive pop to eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her English teacher by his wife (Claudette Mink), a school counselor, strictly mediocre. It can also be said that those in charge have seen such films as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987), and THE CRAFT (1996) because they include wholesale credits in all three of these superior films. There is something gore (a guy who cuts off his ear and tongue and then punctures the eyeball is probably the best piece), a nasty vomiting scene, and some fun insoles. Not a horrible movie, but not much originality either.
