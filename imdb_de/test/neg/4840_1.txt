The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer seldom plays in a bad movie. Of course there is a first time for everything. In many ways, this film proves that making Oaters is not as easy as we think, especially from foreign directors. The only one who got away with it was probably Sergio Leone, but even in his films something was missing that was indefinitely inherent in our American psyche and our panier. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda have helped. I can now see why they changed the original title from "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". This tells me that the producers and the director did not have a basic understanding of Western, except for the usual shoot'em-up scenes and violent themes. I think we can say the same thing about American directors trying to shoot a Polish film while failing miserably.
