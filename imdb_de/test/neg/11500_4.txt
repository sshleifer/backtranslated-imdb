Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and rightly so, so I'm excited to see one of their films. Ollie recovers from a broken leg at the hospital, and with nothing to do, Stan decides to visit him and bring him boiled eggs and nuts instead of sweets. Chaos starts with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's thigh string and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out of the window, cling to it, and yank Ollie at the ceiling. As the situation calms down, Stan puts on Ollie's clothes while the doctor wants both of them to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a dormant drug It's not great, but what you can say is done with a car in front of a big screen filled with a sympathetic slapstick and not too bad (albeit repetitive and somewhat predictable) classic comedy classic it is a black and white film Interesting: Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were the # 7 comedians comedian.
