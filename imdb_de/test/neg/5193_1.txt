While the film has a salvation feature, namely some eye-catching shots, z. the recording of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the raft, or the scene in which the boats left the village (apparently influenced by the scene when the warships neared the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon") more photographic than cinematographic and would rather have been hung on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in an embarrassingly slow film that lasts 162 minutes and suffers from terrible conversation. Drama, unimaginative symbolism and strong stylization. This is the first movie I saw of Angelopoulos, and his reputation preceded him. I expected a lot better, but I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I do not expect my way of seeing other director's work in the future. The four friends I visited agreed.
