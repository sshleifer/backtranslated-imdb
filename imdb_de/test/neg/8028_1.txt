<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001 and watched for about 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that viewing a blank screen would be appealing in comparison. There was not a single person in the cast who would have shed a tear for me if hell had opened and the whole group had swallowed them. <br /> <br /> So I sent an email to all my friends and I warn relatives, and I take the time to urge everyone who sees this note to avoid this movie like the plague! I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but NEVER that bad.
