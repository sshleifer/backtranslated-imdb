In this movie, Gary Oldman plays a defender who used to be a prosecutor. He is a bit tormented, but more or less plays a normal guy than any figurative or literal monster. Funny thing is that he does not quite get it right. I think you can not get quite normal from there. Kevin Bacon was scary enough. The scene in the park was way too long and too scared. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from another film, though Miss Young was running well the rest of the time. This film suffers from a strangeness that tries to cover up the predictability. And fail. Do not bother.
