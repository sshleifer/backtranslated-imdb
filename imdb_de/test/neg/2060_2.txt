This movie is interesting for the fans of the famous rock group "The Band", in which the singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. It looks to me like the movie might have been filmed some years before 75, judging Richard's gaze. Interestingly, Jones later played with Levon The Band in a much better movie "Coal Miner's Daughter". Anyway, you really need a special reason to survive this tough art movie. Unfortunately, the famously sensitive Manuel would commit suicide. I've never heard of how he ended up in a movie. Four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad movie "Man Outside".
