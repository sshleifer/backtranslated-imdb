Films like these give a bad name to independent films! This is just a boring compilation of Vingettes, without any structure. I would not be surprised if the scriptwriter were completely pitted. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, check out Half Baked. It's not a winner, but at least it made me laugh. The movie was obviously filmed with a micro budget. Each scene takes place either in a house, in an apartment or outdoors. If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would have ignored the budget of the film (as in the films of Edward Burns), but this is obviously not the case this time. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro from "A Bronx Tale" when I say, "There is nothing in the world worse than wasted talent." Everyone in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented artists! And all were in much better movies. The actors give it all, but with such a lame script they could not go too far. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And of course there was the short strip club scene at the beginning, which I also found appealing. <br /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists. Many movies are terrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was the intent of "Bongwater"? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
