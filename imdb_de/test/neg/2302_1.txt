I rented this movie hoping to learn about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the beginnings of its independence from Belgian rule. I was very pleased to get acquainted with the characters of his story, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule, the political motives behind the individual, the reasons for Belgium's decision to grant its independence to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States States and the former USSR were involved. Unfortunately, all my questions remained largely unanswered. I believe this movie was made by people who, through a temporary familiarity with the history of the DRC's struggle for freedom, saw a story full of drama and emotion and decided to take advantage of it. Then they tried to put all the dramatic points into action, briefly filling them with dialogue, going to the set and shooting it. I could be wrong, but when it does, it's even sadder, because then the creators just have to be too committed to anything, and in the end, they've gone over all the details to create a complete story. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the film can be a timeline of statements and facts printed on screen. The film goes through every major event, telling the viewer the main idea of ​​what's going on, and completely smoothing out the actual details to convey the big things. For example, there is the scene where Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by Mobutu. In the situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: one who sympathizes with Lumumba, one who denigrates Lumumba, and one who stands in the middle who sympathizes and yet obeys commands. Accordingly, there are three soldiers who speak in the scene and express lines that show their point of view unadorned. To avoid dealing with the actual tensions that create these opposing views, scriptwriters have simply inserted random shooting. More and more army men are appearing, and at the end, they are all beating together. This is the extent of the reflectivity of the film. Most of the time, each character just gives up his basic motives, the other characters react with theirs, and that's it. There is hardly anything to be told through actions; Even the things they say indicate the point of pain. It is hard to believe that the people represented have actually behaved like that. In the tendency of this directness, things like political tensions between the factions are reduced to simply recognizing the fact - we never know what these factions are, what they fight for, their power, basically anything except that they exist. The characters are also one-dimensional and flat; Unfortunately, I do not know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately dedicated to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after about an hour of the movie, I did not trust him to say so. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, like many developing countries, has a complicated and important history, especially in the pre and post independence era. However, telling these stories will not be useful unless the complexity of the situations is recognized. Lumumba does not pay attention to these details and tells the viewer little except the most general outlines.
