As with many movies with young children, this starts "really cute" and sympathetic ... and then turns into the opposite after about half an hour. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the case here This time travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a child who really knows him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... The kid "Rusty" is a smart guy, and Willis Rusty has grown up now, as "Russell" gets abusive with his standing Scream. This is entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> The young Breslin became a very good child actor. He has been involved in a number of films, including "The Cat In The Hat," opposite a more well-known child actor: Dakota Fanning. All in all a disappointing movie, especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released.
