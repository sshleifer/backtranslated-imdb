I did not know that if I subscribed to the "All Pay Channel" package on Direct TV, I would come across such a movie. It came right after another movie we watched ... and I was a teenager in 1981, so I'm not sure where I was back then ... but I missed that movie. <br /> <br /> Me too I can not believe we left it. It's kind of weird because you're back in the time machine in the early '80s ... but I think even then that would have been a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! ET was in some ways "cute," but not outrageously sweet ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this, I come to IMDb to see what others are saying. I'm blown away that this thing was nominated! Wow ... the movie industry has been well advanced since the 80's! Well ... it showed some old actors ... by the way, that was the other thing that I was surprised about ... the lineup ... not a bunch of no-names ... but some real actors / actresses , Must have been in her drug days! Anyway ... weird, interesting, bizarre and happy that they grew up!
