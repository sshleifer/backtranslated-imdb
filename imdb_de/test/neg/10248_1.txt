For connoisseurs of bad movies Galaxina is a real gem. With really dreadful dialogue, acting and directing, it's not a choice for people looking for a real movie. But as one of the most funniest films of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. Especially the scenes with the Harley Davidson worship motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes offer the possibility of a cheap laugh. Unfortunately, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really do not deliver, but since she plays an Android, you can probably apologize for acting. <br /> <br /> Bad movie lovers, do not miss this!
