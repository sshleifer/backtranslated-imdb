This home movie is basically scandalous nonsense, but you have to give them 3/10 to try. The blood is garbage, but the grandma who kills her is pretty funny, and I think the concept is good and the make-up is fine for a home movie. Fortunately, it was only 55 minutes, and in the end, the Fight Club is literally "Fight Club" (almost as trashy as the movie). Read this comment, do not watch the movie.
