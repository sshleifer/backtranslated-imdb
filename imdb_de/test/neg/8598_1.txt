The inglorious so-called comedy I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not a stain on the naturalism of the hilarious Twin Town. <br /> <br /> Vegas I, as usual, but this script is so bleak Sun well predictable English in the worst way (the English movies have all been horrible in recent years) Ireland has at least lived up to its obligations, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 have great movies and Wales has Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days of Dolwyn , Torchwood, Doctor Who, and Under Milk Wood, etc. <br /> <br /> The comedy is paint by numbers, the actors are dead men who go because there is no characterization and no originality, and it's just so funny England is falling, no matter how many dark movies they produce in the North. It is the old class system that destroys English films. The Oxbridge graduates spew endless clich√© scripts on working-class workers they've never lived with. It is pathetic. Monty Python was not funny, not even Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> Let guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, write Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or their own dialogues and forget that the archaic failed class system allows the class people and the real talent to work through the system Correctly come, take over the writing and the British and English film industry will rise again.
