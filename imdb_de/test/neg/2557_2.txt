I thought maybe a movie that praised a cast of Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig, and Harry Andrews might be worth a look. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Extremely overbearing nonsense from start to finish, with both O'Toole and York acting wildly. I have looked at it twice and still have no idea what it is about. I feel O'Toole plays the laird of a Scottish castle that has a drinking problem and wants to relive the childhood games with its sister (York). He also barks sourly. But other than that, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redemption function. I can only assume that the actors and the director were blackmailed to make this dreary, unimaginative, dizzying Piffel. Clear a waste of the time of a talented cast and a director. Ridiculous.
