This whimsical and eye-catching movie is the story of a confused dentist starting his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the hinterland and back country of Patagonia. Fergus, from Northern Ireland via New Jersey, sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance, approaching with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist. This is fun as his great plans unravel and disintegrate as he goes from disaster to debacle in the Patagonian hinterland on the back of a bespoke motorcycle or his mobile tooth unit. We will not meet his wife or the wealthy philanthropist who sponsors the unfortunate mission, but we get a solid account of Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed by his highly credible performance as a baffled dentist revered by the innocent but sexy, 18-year-old female lead taking part in the * ahem * ride. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone and I can understand why it was not crowded by the suits. It's a low budget, sometimes charming, always disarming, mildly amusing and instantly forgotten film that starts with low expectations and is almost successful.
