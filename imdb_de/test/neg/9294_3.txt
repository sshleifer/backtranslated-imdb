A very sensitive topic - a 15-year-old girl abandoned as a baby by the mother and visiting her is still ignored, raped by her mother's boyfriend and becomes pregnant. There was not enough depth of this situation displayed. Too much time is spent on the hunt with the truckers who transport the baby. (Interestingly, this baby with asthma - you never see it crying - except once - fed, changed diapers throughout trucking.) I would have liked to see more connections, more attention to the fact that this girl was a minor - this would have have to get up in court immediately. <br /> <br /> And that was a true story! It deserves a better story than that !! <br /> <br /> If the topic had not been, I would have brought this to a rating of 0 closer. I rented it from the library. Only later did I find out that this is a movie made for television. <br /> <br /> well
