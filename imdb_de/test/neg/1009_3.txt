This film was not credible for two reasons. One, not a mayor of a big city, and New York is certainly as important as it gets. Would allow a district in its city to live in such a violent place to live there; especially for voters who have a lot to say about their future job security. All the victims in the film were mostly older, Jewish or defenseless. At the age of 62, I've never seen a movie that showed respect for authority like in this movie. Even "Escape from New York", which was fictional, d. H. They told you that this is science fiction, do not resort to so much violence. In this film, most of the older victims were victims and had weapons but were unwilling to use them. Also in this movie and I have not seen the previous two is more lawless than the "Escape" movie. Second, as far as my research shows, gangs have never been as cooperative as the movie means to them. On the one hand, they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area, and he is killed. However, when the heroes shoot at the local gang bangers, the next gang is greeted with open arms. External gang members are always considered outsiders and stopped. We're supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to get involved. Why did the outer gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang came from outside to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail, and why do other inmates ask for permission to attack Bronson's character? This was not a great movie and I could go on, but I will not do it.
