As a huge streetfighter fan and enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I was really looking forward to this movie! <br /> <br /> However, it seemed that the film had no idea of ​​direction or purpose. Most of the characters I could not connect to were simply missing out on the intense action that made the other Street Fighter movie so superior. <br /> <br /> There are some good points, but the animation is excellent !!!
