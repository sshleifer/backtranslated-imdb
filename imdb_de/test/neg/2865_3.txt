I really enjoyed several GÃ©rard Depardieu films and expected that I would enjoy this movie much more than me. The main reason was that I just did not find the movie very interesting or funny - so he did not hold my interest. Although he does NOT sleep with his headstrong daughter, the notion that she is lying telling everyone that he is her much older lover is simply icky! Yes, I know that there is no incest, and I know that nobody around her knows that he really is her father, but I have found that any child who disregards her father as a sexual preference is too happy and does not make the movie really funny. Besides, I really did not like this little brat very much. Apart from her lies, she seemed very naughty and responsible. I would have preferred it if she somehow got her "come-up" and was punished because I simply did not like her.
