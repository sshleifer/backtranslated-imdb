This type of film is loved by 50-year-old school teachers and people who are aware of social issues but have no idea. The actors - I think they're all amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of clich√©s and stupidities that they can not save it. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is the school cabaret The kids are working - bringing all of your worst memories back to school from drama classes. The lyrics to one of the songs in a quick translation at 2:30 in the morning is something like this: "I am the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
