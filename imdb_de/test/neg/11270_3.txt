I have seen almost all Kurosawa films and dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, this is a rather average to bad movie. The plot shows two warring brothers - for whom I was not particularly interested - and it is very confusing who is allied with whom. The music and cinematography are pretty good, but the special effects are sometimes terrible - rubber heads fly off with about the same realism as the average high school game! In addition to these complaints, the film's end is completely destroyed, undermining the entire image. It turns out that the end is not true, but was completely "faked". What is the meaning of it? If you have seen this movie, you will understand that there are MANY better movies, so do not give up!
