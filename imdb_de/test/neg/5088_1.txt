River Queen's record player should have been fired, there's no excuse for bad recordings on set today. Murmuring voices were the end result, and the cinematography was at best fair to average. The story has potential, and I'm sorry for the foreign actors who must have known they made a turkey during the shoot. It's obvious the film suffered from the El-Cheapo-budget syndrome, and the scene in which Temuera develops indoors while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words. <br /> <br /> I noticed some shortcuts on the Maori protocol page, but that was probably due to movie length, time restrictions, etc. All in all, I was not impressed with this movie, the Whanganui River has many nice spots, but this film gives us a cold, sad and claustrophobic image, without the beauty. The movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less confusion on the screen, better sound recordings, and more thought had to be given to what moviegoers would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Take care of all involved because they must have completed a very difficult shoot. I have the greatest appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film. Unfortunately, I did not like this movie.
