First of all, it's a rip-off of the Japanese movie Battle Royal, except that the only thing missing is what made BR unique, the balls. It's a weak satire at best, and as far as the real TV phenomena are concerned, everyone is trying to say how twisted and stupid this genre can be. Why was this movie made?
