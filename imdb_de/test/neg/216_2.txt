How do you take a cast of seasoned, well-known actors and create a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six employees of an armored vehicle business decide to steal even a large cash delivery. But the way they start with their plans first, everything goes quickly. With an action like this one might think it could not be that bad, at least for an action movie. In the first 40 minutes or more of this movie, however, we see 6 normal, everyday types. They joke, they laugh, drink some drinks, etc. Then we suddenly find out that they are planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty (Columbus Short) is drawn into the system because of the cold, cruel world, though he is an excellent veteran, a nice guy and a dependable co-worker. Oh my God! In the last 40 minutes of the movie, these former regular boys are almost all turned into money-mad psychos ready to slaughter each other for money. In the final scenes, Mike (Matt Dillon) rages for no other reason than killing his former friend. The viewer has no indication before this end that these men are so ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's absolutely incredible and "B movie" is almost too nice for this kind of kitschy plot. I would say, do not waste your time - too bad that nobody gave the same advice to Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward before taking this picture.
