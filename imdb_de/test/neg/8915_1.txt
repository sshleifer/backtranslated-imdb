At the beginning I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But the last movies make me wonder if he's still trying? His latest films show almost no effort by Seagal. In Out of Reach, it's too obvious that his lines are dubbed. , What Seagal does in this movie is not just a slap in the face for his fans, but even more for Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second scene, as he prepares to plunge into the drug dealer's penthouse to steal the jewels and money, he shows he's setting up the gun and hanging it on a neon sign. You could say to yourself, "Yah, what does that have to do with Van Damme?" Well, this scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called Orden. Rent them both, look at both, compare them and you will lose respect for Seagal. Today You was not just garbage, it was an insult too. Seagal's aikido movements are still good, but why is not he doing great movies like Marked for Death or About the Law? He still has the moves and the attitude. I just wonder: why Seagal, why? In his recent films, there are such idiotic scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, and moreover, such idiotic storylines. I hope that the upcoming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because this last chain of films that he has made, especially Today Today Die, really made me wonder if he had that It's up to you to shoot great action movies like Double Team. Please do not watch this movie if you do not hate Seagal. If you love his films, do not look at them, it will make you question your future in the action movie genre.
