If there was justice in the cinematic universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never again be allowed to enter a movie. It seems inconceivable that anyone who has spent two full decades in a cutting room where LS began his film career could be so completely free from any tempo or dramatic staging, but this film is damning evidence. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, it's fascinating. From the opening scene, in which a nurse is dressed in a costume suitable only for a pornographic film or a sketch in a Mexican variety show, the viewer must see how deep he can go. The answer is not far away as in the next scene we move to a funeral home where the next stunning fashion statement appears in a sexy black dress with no shoulders worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressively inappropriate costumes are not the only flaw in the movie. Dialogue is a treat for connoisseurs of bad writing. "You make my tears in wine," is a sampling. The actor deserves an Oscar because he delivered it with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces every cheeseball scene with possibly the slightest soundtrack ever recorded, which in the dialogue scenes is embarrassingly maudlinish groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transitional scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason, and story beats sound like a broken trowel. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget a "horror movie". Our characters are in a forest in which Dr. Chopper and his two "scary" executioners lurk, who are supposed to be a kind of Franken creature, but look just like Valley Girls whose blood is spotted under their Supercut shags. To be honest, I've seen a scary makeover by eight-year-olds who did tricks on Halloween. And again, we smell the costume designer's evil-smelling handiwork, as Valley Ghoul One claims in a pseudo-Victorian polyblend tunic, while her buddy wears an unassuming ensemble in the lesser-known corners of the 1980s Years could have been almost in vogue. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper makes the great fashion statement, but looks like a Crisco cowboy, who has lost his way in the woods on his big black Harley and is covered from head to toe with black S & M leather with zipper. <br /> <br /> If this sounds intriguing, then everything means finding out. There are many side-by-side dialogues (like the precious "elephant cemetery scene" or the "intellectual" discourse about Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be fair, cinematography is good, considering what you've come up with in front of the camera, and the actors are trying (with extremely extreme results) out of a clump of clich√©s and mental illnesses something to do. You have to wonder if they really were really stupid or just desperately desperate not to go off the set after catching a glimpse of the ridiculous-looking villains with their 99-cent-store weapons.
