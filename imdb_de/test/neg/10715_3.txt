Fun With Dick and Jane could not talk on so many levels. There were loose ends to writing, for example, it seems that one of the major conflicts is the charge of Jim Carrey's character, Dict Harper, but the authors never pursue that particular conflict. Basically, the story is weak and usually not funny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but frankly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might just as well have been there for her performance, because she was not that funny either. This is just another example of Hollywood franchise actors having a lousy unoriginal story.
