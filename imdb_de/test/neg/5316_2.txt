Get Shorty was an excellent movie. It was funny and had the perfect balance between very funny acting and a serious conspiracy. Be Cool is like a cheap knock-off trying to make a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it like he's a bored movie manager, not a bored movie manager who used to be a shylock. Uma Thurman, who is great in almost every role she has ever played, seems tense and confused. Should she be dark or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. Otherwise, just add any film cliché you can imagine. A well-trained rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, a clumsy gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart and soul and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a black guy with wannabe Vaughn and a stupid cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only fun part was the rock that invented its own new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard performer wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the conspiracy: it makes no sense. Get Shorty was smart when Chili played one group against another and was at the top. But this movie tries that with around a million different characters. And even Chili does not seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty are warned: This is a very different, very bad movie.
