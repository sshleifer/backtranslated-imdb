Have just seen this movie for the first time after buying on DVD <br /> <br /> It is a cheap attempt to redeem the two Conan movies. Unfortunately, this movie did not seem to have the same budget as the Conan movies, and so some sets and effects are not so flashy and some scenes are hurried. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is alright, but unfortunately she could not do anything with a gun attached to her head. <br /> <br /> Arnie's supporting role looked like it was a favor for director Fleischer, who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie was not confident that he would continue with headlines like Predator, Total Recall, T2, and so on. <br /> <br /> Some of the talisman female guardians at the beginning of the movie looked like they had difficulty picking up their swords and the looks on their faces suggested that they had fun making this movie. I could not be so happy if I was fighting for my life. Apart from the fact that this film needed very little concentration to look at him, and was mildly entertaining. I have seen much worse. Two stars
