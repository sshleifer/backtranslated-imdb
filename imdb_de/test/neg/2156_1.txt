I love a good western movie, but that was more like watching a stage play or show at the local street carnival show. I could only stand 38 minutes hoping that it would improve, but it just got worse and I had to finish it. Each actor gave the lines as if he were reading directly from the script or playing cards. The lines and actions were too predictable, not as if it were a natural event or a natural conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses who play Native American sisters could have played non-native roles and should have done so. The wardrobe for the Native Americans could have looked better and a bit more authentic. If I decide to see it with friends in the future, I will do so, not with the expectations of a good Western, but with the expectations of an amateur comedy.
