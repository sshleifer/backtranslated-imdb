I saw this on the sci-fi channel, so I knew it would be bad at first, but I was surprised how much worse it was than expected. The CG effects on the kite were horrible even for the sci-fi channel and the writing was pathetic. I could not say if that was supposed to be as stupid as a joke or if it just happened. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it's so horrible that it's almost funny. Especially the part in which Patrick Swayze's knight character goes home to his Knight father, who has retired after losing his legs and now sits in his armor only to let the audience know that he was a knight. Most of the film focuses on a giant dragon egg that hatches itself into a not-so-big baby dragon with some of the worst CGIs I've ever seen. That was just terrible.
