This unintentionally amusing 1980s TV movie is based on the premise that Donna Mills (in a mostly horrible dressing room) bombshell is a neglected housewife who longs for her sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by fantasizing about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she encounters, finally giving in to her fantasies and taking a bit of aloofness even though she really just wants to kindle the flames of passion with her boring husband James Brolin. <br /> <br /> There are many ridiculous aspects in this film, Mills 'first foray into coproduction (later, after she had dismissed Knots Landing, she found great success as a trashy television movie queen.) In most of the' 90s Most of the time they played in melodramas, which appeared in most issues of the week. She usually played a victim, and she was determined to wash the hands of the wonderfully evil and entertaining spoiler she had been playing on knots for so long. The funniest are the long-drawn-out fantasy sequences that are filmed as if they were softcore porn (wind and smoke machines, backlighting, porno music), but since this is a network television movie, the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all. In the most amusing (and bizarre) scene, Mills walks among the spiky punks (complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack) through the wild downtown. <br /> <br /> Less ridiculous is the terrible dialogue cardboard characters have to force (pity on poor Cicely Tyson as a compulsory psychoanalyst) or Veronica Cartwright as a compulsory best friend, or even James Babolin, with this day-time soap style clenched fist.) Of course, as in all these films, we learn that all problems can be solved through psychotherapy and the film then just becomes stupid. We briefly examine the reasons for Mills "shocking" behavior (as if it could not just be that way that she wants a good nub!).
