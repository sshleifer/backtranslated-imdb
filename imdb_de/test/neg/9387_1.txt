With NBC's "Thank God You're Here", the network tries to capture the success of the IMC sitcom "Who is Line Anyway?" To replicate from ABC. In the moderator, Drew Carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast asked to improvise scenes of some sort. On the NBC show, Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who have to improvise through various scenes, all of which begin with "Thank God You're Here." It takes far too seriously (why must the viewer be reminded repeatedly that the actors have never seen the sets before), both co-presenters seem to be less enthusiastic. After seeing the actors' uninterrupted, entertaining attempts to make some laughter, I wonder if the live audience really laughs, what happens, or even improvises. It can be assumed that this time window filler is very short-lived.
