This is one of the most terrifying "scary" movies I've seen in a while. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction for this movie. The Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks of the Land of the Lost and the creature of the Black Lagoon. In addition, they should have used someone who was a little smaller, since the legend's chupacabra is much smaller. All in all, the movie was so bad that it was funny. Why could bullets and electric shocks not stop the Chupacabra, but Captain Kickboxing's daughter OK? See if you are ill at home or feel bad and need a good laugh.
