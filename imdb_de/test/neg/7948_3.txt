Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Assault is a debacle. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a dilapidated police station in Detroit (If the Detroit site warms you up Robocop and the Fuzzies stop now, it could easily have been Topeka in the opening speech and nothing would have changed.) In fact, the last piece would not have changed in the forest it would have made more sense.) Around them are our evil ones; corrupt police. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you think. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy this weekend? Of course these are not ordinary bulls. These guys are right on the cover of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yes, we have armor. Helicopter; Laser sights; Night vision goggles work. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. Members / Special Forces armed to the teeth verses 4 policemen (drunk, although it is New Year), 2 girls in festive dresses and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> How do our heroes defend themselves? The truth is that they can not. They should all be dead within ten minutes. (Not to mention that the characters inside have the annoying habit of walking past the windows.) Now, an illogical scenario is no reason to swivel a movie completely. a B-style action movie. With the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed to be a strange relief. (At least I hope they did) <br /> <br /> While Ja-Rules and Leguizamo's characters are bad enough. It's Aisha Hinds minstrel show that takes the cake. Rarely on the modern screen has a rather stereotypical African-American character emerged. Her performance is similar to a fratished boy in Blackface and Drag Acting Ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original Assault, a gang member picks up an ice cream truck and drives around the neighborhood, shooting little girls in the head. I've had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks ever since. After this attack I have a completely rational fear of remakes.
