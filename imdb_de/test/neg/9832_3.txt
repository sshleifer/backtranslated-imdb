The girl in the love lane: 3 of 10: Homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well-known phenomenon. There are many dissertations from film schools on hidden subtexts in films like Top Gun and Spartacus. The girl in Lover's track certainly fits the homoerotic trope. In fact, it is so blatant and exaggerated even MST3K, who rarely finds such things in his riffing, just can not avoid it. <br /> <br /> The film is about two drifters. One is a rich kid (Lowell Brown) who ran out of the house with a hundred bucks and no road, the other is a professional hobo (Brett Halsey). The hobo rescues the child from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a snack bar, a pool and a whorehouse. Our drifter scholar gets a second look from the restaurant's waitress (Joyce Meadows as a title girl in Lovers Lane), who has clearly passed the age of her constituency and whose only other perspective is the sinister Jack Elam making a Steve Buscemi impression Superficially, this seems to be a strange movie for MST3K treatment. While the cast is too old for the characters they play, the acting is actually pretty good, with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam delivering solid performances. The story is low, but barely The Robot vs.. Aztec mummy material and production values ​​are cheap but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> It's the weird Batman and his gay undercurrents that make this movie both horrible and weird. Halsey's outright objections to the kids' attempts to be misplaced in the Whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to comply with that To tie the waitress (or at least to get past the first base), and the dozens of glances between him and the child; a hand on the shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, the blowing out of dates with the girl so that he and the child can shave. You do not have to be Freud to find out this undercurrent.
