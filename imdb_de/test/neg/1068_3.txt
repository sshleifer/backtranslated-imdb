This movie made me think ... about how I could write something about it without personally disciplining the director and all the actors I'm proud of as an Australian, because I actually went out and made a movie. <Br /> <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story .... <br /> <br /> Yesterday I found this DVD in my local rental business and had vague memories of the reviews at the time of the release, so I thought I would give go. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I've decided to see the 'peculiarities' before watching the actual movie, not something I usually do. The 'Making of' was turned off halfway because I had enough wreaths. Are not we so wonderful at putting together such a tough movie with such a raw script setting? <br /> <br /> The movie? Pooh. Full of clich√©s and pathetic character development. The actors? Well done guys, you are Aussies and I applaud you. And just as a Footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them, unfortunately you did NOT have a great script to work with. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie has trivialized so many of the themes it seemed to cover. I have seen many reviews here that relate to it being just a soap. Agreed. <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me, if I do not say it right), I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes, we know that things like incest do happen, but I find it really hard to applaud a movie that does not contain a single piece of joy. I think a director has a responsibility to put it somewhere. Otherwise, the film is just about YOU and YOUR feelings, they made it for yourself, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> Which in my opinion is the basis for why this movie is not so great. The peculiarities mention that the director wrote the script in a 36-hour session, the day after he tried to end his own life. Well, it may have been cathartic to him, but the film smells of indulgence if you know the story of why it was written. "I feel terrible, I will write a film about how I feel awful". (Note: I read the interview with Andrew Urban and understand why Thalluri had to write something to help him with his own problems, but I believe there is a line in the film that can not be crossed - the line, making a film out of your own emotional needs, and I feel like this was unintentionally happening here. <br /> <br /> In his opinion, the director had no technical experience, and that does not make the movie sad anymore than one year twelve media project. <br /> <br /> Regarding the recommendations that this film should be studied at school or that all teenagers should see it - not sure because there is a very dangerous line in the end. I was also in a place where I thought that someone who does not have to face life anymore is lucky, but as an adult, I'm worried that this line could affect a young viewer Being in a vulnerable area was a state of mind. Could be there to promote the discussion, but it also reflects no possibility of salvation or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost means there will be more sadness. <br /> <br /> I did not see Elephant, but I could easily find it, considering all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> Nothing personal here, people, I hope you can someday make another movie, and we all have to start somewhere. Forgive me if I'm too hard. I am glad that you are proud of what you have created and what is important in the end. It is not a movie that I would recommend. <br /> <br /> Oh, I like the way the timeframes often collided, thought that would be an interesting way to film. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing "It's the quiet ones you have to watch" - we already know that.
