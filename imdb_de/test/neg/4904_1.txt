A horribly bad movie allegedly reporting a croupier who wants to become a writer and the incidents that make up casino life. Moves at a snail's pace. Dull, dull, dull! Practically everything about this film is amateurish and unconvincing - with one very notable exception: the performance of Clive Owen, who is like a Rolls Royce purring through a slum. Advice for the casino sequences was reportedly given by a specialist, but according to the way they are handled, the director completely ignored them. While the casino staff may be a different race than the rest of the world, they are nowhere near as witty and down to earth as the characters in this script. Chances and endings are thrown into the script to give it a convincing background, which would, however, have been noted in a list on a cocktail napkin. For anyone earning a living in the casino business (as the writer has been doing for forty years!), This is a paltry representation of his world that NEVER had that in the most remote and darkest areas of England! A horrible, insulting mess of a movie trotting and trotting to an idiotic and unconvincing end. American critics loved it.
