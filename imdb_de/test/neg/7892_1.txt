All right, let it break down. Why is this movie one of the worst ever? Because there are so many answers to this question, I have a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? The role with the Arab? It's just awful, I did not really care about all White racism, but when they did that with the Arab, I wanted the names of all the authors. It really is not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not even funny what my first interpretation was. I hope that the person who staged this movie does not commit suicide, but it is likely that I see no other options. Never watch this movie.
