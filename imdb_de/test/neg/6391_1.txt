I never intended to write a review of this movie. Actually, I was just looking for the name of the movie's star and then I started reading reviews. I think I will never learn it. This movie is terrible! I will not justify my comments with certain reasons, because I find it really hard to believe that anyone with all tastes really likes it. A guilty pleasure? Okay, I think. But a movie that is so bad and has wasted so much talent (Caine, Gelbart, and Donen) is a cause for mourning, not a pleasant distraction. A low point for anyone except perhaps Bologna, who has to sit at night to find out which bomb was THE bomb that destroyed his career.
