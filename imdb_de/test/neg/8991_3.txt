The film begins in Latvia shortly after the First World War. As a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied a large part of Russia during that time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism, and the troops were supposed to be there to defend the interests of their nations. Sometimes, however, they flew with missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, because the participating nations really wanted to win the "whites." The whites, however, were deeply fractionated - some wanted the return of a Czar, some wanted a republic and some wanted something in between. Because of these mixed goals and the lack of real engagement of foreign armies, the entire expedition was doomed to fail and left the USSR after only a year or two. However, I did NOT know that German troops were involved as well. This surprised me because they had just lost World War I and were not in the best shape to start such an expedition. This is the backdrop for the film, but it is also about a pro-communist rich woman and her unfortunate love for a childhood friend who belongs to the German troops. She throws herself at him again and again, but in any case he rejects her. She then sublimates these wishes through various matters. Although none of this sex is so graphic, this and the underlying reason why the man is not interested in this movie is a more adult movie and I would not show it to younger audiences. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, the whole movie is as gray and lifeless as I've ever seen it. I can only recommend it if you are an amazingly patient person or really stuck in overvalued German films. I especially warn those who suffer from depression as this will undoubtedly make the situation worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films waiting to be seen - such as MOSTLY MARTHA, THE BOAT, MOTHER KUSTER'S GOES TO HEAVEN, WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI.
