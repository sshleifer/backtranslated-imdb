The use of "astral projection" (wandering soul) to exist outside of the body, with the result that terrible deaths are imposed (which crush the inside of victims, causing spinal fractures and broken organs) in those who are such a person Nearby is the threat posed by ETERNAL EVIL, which gives Karen Black (.. as Janus) another "unique" character, with which she influences a commercial director as a woman, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert), his dwindling marriage and makes his boring career tired. In fact, she dies and needs his body. Her mind may be harmful to his wife and son (his son has a "special friend" who persuades him into things and even poisons himself). A detective, Kauffman (John Novak), who investigates the unusual murders of people killed by the benevolent mind, connects Paul to the dead and discovers Janus through him. Soon they both realize that Janus has to be stopped, or she simply moves on to another human host. What Paul does not know is that his new secretary is Janus's lover. Both were actually older intellectuals who were featured in his documentary on astral projection called WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) certainly creates a strange atmosphere with this film, which contains a rather bizarre premise. It seems that Paul's boy can see the mind in the form of a "blue man" manipulating the boy into disorderly behavior. Despite the star treatment, black is rarely shot close by exploiting her face, which can provoke the kind of evil evil that justifies her character. Instead, she is shot from a distance, her voice is dubbed, and she never really gets involved with the right threat, which in my opinion is a lost opportunity. For some reason, despite the fascinating (albeit odd) idea of ​​astral projection that makes a mind kill people from within, the movie just never takes off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (and sound), while sometimes moody and effective, is often quite bleak. The tempo is also a problem as the story mules go along. The cast is rather limp, especially Rekert at the top, his performance at best unpredictable. It does not help that there are only a few characters (except Paul's wife) who are less of an interest to us, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not exactly the loveliest person in the world. He can be quite tricky, his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior. Black should have been a more prominent character in the film, but mostly stays in the background and is talked about in the dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely does she get a chance to amuse us with her histrionics, which is a pity.
