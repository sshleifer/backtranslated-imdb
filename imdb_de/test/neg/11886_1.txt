This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who, as free men in 17th-century Brazil, have found their own mountain community. The story is interesting and edifying. However, this movie is terrible - as a movie. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early eighties. Combat scenes are fought with the sounds of kitschy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cop dramas. Admittedly, the texts are folkloric narratives about the heroism of slaves. The special effects are absurd. Instead of relying on the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they make the film seem cheap. They are absolutely incredible, and I do not mean just a sense of accuracy. <br /> <br /> Life in the municipality of Palmares could not have been as it is portrayed in the film. For this society, as shown in the film, it is a one-piece kibbutz, a one-piece Afro-pop festival. It is almost embarrassing when the director plays the stereotypes of black people as talented singers and dancers who just want to be happy. He portrays everyday life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves in bright colors and whirl around to the strains of pop music of the 80s. On the other hand, there is plenty of nice food, but the viewer hardly sees work being done. The king defends himself against private property in a hackneyed and clichéd way. When a man complains that people are taking the vegetables he has grown for many months, the king says, "What comes from the earth belongs to everyone, because the earth does not belong to anyone, and when they need food, they have one Just take yours. "<br /> <br /> I'm glad I've learned from this episode in the story, but I'm relieved to see a movie with such low production values ​​and handling such worn-out stereotypes today probably would not be done.
