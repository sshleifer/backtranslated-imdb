Jack Frost 2 was a terrible, terrible, sadly pathetic apology for a sequal of a great movie. The original was a low-budget comedy horror movie about a murdered man who was turned into a snowman after an accident with toxic waste. And the snowman left, murdering people and avoiding blow-drying like the plague. However, this was far from the quality of the original. It seems that this even had a lower budget because for some reason after an hour in this movie I still had not seen the snowman. He gets some revenge when he is always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice and a little shake of the radiator, where he rests to animate the figure. Disappointing for no faith, even for a fan of bad cinema.
