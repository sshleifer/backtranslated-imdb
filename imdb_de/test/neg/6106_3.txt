My mother told me not to visit "Kadosh" - but who's listening to his mother? <br /> <br /> I was so rejected while watching that I thought I had lost my feminist qualifications on the way to the theater, so the next day I asked about the feminists with card carriers. No, they also thought it was much more of an anti-Orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement that painted the Orthodox as equal to the Taliban. While this Israeli film pays attention that the sect is The Story of Ultimate Orthodox Messianists. It's so evil that it's unbelievable (and that the non-fanatical Orthodox rock'n'-scooter (!) In which one of the sisters falls in love is incredibly sexy--). Even in Israel it has to be fantasy act. <br /> <br /> The theater was quite crowded, so there is a pent-up curiosity to see Israeli films. too bad this evil movie is the one that is widely used. That was almost enough to get me into bland Hollywood romantic movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 29.04.2000)
