Oh dear, oh dear! What did you think of? Terrible screenplay, terrible spectacle. I'm not even sorry for the actors ... they brought their checks to the bank and smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since when did an air shaft of Charing Cross appear in the bank? Why are vehicles crossing Tower Bridge heading for the city when the climb is due? Why is Tower Bridge not full when the city is evacuated? How does Carlyle dive into a raging torrent ... and survive? I could go on ... and on. <br /> <br /> There is no real urgency in the command room. They might as well wait for the English team to return to the pitch after the tea break at Lords. <br /> <br /> It says something when I wait for the Adsbreaks to learn more about the Diarrahoe treatment with anticipation. <br /> <br /> Completely vile garbage!
