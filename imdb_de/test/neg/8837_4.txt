Sad to say that this is one of the gloomiest of John Wayson's line of Westerns of Poverty Series for Lone Star Productions. Here he is a United States marshal on the trail of a well-known bandit, I do not shit you as a shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's a guy who gives his orders through an open wall. Sure, so his men do not see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you will know it within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is pretty wrong, no squeaking or groaning of the audience would have occurred because Gabby Hayes still played a variety of roles and is clean shaven here. He had not yet found his niche as the lovable vintage buddy of various movie cowboy heroes like the Duke. Later, he leads his men fairly open to the climax, so I'm not sure what the meaning of the original wall play was for sure. I do not think those who wrote this article knew anything about it either. Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian buddy here and the relationship is about the same as with an unmasked Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> It's all very stupid if you ask me.
