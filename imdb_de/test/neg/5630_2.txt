The Riddle was written by Brendan Foley in an apparent attempt to draw the secrets of Charles Dickens' novels into a contemporary history, but this attempt is thwarted by the choice between two periods in which the "magazine" is used. "Riddles" is riddled. Despite a cast of well-known actors doing their best to present this straightforward DVD movie, the end product is a long, boring, amateurish jumble that can only be viewed as entertainment when viewers are cast members, such as she knows movies from others. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist who limits himself to dog racing while dreaming of important reporting assignments. A series of similar murders is an old friend of Mikes - Sadie (Vera Day), who runs a pub on the Thames that has just discovered an old valuable, unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens and has a gold heart to such miserable creatures like an old beach robber (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder puts Mike in the role of detective journalism, and with the help of policewoman Kate (Julie Cox), he begins linking the investigation to clues he finds while reading the Dickens manuscript. Disturbing the flow of this rather simple story is the use of flashbacks to Dickens' time when Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) tells a rather personal story of strange murders. The parallels between the stories and the cross-casting among the actors may have worked in the hands of another, but the sophistication of this type of venture escapes the writer / director Brendan Foley. He ends his story (finally) with a tired end to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Apart from Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film somehow caught the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but happily distracting. This is a faint bit of syrup, and the viewer wonders how films of this quality will ever find funding. Grady harp
