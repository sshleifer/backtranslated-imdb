Water shows the plight of the Indian widows in the late 1930s, in the end says that the problem still largely consists of statistical statistics, refers to Gandhi several times in the film, before he finally had a scene that represents him, and does nothing extraordinary or new in the movie. Yes, the cinematography is pretty impressive, but that can not be a movie for me. <br /> <br /> India has had many problems like many other nations, but it has solved many of these problems in general. What if America's film on racism in a given year ended with "x number of Americans still experiencing racism today?" <br /> <br /> a) How relevant and b) How about something extraordinary being shown in the cinema. <br /> <br /> A view I read from a Deepa Mehta interview was that this movie is interpreted as a voice for the marginalized everywhere. From the reviews I've read everywhere, I've heard that the director did a great job and was brave enough to bring a problem to the world. The film is more about a specific problem that society faces (and has been removed by reforms in general). <br /> <br /> I do not see anything that shakes the earth over the movie. In addition, the film lacked soul and shifted between the actions of Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young Sri Lankan actress, brilliantly portrayed Chuiyya's role, and that was the only thing that saddened me about the film.
