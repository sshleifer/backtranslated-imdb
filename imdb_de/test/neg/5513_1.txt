A roger corman rip-off that was put together for seemingly zero budget. All the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars", and I suspect that a significant number of the props, costumes and sets were also used from other sources. The story seems to be written around these elements, so this is not really a movie, but a recycling project. "Star Wars" third-class drink was not needed then or now.
