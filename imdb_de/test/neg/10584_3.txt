That's not fair. I really expected it to be a funny, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell of Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to despise since his earliest classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, after the movie with the superhero, I am glad that I did not even have to pay for it. It just would not have been near the $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and pennies. Because that would add up for the hour and a few minutes. And as disappointing as this movie was, I'm glad the runtime was so short, if not shorter. I just can not believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary and above all STUPID, some scenes were! And beyond that, I've seen how to act better from a wooden dummy (without a ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin intentionally wanted to make a movie that earned his 3.7, if not lower, and even tried to be worse than "Meet the Spartans." Very disappointing.
