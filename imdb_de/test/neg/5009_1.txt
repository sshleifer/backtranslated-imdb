Strangers with sweets overreact in the wrong context, the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and the bad low-braow-comedy-timing. The clear attempt of dry / black / dark humor is obvious and does not bring out all the elements of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a high cring factor and a low salmon rate, I was shocked that this show passed the first season. I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pull, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what you think, these shows are not at all weird. So Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box are some of the good shows I've ever seen. black / dark humor / satire and are all at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> Garth Marenghis Darkplace is cheap, overclocked and weird, but the context is well thought-out and fun to work on.
