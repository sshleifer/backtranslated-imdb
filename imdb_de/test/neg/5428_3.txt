Oh God. Why does Nickelodeon have such a hard time producing even a decent movie? I mean, this movie could have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Rather superficial, stereotypical and offensive to some C. Ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> First of all, dressing the nerd to look cool was very consumer, very superficial, very pointless. and very offensive. It has the stereotypical nerd-dumb faces, glasses, never kissed, holidays with his mother etc. The reason why this guy has never kissed a girl is that he is gay! Does that mean that all gays are nerds? And what's wrong with being friends with your mother? <br /> <br /> The worst was by far the end. The whole drama of the movie revolved around Zoey finding out that Chase loved her and blah blah blah, and when Chase finally decided to tell her, <br /> <br /> A. He did not tell her personally because he just came to the typical distraction. For example, he tried to send her a text message, but her PDA fell into a well and died before receiving the message. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> HOW LAME IS THAT ????? I mean, why can not cartoonists just change the series? So many of us want these two to come together. Why can not we see it? I mean, are the producers really so uncreative that they can not imagine any new issues with the changes in the series? So they have to stick to the same plot and contours and make as many episodes as they can. After a while, it gets boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see some real romance here, IT! <br /> <br /> Okay. I'm done with my anger.
