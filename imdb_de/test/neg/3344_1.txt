This movie is so unreal. Such French films are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? I did not even know why. What? The well-known sex scene of half-siblings? The sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story on which it is based is so unreal. What good is it then? Can you easily find in life that half-siblings do such things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn something from this film? Yes, some people just like to waste time making such films, such stories, such non-sensible ones. But for those who like nihilism, nothing in life or just a life without hope, then you are there ... you must watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Only one who appreciates: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is such a strikingly beautiful woman.
