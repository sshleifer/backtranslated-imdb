Karen and her boyfriend Jerry move to their new apartment in Los Angeles. You discover an old brass bed that Karen likes, unfortunately it has a really weird story with muddled sex murders. "Deathbed" tries to be a scary supernatural story, but the action is slow, acting is nothing special and there is no suspense. Even the sex scenes are lame. The climax is pretty bloody and violent, so the fans of Splatter should be contented "is deadly boring and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap horrors." Definitely avoid my rating: 4 out of 10 and that's generous -Animator "or" Castle Freak ".
