This is the story of a crazy cop who for some reason has it for a young college stud and his comrades. After they have reported him to his supervisor, who suspends him to psychiatric assessment, he finds a way to torture them, as the children in a bet in the security of a department store hack and unlock the door. Only they are locked up in the store together with the spinner. Murder and chaos are under way, and the children are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape. <br /> <br /> 'Dangerous Game' would probably have been a successful Katzemaus psycho-thriller when it was hired elsewhere. The thought of a psychotic cop chasing a few innocent teenagers in a department store just did not work. Especially if he often comes to his twitching prey and still does nothing serious. There was no real confrontation that would be enough for this kind of story, and maybe it would have worked better if, for example, the teenagers were loose in the neighborhood and had to fight back against that spinner (especially if that took a few. ) Days in which he makes her increasingly paranoid ... although granted, that too is a clich√©). Also a pity that it could not have been a better thriller, considering a funky cast of the young Aussie character. Even a carefree adventure despite the madness of the villain through the image might even have made it a satisfying picture. Instead, it started fresh and certainly had many action sequences, but they were pretty ridiculous.
