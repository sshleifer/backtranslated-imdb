There is a lot of money behind this production, so it looks very good. It includes some interesting performances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a short cameo at the beginning of Christopher Lee. There are a few thrilling gunfights and one or two funny fights - the satire about Django, the man without a name and Sabata is amusing, especially if they get the names of the failed presidents of the Mexico Revolution. The problem is that there is no purpose has to satirize the Spaghetti Western as it is being tried here. The key element in the spaghetti is IRONY, which easily fits into a comedy. In fact, the source of all spaghetti is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, widely considered to be one of the great black comedies of all time, and most spaghetti has easily become a true comedy of a very demanding variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this can be found in the Trinity films, which are openly about spaghetti and open slapstick comedy. So why bother satirizing a genre that naturally satirizes itself? As a result, I found the entire company essentially unconvincing. None of these characters were people who would ever interest me, the story was a generic cliché, and the production values ​​reflected only the money, not the passion of the director. All in all a banal and futile effort to exploit the phenomenon that mocks it.
