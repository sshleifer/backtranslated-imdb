This was a very nice concert of the single MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The singing was ok. I have to admit that his vocals were on Human Nature and Billie Jean Mist. They could not hear him half the time. The other songs make up for the singing. The highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I just can not stop loving you. She is from my life. If it was someone other than Mj, it would have been a 9. It is a must. I wish I had been born so that I could have gotten a ticket for the best concert of 1992.
