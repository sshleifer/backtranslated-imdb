At least for me. I followed Mr. Almdovar's career from the beginning and was not crazy about this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was a bad fight, the type of woman she portrays does not look so good, she makes the character incredible. Also the singing scene was just funny. I do not understand the point and the lip sync was terrible. <br /> <br /> As a Spaniard, another thing that has driven me crazy is the accents. Why do people who come from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and makes no sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I tried to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", things are not so. <br /> <br /> I had expected more, but this time Mr.Almodovar had not done so, at least for me. I'm not saying Miss Cruz is doing a bad job, I say that she does not belong there, does not represent that character.
