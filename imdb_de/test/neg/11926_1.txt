It was at the top (or bottom) with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace. <br/> <br /> The premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked promising, but the entire movie had about 30 seconds of proper shootout, and that was shown on the small-screen 30-second slot. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snooze party by all means. The property is recycled sci-fi food. Too bad, because I thought it would be bad, but I hoped. It could be the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not look. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you liked one of the three movies mentioned above.
