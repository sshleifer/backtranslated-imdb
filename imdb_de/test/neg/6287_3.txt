Poor old Robert Taylor. Apart from THE FEDS, not much has gone his way - this almost shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much else. It's one of those cheesy detective crime films with the whole story of the main character - usually reserved for comedy, but this movie takes itself too seriously! A shame; The Australian films were of exceptional quality overall, especially in 2000-2001 - but I suspect that there have been some failures. Why even make a movie like this, which obviously is not good?
