Who wrote the script for this movie, the staff of Disney Studios ?! This is the most uncomplicated adaptation of all stories! I wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry over others, and that was just so pathetic. I have to credit it, there were some funny scenes, but I could have spent a better time with my evening. Very rarely do I turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way.
