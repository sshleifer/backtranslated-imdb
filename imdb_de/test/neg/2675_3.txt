If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to fans of the show, then Halloween 6 is like a vicious insult. The story has gone to all dogs. Michael is used as a helpless farmer in this movie and is not scary at all. He reminds me of an overweight alcoholic as the boogeyman, who in the original struck fear in our hearts. There are almost no redeemable qualities for this feature, and I am so glad that H20 came out because it would be insulting to the fans if we considered it fresh. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects I liked. Having a grown-up Tommy Doyle in the movie was a nice touch and linked him to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie to end an otherwise beautiful career). When he's on the screen, he remembers the good old days, when Halloween was really scary. <br /> <br /> This is my friends. The stalk sequences are not original. One of them is a blatant rip-off of the pursuit of Laurie / Michael in the original. The other characters are terribly signed and just not sympathetic. The music, even though the movie is bad, a highlight of Halloween, is being tortured in this movie. We get a stupid rock version of the Stalk / Chase theme. What did they think when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Her biggest mistake was killing the character of Jamie (Now played by another actress not worthy mention) We have this character seen in two films before death. We're rooting for her and if she gets killed in this movie, you can not help but feel sorry for her and realize that filmmakers do not care if good characters establish themselves in a movie. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less said about this embarrassment, the better. I wish there was not. I suggest skipping this movie and even 5 and going straight to H20, because if you see that, you might not want to watch another Halloween movie.
