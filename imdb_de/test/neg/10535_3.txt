I saw this movie yesterday, and as almost everyone else wrote "I also expected a Steven movie," God, I love this guy just because his style of fighting is unique and very humorous. I had some doubts because I read that "Yes Rule" was playing in it, but I thought I hope they give it a small role, so I do not get irritated when I watch it. And of course, the opposite is true, what the hell you thought you were about to join a sly crew like this one. Steven was broke and needed money? bah = (what a big disappointment, if you like Steven Film, please skip this is just a drama, you just get some special effects that made me choose 3/10.) movie aswel up for his buddy with his irritating award speech. <br /> <br /> My beer tasted not only fresh water, but also water we washed dishes in. I felt like a 3 year old producer. <br /> <br /> Steven hopes to make me happy again in a future movie. Guys, it's not worth it to just rent like that. <br /> <br /> Pity and shit :-)
