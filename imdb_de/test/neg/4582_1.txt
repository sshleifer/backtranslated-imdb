Greyfriars Bobby was not a Westie - Bobby was a Skye terrier. A highlight of my day trips to Edinburgh was the monument to Bobby. I grew up with the story of the brave and faithful little dog, like any other child in my generation, and I remember being with my mother outside of the cinema - with many other Dundee children and their mothers - to see the wonderful Disney World movie. How could a movie based on such a wonderful story be made with a Westie, for God's sake. It's like making a movie about the life of Robert Burns and portraying him as an Englishman, for example. I say, give Bobby his breed back!
