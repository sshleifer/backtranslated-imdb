Terrible, terrible, horrible show. The "real world" was about blatant unoriginality. Stereotypes galore. What the hell is going on with the African American (black!) Guys? Tyrone does! Terrible, terrible, horrible, horrible, horrible show. The fact that it took three seasons is the belief. This show is really a hoax for the brain dead who accept mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Saved by the bell seemed almost humorous in comparison. Well, in hindsight, no. It is of the same banal sort and therefore also without intelligence. The only thing missing so far is the Jesus message. The mentality and liberation is the same, but somehow feels evil and soulless. You can almost hear the TV managers listening to each other. In fact, I felt so outraged that it shows excremental existence, and I felt compelled to comment. <br /> <br /> Terrible, horrible, horrible show.
