This movie was really bad. It has the quality that many indie films have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are totally boring. Any hardcore BAM Magera fan will love this movie, but that's probably the only person who would see it. Someone gave me this movie to watch, knowing that I was a fan of Jackass and was a fan of Viva la bam before the scripted nature of this show developed thinly. To explain why this movie does not work, I should just say that the premise itself is played. A guy who is with a girl that is terrible for him. And pretty much the whole movie has lamented this Ryan Dunn guy and Bam Magera is jumping like a merry mischief maker. Dicamillo's performance is strange at best. It's a humorous little nonspecific Canadian French accent that's pretty much the extent of its performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then it's like "ok, you pretend to be strangers enough") <br /> <br /> Maybe it's like this If they were going to parody, that would work, but all they can do is make a film with an IQ of zero. I love toilet humor as much as the next, but that's not even modest, it's just stupid The humor that you can get from this movie is completely in itself and the audience, even those who are familiar with Magera and society, is left out of the joke. <br /> <br /> Next time Magera will hand over a sack of money, hopefully he will not blow it on any lousy pet project
