I saw this movie with very low expectations. I did not know much about it, so I was not sure if it would be worth it. The tension continues when the Mayans emerge, forcing them to stay in the ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the movie turns from something exciting to pointless. The amount of gore found in this film was not compared to the question of whether it was really necessary or more likely to be used as a shock. They had fire and did not try to burn it, nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of the old horror movies where people just scream and scream and have half their brains to fight back.
