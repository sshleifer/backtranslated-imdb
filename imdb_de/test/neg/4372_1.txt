I really do not know why I agreed to watch this movie, but like a complete idiot I did, and for that I deserve to be filmed! I had seen the original Killjoy. Well, I saw it ... I started to look at it, but it was so bad that I saw it at 4x speed to finish it and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but I said I would see it and did it also, if it were in 4x speed. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short, Killjoy 2 is a kick where Killjoy left off. By that I do not mean the conspiracy, I mean the whole bag of dirt, known as drama and cheapness. I do not mind low-budget movies, in fact I enjoy them, they are something other than mega-budget blockbusters, but this movie is just awful! Acting is devilish and the script ... well, I think you could give Stevie Wonder a pen and paper, and he would produce something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has that so obvious! I did not manage to get through the movie anyway. About three-quarters of the way through was the time to turn it off and throw it through the window. It may have been a rip off to buy a DVD, but as a Frisbee it was a mega bargain! <br /> <br /> Please do NOT consider this crap for the love of humanity itself, it may be the worst thing I've ever seen and considering some of the filth that I've seen, that says a lot! <br /> <br /> My rating for this film would be ... nail gun to the head / 10
