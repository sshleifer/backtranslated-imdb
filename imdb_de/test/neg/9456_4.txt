Ouch!! What a mess we have here. Not so much a mess as a painfully boring, half-hearted excuse for exploitation. From the single, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same from Moonshine Mountain, brought to you. Doctor Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is probably inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else is. The late Mr. Patterson also plays a part in this joke, as a fragile scientist / plastic surgeon who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and driven mad with sadness, so it becomes clear that the next step is in it Slaughter countless females, then you may rob a few graves for body parts to "put together" the perfect partner. It will not be easy, but thankfully, his friend Gregg the Bucklige can lend a hand and provide moral support. <br /> <br /> If ever proof was needed that the goals of some peoples are not intended, here it is gang. Obviously, this Patterson hay seed never had anything to do, if he followed in the footsteps of a good old H. G. as a master of the blood. I've never seen a Gore movie where the viewer is simply not allowed to watch the viewer. Even the blood is boring. At times almost remotely humorous, but impossible to say whether it is intended or not. I choose "not". <br /> <br /> Filmed in Charolotte, North Carolina (home to the massacre of California Ax Ax), most likely on a 3-digit budget, by a man as disinterested as he possibly has, who is probably one So maybe we should take a break for the good old JG, I mean, he tried (I suppose) what more can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the super hero trash that the theaters are mucking out these days, though I realize it does not say much. Apart from that, Doctor Gore is the improvement over Patterson's earlier failure, The Electic Chair. It is quite possible that he would have improved his craft in time if he had not died. Maybe it's not so bad, especially in comparison to the other movies the DVD, how to make a doll, so, heck, check it out. 4.10
