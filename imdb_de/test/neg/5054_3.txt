This absurd film was about a "goodie-two-shoe," a teenage girl who actually wanted to become a Valedictorian, but finds his obstacle in a teacher's name, Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", faces the "biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when that classmate comes by her along with the final exam to help pin down Mrs. Tingle's test. Mrs. Tingle comes along and gets Holmes, the classmate and her best friend, the final exam. Convinced that the three intended to cheat on this exam, Mrs. Tingle raves about her chance to finally ruin Holmes, with allegations that can nullify any chance that Holmes has passed her class. And the classmate who seems to have Holmes in mind has always wondered why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? Desperately, Holmes and her friends come to Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to convince her that Holmes was about to cheat. Somehow it all fails when the classmate points Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow to Mrs. Tingle and threatens to get things right for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle strikes back, but ends up being a prisoner of Holmes and her friend. <br /> <br /> While Mrs. Tingle is trapped under Holmes, they do everything to get her tied up and gagged in her own bed until she is blackmailed for false pictures she and Ms. Tingle of the unconscious coach in bed had done. I saw myself wince as the children felt at home in Mrs. Tingle's house eating their food and doing their private work. At some point, Holmes found Mrs. Tingle's Gradebook and deliberately changed the note in her favor, which diminished the evaluation of her challenge to the Valedictorian. The ending was like a childish attempt to revive the comedy, which was thrifty at the beginning of the film, with pure irony, slapstick, and absurdity. <br /> <br /> This must be the most unlikely and evil evil character Holmes would ever play in her entire life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle to be free to really dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and thoughtful. She even slept with the classmate, although her best friend's best interest lay in him ... and she did not like him. From trying to ruin her challengers' scores by capturing Mrs. Tingle's music book to her best friend's husband, you'd think Holmes will end up getting what she deserves, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything her heart desires and shows that evil, manipulative, selfish, and whining feeling can get you what you want. <br /> <br /> Ms. Tingle was probably the character you did not like. They did not even bring me to this point to believe that she was the woman who "must have learned this lesson". She was like any other strict teacher, who even gave reasonable reasons for her resentment against the next generation. Personally, I felt that her views on young people were confirmed each time with the actions of Holmes and her friend. I always hoped she could call the police and nail Holmes free. They kept her tied up in bed, ate her food like a pigsty, drank the woman's wine, messed with her personal belongings, and we think she did not deserve to bring them a bat heads? And the classmate must be one of the most unpopular characters in film history. Forget the idiot, we need a new word for him that is not in Webster's dictionary. He had the greatest difficulty in Holmes life, and made it worse when he came into Mrs. Tingle's house, did not invite Holmes, and cornered Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow. I was thrilled every time Mrs. Tingle got the chance to fire him or choke the would-be actress' best friend. <br /> <br /> If you're a teenager out there and want to see when a teen manipulates and wrongdoing can give birth to him or her, you'll see this listless, caricatured, unintentional movie noir.
