I once heard that this movie was described. Either you will love him or you will hate him. If I've read through some of the other reviews and reviews, I'd like to say that's true. I sit down in the hate it pushes. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This movie is bad on all three fronts. <br /> <br /> Exeter of Earth Island (Jeff Morrow) returns to his roots as a sci-fi / B-movie as Dr. Les (without a giant head prosthesis) back. The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - aka George Jetson), along with Les' girlfriend assistant Vera, are following a meteorite. This is the core of the cast and is almost a double appointment. Les has Vera and Arnie has his "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitor - aka Computer). Let's just assume that the relationship between George and his robot girl Rosie (and its relation to "Susie") is more credible than the cold, shell-like feelings that Vera for Les has (and vice versa). The goal of their entire interest, however, is not an ordinary meteor. It's really an alien Art Nouveau / Art Deco energy storage that moves like a three-legged dog. There is also the little extraterrestrial "energy" that Dr. Hubbel (aka chief scientist there) inspects. The alien is obvious and evil and evil from the beginning. Is that the kind of science we hand out? No wonder the aliens of the explorers were afraid of us. After watching some of these films, we'll shoot first. After that, no questions need to be asked. <br /> <br /> The whole film is equivalent to viewing some really boring scientific experiments, such as cooking an egg or adding food coloring to celery. It's not the fact that this is a sci-fi movie on a low budget or that's a bit cheesy and outdated. It is really boring. The whole movie is about finding out what's going on. That's it. Most of the things we learn about what happens are monologues and self-dictates. Now add shabby dialogues, cardboard games and cheap sets and you have what it takes to be an Ed Wood clone (by the way, Ed also made some really boring movies - please avoid the orgy of the dead). The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. Jems like: <br /> <br /> ".. less than 3 km of the ocean? <br /> <br /> Why not ?! It came through a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "Do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who has probably drawn the scientific treasure of all time?" <br /> <br /> This movie obviously tries to draw a Forbidden Planet, this Island Earth, a magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits, Twilight Zone. A low-budget sci-fi movie (or TV episode) convincing enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. In essence, these films are pleasing on a certain level (the story, the underlying meaning or the weird nature of the dialogue or situations). This movie has none of this. It's only 90 minutes boredom. I could not even enjoy Ed Wood. I definitely recommend skipping this movie and watching one of the above movies instead. It's so bad that when I see Dr. Forrester said, never think about showing this movie to anyone ... except maybe Frank.
