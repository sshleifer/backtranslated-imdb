Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! "The Beginning" was not the greatest, but better than this. This is not a good way to get to the original movie. It's just awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake in both movies! Why not use real animals? I liked the old Sinbad movies better. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this film waste is the cinematography and the clothes that captured this time really well. I understand why this film was renewed as "The Beginning". It's just so bad in my opinion. Where does the money come from to waste like that? Give me a budget of several million dollars and I'll show you how it should be done!
