The plot of this film is a clich√© and was obviously demolished by Jurassic Park. The filmmakers did not even try to hide that. It seems that the budget is not enough to make decent dinosaur puppets, and instead the viewer sees robotic toy dinos (from a cheap toystore) moving in a very unnatural way. It's funny because it's so bad. The spectacle is almost as unnatural as the dinosaurs. Nobody seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and you can hardly watch them without falling asleep. The only positive comment I want to make about "Raptor" is that it does not take a full 90 minutes.
