A teenage teenager, who is not in the military and has not trained as a jet fighter, sets off for a foreign country to rescue his father. If that's not ridiculous enough, he persuades an Air Force colonel to help him get a jet in his hands [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, the Colonel risks his career and his life by giving the spiky boy some hands on help. Not only do not Colonel do that anymore, but they never did. This juicy, dumb movie should be thrown into the air and blown away by a MIG.
