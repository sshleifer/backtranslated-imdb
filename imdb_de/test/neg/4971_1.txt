In 1993, Sega released a boring, dull video game of one of the greatest films of all time. They quickly realized their mistake and made another version of the game. They claimed it was bigger, harder and better. Both were slow, boring games. <br /> <br /> You can either Dr. Alan Grant or ... being a raptor. Both have their problems. Why should Dr. Grant kill all these army types (what do they do in the game)? And why does a bird of prey kill other birds of prey? Weird. <br /> <br /> Obviously not learned from their first mistake, Sega really lost the ball on the original release and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, laziest, and boring platformers I've ever played.
