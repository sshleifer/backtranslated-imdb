The perfect 6-step recipe for a boring movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Take a burned-out, rogue ex-policeman with a bad attitude, but also a sensitive touch (cabinet pianist with a pet cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some "cool" retro gadgets like a beat-up Porsche 356, a roaring bike, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles. <br /> <br /> 3. Mix at a few "free places", e.g. a trendy seaside apartment and a dedicated diner for an office; <br /> <br /> 4. Feel it with "deep" socio-romantic themes, such as a post-divorce-traumatized but ultimately remarried ex-wife, a secretly admiring and therefore forgiving waitress, a couple former Fellow-cops-just-of-whom-is-really a complete jerk and a best buddy who becomes fully-illegal about a suitcase - $$$; <br /> 5. Allow it to simmer for about 90 minutes in a "fast," though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes, cheap, tender moments, and slow-paced sophistication; <br /> <br /> 6. Use either with a comfortable pillow to rummage through, or something more interesting (do not worry, even the yellow pages are enough!).
