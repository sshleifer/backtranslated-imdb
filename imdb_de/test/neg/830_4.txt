Even before this film it is clear that Ali G has become exactly the character he intended to parody. I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character anyway, but I was curious how a man with so little talent could convince a universal studio to finance a nearly one-and-a-half-hour movie from a three-minute joke. <br /> <br /> A paper-thin story is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes, and I have to admit I've been down when I've seen such respected thespians as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, who do so little Have work. I have to admit that I have to admit (even though I'm pretty ashamed) that I've raised a Titter more than once, and how bad this movie was, it was never boring, and I've never thought to turn it off ( mainly because of the beautiful Rhona Mitra). If you say so, watch this movie only if you're a teenager between the ages of 14 and 17 and find jokes funny.
