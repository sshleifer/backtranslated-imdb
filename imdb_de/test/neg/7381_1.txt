I rented this movie because the DVD cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like Van Wilder or Animal House. I brought it to my friend after movie night. We ended the movie after 15 minutes and saw Copper Mountain instead. I do not know if any of you saw Copper Mountain, but it's not that great. But I have to say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo has made the clock even more beautiful. <br /> <br /> I finished Puddle Cruiser later. This movie was slow and the humor was forced. This movie reminded me of some stinkers that I've seen in some of my previous production classes at college. I wondered if this was the movie that allowed Broken Lizard to build supertroopers? How could this movie be that bad? Supertroopers was good and Club Dread was decent. Do not see this movie
