This is the kind of late-night cable that is usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Unlike most Tweed and Stevens' T & A vehicles, this is deadly boring! <br /> <br /> Let's go hunting. The real reason to see this non-thriller is to see Shannon Doherty's breasts. Whoever claims otherwise is a liar! However, most of her steamy sex scenes all seem to be smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all shots that show the head and chest at the same time are fast peek-a-boo flashes. The images of the camera hanging from her naked body have little or no face attached, or she is behind a dripping, wet shower door. <br /> <br /> All the fools out there know what that means - Body double! <br /> <br /> I have to admit, though, that the finale where Doherty is connected with a knife, blindfolded and threatened, provided a certain fetishistic kick. <br /> <br /> If you find a VHS copy somewhere, buy it! Since all parties are probably too embarrassed that this can ever be released on DVD!
