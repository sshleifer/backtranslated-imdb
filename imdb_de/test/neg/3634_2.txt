I've seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and I've seen most of them. And I did not like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving us such great shows as Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create such a stupid show? My problem is not only with Dan, but also with the guys who nominated this show for an Emmy, were they drunk that day or what's the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for an Emmy, but it's much better than Zoey 101. The creators of this series should be ashamed for the existence of this show even better, it will cause it to be canceled.
