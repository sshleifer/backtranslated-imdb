Very strange, that seems to me to be a very average movie, albeit a little less. It's brilliantly shot, but along with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, this is about the only redemptive aspect I've found in the movie, which consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part describes the basic training for the sea which, when I look at it in 2007, looks like I've seen countless times in dozens of other films and series. It is not very exciting. After 30 minutes, I had the idea and wished they could just keep going. The Drill Sergeant is the only believable character, while everyone else seems to be just cardboard cutouts. The general drama is amazingly hard, and the script contains nothing interesting and is little more than the sergeant's shouting. The boys make it through their training and land in Vietnam. Oh, and the fat spinner shoots at the sergeant (what a surprise ..), probably in the false belief that he was indeed the scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> So one hour passed and nothing special happened. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the Vietnam part. <br /> <br /> It starts with a koyo scene where reporters from Stars and Stripes get bored and make small talk to pass the time. At first, I thought they were re-enacting some movie scenes from old movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they were actually mumbling their script lines. Then the camp is besieged. About 20 Viet Cong enter the camp through the main gate. Too bad for them that they are dropped like flies because they simply enter several manned gun posts without cover. Is that normal? Were the Vietnamese suicidal? If so, how did the US not win this war in the first two months of engagement? The rest of the film continues with even more illogical war scenes. <br /> <br /> Besides, the whole plot is completely pointless. None of the characters inspires too much sympathy and the story is frankly uneventful. It shows slightly more than a few war correspondents who come together with a train, with some guys being shot because they are disobedient idiots and also seem to believe that a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets the message of this film ... that the people in Vietnam have died? That people in war situations are animals? If you really want to get rid of stupid people, send them to a war zone? Or that somehow concrete can burn in Vietnam? <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if this movie earns an 8.3, then Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
