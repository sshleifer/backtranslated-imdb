What distinguishes some of the "Lone Star" films (and many others in western and adventure films of the early 1930s) was their lack of what we recognize as formulaic storytelling. To be sure they are good vs Having bad (the basic element of a West), Boy meets girls and some characters like the old rancher and his gorgeous daughter or granddaughter and sometimes the evil banker or another businessman. How the action went was often different from film to film. <br /> <br /> In 'The Lawless Frontier', Earl Dwire is portrayed in his big star (not inexplicable) as Pandro Zanti, a 'half', Apache, half American, posing as a Mexican and fluently speaks the language. His greatest pose as a Mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi attire. The only plot seems to be that he wants to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of "Old Dusty" (Gabby Hayes). At the first meeting with her, Dwire shows her a long gaze that brings him into the big leagues with the sexual predators. One might think that Zanti, who kills Tobin's father in front of the camera in the opening scene of John (Wayne), would play a major role in the film. There is not too much time to hunt between heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> We get a lot of good stunts from Yakima Canutt, including riding Ruby on his horse as he passes by, jumping on 'Renegades' and knocking on their horses, jumping a horse off a cliff into a lake and even slipped down the lock sequence of "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although the Mighty Yak this time uses a body-surfing protocol instead of spreading a tree branch, and this insertion is also illogical, as they are in a desert. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly John Ways measured and methodically well-photographed walk through the desert after the escape and Zanti tripped with these fantastic basalt rocks of Red Rock Canyon (in countless series, Western and science-fiction moon films see) behind him. No final cannon duel at fifty steps. The heroine runs from the wooden steps of the bar to hug and kiss the winning hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally brings him in, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a water hole and dies. After a few too many chases, Zantai's gang is finally caught in Dusty's cabin, stepping onto a revolving cupboard one by one, apparently leading to a ravine now blocked by the blast. No sunset ride or compulsory kissing of the girl: The last shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the now Sheriff John Tobin's phone: "What would Sheriff Tobin want for dinner?" The film is also poorly lit and edited at the beginning, the tempo is slow, some parts with the sheriff let him pull and the chases fill the film. Despite the different and unusual elements, it is one of the weaker Lone Stars.
