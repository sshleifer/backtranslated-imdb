In the first forty minutes Luna is a real treat. The characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and the places are nice to look at. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers that her son Matthew Barry is using heroin, the film begins to unravel, and then becomes ridiculous in his illness. Always getting a direct answer, which would be a bit helpful. He mentions that he does not care about anything, but that's not right because we clearly see in the amazing early scenes that he has a keen interest in his mother singing, baseball, and sex, and obviously was interested enough in rejecting marijuana. This movie is meant for people who believe that Junior gets hard drugs because mom and dad were workaholics who missed his piano recital. I think such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug like heroin was chosen as a kind of intellectual catalyst for the later incest scenes. There is much discussion about the mother's love for the son, but the point is that Bernardo Bertolucci is presumptuous. Luna would have been a wonderful little family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this film than anything his character went through. ** out ****
