Not bad enough again to make it comfortable. In fact, this one is just boring. It's reasonably well done, even if the script is bad, the effects are okay and the average is average. (Apart from James Mason, who is always great, but is not used enough in this movie.) <br /> <br /> I think it's hard to write about this movie because it did not trigger any reaction with me blunt, blunt, blunt, blunt, blunt.
