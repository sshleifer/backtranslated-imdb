This film deviates from the Bible and thus fell under the bar of the 1956 film. I hate having replaced the 2006 film over the traditional 10 commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the handsome man Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I will not waste my time with this movie again. They've been trying so hard to modernize this movie to keep you from being a soap opera (and not a good one at that). I'm pretty sure younger people who never took care of the original 10 commandments disagree with me, but with each of his own. It took 10 years for the first 10 bids to be submitted. It probably took them 2 months to fulfill this. The special effects were not as amazing as the first ones, and after so many years of technology, you would have thought they would do better now.
