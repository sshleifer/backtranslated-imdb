If you can watch a movie without worrying about the action, or a stupid drama, then Backdraft is definitely the one. <br /> <br /> But if you, like me, see films that you can believe, backdraft will have some serious flaws. It's nothing new, and there are hundreds of action movies from the 90s that follow identical formulas, though they're not that clumsy. <br /> <br /> After two firefights, I think that must go? I mean, how many big fires are there in a city? Of course firefighters are doing other things, such as getting cats out of trees? Well, I was wrong, and the repetition takes time and again until the end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the movie is the fire itself, well filmed, and I have to say that I felt quite hot watching it. That means two hours of fire without history or acting have been more to my liking would.
