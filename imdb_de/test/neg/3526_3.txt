** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie does not wait a second when we see him sneaking into a woman's shower and chopping her to death and taking her severed and bloody arm as he flees. Then we get this official prologue, as if we were seeing a true story that states that in late autumn 1985, a series of gruesome murders had been committed in a small collage from the Midwest. Grandfather looked, hearing impaired sheriff Ron Delboys is amazed at this murder. Later, as the murder of local collage students, all women, continues his fight for the state senator, he is in danger, bumping into the investigation each round. There are at least two times when Delboys says there will never be another murder while he's in the case and another murder happens within minutes. <br /> <br /> Finding a golden amulet at the crime scene of the sheriff's daughter, the collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft, which indicates that the amulet is a symbol of a witch's cult, the early 1700 immediately after the Salem -Hexenprozessen arose. This cult sought to avenge the 19 accused witches hanged by the locals in 1692. At night, they went out and killed men and women of authority and broke off with a body part. If the body parts were a complete person, they would be burned in an occult midnight fire ritual. <br /> <br /> You never get to grips with what's happening in the movie "Blood Cult", not only because it's totally disjointed history, but it's always unheard of and graduated from the school, especially by Charles Ellis, who plays the butter-fingered sheriff Ron Delboys. If he gets himself into bigger trouble, even the wild murderer could have got him. The limping sheriff Delboys ends with the head shot of his coffee, which was burned alive after its dismemberment. The only reason he was not, was that he seemed to dream everything under a strong and unnamed drug. <br /> <br /> There is a strange dream sequence in the film that suggests a number of factors respected members of the community are members of the Witchcraft cult responsible for the Sorority Murders. The film does not explain if the dream the deaf Sheriff Delboys had was a dream or a real experience for him, dropping it as if it had been cut out of the movie! > <br /> As he leaves the hospital and drops the Collage Sorority home while Sheriff Delboys takes down a sackful of McDonald cheeseburgers, he faces the killer. Shefiff Delboys is shocked and astonished that he not only knows who he or she is, he is also ready to let the killer escape! <br /> <br /> The very first direct video movie sequence displays. Not only that, her mind is not crazy enough to pay for admission, at least with the video you can record about it. Thank goodness to see this catastrophe, but no movie theater owner would dare to play it on his screen without danger the outraged patrons rip the place in a legitimate show of just indignation!
