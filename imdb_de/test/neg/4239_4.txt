First a warning. "How to Marry a Millionaire" is initiated by a seemingly random, five-minute orchestral performance of "Street Scene," a play by Gershwin-lite that is treated to the full pomp and ceremony of Gershwin. Sitting requires a bit of patience. If you have the DVD, you can be sure that you can jump forward. You will miss nothing. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of the eternal disappointments of Hollywood in the '50s, a film supported by big stars, opulent mise-en scene and perfect high-concept failure seems unthinkable. Only the title is perfect. Generation after generation, however, have to ask themselves - how is it that slack? The script is an albatross over the neck of the production, a dead, smelling thing that stifles everything and everyone before it can really be brought to life. There are no funny situations, just a few moments that make you laugh. Whenever a real comedy scene evolves, the movie threatens quickly to other, less interesting things. A typical example - the scene in which the three leading ladies each bring a date in the same chic restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear her glasses out of vanity. One of the appointments is married. A classic Hollywood farce, certainly with a false identity, an angry woman and probably a cake on the face for someone? Well, no. Instead, we cut off between the three dates, while the ladies react "weirdly" to what their partners say. Hit the punch line and cut to the next joke. If in doubt, run Marilyn against a wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's short films, and the camera only eats it up, though the script has nothing to do with it. She is so bright that she seems to have hatched almost fresh. By contrast, Lauren Bacall had been a big star for almost a decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen, even when she's in Monroe. She gets the only thing that fits a real role, and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snapshot - given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She's a strangely ageless actress-if she's about her own age in her movie, claiming to be forty, that's not immediately ridiculous-and far less girly than her co-stars, which gives her a compelling authority. Betty Grable was anything but ageless and had a good eight years on her co-stars, which almost put her at the end of her Hollywood career. At times there is a touch of despair about her, with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few bits of weird timeline on screen, unable to play her true age but deceiving no one as contemporaries of this new, sharper generation of actresses. She relies on the same old fate that has served her throughout her career (for Marilyn doubters, the fact that they are juxtaposed in this film helps to bring Monroe's subtlety and, yes, intelligence to sharp relief). She is also burdened with the dead wood in male co-stars (though all men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performance); She can not beat any funny sparks from them. It would be better to play her part in subconscious Monroe, who could be fun on her own, and let Grable leave with the repetitive Mr. Magoo routine. <br /> <br /> That the movie is as pleasing as it can be You have to rely on the lush Hollywood production, the kind that makes even the dwarf artists like "By the Light of the Silvery Moon" perceptible. But somewhere, buried under the limp jokes and professionalism, lies the rough outline of a sharp, cynical comedy about the marriage business that Bacall could have made to sing - and new generations of movie viewers will meet with "How to Marry a Millionaire." in anticipation of this movie ready to be disappointed again by everyone.
