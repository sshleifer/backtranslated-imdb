The Salena Incident is by far the director, the best film by Dustin Rikert, who does not say much. In his past films (and I use the term "movies" only loosely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and marginalizes them greatly. The incident in Salena is no different. The film is basically Con Air meets Aliens, made with the appearance of an average film school production. The film is full of blurry shots and is plagued by special effects that could rival most high school computer animation classes. For example, almost every blast on the screen has the same fire effect matted on the screen. <br /> <br /> The weak effects and production value are only affected by a faulty conspiracy and rocky dialogues. In one sentence, the story joins together like an exhibition of overloaded Hollywood clich√©s. The movie begins with the worst CGI alien ship ever crashed into the worst CGI earth ever, and a team of armed forces looking to investigate. Next, a bus of jail transporting the worst of the worst out of the state is toppled by the prisoners with the help of their blond girlfriends armed with silicone implants. The prisoners flee and run to the city of Salena, where they meet the aliens who ... SHOCK ... fled an extraterrestrial prison transport carrying the worst of the galaxy. The prisoners and their captured police, armed only with guns and sad puns, have to fend off the aliens and flee the city before the International Space Alliance turns their eyes and oblivious the city. <br /> <br /> The only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors (clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and they also fend off the smaller of the alien creatures in a rifle fire. Apart from that, the movie is really worth no time, let alone the plastic that made the DVD. How awful was that? Let's just say that the Secretary of Defense is around 90 years old, works in a room similar to the 1950s high-tech real estate office, and wears a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if that was not clear enough BEFORE, THE MAN WILL TAKE A TIE WITH BUGS BUNNY AND THE ROAD RUNNER IN PENTAGON'S FEE. The film essentially culminates (HAHAHahhaaa, I said, culminating ...). The last remaining soldier meets the group of prisoners and guards, and the newly formed team fights off the evil aliens - what a strange reason leads them back to the alien ship? yeah ... <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of heart, but it's in a terrible direction and even worse camera work. Someone had to sincerely clap with the DP and tell him that cinematography is more than repetitive, stagnant shots at chest height. This movie really is not worth it (if it ever gets that far), as it is not as bad as the last movies the director has done, which reduces the ability to laugh, but it's not a noteworthy movie.
