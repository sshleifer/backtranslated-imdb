It's hard to go into that kind of knowledge, because there's absolutely no reason to even see a part of it, let alone express an opinion about it. I know nothing about it - saw it laughing and stayed for the wrong breasts. Apparently it's an unofficial sequel to the 1982 Slumber Party Massacre I enjoyed as a funny slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a Late Cinemax porn with latecore! And not surprisingly, there are chicks like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (productive T & A actresses). A lot of nekkid Hooters and not much else ... A group of 20 high school cheerleaders, two random guys and the fat, stupid comic relief stranded in the countryside finding a house to spend the night in. The recently escaped "Slumber Party" murderer is in the area and starts killing her. There is no gore or originality and I would not say that nudity is a real "selling point" as it is as boring as a Slasher movie can be. Absolutely terrible ...
