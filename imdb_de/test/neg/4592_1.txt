This movie is awful. A real hockey fan would have to assume that the people who appeared in this movie and produced this movie never played or saw a real hockey game. I hoped it would be a "guy movie," but the only people likely to appreciate this movie are women between the ages of 13 and 17. The squatting scenes are terrible, defenders play as they are 5 years old, goalies dive with punches that are 3 feet wide, etc. However, the end of this movie is hard to predict !! For those who saw it, who would have thought it? For those who have not seen it yet, do not waste time! <br /> <br /> I found out less than half of the film. To call this movie a drama is ridiculous !!
