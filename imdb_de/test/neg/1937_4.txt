Read the other user comments and the review of A666333 has articulated most of what I felt in this movie-predictable storyline: cliché lesions of lesbians / heterosexuals. <br /> <br /> Also the result was very disappointing. It was mild, gentle, sentimental elevator music - another common cliché in lesbian films. The movie would have had some interesting dramatic moments, if not destroyed by the music. <br /> <br /> Some scenes related to sex and eroticism also occurred to me as an attempt to increase the shock level and increase the shock level, including parts of the final performance scene. The conventional "hot and steamy" moments were just as boring as the overly sentimental score. For example, the women kiss during the pool scene, and then the camera pans down the abandoned wine glass, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the gentle collision of the waves. <br /> <br /> The only elements I liked were the costumes and the acrobatics. They are well choreographed and the development of the attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes. I sincerely smiled during the last scene with the policeman. But they were not enough to make up for the negatives or make me enjoy this movie.
