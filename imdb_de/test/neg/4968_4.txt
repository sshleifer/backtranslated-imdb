How could this achieve a score of 6.0? So, as horror fans, are we so used to the horror movies that are so bad these days that when someone comes, and I repeat "only a few", redeeming quality, we get too excited and give a rating that's just one a bit too high? The director has a certain visual flair. There is no doubt about that. But between a few good pictures he forgot a good story, mood or fear. It had a very slow first act, lazy killing scenes, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist. And what about the portrayal of American teenagers in so many of these films? Do they always have to be so stupid, irritating and so god-fearing? I do not remember that teenagers were like that when I grew up here in Holland. All in all, the film can give nothing more than 4 out of 10 points.
