I was wondering what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival owned to include this movie in their program. I think they have to agree with the others who have reviewed this movie. I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bad script, full of holes and a dialogue that is unlikely to be embarrassing. Ideas are introduced and then dropped without development. Acting has left me completely cold and uninvolved. The decorations were contemporary, but the nightmare of a decorator. The only way the characters could love this house is when their previous homes were awful. The attic looked like it had thrown the objects for the scene without trying to create the look of a real loft that has filled up with garbage over the years. The photography was lead-free and varied. Save your money on something that pays off.
