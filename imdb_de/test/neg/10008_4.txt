Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustache-clad Latin son with bright eyes, blond hair, and some cheeky moves on the dance floor falls into a certain Crawford ? The 20th Century Fox musical has a shiny veneer and looks a bit stained on the edges. It's very hard for the frenetic, gym-like dance and the story is extremely thin. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives him a boost, though she's paired with the lead-based Don Ameche (in brown make-up and straight hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Bettys hearty aunt, a limousine driver who constantly sleeps at work, and Carmen Miranda, who plays herself (who else?). Argentina's stock picks far surpass the action taken on the Fox backlot and some of the supportive performance is pretty dreadful. Until the big horse race, most spectators have enough. * 1/2 of ****
