When Bob and Marion Boxletter see a man in a hotel, Marion thinks it's her long-lost brother Brian, but as she approaches, he seems to be someone else with the same face. Marion gets his fingerprints and brings them to the police, and when the identity is confirmed that it was indeed her brother Brian, she and Bob traveled to New York after investigating his whereabouts. They get Brian, but he still does not know what they're talking about, but all the couple really wants to know is where Brian has his 8-year-old son, Joey ... and even if he sees Joey, she does not know her either , The plot gets fatter and one day they think they are somebody else too. Experiments made on humans to make only the perfect killers, but the question of why they would bother putting Bob and Marion in the same building is unclear to me. Personally, Gregory Harrison played his two games great, but I have no idea what was going on with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a bit exciting yes, but that's it.
