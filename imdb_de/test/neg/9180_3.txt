Unlike most reviewers of this particular movie, I'm not really the best fan of Cynthia Rothrock, to say the least. However, when I saw that the film had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), all I had to do was watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic who has been demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush. Forster is always visible, it's just a shame that the movie itself is so damn banal and clich√©d. It also has one of the least frightening villains ever used for celluloid. Williamson returned to the Dakota character in several other films. The next one was "Down N Dirty". <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T & A; Mary Kapper goes topless <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme
