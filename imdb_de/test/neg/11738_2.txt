This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. Create a classic movie by shot. I hope nobody tries this technique again. Gus Van Sant, director of "Good Will Hunting", attempted it in 1998 by restoring Hitchcock's 1960 classic "Psycho". How in the world did Van Sant think? This remake is not nearly as good as the original. The few changes made here were of no help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
