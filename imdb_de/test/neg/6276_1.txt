This movie looked like the footage of deleted scenes from a high school movie class experiment. It did not make sense! It was well played, but I only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slopp. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity, they were crabs! The underlaid and barely seen aliens were Frisbees with legs. WHERE WERE THE STATES? Edited by Director / Author / Producer / Make-Up Artist / Gripper Latt jumps everywhere, repeating some scenes several times. Most of it seemed to have been filmed after Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone has to beat him. In 2005 alone he produced 11 films! This does not apply to writing, editing, directing or visual effects for other films. If the rest is like this snotload, he just makes fun of us. This was a battered rip-off of Spielberg's movie, nothing more. I'm looking forward to Latt's BackBroke Ridge, X-Man IIV, The Hillocks Have Eyes.
