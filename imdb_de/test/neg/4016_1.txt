An "independent" movie that promises twists, adventures and an emotional adventure on the back of the box that we'll never forget. This movie also deceives us into starring Rachel Lee Cook. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is NOTHING. The story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to interest us. All three "disturbed" characters have little background to make us worry. Once you have reached the end, everything changes in the story. Instead of catching up with the audience, you have no idea and, above all, no interest in "why". The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to be a co-star, seems to be in the film without having much experience in filmmaking. The entire piece looks like a college art film developed by a freshman attempting to hide a lack of true talent.
