I have read and enjoyed many secrets of James Lee Burkes Robicheaux. When I read that "In the Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead" was filmed and Tommy Lee Jones starred, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I turned it off for about twenty minutes and did not want more people being shot or beaten. Do not get me wrong, I do not care about blood and blood - I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Maybe I just saw 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before I looked at it. I know that Burke's books are violent and lyrical, and especially in the case of 'In The Electric Mist', like the Cajun Swamps he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. That's good in a book. It's confusing in a movie. Many of the previous reviewers are also enthusiastic admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it easier to understand that they really liked the movie. Or admire Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt that it was a waste of their talents altogether - they performed well in a movie that did not match. Well, I say that after just seeing the USA DVD and hoping Tavernier's cut will make a big difference. On the positive side: The soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes at Robicheaux were perfect - just as I had imagined the bait shop. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie and Walter Breaux as Batiste. When you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a well-balanced person at the beginning of the film, and then start beating people with different instruments. Overall, I wish she had filmed more of 'Electric Mist and the Confederate Dead' and skipped off much of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his connection to Dave and the General to Dave. Then I would not feel the same as last night when I turned it off. "What happened just now?"
