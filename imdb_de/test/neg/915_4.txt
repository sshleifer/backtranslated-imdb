It is difficult to evaluate the first attempt of a writer / director. After all, it's a movie more than I wrote or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven river. <br /> <br /> Finally, the notion that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the life of the bat, and It has even happened to fall in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you have killed. Repeating requires something original, and this film lacks originality. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie) Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames (Rosewood , Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint their performances, but had little to do. <br /> <br /> Direct to video is becoming more common, but that does not mean it has to be a waste of time. Maybe Hunter's second effort is more fun.
