It is impossible to make a film based on a book like "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostoyevsky. Richard Brooks is a great director, but this film is at a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie was the end. Well, let's think about the book. In the end we have the "culprit" Dimitrij Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. In the end, Dostojevsky's famous epilogues, friends and family made a plan to save him. But that's it ... and now the movie takes two more steps and shows us an illusory ending to the escape of Dimitry and Grushenka (I think). I am sure that Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open end, because on the one hand he is not guilty (Smerdjakov is the true murderer) and therefore he has to be a free man. On the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him, so he has decided to commit the crime ... that's a moral dilemma and the following point is an open end ... well, really, it's not fully open , <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters play in a good performance, as we have to expect from such good actors ... Above all, an outstanding performance by Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think there are not many actors who can play this role better. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning, this book is not customizable. It should never be a movie that is impossible in two hours. I think there are some longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing ... But I think that this book can not be adapted. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <br /> One point for the great director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a great performance by Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally: One point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky
