I have not learned much from this film that I did not know from CNN and The New York Times. (And I did not pursue the Enron case like others obsessed.) The film has very poorly explained what "business" is about, in which Enron was indeed on the rise before hiding his debt in Andy Fastow's created entities. In addition, the role of Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in validating practices that were later found illegal was significantly underestimated. Nor did it go as far as it needed to find out what the "investors" - all these prominent bankers - thought. With the 24-hour cable networks, the Discovery Channel and the History Channel documentations have grown. Last year, I saw many who were better than them.
