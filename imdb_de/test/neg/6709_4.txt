To call a movie boring, I would not normally call a legitimate criticism. However, if a movie is blatantly made from spare parts from other films that were not that good at first, and it's slow like molasses with no real gain, I think a spade can be called a spade. And The Ghost is a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> A movie as original as its name. The Ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being persecuted by a ghost hiding the secret of her past. Only it is much more complicated and less interesting than you think. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost incomprehensible to most of the image and the hook, the Amnesia element, just makes things worse. It seems nobody, including the writer and director, has any idea what the hell is going on. Instead, they opted for what roughly corresponds to the cinematic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, the Grudge series, and a bit of Pulse for a good measure. The half-dozen female leads disguise themselves and read their lines equally, making it impossible to tell them apart. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there's no catching. The story is not well thought out. The amnesia gimmick is lazy. The mystery element is uninteresting and is treated with little grace. The characters never derive anything, all information is distributed only by the line, which remembers its past, whenever this is favorable for the action. <br /> <br /> The cinematography, full of reflections and images of water, at least tries to add something to the subtext is a thematic connection with the amnesia and the last turn (which I will not reveal) nice, but often revised. Even the score feels borrowed and clich√©. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the curse incentive is not very interesting and the last turn is predictable and lame. "Wait, you mean that a character who has 15 minutes of screen time, but apparently nothing to do with the plot, comes back in the end? No!" The audience is too skilled for this kind of tripe. Anyone who has seen one of the films that demolishes this movie will find it hard to even keep it awake with this feature. I used to think Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (he did not make his grudge movie any less than 5 times), but even his second-rate work like Reincarnation, a movie I could not handle myself, is miles ahead , <br /> <br /> More reviews can be found at www.collider.com
