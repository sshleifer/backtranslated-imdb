Hey ... I really do not know why this movie was so appreciated, maybe I missed the point. As I see it, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that deal with "schizophrenia" and have informed, excited, shocked, aroused emotions, and forced the audience to turn away from their own reality and reflect ..... .... while it is true that Aparna Sen proved to be ambitious against the backdrop of all the other films. This is enough ..... miserable ...... it was too slow, there was no details about anything and the end .... was completely ... pointless ...... it was not Open Ended or anything .... just pointless ..... so watch out, if you want to see a good concept completely wasted .......
