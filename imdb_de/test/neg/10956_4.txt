This is a very bad B movie. Actually it is really much better than many other films. It had a consistent script, a decent director, Cinematogrpahy, and I've seen worse drama. The zombies were great, clearly they were Romero zombies and it was really an interesting zombie story. Obviously not an Oscar material, and if you're not into zombie movies or B movies, you probably will not like this, but if you are, you'll like this movie is pretty good, though they never really explain it clearly can heal from shots and zombie bites. But if he has more than one line of dialogue, then his bad actions are really obvious. <br /> <br /> It was a happy ending, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he had ever seen it.
