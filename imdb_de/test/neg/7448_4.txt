I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say I was disappointed with this first sequel would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The problems are numerous. <br /> <br /> Brilliant, even though the movie may look like there are a lot of bells and whistles on the screen, wires, cameramen, etc. - something I find totally unacceptable by someone in Irvin Kreshner's pedigree a robot , There is no spark of humanity in the figure. A real disappointment, considering that his "soul" had returned at the end of the first movie. Here his attitude shows no human side and makes it difficult for him to sympathize with him. Caine is a poor villain. OK, I know that Boddiker from the first movie was better than the average, thanks mainly to the performance of Kurtwood Smith, but the normally solid Tom Noonan creates a character who can not be less interested in one way or another. <br /> <br /> What happened to the old man ???? I appreciate that he did not come here with "nice", but the change of his character here is nothing short of astonishing. The first movie reveals that he rejects Dick Jones tactics and attitude and yet he is no better here than Jones. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Doctor Faxx is a poor substitute for Bob Morton's charismatic, if awkward, OCP genius. <br /> <br /> The action sequences save the sequence in which Murphy gets stuck on the side of Caines Truck, are tough and angry and more repulsive than entertained. <br /> <br /> And finally. What about the score? Do not tell me that Poledouris did not do that just because he was working on Total Recall. A serial soundtrack (TV or movie) is part of his personality. Part of his character. Removing this will damage the familiarity of the characters we watch. It's bad enough, but it's too bad for Leonard Rosenman. His score here is glaring, the camp and the terrible fear it deserves. The story has its moments to be fair. Here is a lot of originality. However, too many new things are attempted which can be recorded with a movie. Hob is a well-made villain and the only really passionate "cimp" in the procession, thumbs up to Gabriel Damon. <br /> <br /> The last showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for the vast majority of excessively long maturity this is a serious disappointment.
