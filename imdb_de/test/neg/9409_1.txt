For all actors and crew who have worked on this apology for a movie, another payday in L. A. For any audience hoping for a fair return to the ticket price, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we watch an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody on himself. That remained a total mystery to me. I can understand the work of the film industry and make a living from it. What I do not understand is an artist in which Al Pacino's talent prostitutes and embarrasses with this level of mindless garbage. Hopefully he chooses projects with a better value in the future ... and saves time and hard-earned money. Skip this !! Let's send Hollywood and Al a message.
