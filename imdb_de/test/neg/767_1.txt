Although this is a comic by Tom and Jerry, this is not the cat and mouse team, but a former Mutt and Jeff rip-off, in which they go to Africa and find themselves in the Disguise stereotypical cork make-up to mix. While the dialect humor is mostly lame, there is a short musical sequence with "black skeletons" that was entertaining. But I have to ask, how can Tom and Jerry keep their make-up in the water after a few more times? One of many submissions produced by Van Beuren Corporation for the distribution of RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney. Worth seeing if you are an animation fanatic or are interested in how certain ethnic groups were considered entertainment at the time.
