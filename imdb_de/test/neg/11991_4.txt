One of Boll's better attempts. Only shows that you have to improve by chance if you do something long enough. It's still not good, but it's at least observable, which is an improvement over the blood picture. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story of Farcry was not the strength of the game, while Bloodrayne had a strong history and Boll had more chances to mess it up. <br /> <br /> Film is actually pretty good. Occasionally a touch has been exaggerated, but in a good way, and it's worth a watch for just that. <br /> <br /> In this regard, it was pretty decent. Most actors are pretty good, but you can say that they do not take it seriously because of comparisons with other performances. However, the brighter mood that is given to the film actually helps. <br /> <br /> Although I think staying a bit closer to the story of the game, this could have led to a slightly better movie. However, the changes made are pretty much practical enough to make a difference. Especially considering the plot of the game Oscar was hardly a win for a FPS slaughter. I would have liked to play in the jungle as this was a pretty essential part of the game, but Canada does not have much jungle and at least it's settled in a kind of rainforest. Why? Boll has a need to change already well-rehearsed and planned schedules that I do not know, but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adjustments, it will always be missing. Watch the movie to laugh. It's good for that and maybe if you're watching a party for a party during a party.
