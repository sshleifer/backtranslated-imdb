After reading the most glowing commentary on this film, I decided to hire it despite some suspicions of television movies. I should have followed my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to warm up with the movie and find merit, but I could not. History never draws you in or sounds true, and the drama is at best superficial and, at worst, laughable. Everything in this production is amateurish. <br /> <br /> Mary McDonnell is always a joy to see and may be the only actor to escape this catastrophe without compromising her career or reputation. I will not even care about the name of the leading man - hopefully he will advertise again. <br /> <br /> Even poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I admire and respect, seemed to channel Katherine Hepburn all the time when she was really stunned at home. Maybe she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If I can save a person from wasting 100 minutes on this coach waste, I feel confirmed.
