I am a historian. This movie is so wrong that it hurts. I tried to watch with an open mind, but if you want to dive into a movie or anything like that, at least do some homework on the story, the places, the church record, and so on. Stop playing in front of the stupid audience. There are those of us out there who actually put our shoes on and go to the theater when something of this kind, worthy of a theatrical release, comes to town. A little research, everything I ask. On the other hand, the book on which it is based is a joke in itself. Basically, they took a novel with many mistakes and decided to make a screenplay out of it, spend millions upon millions of dollars, and publish an incredibly popular world publication, and at no time did anyone have the time to do a book much research about the lot. I know some of my colleagues who did it for the credit alone, or at least commissioned several students to study the different aspects for several weeks. or just pay a few dollars to someone knowledgeable, just to walk around, because I'm familiar. There are many hungry historians out there who would have seized the opportunity, if that was the case.
