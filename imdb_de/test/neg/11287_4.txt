I know nothing about the real Cobb, but I had the distinct impression that the filmmakers' goal was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation without giving us a true portrait of the man. In the film, besides some racist remarks, he's just another hard-nosed, coquettish old coot (he's so full of life!) With a heart of gold (more or less). This is also the worst drama I have seen from T.L. Jones (he brings nothing new or more subtle to his stereotyped character). He just does not bring Cobb out so he pulls me into the movie. For a minute or so, I forgot that Tommy Lee was playing Jones on the screen posing as Ty Cobb. Robert Wuhl did not impress either. The "comedic" elements in this movie were just distracting and did not sound true at all. A bloody waste of time
