* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this alleged satire, Chaplin examined the evils of German fascism and played the dual role of the Toman dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an unintentional World War I hero and Jewish barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates treaties and declares war on the neighboring Easter, while finding time for numerous, oddly flat set pieces. The dictator's oft-celebrated waltz with an inflatable ball is actually totally offended, oppressive and inglorious. Chaplin should definitely be recommended to appease Hitler and deal heavily with celluloid - his much shitty finale. Speech is actually the bold, memorable highlight of the piece - but the film is just not spicy or funny enough to do that often to praise it praised, and not to ask for repeated visits. The best gags are removed from Hynkel's tiring stance and include The Barber, who tries to avoid a large spinning bomb (a sequence that steals the clutter in The Gold Rush), and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally plank the plank from the gun slides down roof of his shop. <br /> <br /> Compared to the silent classics of the director, The Great Dictator is slow, totally inconsistent and somewhat unsatisfactory overall, while the barren proverbs between laughter are often long and hard to bear. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and The Great Dictator is certainly one of them.
