What is it nowadays that minority comedians think it is okay to slander and reckon with their minority? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When I look at comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. I think he was forced to make his show "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" version of the Dave Chappelle show. What a terrible mistake. (Note on Mencia: Please do not do a "Block Party" movie.) As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunion of the cast of "Xica da Silva" on one stage not.) <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia uses the word "beaners" just as Dave Chappelle liked the word "n". Neither is funny nor both acceptable, even if it is from "their own people". Carols Mencia also likes to say, "If you are insulted, too bad". It is not the offense, it is the defense of what is said and asked to be accepted. Carols Mencia continues - he respects everyone he considers a comedy. It's not a comedy, it's not funny. It is a finesse to be able to look at oneself and make others of the comedy laugh, not to laugh at the stereotypes other races initially believed. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Mencia needs to be polished because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what's funny and not, what gets more prejudices going, and then - do it. Until then, the show Mind of Mencia is a passport.
