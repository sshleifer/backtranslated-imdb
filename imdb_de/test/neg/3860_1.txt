I just looked at it to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I had not bothered, he can and did much better than this crap. I can not understand why someone finds this kind of stupidity amusing, but everyone is by themselves; It's an absolute mess and not funny at all. No waiting, just a line was funny, where Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family had dinner with this crazy job because he was invited to dinner (Lord alone knows why). Plague to Mr. Kent: Do you know what it's like, dog? They were there. Mrs. Kent: Not so lately, Joe's expression was funny, but that's a line that's not a great comedy about being taken to the nearest garbage truck, it's only good enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see that you are no longer in such a garbage; You are far superior and a great actor.
