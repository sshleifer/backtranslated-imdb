42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with clothes", it is by no means in the same league as its far superior Tarzan series. Basically, the Jungle Jim series was a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after he had become too bad for a loincloth. He is fully clothed in Jungle Jim. It can not be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, scripts or production quality. It's pretty hokey stuff. This is the first of the best in the series and that does not say much. There is too much footage used and that is so obvious. The score is exaggerated, the plot is lame and the production is so bad that sometimes it is difficult to look at it.
