This was a disrespectful comedy of the 70s that made the psychiatric profession and in Beverly Hills fun. I did not mind that, but I have something more against this disrespect for marriage and religion: two issues that secular filmmakers (who refer to anyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) just can not stop disappearing. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays the bizarre character "Donald Becker" walking around with a clerical collar, which offends me, but when did Hollywood ever fear to offend Christians? <br /> <br /> Despite this nonsense, the movie has its entertaining moments and even some charm. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a nutcrack and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout player. I'm sorry she did not matter much.
