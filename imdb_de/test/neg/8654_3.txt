I agree that this movie is about sex without seduction or love. Actually it makes the sex so boring and I wonder why. I do not think at all that this speaks in the distance of how Canadian second generation India feels about sex. Did you know that the first hotel / drunken idea comes from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or above? This Korean film was actually brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time compels audiences to think about the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman differences in experience and thinking. I mean, most of the Neal N Nikki hotel / drunken segment was mimicked from take to take. Can Bollywood filmmakers not only make originals, please? Seriously, I've never enjoyed a Hindi strip that's an imitation. Those I like have always spoken Indian feelings in Indian cultural ways.
