Let me start with a terrible story and a terrible control system. good animation, but not good graphics. That's why I give this game 4 out of 10. This game really needs an improvement if you ask me !!! I would redo it and improve this control system so the jaws are not so hard to control. If I wanted to improve it, I would make these graphics look better than on the movie. It will drive anyone crazy if killed so lightly. I played this and was killed by a diver when he had one of those knives in 2 hits. The dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will beg to go to the bottom of hell. This game sucks fat ass. Sorry for all the jokes, I think I'm done now. It's just that this game is so bad that it should be taken out of the store shelf. I dare you play the garbage, and you'll probably get so angry if you die so easily.
