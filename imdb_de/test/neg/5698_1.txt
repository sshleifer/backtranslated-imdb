I'm surprised that someone is considering spending some money on a movie like this. Really. Let's forget for a second that the plot does not even convey a touch of originality ... Most of today's films are based on the stories of other films. Therefore, a "simple" lack of originality is not such a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can not believe that none of the guys involved in the film had ever boarded a plane before. To be honest, this would be the only excuse to find something so ridiculous. To be honest, I think that a 6-year-old child with a fake camera could have found something technically credible. Some examples follow. <br /> <br /> The scene that really made me crazy is when the engines shut down when they regain control of the plane. If they need to turn them back on, the guy on the radio says something like "OK, press buttons 1 and 2 on the dashboard". Well, these are not buttons. They should not be pressed, they should actually be pulled up and towards the pilot. That's something only airplane-addicts would know, you say? Not correct. In the next scene you can see how their fingers press the "buttons" ... And of course, the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not even a millimeter! (And note that I have not even mentioned the fact that airplane engines are not like car engines, that you just turn the key and the magic happens ... you have to do a complicated procedure to turn them on ...) Come on guys ! You would have faked the movements at least !! Not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane bumps against every single object along the runway (light pylons along the runway, what do you think ?!) ... And the wings are not even torn off! It happened to me once ... Except that the plane was Lego! What about the flight attendant? She's actually so clever that she knows perfectly well where the fuses "aux 1" and "aux 2" are located, in the middle of the cables behind the cockpit. Should we mention the guy who can drive an ambulance and use his computer to fly an airplane behind the ambulance? And how did he turn on the other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could go on with this stuff for hours. This is the stupidest movie I've ever met, and I add garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff to the list. Do you want to do yourself a favor? Do not look at it.
