Documentary films about fans are always a mish-mash, and it's never worth looking through them, but I found this, which was made by some fans themselves, more than usual, not revealing. As a veteran of the original Tolkien enthusiasm forty years ago, I had hoped for more than the obvious - which is not always true. If someone lives who does not know the nature of a fandom or fandom because he was or knew a fan, he will not discover it here. Between irrelevant relationships, platitudes (to which the actors in the movies are particularly vulnerable) and play (by fans who make up the bulk of their only shot), I have not been able to learn much about the particular appeal of LOTR, the particular emotional responses that it evokes, and the range of special creative forms that these reactions can take. In addition, the film is rather lazy: he brings some facts into the light, which could have been communicated with little effort, eg. What exactly was the legal loophole (the wording of a copyright notice) that allowed the unauthorized publication of books in the US (which I state: I make a strong exception if the film dismisses the cover of this issue as "irrelevant" and "psychedelic" They were the work of Jack Gaughan, a very capable illustrator of the time, and some fans, including myself, found them more apt and attractive than the rivals' covers.)
