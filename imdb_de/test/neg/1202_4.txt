... but it definitely deserves only 4/10 stars and nothing more. The father of a moronic dumb child is a fighter pilot who is shot down by an Arab country. They never call the land in the film, it's really ridiculous, they vaguely refer to an Arab nation, this movie is so ignorant. But Lamar of Revenge of the Nerds is here, he is friends with the main character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives on an Air Force base, his father is Air Force pilot, but he does not manage to go to the Air Force Academy. He plans a conspiracy (with the help of his backward friends) to steal two jets and start saving his father. Yes, exactly - this is one of the greatest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can say he wanted to get Doug Masters out of the way of the movie. Well, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can not believe they made 3 sequels to this movie.
