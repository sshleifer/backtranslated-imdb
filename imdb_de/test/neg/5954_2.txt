This movie has so much in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; everything presented in abundance ... without a word pronounced !!! And how is it that it is so bad? This film will make you rethink the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology, you would all rather contradict Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis. You can not stand watching this, even when your brain is shutting down. And now you think, "I have to see that." I warned you. I take no responsibility in case you regret having spent more than an hour staring at this work of art. Well, I warned you. This should be forgotten and buried forever.
