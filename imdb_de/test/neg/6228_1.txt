I have to say that there is a redeeming blur on this "movie". It firmly sets the bottom of the barrel. Now the filmmakers know what they are aiming for when filming. Besides, I regret that I saw this debacle. What was the shameless task of this "movie"? What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's right, one hundred thousand dollars). This "movie" reminds me of the show "Adult Video Awards", in which the group of "industrial prostitutes" praise themselves and believe they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. Ironic then, as I have seen blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. I also thought it was funny that executive producer Justin Ament only had to be in the "film". He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I am sure that his "acting career" has decreased ... Ted Pfiffer, the author, has a role. He undoubtedly doubted the clich√© he had created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea plays a major role in the film. You may remember Gus Van Sant's "Elephant". I'm not sure if she wants to write this movie on her CV. And I'm not sure what a depressing point is. Money was spent to make this movie or people will see it. Together with "Torque", "Godsend" and "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", one of the worst films "If Not The Worst Film" of 2004.
