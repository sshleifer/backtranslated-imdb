Possible Spoilers Three young people who are on the wrong side of the law are being given the opportunity to change their lives and become useful members of society by writing in "The Mod Squad," a resurrection of the successful television series of ?? 60s, directed by Scott Silver. Given their less than outstanding origins and who they are and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can visit places where other cops do not Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) taps to infiltrate a run-down nightclub suspected to be the front of a prostitution ring. First of all, Julie gets a job as a waitress, while Pete and Linc just hang out to find out what they can do. Julie soon becomes acquainted with an old friend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who deals with drugs tied to the bar's shady shops. Before it's over, the "squad" is up to his neck in it while joining a line of fake police officers who are also involved with the drugs and are therefore involved in their investigation. At the beginning of the movie you feel that you are late. As if it is assumed that you know what happens to the origin and functioning of the squad. All you get here is a short bioshot bios of the three that gives you just a glimpse of their past. There's nothing about how it all came about. The idea was probably that this would make it faster to dive into the story and get things moving. While this is true to some extent, an extra background would have made the texture of the story more interesting; The way it was done here only reduces the credibility of the whole process. The plot is initially marginal, and any time spent on character development would have been worthwhile. What is delivered, and quite unimaginable, is a less than compelling story, filled with one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors do not get any help from the script or even silver. The Danes, Ribisi and Epps are about to realize Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time available to them, combined with the lack of support, they are still far too little for these people. Farina, a good actor who deserves better things than he gets here, is nothing more than a caricature of the "good policeman". There is a feeling that everything was unique in this film; some details and nuances would have driven the share up considerably in this respect. The cast includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a shame to see that the acting talent is so wasted. Much more consideration and planning should have flowed into the creation of this film. It looks like it's badly designed and badly executed. Danes, Ribisi, and Epps are like Major Leaguers stuck with the marbles in the local sand slot; Instead of shooting for the title, they were all hung to dry. As Terry says in "On The Waterfront", "You were my brother, Charlie, you should have taken care of me." It's obvious that there was no Charlie looking for them here, and after "The Mod Squad" they can all hope that something better will happen next time. I rate this with 1/10.
