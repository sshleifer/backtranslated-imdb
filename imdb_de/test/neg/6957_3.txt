First of all, do not get yourself in the mood for this movie. You do not know what to feel. So much so that you do not feel bad for Caines character when his son is murdered (mainly due to bad editing). The script was too bland. None of the situations matter if you watch them. The soundtrack or lack of it (if it was not good enough to remember) does not help a bit. The only surprise for this movie was the performance of Andy Serkis. It was on par, if not better than Caine. The story would probably have gone better if Serkis had killed him. Apparently, you do not feel salvation at its peak. Just a feeling of lack of feeling when you feel me. Basically, this film lacks massive draws. The audience remained alienated throughout the whole thing.
