When I saw this show for the first time, I thought to myself, "What is this !!!!!?" It's one of those shows where there is a perfect, fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". Then there is Sadie. This complete fit for her friends and her family. She is completely obsessed with nature, not a bad thing, but she compares students to animals! how is that? They also made another Lizzie Miguire clone (yes, because the world definitely needs another!). She is also very perfect, like most TV girls, which makes me sick! So please, that's a stupid show. It does not make sense to just skip it unless Lizzie McGuire or other shows like that.
