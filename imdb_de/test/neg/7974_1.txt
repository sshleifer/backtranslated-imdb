The first question is: How many talentless idiots do you need to mess up a movie? Answer: One is more than enough when he writes the script and conducts it. The second question is: Has anyone taught the actors to handle weapons properly? Answer: hell no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson was hit in the face with hot brass - because it seemed so damned! The third question is: How many times have we uncovered the conspiracy of the "super-secret government authority" from within? Answer: a good pair too much! The fourth question is: Are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overrated? Answer: unfortunately in this movie. The fifth question is: Can a pair of tits save this movie? Answer: Even three (Kristy Swanson's couple and the director / author) did not do it. <br /> <br /> God ... When I see the (most likely) assassin preparing his weapons for a hit, and then the idiot from the prop department give her a completely different set, the first damn thing in the goddamn movie , the "sucking" meter reaches its peak. Time from the beginning of the movie until I turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Just a bit more than I needed on "Alone in the Dark".
