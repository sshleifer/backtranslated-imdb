I was excited about the concept of my favorite comic hero on television ... and painfully disappointed in the end result. <br /> <br /> The only "amazing thing" was the crawling of the walls (despite the visibility of the cable). I did not think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he obviously was built differently than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. You could say that they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Granted, I can see it in the modern Spider-Man movies as I watch Tobey Macguire and CGI. But that's a trained eye and experience with CGI. Despite the lack of special effects, the 70s version could have been even better. <br /> <br /> The tracks were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around rather than stick to it. And what was there to give him a spider mobile in which he could ride around. Hello? He is the web singer. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry ... I did not want to be so excited, but our beloved wall crawler deserves it better.
