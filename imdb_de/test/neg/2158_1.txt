I can not see anyone saying that this was a really good entertaining movie. With some well-known actors, I could hardly believe that this was only done in 2005. It is crap! Acting is amateur drama, poor amateur drama equivalent. If you do not want to laugh out loud about the incredible 100 minutes of pure corn, you do not have to download or rent it. It's from the bygone days of acting, where cowboys shoot 8 bullets from the six shooters. The better known the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. I was extremely disappointed with Lee Majors. Did he actually throw in this kind of garbage? It was bad enough playing the six million dollar man.
