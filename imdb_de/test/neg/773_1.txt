Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro plays the crazy leader of a freak show. Every performance is flat and unfeeling, with the exception of Fondacaro's. The plot is simple and follows almost every possible clich√© of horror film. A group of high school students go to a carnival, attend a side show and climb over their heads. Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned, this is not one of his other films. This is missing in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other F.O. Ray movies are outstanding. <br /> <br /> The version I saw also included a making-of documentary in which the director made comments such as "We had a limited budget" and "With our limited timeline." how much Charles Band was interested in this movie. Borrow instead "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living" (Full Moon). Full moon should be ashamed (and that says a lot after seeing "Killer Eye"). <br /> <br /> grade: D-
