How can you describe it better than criminal criminals on TV? And I do not mean COPS in the show; Here they are actually portrayed as protagonists. <br /> <br /> I do not see a salvation on this show unless you have a perverted bent on human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star that helped Bobby Brown pull out of the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing more than a criminal. Why watch him? Why does Whitney stand by him, no matter how hideous he is? This pair should be locked up, and it is a vile shame that they make money and gain some fame by observing the septic tank that is their life and the human waste that characterizes them.
