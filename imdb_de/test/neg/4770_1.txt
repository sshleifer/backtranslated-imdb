My review is divided into questions that you should really ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat humans have been made hundreds of years ago. It was used by Nintendo for anything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It was used in a lot of low-budget movies of the 50s, at the level of the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And this brings it to a whole other level of cheese with plants that SPEAK. I did not know anyone who went out, but I know a lot of people who broke out in hysterical laughter in parts of this movie. I was one of them. Does not the horror genre deserve anything better than this laughing dunghill? <br /> <br /> 2. The characters could easily have been copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or another movie with collage kids with bad luck. But does it mean "characterizing" when the movie takes hours to tell you clich√©s that hundreds of characters had before? Do not you ever wish that a movie had characters that were not just legged legged pieces? <br /> <br /> 3. That was not bloody. A man cuts off his skin. Oh my! (Not.) A man gets his legs broken. Oh my! Gasp! (Not.) I showed my mother films that hated everything related to horror because she was getting sick, and she said, "I've seen PG movies that are worse than that! Why did she come along? R rated? " Why was it rated R? <br /> <br /> 4. Here's the only action the movie / book has: drinking collage kids, having sex, undressing, crippling, bleeding, and finally dying. This may be the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror movie. Nevertheless, this is called "ripe". What the . , .. <br /> <br /> 5. I do not think I ever saw anything less original than I saw A Beautiful Mind. <br /> <br /> Have you never sat there wishing that the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre out there, would do something. , , good, diverse? Something really original? <br /> <br /> I just wish more horror movies had a real horror, not just cheap collage parties filmed with a few splashes of fake blood / 10
