Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) looking for her lost sister. It turned out that her sister joined a sect that disappeared in the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side, she sets out to find her sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, the acting is not of the highest quality, but you get the cannibal-film girl Me Me Lai, who spends the most The time on the screen with bare chest, the female lead Janet Agren, with Gold color covered and abused with a dildo, which is dipped in snake blood, among other things. Well, that must count for something! <br /> <br /> But I have to say that it's a bit difficult to recommend this title. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably spot a few Gore scenes in the movie bar. And I mean that literally. Many of the Gore scenes are taken directly from other Cannibal films, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies in the game. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's one of diehard fans who tick their list. If you have not seen Italian jungle films, you should look at CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. If you're an avid fan, you've seen most of the gore scenes in other films.
