It hurts me to say this about an Australian movie, but Mr. Accident is one of the worst of the worst movies I have ever seen. Even more tragically, it does not fit into the category "It's so bad, it's good". What annoys me most about this film is the sizeable amount of money wasted by a meaningless, idle, underdeveloped, incompetent screenplay. Stupid Performances (What do Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast do in this garbage?) Inappropriate direction, no conspiracy, and a general sense of meanness take away the interesting production design altogether, leaving a truly gruesome taste in the mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
