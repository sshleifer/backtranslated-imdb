Victor Buono as the devil? Surely someone must have been drunk when this casting decision was made. This is not the worst part of this stupid mix of various ghost house devices, but I get my vote for being the funniest part of it. Although not terrible, the film does not even approach other 1970s Haunted House films such as Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. The evil can be entertaining in places, but do not expect fear. It's better than what it is: a stupid horror movie that gets even dumber by its overly serious approach.
