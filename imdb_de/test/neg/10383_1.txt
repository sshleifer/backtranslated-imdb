Let me tell you something ... This movie surpasses all Troma Laugh and Gore movies when it actually tries to come out as a serious movie. From the terrible acting ... "I knew it, I knew she was obsessed!" ... the priest who accepted sexual favors and showered with naked teenagers ... This bitch takes the cake. I try to compare this with another movie that is just as bad. This can only be a class of its own. The kicker is that allegedly some cardinals have overseen the production to make sure it matches the actual situation. I did not know that people from Backwoods USA act like idiots. I'm not sure I'm mad because I rented it or stumbled upon a gem of comedy. This was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I watched with half the time with my hands over my eyes (while not laughing so much that I was crying). The end just did not make sense and pulled it together perfectly. If you want to see something so terrible, it's funny, here's your movie. If you want a scary movie about exorcism ... keep going.
