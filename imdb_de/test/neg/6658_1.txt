This movie, "Desperate Measures," was ... I'm not quite sure how to put it into words. Was that a comedy? I could not stop laughing at how utterly ridiculous it was. I love Michael Keaton and I can not really understand that he did that. They did a good job of watching because I could not wait to see how ridiculous it would be from minute to minute. I just registered on this site so I can get it out. I do not check movies. I do not have time for that, but I can not let this go because I have not fulfilled my civil duties by letting people (those with an IQ of 85 or higher) say that this is no action / thriller for kindness funny. You guys, who really had a thrill of it, scares me. Watch a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's acting is not great, but in the end I was on the ball. Train your brain America!
