I love movies, all genres and from big dollar goggles to little indie projects. But even if we consider that this piece of garbage is 25 years old, and its attempt to pay homage to the 1950s, it almost suffers in some way from how we judge films. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I've been reminded of several "student films" I've watched, efforts that require creativity to fill in gaps where funding is needed. <br /> <br /> All in all, the chances for 90 minutes of your life are much better. <br /> <br /> 2/10
