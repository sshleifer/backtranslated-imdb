Seems to be a rather innocent choice at first glance - the name "Employee of the Month" could ring "Office Space" and the show "Office Clerk". I do not think so. This is not even a dark comedy. The director of this film, whoever his name was, was an idiot and has a sick, perverted mind. It's no pleasure to apologize for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals his first-class job, and lies through his teeth 24/7. The second time I enter the room when my family watches it (and believe me, they just watched it more because they were praying that at least there would be relief, maybe even a fable that sends a warm message of good righteousness done and when the good ones look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they did not have time to look good. There was no monument. <br /> <br /> This movie has border madness. It respects the old, the dead and the women - and the director tries to get people to like it. <br /> <br /> I only gave this movie two, because the soundtrack was good. But that was not so memorable. If you were lucky enough not to see it in the cinemas, definitely my friends, do not do that at home.
