This movie is, frankly, the worst garbage I've ever seen. that's slow, plots less and boring. The cameraman deserves to be shot. There were several aspects of an unintended comedy, of which Jared was a strange camp. Laughed a lot of laughter, but also yawning. Do not look at someone, no matter where you are. If you hate someone, you recommend buying or renting it. big waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant ... not. I can not say anything else but to never see this movie, it will make you jump off a cliff. Hope Gus and his colleagues read this comment before it's too late and he's making a sequel or another catastrophe with what was shot with a camera phone.
