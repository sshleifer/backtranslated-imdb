... with a budget of $ 500 and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of C films without talented actors, a ridiculous story, cheap effects, and lousy camerawork, this movie delivers. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a few friends in your backyard and a home camcorder. <br /> <br /> But the movie is good for a few laughs. Have a look with some friends and discuss how you DO NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 for an unwanted comedy. <br /> <br /> Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with fewer lines and writing is just a lame filler.
