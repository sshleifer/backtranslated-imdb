I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I could not find it. It's a really long, barely believable, barely clear conversation between three men in a set. <br /> <br /> It does not move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying plot as well. It's lost to me, definitely a walk-in movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps you from going out is the still unrealized possibility that it has a point or a meaningful climax, and the fact that apart from the irritation of the banal personalities they acted reasonably well. But you have to be prepared for endless dialogues and wish on some occasions that Teach would close the% * & * for a moment.
