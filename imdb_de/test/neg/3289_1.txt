I finally made it through an entire episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clear. I used to always turn it off because I thought it was so bad. Watching an entire episode convinces me that it's really that bad. I could not even tell you what happened, but I remember remembering not to laugh. For people who think this is the new All in the Family or married to children ... have you ever watched these shows? They are well written and well played and above all funny! This show is NOT funny. You may think, if this is the first sitcom you've ever seen. I can not see who else would. I express all previous opinions about Arrested Development etc. It's probably my own fault that I'm frustrated with the television and I'm not watching it, so the stupid people can dictate what's actually in the air.
