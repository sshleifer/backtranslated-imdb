I went into this movie expecting / hoping for a sloppy drive-in piece of 70s exploitation, but what I got was more of a bizarre pseudo-western with far too much talk and too little action. It is clear that this film was made on a budget; The locations are dull and badly shot, while acting leaves much to be desired. The plot focuses on three robbers (one father and two sons) who steal a lot of gold after killing some miners. They come across a hut that is inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother ... and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl who is currently in an asylum. It's clear that directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking. But despite all efforts, South of Hell Mountain is too boring to shock the audience. The film threatens for about eighty minutes, and most of it consists of boring characters, the boring and lengthy dialogues radiate. The only good thing I can say about the movie is the music. that's good in places. The end is the only good thing about the movie. and that's only because it's the last thing that happens. I would not recommend anyone who finds this problem ... There was much better waste in the 1970s.
