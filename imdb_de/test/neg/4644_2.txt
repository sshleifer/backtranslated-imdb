It's a truism that making a bad movie is very tiring - this is no exception. I'm not a lover of Yanks, but her amazingly simplified view of the world and its ability to reduce it All that goes with black and white as well as events (even fictitious events in novels) fit into an agenda that has little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme. Wilbur Smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate stories that deserve more than was delivered by this horrible mish-mash of a movie. <br /> <br /> Sad for those who will never read Smith. You will leave behind a less than decent depiction of his Egyptian series, which is gigantic in its depiction. <br /> <br /> The Indiana Jones movies were snappy. To try to reproduce that by manipulating Smith's novels in this production misses a mile of land. <br /> <br /> Pathetic except photography and Art Malik.
