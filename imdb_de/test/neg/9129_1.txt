Dear reader, watch out! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the audacity to call it that. If you have not been warned about the content, here it is: The film is simply a sequence of images that flow continuously, trying to convey a certain feeling, concept. They could therefore be called symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack whose purpose is to create atmosphere. The images chosen by the director, however, can only convey feelings to an American audience, since they are overwhelmingly American icons. Although the film is meant to convey the idea of ​​"civilized war," it does so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is far too long and tedious, and I felt that many scenes do not have that "War" to do, no matter in what imagination. In summary, I was very disappointed with a documentary that is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, a "something" whose only strength is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.
