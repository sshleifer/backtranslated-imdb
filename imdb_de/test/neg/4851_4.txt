I do not see what makes the whole deal about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, and that makes the movie charming, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want to get all the benefits from this, buy Patricia CD and enjoy it! The plot is simple (if the "dreams" are to be omitted); The main characters seem to love each other immediately and forget their other acquaintances immediately. The relationships seem almost "obligatory" and the little "detective story" only makes things worse. What ended up as a perfect movie at first glance, is first messed up and then comes out as a dream. I watch movies about how well I remember them, and for that I've already begun to forget the details.
