This is just a long advertisement for the movie "The Death Tunnel". Although it is an interesting story of the Waverly Hills sanitarium, the entire ghost theory is left to your interpretation. Other "Ghost Orbs" that you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and the "Ectoplasmic Mist" is just the cigarette smoke that is illuminated with the camera flash. I could not see any "shadow people" until they outlined the blurred distortions of the image. No scientific explanations have been proposed for the phenomena, only paranormal. Maybe these are just events that you have to see to believe. Be sure to make plans to visit the sanatorium on your next Louisville, Kentucky vacation.
