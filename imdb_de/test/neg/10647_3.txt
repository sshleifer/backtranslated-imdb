When the Hellraiser franchise reached its fourth film, the premise was a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist of the future who, as the prisoner builds his story about the history of his ancestors (all played by Ramsey), has created the first evil lament configuration box that makes the world evil and how his bloodline later dealt with the box. The film is a flooding with a lack of continuity in relation to the other films and lack of coherence in this film. Yes, that could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the movie or whatever. But I check the movie the way it is and not what it was or could have been. And as it is now, it is a mess. Sure, the franchise will continue indefinitely with direct-to-DVD sequels, but this was a real death knell for its chances to re-release a new play. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
