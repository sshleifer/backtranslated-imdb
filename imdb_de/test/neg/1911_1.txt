Well, if you put aside the fact that this movie offers vile spectacles; and if you put aside the fact that the story is confused and wanders in five different directions, without deciding which way to go; and if you put aside the fact that in this film I have not found a single scene that was interesting from afar; Well, if you put all that aside, this is still a really horrible movie! <br /> <br /> I suppose this is supposed to be a love story about a rich guy / poor girl. I've never really understood how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) ever started. The inexplicable romanticism is aggravated by the complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The screenplay (by Michael Seitzman) is boring to the point of astonishment. How Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle. that he would think someone would pay to see that this is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is a REALLY REALLY REALLY horrible movie? NULL, but the IMDb does not provide ZERO votes. So I give one while holding my nose.
