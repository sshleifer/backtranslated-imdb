I was looking forward to seeing two young young actors in "Dear John", but it was moving very slowly; and I felt that both the script and the direction hindered the flexibility of the lead actors. I usually enjoy movie adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the film did an excellent job of portraying realistic military action. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was very good at navigating through love letters and focusing just enough on a keyword or phrase in each letter. I felt Channing Tatum stuck in a very hang-dog series of expressions in response to the loss.
