1. watched 21.06.2001 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): A rather worthless, supposed thriller, who spends more time in sexual encounters with and without the star 'Amber Smith'. An attempt is made to wrap a story around the sex scenes, but as is common with these types of films, this is not done very well. I was so bored with this movie that I was fast-forwarded through the ending to finish it. The video version I watched was Tell Me No Lies.
