I appeared in this movie surfing the channel, and it seemed like another poorly built Christian movie about The End Times (which I found very entertaining because he takes himself so seriously). To be honest, I've only seen the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the sci-fi stuff. But it was long enough to classify it as an embarrassing and appalling account of the Christian faith, and as a rather pathetic film in the artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a script, the script was awful, the acting was mediocre and the tempo was bad. The cinematography and the direction were below average: no interesting visual elements, no superimposed plot line, no creativity. Do not blame the budget - movies can be interesting without special effects. That was not so. Christian films can not excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic field, not only because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian." <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is for Christians. ** <br /> <br /> First of all, it is unethical in any business to lure your customers and switch. I do not like being told that I can win a free iPod just to realize that I first have to spend $ 300 on participating stores. Non-Christian people do not like being told that they see a sci-fi movie and then being bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Hidden agendas do not win friends, let alone converts. <br /> <br /> Secondly, you should not use obvious threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented the Christians failed in their dealings with the skeptical "infidel" as melancholy, complacent thugs - they even go so far as to stage the Rapture to frighten him into faith. Representative dialogue: "Turn to Jesus or go to hell!" "Good, do not believe me, but you'll do it!" "On the day you die, I can guarantee you that you wish you would have paid more attention to this Jesus stuff - IF YOU ARE IN THE BELL OF HELL!" OK, I may be exaggerating, but it came about in the same way. If you think that this is a "clear message for Christ," you are wrong. I can not remember that Jesus used threats and coercion. And I do not think people can make an authentic decision out of fear of believing in him. Christians, please do not use this as a "witness" for your "unsaved" friends. It is stubborn, offensive and inaccurate when it comes to presenting a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was bad. In addition to calling Jesus a healer, there was no room for discussion or discussion, and he did not try to answer the question of whether UFOs or extraterrestrial life could exist. Instead, she offered a simple answer: "UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the Rapture takes place", which most Christians do not accept biblically or generally. Since the Bible does not mention UFOs or extraterrestrials, you can not use them as a source to draw conclusions in one way or another. The Rapture is not necessarily a widely accepted, solid biblical concept, though today most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you conduct your research (as so many of the supporting reviewers suggest), the notion of two coming of Christ (the first as the Rapture) is a relatively new phenomenon in the tradition of the Church, which was proclaimed by some evangelists at the turn of the 20th century 20 Century. The majority of Orthodox Christians are likely to perceive the message of this film as quite a stretch based on many unsupported assumptions. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film misses the note both as a worthwhile entertainment object and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
