When I borrowed this movie, I did not expect a high-quality performance, but that was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the plays were so bad that you could not easily get this movie done. There's nothing like kidding things like "Oh no, my dad is invisible!" or "I wonder what that does?" in the same monotone that could be used to report traffic announcements over the radio. There are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, though it would be pretty easy to guess given that there are not too many real action changes. Also many holes. For example, the father is invisible and the inventor determines what part is needed to make it visible again. So the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store. Could not he just ask his dad for the money? <br /> <br /> This is in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was pretty stupid, like the invisible dad, who undresses invisibly and then reappears almost nude during a meeting, or always with run around with a cloudy head. Funny at first, but it is getting old. <br /> <br / 2/5 because it can be viewed, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way ... like the monotonous recitation of lines.
