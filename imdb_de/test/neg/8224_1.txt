OK, so I have to start this review by saying I really expected to see this strip for months. I look at the trailer and think it's really cool. I just knew that the only thing cool about this cliché is. Turd was exactly his trailer. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 3 frames of this movie in the cinema and although for me "this movie is by no means that bad, do not be an idiot, give it a chance! You've only seen 3 minutes", while I rolled my eyes in shame. All these frames showed ... Get this ... a guy with a poker face (because he does not feel anything ... that's deep) and looks straight into the camera in the middle of the picture. In the second or third, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead ... because he does not feel anything), and his father calls and says "John Garden State, I'm your dad." .... Oh come on! I've seen a little more than a few flicks to hate clichés, like the "is I, your (insert parent)", how the hell am I supposed to react ?: "Oh, he's got a tough relationship with him" ... uh ... yeah, that's how I should react ... man, this is a crappy movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, we learn something about his friends, each of them an ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE CLICHÉ is. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval theme restaurant and speaks Klingon (bizarre characters + pop culture = your American standard indie strip). Then we know the character of Natalie Portman, kicking a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie, the GS 'butt, Chasing Amy), Amelie and that chick from Eternal Sunshine ... you know, smart, original (not really) , cultivated, beautiful and ... in connection with her sexuality (!). She hears a 70s band called The Shins and gives ... what? You are out of this damned decade? Why do you sound like that? Oh, they do not have a personality, OK ..... So she gives her CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a stupid face (you know, dear). As the song continued to play, I heard his lyrics say, "You'll love this soundtrack, it's so alternative and cool, you'll love this movie, it will determine you and your generation, even if it's an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club Ghost World and all the other smart teen films of the last 20 years will make you drink coffee and read books that you do not understand "... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile unoriginal sh really starts! T to happen. ... he does not care if he dies in a plane crash (because he is already dead ... and he feels nothing) and lets us know in a scene idea that comes directly from an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB! !!, it's a cool scene, but, oh, did I mention it appeared in the trailer? ....... then at a party, and when you think this guy is really deep and asexual, he does it with a bimbo .... so oh, he's not such an emotional zombie ... skillful Character development or just a Sh! tty movie? ... Well, let's analyze this scene as he sits motionless as a cou ch with all the others moving at very fast speed ...... scene idea taken directly from an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM comes! ...... so only one sh! tty, sh! tty movie ... <br /> <br /> Then you encounter more eccentric (actually cliché) characters and finally one that lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says something crap like "good luck exploring your infinite abyss" and the guy says ... and meanwhile I really wanted to "suffocate" myself ............. and then we'll be gentle said that Neo Jesus is ... oh no, wait, that's about another stupid, obvious, repetitive, overrated and clichéd bitch. Finally (finally!)!), It happens a bit more crap and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs: He has to talk to his father, whom he has not seen in the last few decades, because he (FINALLY COOL SPOILER) his own mother .. .. (you see, he killed his mother, so he's dead too ... and feels nothing ... that's deep). Now I've really only expected a clever and moving magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a son ... but this is Garden State, so it's pretty much everything: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you have I do not know what you did when you drugged me for decades, but I know you love me. Father of the happy director: No !!! No!!!! I'll say a few simple things because I'm not really that deep of a character anyway, like this whole movie actually, so no !!!! -John Garden State: No, Dad, we have to get along because we're equal individuals. I mean different individuals. No !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he gets the girl (because he's not dead anymore, you know), and the movie is over, and I go and eat a piece of chicken, that's what makes my day ... < br /> <br /> This movie made for the trailer is shit
