Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this last episode of the trilogy is a big disappointment. They were too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. The executive producer sets his own image in the movie ... It's just presumptuous. If they had to spend more than three million dollars, it might have been something. I thought Steven Soderbergh was in charge of it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqowaqatsi, directed this. I have to assume that they simply did not have the budget for a decent movie. One might think that Francis Ford Coppola wanted to be part of this movie and help to get more money together.
