I am new to Argento's work, and if this and Suspiria are an indication, then Argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than history. His films feature characters in grueling and intriguing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally flows gracefully through the sets as the characters race, stumble and make their way to a terrible end. It worked really well in Suspiria. For some reason, it did not work here. <br /> <br /> The problem I see in this movie is that the protagonist gets "help" by contacting the police and asking her friends for help, she still feels as if she refuses To get "help" when she is actually trying to find a solution to her problem. The captive in this movie is that she's trapped in the killer's little game, one that could easily leave her ... by not putting herself up so easily? In a strange way, the character seems to want the torture that the killer gives her, which in a sense is the point and could have worked, except that the whole psychology of it is thrown mainly because of what Argento wants. > <br /> As a loving homage to "The Phantom of the Opera" it is certainly an interesting and unique setting. Argento enjoys all its value in opera movements, which underlines the action well. It just does not make much sense, especially as it continues to dive into an utterly useless end (yes, I know it's an indication of Harris' novel "Red Dragon." No, it did not work). Why the character should go from a fearsome experience of capture to a willing with the director is inexplicable to me. For Argento it seemed almost independent. <br /> <br /> All in all a fun experience, and between this and Suspiria I'm more than willing to pursue more Argento productions. But this is not a movie that I would like to return to or remember. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
