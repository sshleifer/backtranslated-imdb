The film is about a day in the life of a woman who goes crazy. To show that she is mentally ill, she excels a lot and the narrator tells us that she is "insane". On the way there she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be Orson Welles' brother, and he later takes a header in one of the only interesting moments in the movie is a weird little movie that's made very cheap - and that shows it for sure. The film was shot without sound (probably 8mm or another cheap movie) and had some sound effects and a nasty narrative that was added later. In fact, the narrative was the most intrusive and unintentionally funniest I've ever heard, and it's said so silly and over the top, you just have to hear it to believe it. As a result of these cost reduction measures, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​making such a film was quite original. Besides, it is VERY difficult to survive the whole movie.
