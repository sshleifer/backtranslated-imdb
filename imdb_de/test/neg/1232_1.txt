Please do not waste six hours of your life watching this like me. The fact that I did that is not very good thinking about me. The only redeeming acting job in this clunker was from Wes Studi. How a "prequel" with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove is a mystery to me !! It was a disconnected, vast, incoherent story. Plot lines were not developed, action scenes were almost ridiculous and the big end (disappointment) was the fitting end of this miniseries. Val Kilmer, whom I thought was a serious actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen him in. I have been reading these reviews for years and this show has caused me to sign up !!!
