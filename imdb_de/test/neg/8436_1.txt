One of the greatest lessons I've ever seen in the movie happened this way: <br /> <br /> I worked in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other Wanabees before and since, doing an internship and trying to find out Learn how everything worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and her own producer, asked me to invite a band. I'm not sure why she wanted to see it. I had the impression that it was a student film or a show role, something of a kind of business card. Whatever the reason she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at the time was in the room I worked in, and I was the next person on the machine. I started the tape. <br /> <br /> Fade in: A figure was sitting at a desk on the screen looking at the camera. Behind him, to the left, a door that opened into the room. On the opposite wall was a wardrobe. A second character stepped through the door and began to speak. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned around to answer (that's all you need, static camera, no cuts or dolly shots, just a locked camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the wardrobe and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said, "I've seen enough." and left the room. <br /> <br /> What she had seen in the ten seconds of the movie she had seen was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turn their backs on the camera that supplied the lines? No sorry. Next! So long have you. Ten seconds. Make it up in the first shot and you're dead. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of that moment when I watched the opening of this bitch. After an endless journey in the jungle, we see several monkeys, apparently in cages. A man with a gun laughs. A jetliner lands and we see that it drives all the way to the terminal. God, that's boring! Cut into the interior of the airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something happens! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the film, which are in some spatial relationship with each other and the guy has teamed up. "Not Crossing The Line" is one of the basic rules of film grammar that keeps the characters from jumping from one page to another on the screen and confusing the audience. The audience does not like being confused. Mystified Perplexed? Confused and fascinated? Yes. The audience loves it all. Confused? They lose them. They go out. "Not Crossing The Line" is one of the things you should or should meet in film school. It's basic stuff. It is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules). Directors break them all the time - but not at the first real cut. <br /> <br /> I thought, "I have seen enough". And off
