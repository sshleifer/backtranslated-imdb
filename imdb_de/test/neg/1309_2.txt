Wrongly directed, badly directed and abominably written. This is understandable if you have one or two hours to kill or suffer from insomnia, but only just. Robert Carlyle recognizes his potential as a high-powered actor with only one expression of his repertoire (a chronically clogged football hooligan who maintains a weak inferiority complex), which he sometimes modifies slightly by inflating his nostrils and exposing a line of crooked yellow teeth (This indicates anger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, mirth, compassion, etc.) In his role as "the best naval engineer in the UK" and son of a university professor, he is as compelling as my neighbor Tom Courtenay's cat, who is also miscast is, each line trimmed and scanned, the eyeballs appear permanently in the sun and seems no longer able to distinguish a flood from a puddle of his own urine, if he would stand in it. All in all, another stupid attempt by the British to emulate Hollywood pulp most likely. The dialogue is a series of badly supplied stereotypes. the action is incoherent; The plot is pointless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even make it into the two-dimensional ground of their American counterparts.
