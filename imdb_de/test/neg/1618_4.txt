With stupid horror movies like "Troll" and the indescribably cruel cult favorite "Troll 2", it's virtually impossible these days to take movies with goblins, dwarfs and various other little green hobgoblins seriously. I've recently seen the 70's movie "Do not Fear the Dark," which is basically a pretty frightening and serious movie about little goblin monsters, and yet I can still think back to the laughing potato-heads that dressed in garbage bags and running amok in "Troll 2". The same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried to go into "Inhabited" with a clear mindset, I unconsciously forgot the supposedly weird and threatening garden fairies with the ill-modeled goblins of Nilbog! Despite all prejudices, "Inhabited" is still an entertaining, albeit unbelievable horror movie. It's a cheesy, soft and politically correct pastiche from family drama and Northern Europe's mythology. The annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie are not easy goblins. They are "The Huldre": evil little Norwegian demons who live in the underground and try to chase happy families out of their homes by influencing the youngest children. This overcomes the Russell family as they move into their rickety dream home in a remote small town. MILF actress Megan Gallagher's cherubic-blonde daughter starts behaving strangely as she hangs around the cute playhouse at the back of the garden. She claims her friends are fairies, and although the sinister craftsman also warns of strange events in the past, Gina's parents simply believe that the girl has difficulty adjusting to her new neighborhood. If she rattles about fairies again and again, they make an appointment with the renowned psychologist dr. Werner, while "The Huldre" slowly comes out of her botanical shelter. Not to mention. The pace is acceptable and the attempts to build tension are pretty cute. You understand that this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder sequences are shown graphically here. Heck, even the carcass of the family's pet cat is kept away from the screen. This is the umpteenth, nonsensical horror movie Malcolm McDowell appears in and is almost always an unreliable, greedy and selfish authority figure.
