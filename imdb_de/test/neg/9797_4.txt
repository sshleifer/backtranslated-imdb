The plot here is simple. The country boy Lem (Farrell) goes to town to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, Kate (Duncan), and marries her. She brings her to a hostile father and a group of hungry women. There are shades of YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, and MICE AND MEN. The courtship, which takes place in two long sequences in the restaurant, take the first half hour and are lethargically timed. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is proposed by Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the Reapers. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this boring potboiler that lacks the insights and cinematic beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbone, so we focus on a "real man" (Mac) who distracts Kate from everything. With sympathy of the audience, the film loses its narrative progress. The conversion of the father at the end of the film is unrealistic and unbelievable and leads to an artificial dissolution. This movie is for fans of the stars and the director only - the general public does not have to worry about it.
