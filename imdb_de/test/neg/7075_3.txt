I have watched this movie and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I did not know what to expect, but once the movie was out, it was nice to see it. The idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror movies is finding a happy ending. But there the film has failed. For a change, a final scene in a hospital in which suddenly all employees are gone. At first you see doctors and nurses walking around, but then they all went home. <br /> <br /> No cries for help while being chased by Tamara, flight to the roof (also a smart move ... not) and of course a kind of open ending. <br /> <br /> No .... the movie started off well, the main part was nice to look at, but they really screwed up the end with all the clichés of bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed in my eyes with this film after he shot some really high quality movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a good horror full of cliché endings, Tamara is a good movie. For me, I like movies that surprise me.
