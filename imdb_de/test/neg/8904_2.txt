This movie has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately it is not a big movie. It's more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a celluloid piece edited by the newspaper. However, their average researched piece is much bolder and more concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker seeks to communicate the plight of African life, particularly Mali, to the viewer through the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8, and the World Bank by using a mock trial of the foregoing. There's an extra 10 minutes throughout the movie that make a half-hearted attempt at a narrative, and a bizarre Hollywood western shootout scene where the director seems quite content with his own wisdom (hence the frequent Godard comparisons). Of course, at the beginning of the film, it is never clear what and who is in court, but as we now know, the French refuse to feed their audience with spoons. <br /> <br /> There are many passionate arguments, but they are often lengthy, delivered in shrill monotone (one that is fairly easy to hear after some time), and very accurate. The last point is the most frustrating of all, as there is a very justified special case against the institutions here in court. Unfortunately, in just two hours, we're just getting the IMF and the G8 evil oppressors and forgiving Third World debt. We are only occasionally given an indication of the specific reasons why the organizations that are being tried are guilty, but never a clear case. The pseudo-arguments and footage of the surrounding village make the suffering of these African residents clear, but one wonders why we need two hours to paint a much more accurate picture in a 20-minute Newsweek article, or Bill Moyer's episode , In the end, something very important to say on this subject is simply not presented very well or very clearly in this presumptuous, forgiving piece.
