I can not understand why someone would make such a movie. From start to finish this movie is really, very bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are all very shallow, terribly played and absolutely annoying. There is absolutely nothing going on beneath the surface, either with characters or a plot. <br /> <br /> The "humor", if you can call it, is addressed to an adult audience (I assume that this is language and nudity), although it works primarily as a toilet humor and it Had trouble pulling a smile from a half-understood 16-year-old, I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It has nothing that would please a movie fan. Non-existent laughter and an action that barely exists make me ask, "Why was this movie made, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> I expect in the abundance of time that this movie is at the top of Top 100 Worst Movies.
