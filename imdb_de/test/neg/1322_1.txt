What a shitty movie. This is undoubtedly a low-class B movie. The German elite Storm Troopers attack Russian mass bunkers like an old battle from the First World War. The action is mediocre, the action thin and threadbare. It's sometimes hard to track where it's going. The action sequences are pretty worthless (if they show any) except that they use authentic World War II equipment / vehicles. This is by no means at the same level as "Saving Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". Many worthless attempts at character development that lead nowhere. Good officer / bad officer, who is very predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12-year-old kid is putting them up. I could have controlled better. Too bad, that's the same guy who did "The Boat" because that was a great movie. He must have celebrated too much after this success, because he has certainly lost contact in this film. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it.
