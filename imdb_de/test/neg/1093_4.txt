I do not know if this exceptionally boring movie was meant to be an unofficial sequel to "The French Connection", but it has many of the same drawbacks: the script is so confusing that the viewer remains uninvolved and does not feel in the picture and the direction so cold that it lacks energy, that even the great chase sequence can not enliven things. (* 1/2)
