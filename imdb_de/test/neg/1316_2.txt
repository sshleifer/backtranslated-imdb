At first glance, the movie looked like it was really good - that's not the case. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing. The real catastrophe in this movie is not the flood but the script. An attempt is made to include every clich√© in the book, all incredibly bad. The end is very abrupt, but this is a blessing in secret. Congratulations, if you get this far. <br /> <br /> All three main actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) would certainly agree that this is the low point in their career. I hope they paid a lot of money because their reputation is not really expressed. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same was done much better in The Day After Tomorrow. <br /> <br /> In short, a pointless exercise. Do not waste your time.
