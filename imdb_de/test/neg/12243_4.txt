This movie is an uncompromising comedy in The Airplane's or Naked Gun's lines, but it does not approach these two because it lacks originality and a little smarter joke, instead of just throwing away old simple jokes with the same movie. <br /> <br /> You can find out some references to other movies. From my head I have identified Dodgeball and Rocky. So you can enjoy it and find out what movies are spoofed. <br /> <br /> The film also offers an occasional laugh, but nothing that can lead to injury, so nothing really funny. <br /> <br /> I liked the character IPod in some ways (even though some of the jokes with it are standard comedy 101.) <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and like most weird / nonsensical comedies depends on the mood you are in. So if you think, you'll laugh For every joke watching this movie If you're in a serious mood, forget about (re) watching the plane instead They definitely make you laugh
