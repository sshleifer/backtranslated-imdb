Yash Raj movies are so funny, whatever the works are, they follow her, even though they are called the best production house br /> <br /> The movie is so horrible that it contracts you <br /> <br / > The jokes are so bad and so horny that he can beat them. Uday is like a gay and a monkey. <br /> <br /> Tanishaa resembles an idiot <br /> <br /> The director believes that we are all idiots. Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted that music saves grace. Camera work is good, Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g, if Kajol was annoying then Tanishaa is worse, the rest is okay
