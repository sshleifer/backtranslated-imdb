I just do not understand. Why is this called a sequel to the movie "American Werewolf" when it absolutely has NO connection with it? The first movie was funny and scary with groundbreaking special effects. (If memory is available, the Oscar category for special make-up effects was created for this movie.) "Paris" is none of this. Terrible effects and not much else. Do not see this movie Rent instead the original "werewolf in London". You will be much happier.
