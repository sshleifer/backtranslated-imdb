As sweet and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks does not seem to have enough flesh to last for an hour and a half. I thought the first half hour of this movie would be worth seeing. It was fun, it had a few laughs, it was full of energy. Then it somehow lost. I would not even say that it faded because it seemed pretty abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter has noticed too. She is 4 - she laughed several times in this first part of the movie, then she stopped laughing. Maybe it took too serious a tone - the evil movie producer who was working the Chipmunks to death. It happened anyway and it was not for the better. <br /> <br /> Of course the film tries to tell the story of how the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) started. Everyone knows the Christmas carol. Here we learn how they met Dave and got started. The film has been updated to its current state, although its true origin is from Dave's street address from 1958, the year in which the animated singing rodents were created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job when Dave and the Chipmunk voices were pretty good as well. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me that he was blunt, and I could not figure out the meaning of Claire's character played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can see with the kids - it's probably a movie you just want to see with the kids. It gets a 4/10 from me.
