Normally, I prefer French movies much more than American ones, with explosions and car chases, but this movie was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler, because nothing really happens. This French couple has been living in Lisbon for years, returning to Paris for a friend's wedding. They tell another friend they're having dinner with, that they're going to split up. Then not much happens, they do not seem to know if they want to split up or not. I do not necessarily think her hesitation leads to a bad movie. It is very human to hesitate to make such a decision forever, but this could be treated in an interesting way that gives some flesh to their desires and their relationship, but that does not happen. You come out of the theater and know not why the two have come together or want to separate. The only piece I enjoyed was the conversation with the drunks. That was true to life.
