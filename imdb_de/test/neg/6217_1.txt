I can not remember a more trivial, startling and flatter movie, in other words a real chick movie of the worst kind. How can anyone watch and recommend this movie? Only if they do not like to admit they have made a mistake. It seems to summarize the worst female aspirations. No real substance for everything happy and flat. Yes, that will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a minor burden from Drivel. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes before the start. And to think, I paid 7 pounds to see that! But I think that, as with most media, this is the demise of the cinema nowadays. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or how?
