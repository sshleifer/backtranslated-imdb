This one was really terrible. With fascinated horror I kept watching: "Why did you do that?" In other words, all the scenarios were taken from "The Day after Tomorrow", "The Perfect Storm" and "Twister" and remixed with every catastrophe film in a three-hour miniseries led by longtime junk TV director Dick Lowry. that is known to man, and not an ounce of real tension. Many of the performers were unknown Canadians and shooting was shot in Canada, Winnepeg doubled for Chicago, so tax relief certainly had something to do with it. Although some ambitious special effects have been tried, the performance is so bad that no decent acting is achieved. The actors can be a competent lot; The script is so bad that nobody had a chance to show it, except perhaps for Randy Quaid as Tommy, the tornado hunter who was directly over the top and quite amusing. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, manufacturers have since produced another Canadian disaster turkey named "Category 7 ?? the End of the World", which was released some weeks after Hurricane Katrina CBS in the US was shown very tastefully. How could the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do that? In prime time? PT Barnum: "No one has underestimated the public taste," has once again proved to be the right one.
