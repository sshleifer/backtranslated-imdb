The Toxic Avenger, Part II, begins with the startling discovery that the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura, who was apparently fired during production and replaced by Ron Fazio) freed his hometown of Tromaville from evil, actually became a beautiful place to live. This meant that Toxie was no longer used as a superhero and now suffers from depression and a feeling of utter uselessness (just as directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz feel about it). Now Toxie works as a concierge at the Tromaville Center for the Blind. It does not take long for trouble to have an ugly head. A nasty chemical company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take on Tromaville for some stupid, insignificant reason, but they have to get rid of toxicity. After failing the evil ruler's first plan (Rick Collins), he convinces Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. His girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his home behind Toxie are moving to Tokyo, Japan. Once there, Toxie starts searching for his father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi), who helps him with his search. In the meantime, Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. got involved in the kill and without it the citizens can not fight back. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka), whom he believes to be his father, but Big Mac is part of Apocalypse Inc. and plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by: Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz. Essentially, this follow-up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) proves that the first film was a complete coincidence, a happy coincidence that combined the right mix of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence, and such terrible results. The Toxic Avenger, Part II , is a good movie. The script of Kaufman, Phil Rivio and Gay Partington Terry with a lot of additional material does not contain a single funny moment during its entire duration of 102 (unabridged Director's Cut). The visual gags are awful, Toxie is running with a wig and glasses through Tokyo, for example, or a scene in which he heats a bath with a bad guy in it and while he's cooking, Toxie throws a load of vegetables and spaghetti, a scene in which he puts electrical cables in the nose of a woman, an antenna in her head, and a microphone in her mouth, in which a Japanese broadcaster speaks, a bit where a Japanese villain burned his nose in the form of a fish, a bit Where Toxie grabs a swordfish's head and uses it as a weapon, or the embarrassingly over-acting and stupid idiotic facial expressions. A guy literary having a fish for a head is turned into sushi, the horrible comedy music and the sound effects & the whole movie is generally a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing and memorable. The bad taste buds are not included this time and the silly childlike, youthful humor of the first one is missing as well, it just feels like a real step from the original and lets not forget that this is Troma, so this is definitely a worse thing. There are a few bloody battles and a lot of blood and violence, at least in the supposedly uncut 102-minute version I saw, shattered heads whose bodies spattered blood, battered faces, guts, roses in some eyes and thorns Wrapped around his neck, ragged ears, severed arms and a very graphic and bloody scene of a man being torn to pieces. Unfortunately, the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not very convincing and mostly come within the first 20 minutes. The spectacle is, as I have already mentioned, embarrassing. Action-wise, there's an extremely cheap-looking chase at the end and a few nondescript, lackluster battles throwing cardboard ninja stars at one point. Horrorically, there is nothing that makes up a few bloody set pieces. Comedy, that is very unstable. In fact, The Toxic Avenger, Part II, really sucks in at all levels and to top it off, it's disgusting. Most cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner, continuity is absent, cinematography is fundamental. Shoot & the special effects are anything but. One or two bloody scenes, this is totally shit & easy, do yourself a favor and look at the original again instead.
