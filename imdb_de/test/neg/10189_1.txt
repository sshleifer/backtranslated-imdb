After a good start, it proved to be the worst piece of sacred than the propaganda I've ever seen. This film is an open insult intended to make you feel unwell if you do not read the "holy bible". <br /> <br /> To continue ... OK, let's call it a conspiracy ... Basically, aliens do not kidnap people (whom we already know ..). No, in fact, the demonic forces kidnap people in New Age stuff or witchcraft, or read a porn magazine (as a protagonist does). <br /> <br /> It's complete with the little emotional piano music when the main character realizes He must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> A quote sums it all up, imagining subtle piano music in the background: "You can not let others, even those you love, stop you from following that, sir .." <br /> <br /> and we are to live in an enlightened age ... still working. Boycott this piece of crap
