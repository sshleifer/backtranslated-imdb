I really wanted to like this movie. A movie in which zombie children came out of a mine to kill people at night really did seem like a great idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film was in the last three of the films that were played at the horror festival. A mother and her two daughters try to move on after her husband / dad dies of a disease that has cost her family a child a lot of money. They have to adapt to their new environment. In the end, they fight for different reasons for different reasons. (Crazy Zombie Kids are in this category.) For anyone who lives or dies, the film has no sentimental attachment, the film does not create frightening moments that the movie barely shows the kids do what they're supposed to do ... kill! With a bigger budget and a better cast, this film could hope. Pass on until then. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 actually.
