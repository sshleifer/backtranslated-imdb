How is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? Were you forced to? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of ​​how things would turn out if a comedian ran for the president. They do not even try to give an impression of it. Just when you thought you would see a commentary from famous Liberals on DC politics (the first five minutes), the movie is about to run on the street and in B-movie drama about 1) a computer voting mistake, 2) the evil ones Business suits, who wants to cover it with the unoriginal lines of history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely pretty programmer who's trying to tell the incoming president about it. She is soon the victim of the computer company's evil X-files masters, who instead of killing her drugged her to make her untrustworthy. But when she comes to DC, she does not tell him. In fact, the film then changes from B-movie drama to the idiotic B-movie love drama. So far, we are so far from the film's original starting point that most people shut it off. I almost did it. If only it could be SMART, love drama, but no! It is not! It's the kind of "Oops, I'm so nervous that I'm stupid the whole time, so please love me for that" - love drama. Everything at a slow, slow pace has nothing to do with the film's political plot, the film's X-Files plot, or the film's comedy plot. All diagrams fail on all levels, which reminds every annoying part of meaningless dialogue. The love affair must be the result of a decision made while drinking. "Hey, there has to be a dynamic of love between the presidential candidate and the extremely pretty programmer, yes, that will work, plug it in!" <In the meantime, Lewis Black is castrated and put into a role where he can not find a single line from Lewis Black. The Lewis Black Rage is replaced by the hope that she will eventually appear in the movie, which she never does. Christopher Walken is sent to a hospital heart condition to copy the dramatic effects of the President's closest support of the heart attack in Westwing. If Christopher Walken, like Lewis Black, is castrated in roles that are constantly uphill to sound casual and western, but fail every time like Titanic, it's like watching a big blue whale die on a beach. Heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And then you enter the low point of the entire film: It raises the insanely, enormously difficult ethical question: Should Robin Williams continue to be president and know that he was chosen for a computer? Breakdown? The American Dream And All Good prevails when he rejects the presidency on live television as Dog Lassie would. With the usual patriotic glamor of the president and the historic atmosphere created by us, Westwing cultivated in morbid abundance for the next million years. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriter Barry Levinson is now on my personal list of writers and directors I'll stay away forever. This film is to be understood as a symptom of a flawed production process in which people (including Barry Levinson) had to spend production money because of their personal relationships and not their abilities. This is a project that satisfies the desire of low-skilled professionals for career success, and the aforementioned major actors have been tempted to attend. That's the only explanation that can exist. <br /> <br /> PS: The reconciliation error in the computers was due to the double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course, what if you could write a script and not distinguish a computer from a dishwasher?
