Rock Hudson's second company in the Seconds science fiction genre is Embryo, a film that unites elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion in a rather strange movie about the lack of a better word, a test tube baby that becomes Barbara Carrera. <br /> Hudson is a scientist who experiments in organic evolution. He has the chance to experiment with his own Doberman dump truck first when accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some bitch pituitary secretions are given to a pre-term puppy and, remarkably, it develops into an adult. Amazed at his success, Hudson takes a fetus from a dead casualty and gives him the same stuff. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And it is developing physically and intellectually at an amazing speed. What she does not do is develop emotionally. Hudson still spends her as his new research associate to friends and family members such as sister-in-law Diane Ladd, son John Elerick, and daughter-in-law Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> Embryo does not explore some of the real problems of this type of science, but instead uses it instead. The special effects are, as they are, rather secondary. Hudson seems to have lost interest in the project about halfway through the film. Now it would have been really interesting if he'd had a small child and grown into a Harlequin novel hero. That would be something Rock Hudson could have put his teeth into.
