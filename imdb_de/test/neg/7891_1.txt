This is a movie about a black man who buys an airline and turns the company into an African center over the top airliner. They even set up the owner to not only control the airline, but also control part of the airport terminal. One day, this guy wins $ 100 million on his next visit. He goes through the whole airport and behaves like the owner of the airport. Everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie gets parody! This movie is a flop and will forever be in the $ 4.95 ton at Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> I can not even understand why MGM wastes $ 16 million on this film. This movie does not even guarantee a direct video status. The writers (black and white) should be blacked out of Hollywood forever. They not only stereotype black people, but they also portray them as ignorant people. I would be ashamed to go to a movie that constantly humiliates me. Do not waste your time at the video library, at Wal-Mart, pay-per-view or on a Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS.
