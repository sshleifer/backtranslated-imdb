I do not see any point in making so much effort to do a film like this and then throw the history book out the window. There was no exact detail in this movie except the fact that Richtofen died, which I was thankful for in the end, so I did not have to watch anymore. Films like these are an insult to anyone familiar with the history of the First World War. <br /> <br /> I'll skip the obvious that they flew with Fokker DVII in 1916, because the Blue Max did so too. The 209 squadron flew SE-5 and will attack other parts. First, they call the Palatinate D-III initially an "old albatross". Second, they have Voss, Goering and Wolff in Jasta Boelcke. The only one who was in this Jasta was Voss, and he joined Boelcke's death. Richtofen had no blame for Boelcke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who had collided with Boelcke, had turned away to avoid a British plane chasing Richtofen. When Richtofen received his head injury, it was an attack on a FE-2d two-seater, and he did not crash into the trenches and let himself be argued by soldiers, and NO. Werner Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic battles of the First World War. Manfred was short, not like the actor who towered over everyone else. His brother Lothar was also never in Jasta Boelcke, he was a member of the squadron, as Manfred took over the responsibility for Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other blatant mistakes in the historical fact that I'll let them go, except maybe the worst, the death scene. In the film Manfred von Brown is outmaneuvered and then shot down to achieve a perfect landing. Brown got a strike in Richtofen while Richtofen chased May, and the facts collected over the years show overwhelmingly that Richtofen was killed by ground fire, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this movie was the chance to see the air scenes that were as good as "The Blue Max", otherwise I will not watch them anymore and I have $ 30 for that Band paid!
