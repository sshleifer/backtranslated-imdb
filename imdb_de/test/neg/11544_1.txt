You do not have to spend a lot of time watching this movie or serial pilot movie, or whatever it is meant to be, to find out exactly what's in the stores. The incredibly bad music score celebrates its debut from the beginning. Seriously, if this is not the worst topic I've ever heard, I certainly can not remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles and Sal Mineo, the writing is cruel and the story is invented, filled with bland stereotypes and an obvious rip-off of Ken Kesey. Why does Hollywood always have to present stories from the sixties, as if the so-called hippies were all one-dimensional idiots? It's too bad that such an interesting time in our exceptionally compliant social experience is generally portrayed through and through garbage, so that the slightest insult to the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic, when almost none of it comes as close as it really is was. The best I've seen so far is a memoir called Looking Back by a man named Becker, but who has heard of it? Nobody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They're too busy bitching tricks like that groan of a movie to deal with reality.
