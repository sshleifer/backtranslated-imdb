This is a textbook example of how Hollywood has not (not) trusted moviegoers and done their big name stars. The character of Christian is completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah has of his own army group is virtually eliminated, Michael's story is vastly altered, and the end result is the decimation of the power and terrible beauty of the book. I almost wish I had not even seen it, because movies (sounds and images) resonate so much in your brain. Rather, I would only have left the impression of the book. The book could have been written today, it is so honest and courageous. The movie too. My advice: skip the movie; Read the book.
