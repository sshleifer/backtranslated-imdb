Normally, BBC productions by Jane Austen are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just weird. What did they think? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the gothic novels that Austen so derisively mocked. Not only that, the "gothic" sequences are sticky, over the top and, frankly, stupid. The actress Miss Morland plays is poorly staffed and has no obvious incentive to attract the attention of a qualified bachelor, and though I prefer the weird Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he's not a bit of a novel, even if he issues dialogues directly from the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney presented himself in one of his few terrible "ham" performances. This movie was so bizarre and strange that I actually looked at it again, just to see how terribly wrong it was.
