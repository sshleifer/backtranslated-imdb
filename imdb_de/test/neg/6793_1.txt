This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, and so on. The only reason I ever see it is that my stupid wife likes it. How many times can Norris fly through the air to kick an obviously blind villain? No trees, no buildings, just weasels ... thin air. He ALWAYS solves the case or is the best, whatever the skills are. No co-star ever gets the glory. It's all Norris. It's really obvious that Norris is terribly attached to himself and will not allow anyone to record him in any scene, no matter what the content is. Terrible drama, terrible screenplay, terrible series.
