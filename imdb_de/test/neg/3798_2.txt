This movie is in a dead relationship with the original for the worst movie ever made. I think this could be a little worse, if that. SPOILER ALARM !!! Here are these survivors on a ship that was capsized for a long time. Unlikely? No impossible. The whole premise is so ridiculous that it is not funny. There are some pretty big names in the movie, and even they could not save this pretty thing. I really think it's a waste of good celluloid. Unfortunately, after seeing this, I also decided that it was a waste of time. Do not bother with this. Or the original for that matter! I gave him a 2, mainly because they throw out votes of 1.
