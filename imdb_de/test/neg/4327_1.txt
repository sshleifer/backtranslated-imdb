I felt that the two hours I spent on this film might have served better if I had gone to the local antiquarian and searched for old fashion magazines and Halston advertisements. Or maybe by watching the paint dry. These two jobs would have taken me at least a little more than "India Song". The most frustrating part was that I was able to find out which moods / atmospheres were being tried, and the idea of ​​them could have been interesting if they had been worked out more. Instead, an incoherent, stupid chain of non-events was presented - with the same scenes being washed over and over again to make a point in our senses. This film was written by writing a kind of review, except to other people to warn against this waste of time.
