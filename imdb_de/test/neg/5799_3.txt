I have to say, I was really excited about this movie before I lent it, as it was a production of Adam Sandler's "Happy Madison", and I usually feel attracted to such stupid humor. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments at the beginning of the movie, but this movie was missing everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many films that are not realistic can still be funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was very bad, the plot made no sense at all. I can not get over the fact that 3 stylish older ladies are even campaigning for such bad writing. All in all, I was unimpressed by this movie and I do not recommend wasting 5 euros for the rental.
