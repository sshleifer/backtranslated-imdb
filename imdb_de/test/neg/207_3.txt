The sounds in the movie were so banal and ridiculous, serious knocking on the door hinges for about 30 minutes, really gritting his teeth and hurting his head. <br /> <br /> I love bad puns more than the next man, but come on "no blood on our hands" what Matt Dillon's character said about a million times, and when Matt Dillon's character shoots the bum, the main character that I do not remember, because I do not really believe that someone is interested in blood on his hands literally. <br /> <br /> The background music with the heavy metal guitar, which sounds like an A chord for about 5 minutes, is not my idea of ​​music. I had the worst headache at the end of this garbage.
