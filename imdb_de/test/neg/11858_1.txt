My brother-in-law and his wife took the movie overnight to watch videos. This should have given me the first hint that it would be terrible. It was. This movie is terrible from the first to the last picture. It does not even register as a "B" movie. Maybe an N or P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. From Raptor-on-a-Sticks made of rubber, to the still-breathing corpses in the car, to the dreadful final lines, this film is not worth it if you get it for free. Skip this altogether - if you do not mind the Mystery Science Theater To play with friends, it offers a good ammo.
