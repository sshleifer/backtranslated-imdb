The horror. The film about the Nazis - the Germans. The murderers of babies, young girls rapists ... For that they regret it? What interests you to be thousands of miles away from Germany? You do not come to my mind? Fascists are good Samaritans now? Think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. No, of course they do not want to. They were forced to give Hitler, he gave each one of them, and they were forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarussian peace, all Jews, Gypsies ... kill the Slavs. The Facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when they were captured by fascists, they were defiant and outrageous. We kill you all and so on. Since 1943, when they were captured, they suddenly became fascists and peaceful peasants forced to join Hitler and personally. Because such films should be imprisoned for the glorification of fascism for life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what you have done, you are still in Stalingrad, then watch the movie "Come and See" (1985).
