I know that so many reviews of IMDb are extreme, and the reviewers either praised a film to the limit or tore it to pieces inappropriately. I find none of these reviews helpful, and that's why I do not give this movie the dreadful review I'm about to go recklessly. The movie is a kind of house-sci-fiction of the worst kind, disguised as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers attract you by showing you what appears as a coherent plot, but really just a tiny part of a wantonly enigmatic series of events that are never properly resolved. I like movies that challenge the viewer, and I do not need to spoon-feed an action, so my complaint against this movie is not that it's too high. No, the movie is just awful. When the credits roll, you'll feel real rage because you've lost your time playing Cameron Diaz's wooden games and a wavering storyline. Avoid.
