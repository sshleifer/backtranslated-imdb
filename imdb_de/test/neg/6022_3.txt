This movie was a waste of time. It's nothing but a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable representation. My feelings are not connected to the characters and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you look for something else because the movie is so boring because you already know what's going to happen. The other half of the time you desperately hope that the protagonist grows a pair of balls or ends his life by jumping from a bridge or something. Also, the subordinates are mostly one-dimensional. The characters of this movie have no depth! No depth
