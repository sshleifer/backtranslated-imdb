Well, where should I describe this celluloid debacle? You already know the fat fat NADA that passes by as an act. Let us point out that this is the PC that is offensive. It's hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who made us laugh like riots like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, caused this merry mess. <br /> <br /> So this guy does not know he's gay until that actor shows it out OK for sure. If anyone says that I'm gay, I know the truth, even though I currently like girls more than George Luca likes a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how can I recognize the true nature of my sexuality? If I like classical literature, dancing and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. When I quickly dress like a blind man (with half my shirt), I'm straight. Oh, sure. <br /> <br /> And here's the big cliché of clichés: No matter what you look like, there's always a very attractive Hollywood actor who loves every fat under your skin or a top model who will become your Zero IQ, Your ugly face and your ears love. If all those gay places were not enough to annoy me, it did. In the real world, people, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: Now you say "Relax, it's a comedy, do not take it so seriously!". When a comedy gives some "carte blanche" to suck loud, I believe the world has a serious problem. Would not it be much better (and funnier) to do a film to denass these old, annoying clichés instead of constantly enlarging them? <br /> <br /> So, one of the absolutely worst movies I've ever seen. 1 out of 10. If this review has anything to do with my sexual addiction, please let me know. I'm interested.
