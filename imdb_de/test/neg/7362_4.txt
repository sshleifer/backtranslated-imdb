I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart beat faster as the hair on my neck started to stand up as my muscles tensed. But as with a striptease, I had no real action, no solution and no money my wallet. <br /> <br /> Jaume Balaguer√≥ and Miguel Tejada-Flores do not seem to have the right recipe for a horror movie, so they used the old hobby chef's method to throw everything in the pot. <This film is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser in one. Amazing, I know, but true. All flavors are present, you can taste every taste, they just do not go well together. I will not list everything that is wrong in this movie. In short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, poorer dialogue. <br /> <br /> The real problem of stealing from so many movie plots and putting them together into a movie is, apart from the resulting confusion, while you CAN run multiple plots simultaneously, can not have multiple endings , And what does Jaume do if he encounters this problem? Just like a freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses. "The little car disappeared in the dark and ..... THE END" Oooh, scary. Not really. And very disappointing. The end made me confused and disappointed. almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, hire The Shining, Poltergeist and Hellraiser ... strip off your pants, have a great time, and forget that The Darkness ever existed. <br /> <br /> -BJamin
