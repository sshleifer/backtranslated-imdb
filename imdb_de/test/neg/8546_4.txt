A multimillionaire marries a doctor. He has not worked in one day and she is dedicated to her profession. He looks her every day. Something has to be given. <br /> <br /> Our hero Henry Fonda finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store, but is soon fired because poorer people need the job. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen Hunt (Barbara Stanwyck) abandoned her practice? What is there to do? <br /> <br /> Kirk (Fonda) buys a bankrupt hospital and they're both looking forward to helping others while securing their livelihood? If she's angry about her husband, Dr. Hunt: "They behaved like Gestapo." This is supposed to be a comedy. Hogwash <br /> <br /> A very boring, boring movie. Very little going on here.
