The time machine begins in New York in 1899, when Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) suggests his beloved friend Emma (Sienna Guillory), who unfortunately accepts it shortly after being attacked by a robber. Emma is shot and dies in Alexander's arms. 'Jump Four Years Later' & Alexander has built a time machine to travel back to the night Emma was killed to save her, but she is still being killed, but this time in a different way. Alexander realizes that whatever he does, even if Emma comes back often, he will be dead in one way or another. He wishes to know the answer to why he travels so far into the future to discover the truth. However, after the destruction of the Moon, two new races have developed on Earth, the human like Eloi and the monstrous Morlocks who eat the Eloi. Alexander decides to keep and save the Eloi. <br /> <br /> Directed by Simon Wells, who is actually the great-grandson of writer HG Wells, who wrote the original book, The Time Machine, on which the original The Time Machine (1960) The Movie is based and the film of 1960 on which producer John Logan is based is not based on Wells original source. While all three share the same basic story and ideas, this remake adds the subplot about the death of Alexander's fiance Emma. For this reason, he invents a time machine, not only because he is smart and he can. The script is a mix of science fiction, action-adventure and drama none of which really grabbed or fanned me. Sure, there are a few nice special effects, some nice action scenes and the moment when Alexander's question is answered, why he can not save Emma, ​​is actually pretty intelligent and makes sense, it never really put on my imagination and so I was never really touched. The time travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992), in the sense that you can not change the past. At the same time, however, not only the future is set. The Time Machine is not nearly as good A good movie as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is alright, though I thought Guy Pearce looked too young to be a smart scientist capable of inventing a time machine, and behind the mechanics there's no real explanation, since it's like in a It's not a time machine that he invented next, it works perfectly. I think the Back to the Future trilogy offers much more thrill, laugh, excitement and general entertainment than The Time Machine ever. & I'll stop calling him a bad movie because he's moving at a decent pace, a decent story & has moments, I would not call it brilliant or even very good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book and the original film, both of which are checked for the name. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this modern version over the original is the development of special effects, and CGI in particular. To the scenes of time Alexander passed quickly in his time machine, huge buildings were built, new ridges Gorges and mountains formed and a lavish pan that ends in outer space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effect work is good, there are one or two moments that look a bit below average, but in general the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on TV and the station played poorly and scanned it so the left and right edges of the frame were cut off the screen. As a result, part of the year was cut off on Alexander's Time Machine dial so I did not know it, in which year did he go? Apparently, director Gore Verbinski has been shooting the last eighteen days when Wells suffered from extreme fatigue, while the IMDb says the time machine itself was the largest and most expensive prop ever built for a movie I find hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene, but continued like a soldier. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 80 million, production values ​​are high, with a lovingly recreated time in New York and good effects Amazingly, The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for Best Makeup, but lost to Frida (2002). Acting is mixed, Jermey Irons performs well in a horrible make-up job that makes him look like a disapproving Lord of the Rings movie, while singer Samantha Mumba gives her big screen debut here and though Guy Pearce is just terrible and pretty personable. <br /> <br /> The Time Machine is not a particularly bad or very good movie, just a slightly inconspicuous one that can be seen and takes an hour and a half, but not much else. Instead, look back to the future (1985).
