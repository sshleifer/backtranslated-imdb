I took my four-year-old twins to watch this movie today and I would NOT recommend it for kids their age. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there were many fighting scenes that I found too violent and my children scary. <br /> <br /> The topic was far beyond my children's mind and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon-oriented cartoon. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this, but it just did not cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the worst has driven me crazy throughout the movie.
