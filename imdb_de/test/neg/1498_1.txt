Granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The script was devilish, so bad that I almost laughed at some of the things they brought with them. The acting was almost as bad that it would have been better to use traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). The murders were ridiculous, the tension was absent, the camera work was ineffective and the "big" conspiracy at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it gets worse and worse. <br /> <br /> "The Granny" is possibly one of the least threatening "villains" caught in the movie, she looks as if she wears a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair caused endless laughter) and a happy nightie. Would you be afraid ??? I certainly was not. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay Movies) then this is a must. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like to laugh at shockingly bad dialogues avoid the plague.
