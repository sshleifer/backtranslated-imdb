"Julia Kerbridge (Catherine Mary Stewart) works hard to become a doctor, and Julia suddenly finds the guardian of her young niece, Amanda, after her parents were murdered." Julia has a new neighbor, the secretive Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe) breaks her hectic life when it turns out that the young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secret, she too is now the target of the killers, Julia must find out if Kevin is a friend or an enemy, and solve the weird secret before the killer strikes again. " it says in the DVD case. <br /> <br /> This thriller falls softly at the seams, but is interesting at times. Stalker Sean Devine's background phone scene (in front of the police station) and Mr. Lowe's violin (restaurant) are played tense. But it's hard not to overlook the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers deliberately turns his foot in red paint at the scene. Unfortunately, this is not a complicated plot point; and there is a worse story. All in all, "Dead Silent" is not a bad way to spend time, when there is nothing better, or if you love Lowe and his co-stars. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
