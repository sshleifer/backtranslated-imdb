We recorded this as part of a Brentwood set titled "The Broken Skull". Recorded directly on video, with very different tonal and light qualities, this film is presented in a hyperactive quality that stimulates the viewer to nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good "Evil Dead" way <br /> Without being corrupted, the seemingly simple revenge-faced story at first sight becomes increasingly muddled and bizarre. Although there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect will likely cause you to scratch your head and "huh?" Say. <br /> <br /> This is a very bloody movie. The gore effects range from bloody full-head gadgets to a stupid video toaster effect that has to be frozen in order to be believed. The "fangoria" level of gross out effects in this movie is truly amazing and should please the gore-hounds, while anyone with a weak physique feels a bit on the bad side. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull is also an extremely loud movie. Not only is there ambient noise (picked up by microphones and not replaced in the post), but there is a lot of screaming. No, no, I mean a lot. Very much! Characters scream, howl and howl, scream and laugh crazy. Turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and nerves! However, you can not fault the actors for their enthusiasm, they really devour the scenery and sometimes the effect is entertaining. In particular, the actress who plays a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all this with a remarkable amount of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few actors were made of wood. Some of them might have overreacted a bit (oh, just a little bit!), But most of them are definitely fun to watch. The cast is ethnically diverse and a praise for the filmmakers. The two white middle-aged women, however, are two of the meanest, most angry characters since the shopkeeper of the MST3k classic "The Brute Man". You just have to watch them being cooked with all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> Finally, the Head Crusher may not become a horror symbol comparable to Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun). but we can definitely say that ... that was a movie.
