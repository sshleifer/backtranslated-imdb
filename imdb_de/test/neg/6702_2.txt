I assume that the filmmaker's heart was in the right place, but frankly, this movie is really indecent. I was offended by the tone and the ending of the cop. You can not easily handle problems like these! Without knowing the film's last caveat ... let's watch a guy tear down his nine-month pregnant wife and two sons and follow him over the next two hours while trying to build a new life? You can not have compassion for a character doing this. Can not! Not to mention that until the last half hour of this unnecessarily long film, nothing was given why this guy suffers so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reactions to sounds or movements - things that real veterinarians suffer from. All we know is that he has pain in his ass and can not afford to take care of her and his three children. There really did not seem to be any research on what the current Iraq veterinarians are going through. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie suffers enormously from a harsh and totally inappropriate review. It's a disaster. It's really detrimental to some really good male lead actors and sometimes to Joe Morton. It makes EVERYTHING what you should feel and sometimes gives you the wrong hints! Again, this was a brutal thing this guy did, and it's NOT appropriate to see him in a new job, meet a new blonde, do a fight behind the counter. And really the end? What a crazy policeman out! How dare you. <br /> <br /> There are far richer films dealing with the effects of the war on returning soldiers. Please do not worry about these.
