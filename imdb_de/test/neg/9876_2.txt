I never read the book. I do not really want to. I had no idea what this movie was about when I went to the theater. I still do not know exactly where it should have come, but I know that a good two hours of my life have been wasted. Two precious hours that I can never get back. <br /> <br /> The story was so predictable that it is ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something ... a plot of Romeo and Juliet. I predicted the end within five minutes. And I was right. <br /> <br /> The acting is not terrible. The only two cool characters in the movie were the British cousin and the Rambo Graphic Novel Duder. The other characters are too ... the dialogue is very boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part of the film is the transformation between the "humans" and the "wolves". If you wanted something as enthusiastic as Van Helsing's, you will be really mad. Imagine ballerinas, a bright light, then a wolf. Yes that's it. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you have read the book because you only want to beat babies.
