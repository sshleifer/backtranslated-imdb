Why is Jennifer Lopez still occupied by the powers in incredible roles? She was excellent in Selena and pretty good at Money Train, both of which she had roles in which she could basically be herself. Roles like these, however, only draw the line. I was never able to see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for this unremarkable achievement), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Basically, Lopez plays the psychotherapist mentioned above, who is involved in virtual reality experiments, where she enters into the minds of her patients to help them solve their problems. When she steps into the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to crack the madness of his inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez's acting is usually below average. I can not overcome the high squeaking of a voice she has. She is not Julia Roberts, but she still appears on the screen as if she thought she was in the same field. Well, she is not even in the same stadium. Sure, she is a very sexy woman. but that will not be a movie, and there certainly will not be this movie. With all the other actors in this film, it would have been great, especially if it was cast with someone who could give the character more credibility. The colors are fabulous and the plot is not half as bad in a kind of B-movie. The sound here is also excellent. This film brings some points for the rather original plot and important points for look and sound. Unfortunately, the acting and bad casting brings a few notches. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
