This is an example of a movie that has great potential and is very poorly executed. I'm a fan of kids and thumb sucking and many other so-called teen movies, but this one annoyed me. <br /> <br /> Why does every white child turn into a rap lover, it becomes one-dimensional. The acting was awful, but simple, as it was all about throwing bomb after bomb, just a bad, bad movie, if you want to watch better movies like this: Thumbsucker kids all bully <br /> < br /> this i think i would recommend seeing a good "teenage movie". I hope my comment has been useful and I hope you will hear future comments from me
