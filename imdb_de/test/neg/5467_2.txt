There are many questions about the origin of this film. The first of these is: why make a movie that is just about an awkward female fantasy? It's one thing to ask an audience questions to discuss the intent of a movie. It's quite another to go into the process of writing a script that does not adequately address real human issues before they appear on screen. Why the outrageously melodramatic and often weird soundtrack? Why the excessive and often chunky dialogue? Why is the main character's girlfriend one of the hooded kidnappers? What is the purpose of turning the protagonist's kidnapping freedom into a joke by making his "mission" come true? (This is a classic Little Aussie movie moment, at the most inopportune moment you can focus on comic comedy.) Why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens? (This is about 15 minutes of film, which is at least 30 minutes too long.) Why, if a man is detained for so many days, why is not he trying to make a serious escape attempt? <br /> <The director who co-wrote the script has in many ways failed to deliver a satisfying story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
