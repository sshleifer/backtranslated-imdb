So I give it a star for true quality, but I would give it out of pure pleasure at eight and a half. "Young Warriors" is an incredibly weird mix of sex comedy and vigilante thriller. It's just the kind of bad movie you normally expect when poking around in the video fragment, but so rarely. It starts with about half an hour of crazy hi-jinx, sex jokes, and youthful shenanigans (including an olive in the martini joke that must have been seen to be unbelievable). Then the main character's younger sister is raped by a group of dark-skinned motorcyclists (an offensive scene that keeps me from giving a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not a conversation!), And the main character gets the rest of his sexual chattering brothers to him help clean up the city, find the responsible bikers, and kill all the slightly deadly criminals they encounter along the way. <br /> <br /> It's funny, non-stop fun, aside from the whole unpleasant rape scene and is indispensable for any serious bad movie fan. Trust me - I put my time in these things, and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a great flickering slo-mo shootout in a shabby bar (with a shot of a man bleeding off his own foot, which is pretty impressive), a couple of neatly dormant actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a few familiar faces recognizable (Lynda Day George, cry queen Linnea Quigley) and a few relatives of famous people (Chuck Norris' brother Mike, Van Patten clan James). It even has one of those big "What have we become?" The genre hour ends, although the turning point comes when the Vigilante Fratboys knock down a few children who rob a store with a toy gun. I've always wondered why this was the catalyst that made the hero think. Whether they were children and not hard-core criminals, and whether they had a real gun or not, they were still robbing a store. As far as I can tell, this was just another good job for our Vigilante community guys, right? Wonderful stuff. Highly recommended, just do not blame me for enjoying it in spite of you.
