I was hoping Pulp would be an interesting movie, but I was deeply disappointed. Pulp has very little storyline and what never interests you is your interest. It was a real struggle to keep seeing it. When it's over, you say to yourself, "huh, is that it?!?". You think after you've seen it - why did you ever bother? <br /> <br /> It's too bad since Michael Caine is a good actor. I also had hoped to see the great Lizabeth Scott here, but she only appears on the screen for about a minute. Scott is one of the omnipresent great movie Noir Femme Fatale girls and this was her last movie. <br /> <br /> Well ...
