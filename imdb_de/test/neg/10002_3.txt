Not even the Beatles were able to write songs everyone liked, and even though Walter Hill is not a mop-top, he's absolutely unsurpassed in action-action ideas. The nineties came and the social platforms changed in music and film. The emergence of the movie star rapper movie was in full swing. This was one of the many Ice-t films I saw and loved as a kid, only to see and twitch later. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with a basic life until a burning building tenant who is on fire hands over a card with gold implications. I give it to Walter to set up the main characters and the place quickly and properly. But I blame everyone involved for showing Lame-O performances. Ice-t and cube must have been glowing at the time, and although I've enjoyed both careers as a rapper, I think they ended up in this movie. It's about ninety minutes in which one man has ridiculously turned his back on the other man to the point where you are in several incredulous states. Now this is a movie, it's not a documentary, so I'm not going to waste my time telling all the stupid twists in this movie, but there were many, and they did not lead anywhere. I felt as I watched everyone on the set being confused and just playing things off the cuff. There are two things I still enjoy, one is a scene with a needle, and the other is Sadler's huge 45-gun. Bottom line, this movie is like a domino pizza. Yes, I eat it bad when I'm hungry and I do not feel like cooking. But I'm aware that it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.
