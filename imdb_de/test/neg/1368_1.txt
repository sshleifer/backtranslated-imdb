I saw this movie when it was first published in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I had traveled from Youngstown, Ohio, a distance of about 85 miles. I did not know about the plot or the players. I had not read reviews or spoken to anyone who had seen them. Believe me, I will never make that mistake again. I think it was the first feature film in the new 3D process. This has led me to a 170-mile round trip. <br /> <br /> There was a queue two next to each other that moved (I do not shit you) for 2 or 2Â½ blocks and moved very slowly. I could not wait to sit down. If only I had known at that moment what I would know soon, I would be on the way back to Youngstown at the time the feature started. <br /> <br /> When the first 3D scene was shown, I already nodded. The novelty was getting thin quickly and from then on it was a pure torture. <br /> <br /> Without going into the nagging detail, I can only give the following advice. If you have ever seen the famous movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, which is probably the worst film ever made, it modestly holds my head and shoulders above this garbage. I do not know if this is the case has ever been shown on TV, if I do not know why. If you ever have the opportunity to see it, do something different. Go for a walk, cut off the grass, wash the dog, beat yourself with a rubber hose. SOMETHING. Your time was better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first movie review. It could be my last, unless there is a worse movie coming, and I would not make a book that will happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
