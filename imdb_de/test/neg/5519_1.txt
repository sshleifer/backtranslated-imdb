The drama is excellent in this movie, with some great actors. It was fun to see Fred McMurray as a young man. This is not a comedy. It's a drama and the seemingly comedic examples are pathetic. This is not a comedy. It's a drama, and the seemingly comedic instances are pitiful, and some of them seem compelled and invented. However, it is not the fault of acting in the script. <br /> <br /> The 10-line request forces me to write something else ... Hmmm. Loved Carole Lombard's My Man Godfrey, because it's a comedy and, though the acting is wonderful, the storyline and the script itself win the day. Carole Lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress. I'll try to see the features of Fred McMurray.
