Angry! What can one say about this bizarre, startling model of Ed Wood's cross-dressing fantasies? Well, a word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw records of harmless, random footage and then builds a "story" - and what a story !! Wood himself is the star of Glen, a regular Joe who likes to hang around his fiance underwear and sweaters. I believe what Wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the glens in the world by showing that Glen is just like us all, only in Angora. Um ... ok. But then we get this very bizarre montage of a horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some stock footage, and finally a gaunt Bela Lugusi, who plays some kind of twisted, invalid puppetmaster. Lugosi is howling and pushes out garbage like "Beeevaaare ... the Beeswere Dragon, who looks at your doorstep: he sees leeetle boys, puppy tails and bee slugs!" Um, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / There's a weird, twisted Wood logic here. Finally, he reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats and 7 out of 10 are bald." Hmmm, must be the alien / cross dressing / habidashery cowspiracy thang !! Glen or Glenda play an abundance of reliable Wood-Schlock actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller, and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to lure any pathetic, amateur non-talent out of anyone. Everyone knows Bela's sad story: By the time Wood used him for this movie, he probably was in charge of another update and needed the Moolah, but even for him this is unequaled. One of MooCow's favorite Wood Mooments comes with the stock footage buffalo scene - it's so slimy denied !! The MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings" and yawn your hooves on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you will not believe it! : ??
