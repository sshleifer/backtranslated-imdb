At least some of the sitcoms who come endlessly from the US are honestly bad. However, this garbage represents a "heartwarming" side to a clothes horse. Ridiculously "learned" with looks and phrases that are transferred to the "I'm so important and thin and beautiful" fashion. In the episode I was in, someone's "job" was in jeopardy just because a colleague had "put down" a call that deterred his abilities ... !! Really, that's the lowest of the low. What kind of damage does that throw at the watching masses, as only glittering glamor people are facing "work". Absolutely get sick. When the tracks rolled, I thought, well, it was jobs for the boys. You know who you are.
