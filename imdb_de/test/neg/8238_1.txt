I picked up on this movie and was appalled to discover that the film was based on a rape of a little girl whose parents knowingly took her daughter with her. My first thoughts were that I was never ashamed of being both Indian and Hindu. I really loved this movie. Please do not waste time. As for the music, there are at most two terrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope I could shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes, it may emphasize how evil people are in power, especially when it comes to religion. But if you sit down and watch almost two hours of this movie, it can bother almost everyone. If you fancy a good Indian movie, have a look at director Mira Nair.
