I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. If you look at the surface, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, the dolls and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk who does this project to revive inanimate objects can not act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM I would watch this for 2 hours. Instead, the role of the puppets is downplayed, and the whole movie has suffered. The mystic Skull guy who created the totem is crazy at best, and Decapitron's looks are long-awaited, short and really disappointing. It would be better if you look at the first one again.
