"The Racketeer" plays Carol (deprived of the "e", which usually appears at the end of her first name) Lombard as a thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew), who is now an outspoken alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime king Robert Armstrong (best killer). It is almost a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest conversations: stiff direction, immobile cameras, acting, and ridiculously slow delivery of lines. At the time, the sound teams told the directors that their actors should speak every line of s-l-o-w-l-y and that they should not speak their own line until after the previous actor finished their own. About five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows the instructions of the sound recorder and systematically drops below the talents that Lombard and Armstrong know from their later films. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that still brought some legitimate masterpieces despite the transitional problems from silence to sound? Vidors "Hallelujah!", "Mamoulian's" applause, "Wylers" hellhorses, "Capra's" Ladies of Leisure "? All of the directors with a strong will to tell the soundboard dictators that they get fed up and their actors speak and act naturalistically Too bad that Howard Higgin was not as strong as it looks when you watch a naturally fast moving actor like Armstrong in the ridiculous way he was told you have to wonder where the 50th Foot Gorilla is located when Armstrong needs it.
