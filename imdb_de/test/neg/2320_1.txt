For some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this volume. I think because my great-uncle Buddy Baer was the giant in this movie and my father-in-law thought I'd like to see it. I did it years ago as a child and did not like it. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, looked at it and was addicted. Every time I wake up in front of the TV, this awful video was played. I went to work with the inhuman songs stuck in my head. The two "leads" were worse than a high-level junior review. The dancers looked like a rejection of an Ed Wood horror movie and Abbot and Costello called their parts. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son long enough to lose this video. Honestly, I think it was the band of "The Ring". To correct another critic, Buddy Baer is the UNCLE of Jethro (Max Baer, ​​Jr.) and not his father. 0 out of 10.
