I loved the beautiful Greek landscape, but the story, which you can not follow anyway, was harder to track in the movie. I can not imagine how anyone who looks at the film can somehow get a grip on him if he did not read the book, and then, like me, they'd probably wonder why the Australian Allison became the French Anne and many other seemingly pointless changes in movie history. The secrets of the book seemed to be hacked or omitted in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems back then as I had read the book several times. I recently looked at it with my granddaughter (very smart at 20 and usually in movies that I like), who was mostly amazed at how the young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise I could not imagine why it would look, except in the countryside.
