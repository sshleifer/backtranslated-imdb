I can not believe how stupid this movie really is. The plot (written by Keira Knightley's mother) ruins the movie extremely. It's downright boring, absurd and makes absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> this film has suffered so badly for most of them, especially at the beginning. the story went on and on about their everyday flirting, often like a threesome. In this movie you have an annoying deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are totally drunk from the start. The wife sleeps with other men to make ends meet while the poet is a pervert living on cheap buos and women. The woman, who connects too quickly with her former childhood lover (played by Keira), suddenly becomes jealous and knows for sure that the two have been lovers since childhood. Something does not seem right here ... I mean, come on ... come with the program lady! What you would expect. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Former lovers meet again with a new woman who hugs her, then she becomes jealous, then marries the former women's lover and her husband gets jealous, the crazy husband calls the police, and on At the end of the trial, they are brought to trial for the man's attempted murder. this is summarized in a nutshell ... <br /> <br /> this movie had its moments like the quality and good acting of cillian murphy, but otherwise i can not believe that i have looked at it ... I complained about it during the movie and some family members who saw me fell asleep. I decided to give him a chance and I should have stuck to my first instincts.
