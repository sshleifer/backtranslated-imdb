This film is based on a Stephen King novel in which the mysterious new shopkeeper Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers every citizen of Castle Rock the article he most desires - but a high price has to be paid for these transactions. Local Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) soon faces a series of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below the average of Stephen King Cinema: I can understand why some people think it's boring. It trudges to provide no real fear, forcing the viewer to spend time (again) with a bunch of repugnant losers whose hatred of each other is scary. <br /> <br /> I like the novel and do not think that this lackluster movie will do it justice. There are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt far too charming. We should be SCARED of Gaunt at the right times, not amused by him. I also hate that the sheriff's main deputy (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as such an annoying Barney Fife idiot. Star Ed Harris looks like he's been forced by his agent to take that picture, but professionally that he is, he's really sinking his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (as Pangborn's love interest for Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her normal, mentally unbalanced roles) come closest to creating sympathetic characters. <br /> <br /> But it's also mean and mean. <br /> <br /> Although I'd be damned if it did not feel a little bit cathartic, if a few unusual movie characters split up. The climax has some good explosions. <br /> <br /> I often rate films better than they probably deserve, but in that case I should really be honest and just say 3/10.
