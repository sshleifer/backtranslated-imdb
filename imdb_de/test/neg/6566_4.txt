I do not think I can add much to what has already been said about this film. However, I can remember a bit when I saw ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, when the camera pulls out of the camp-shot and it's likely that the credits will start every second, the audience seemed to rise in unison. Normally, at least some die-hard fans stay with such a film until the final disclaimer. As the people left the house, I remembered that I had not heard a laugh and a merry banter, just a soft murmur. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a movie report in the local newspaper where the critic said that only Trek was so bad fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were most likely to rip it first! <br /> <br /> Favorite worst scene: targeting a Voyager spacecraft through a periscope, not less! The space must be a much smaller limit than we thought.
