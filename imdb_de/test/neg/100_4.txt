I was looking forward to this movie. Trustworthy actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you want to try something that should encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know it. OK, I did not expect the directors or writers to know the meaning, but I thought they might have offered crumbs to pick and treats to fuel the fire. they almost did that. Things that I did not get. A woman who walks alone in dark places and lonely parking lots - without paying attention to the consequences. Big puzzles that have fallen by the wayside. The promise of the knowledge contained therein is contained in the original so-called criminal. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the excitement. I understood and can be lyrical about the fool and found Adrian Paul's role crucial and pervasive and then ????? Basically, the story and the script were good to a certain point, and that point was the last 10 minutes. What? No more ideas! Too bad that this movie had to let us down so much. It can not understand the meaning and I really did not expect the authors to understand it, but I hoped for an intellectual, if not spiritual, ride, and got a bump on the road
