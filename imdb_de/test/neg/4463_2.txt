The film begins in 1872 with a fierce, bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves into dust - van Helsing dies as well. Someone collects Dracula's ashes and buries them in the grounds of a church. Cut to 1972 - here the film breaks apart. <br /> <br /> We are immediately overwhelmed with loud, 70s music, HORRIBLE fashion and stupid dialogue. When this happened, Hammer lost money and decided to try everything to get a hit. Placing Dracula in the 70s was not a good idea. The fashion, the music and the dialogue make the movie terrible. We are introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who opt for a black fair - "for a giggle". Of course, they have it in the church (now abandoned) and naturally enliven Dracula. It's a good thing that a descendant of van Helsing is nearby ... But Dracula goes after his revenge on his niece (Stephanie Beacham) On the screen, the film receives much needed energy. The opening and closing battles are the highlights of the film (although the end is badly spoiled by bad music of the 70s). Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) is also the main leader of the children - a really stupid name from the 1940s. The movie also has screaming queen Caroline Munro, who looks absolutely great. The film is well directed and pretty good, but the plot is stupid, the constant confusion of fashion, dialogue and music of the 70s gets annoying fast and I was basically bored - this was one of the worst Dracula movies - it was that Follow Up (Satantic Rites of Dracula) - the last Hammer Dracula movie. This gets a 2 - only for Cushing and Lee.
