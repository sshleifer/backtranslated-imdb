The old man of the mouse in this cartoon lets you believe that all men are created equally evil ............ so if we have to kill men to stop Hitler ... We are as bad as Hitler the Has killed Jews. Well, I do not buy it, Mr. Mouse, but I think it draws a pretty picture and makes a cute cartoon ... but it was not the reality at the time and is not the reality now.
