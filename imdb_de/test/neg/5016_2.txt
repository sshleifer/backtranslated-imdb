I'm not so old that I can not remember that I laughed a few times about Bobcat Goldthwait. But in a few years, during which he lost his sense of humor and brain cells in recent years of drug abuse, the film can not have sympathy or empathy for the female lead from the moment this film begins. You will not find anything funny at all after listening to the opening line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he has to be demoted to feel better - even if it's his own imaginary characters that he demotes. <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen Shakes the Clown, you know how quiet Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident. It is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits' hands be paralyzed so he can not write another script. Hit his tongue so he can not dictate another inglorious scene. He is sad and pitiful and has to make room for a new talent that has to die to get to Hollywood
