Blake Edwards made a great effort to change the image of Julie Andrews in this film. He tried to make her sexy without knowing that she already was. I think both were still a little upset that Julie was not selected to film Camelot's Broadway success and was not considered sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to reassure this belief. It gets to the point of seeing Rock Hudson, who we all know is gay, and kissed Julie every two minutes in this movie. It now seems that not only have they tried to believe that Julie is a femme fatale, but that rock is straightforward. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together and the infinite kissing scenes begin to exhale one. The other mistake they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making. There are almost three different films. There's the drama of Julie as a German spy trying to get military secrets from rock. There's an aerial war movie with a lot of footage of WWI vintage airplanes flying around, and there are the stupid attempts of humor that Blake Edwards seems to believe he must insert into each of his images, whether it's appropriate or not was not. The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are the view of the ever-lovely Lady Julie and her singing in that crystal-clear, bell-like soprano. Of course, if you love her, you can overlook the weaknesses of this movie just because of her. You can always tell afterwards that it was a lot better than sitting through STAR!
