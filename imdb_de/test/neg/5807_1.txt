Honestly, this could be the worst movie I have ever seen. And I saw spider baby and not from this earth. Heck I even saw 200 motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and being surprised by the acting ability of Linda Cardellini, I looked at the reviews here and decided that this is worth a try. That's the LAST time I'll ever rely on a review at IMDb. I did not know that MORONS wrote IMDb reviews while they waited for their calls to be answered on AM radio. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that mere words can not express the misery of its vomiting condition. Serious. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think that Will Farrel is really, really funny, if you think Adam Sandler is a comedic genius. Please do not breed this movie!
