I will recommend to "skip" them in the stack as well. I was a little bit enthusiastic about the concept when my fiancé rented it, and a little bit more excited when I saw Milos Forman ruling it. Ah, well ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes were nice, for sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they had come from anywhere, except from the Period Costume section of a major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - all dressed as they were in court in Versailles. The sets did not look like the qualities of the scenery - the prison did not feel like a jail, the mansions did not feel like villas, and the outdoor scenes looked like they'd been filmed on an hindquarters were probably handy locations. <br /> <br /> The score was dramatically less than she could have been. I've been a fan of movie music since I was a teenager, I've noticed, honored and collected it, which I mean more than John Williams. My fiancé is a professional film composer, a laureate who performed her works at Lincoln Center, and an up and coming star in the industry. At the beginning of the film, we had high hopes, and it actually started well. It was rapidly deteriorating, and in several places - including the scene of the release of the prisoners - it actually got on a nuisance. I actually reached for the remote control to lower the volume. The score was never more than the obvious choice for achieving a certain tone of the scene, and did not integrate into the "soul" of the film (think of the music in Babel and you have an idea of ​​what I think). mean). It never reached the size it wanted, but neither did the movie. Javier Bardem, talented as he was, was terrible. For the first part of the movie, his behaviors are so distracting that he takes over his performance. In the second half, everything that was his character in the first half disappeared, replaced by completely different annoying manners, and he looked like the love child of Keith Richards and Stuart Townshend's Lestat. I never had the idea that he was interested in the role (meaning that the character was interested in his life and actions) or that the character was ever portrayed by the authors as something more than an opportunist, for some reason changed his mind and decided to stick to his principles in the end. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was very good, though she lacked in accomplishments when the joke between her release from prison and Lorenzo's hand-over increased in the end that I really had to call it an effective performance. The character of Alicia was never defined enough to truly perceive, and if there was not the great make-up on the eyes and cheeks, someone who saw the beginning of the movie and the end would not know that they were not the same figure were. The denture teeth were awful, artificial, and distracting, but that's not an impulse for Mrs. Portman. Stellan Skarsgård was fine as Goya. Not Oscar-worthy, but useful and universally credible. I do not know much about Goya's life or his deafness, but it seemed like watching the film as a requirement of biographical information rather than anything used in the movie. I'm sure it influenced Goya's life more than just the need for an interpreter, but you would never know it when you see that. For the protocol, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted by lip reading about 30% of the time. <br /> <br /> Do not let me start with Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character. <br /> <br /> The script reads like one of the books I read as a child: "In some moments of the film, several results are possible." and none of the previous actions will certainly lead to the actual course of the film. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially his sparse attempts to lift the mood with little jokes. The joke on the hands? Maybe it's because I paint (not good) as a hobby and know what a PITA hand is to drawing / painting, but I've seen the joke come a mile away and the reprise in the second half. Was the baby ever there for any other reason than being taken by Ines? There could also have been a number of breadcrumbs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (Note: This review is a copy of an answer I gave to a thread in the forum).
