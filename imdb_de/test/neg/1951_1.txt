Talk about garbage! I do not think that's good in this movie. The script was bad, the drama was terrible and the effects, well, there was no impact. I can not believe that the author of this film did Identity. Everything in this movie made me sick to end. <br /> <br /> The front of the video box shows a showman with shark teeth and weird eyes. I look like a scary villain, but like the old adage, "Never judge a book by its cover," the whole villain looked like a cardboard box. Part of the movie is a girl killed by a salad tongs, terrible. The scenery was bad enough, as if they could stop the whole thing in Lapland, but no, instead a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as a parody, which in my opinion was only the one thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the sticky effects. You can argue that I did not see the first, but I would be sure if I did not try. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the effects that snowballs looked like they were homemade and this carrot was totally embarrassing. If I suspect, the budget of this movie would probably be between 8 and 9 pounds fifty. The producer had panicked the actors at the last minute, telling them that the script had told them they had six minutes to practice these lines and shoot on an island. It was painful, as if the actors forgot their usual lines and made their way through. <br /> <br /> Finally I give this movie: 0 out of 5 stars
