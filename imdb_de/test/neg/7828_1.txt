Tired, mutilated filth. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Her dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The plot was a mess. The spectacle forced. The cinematography remained on the uninspired. Lazy and meaningless. Kim Gordon and her character had no reason to be there. No one else. I could not award two farts for any of the 'characters'. Her feelings jumped and jumped like a junkie hating his heroin. Empty and boring. Why do I have to write down ten lines of text here to refer to it? I think I summarized it in the first three words. But obviously it is not enough. I think that's the last time I wasted time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw "clean" and thought that was pretty ineffective as well. Again, I did not care about the characters, whether they lived or died.
