This relatively unknown "Hong Kong Minorpiece" is the perfect movie on the desert island for video age-peeping tomes (at least the first half is). Every lineup, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's skirt, to look at her breasts, to look at her bottom, and to look into her crotch. What establishes are the perverse inclinations of the main character, of course (!) <br /> <br /> The genre-like Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man plagued by erotic dreams and outrageous fantasies. All of them are sparsely dressed, sexy Chinese ladies with nothing but sexual bondage. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is thickened by a deadly negotiation, the imposition of voodoo dolls and a little rape and looting. <Br Some of the sex scenes are pretty hot and the Gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced in the second half feel half baked and the plot's plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sure, producer of sparkling garbage Wong Jing was in a terrible hurry to get this into and out of the theaters. <br /> <br /> The artistic title sequence did not deceive this well-worn player.
