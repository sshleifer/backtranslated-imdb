This movie was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC) produced under the so-called "Poverty Row" film studios of the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how little money was spent on it. <br /> <br /> The music is forgotten. The actress Gerra Young issues an opera voice, but is a kind of discount Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database does not have any more screenings for her, so we hope she could move to a position in the Grand Opera Classic Movies points out that this film was kept by the National Film Museum. This immediately raises the question: WHY? Are their resources so rich that they can afford to keep rubbish? Some low-budget or B-musicals of this era have redemptive features that are worthwhile. This movie has no. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie in my opinion. It REALLY wastes an hour of your time.
