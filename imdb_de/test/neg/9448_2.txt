I watch a lot of movies and occasionally enjoy the B-movie, but this movie was awful. Apart from the "homemade" quality of the film, it was very slow and did not seem to make sense. I'm just commenting on another comment I've seen here and said it was great! IMPRESSIVE! Maybe OK on a rainy day, if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were incoherent and did not fit into a recognizable pattern of reality. The dialogue between the characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I think if you are very involved with the whole area 51 and have understood some nuances of the other comments, it may be good - but for me - the average Joe - I do not understand it !?
