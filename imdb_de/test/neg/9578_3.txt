They call this movie "Euro-Trash-Horror". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not a horror. The film takes place in Europe, so "Euro". Rubbish? Oh, the garbage is ok. <br /> <br /> You know you're going to have a great movie when the DVD shows you on-screen text right away, apologizing for the quality of the printout. 'I'm just seeing it. Expect crackle, unusual, cracked cuts and that the film does not fit on the screen. There's also the sound - at first I thought I would watch a dubbed movie. As I looked closely at my lips, I realized that the sound quality was embarrassingly bad and out of sync. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is pretty stupid - an old, disfigured woman named dr. Bannister kills a scientist for his youth formula. I do not say much, because when you see the "old woman", it's pretty obvious she's under a thick, badly applied mask. Anyone who has a bit of sense and sees the wrong age knows what's coming next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "old woman" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman - complete with make-up and make-up a long hair wig! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, she has cornflakes on her face. The film does not try to explain how the cornflakes got there. By the way, there is no attempt to explain anything in relation to any of the figures. They are never developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two policemen who are following our anti-heroine are just wandering about, seemingly confused by the most simple clues. The murdered scientist was working on a juvenile serum, the old woman has disappeared, and we always meet a young woman - how do these parts fit together ?! What does that mean? One of the policemen sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth. The other is smoking a pipe. That's pretty much all we get when it comes to characters. <br /> <br /> Dr. Bannister (the old woman, now a beauty) is dressed in unusual costumes and takes off her clothes so we can see her flesh. She has relationships with men. She gets a catfight with a young woman in a nightgown. She goes to Geneva so we can see the lake there. She does a bit of water skiing and then takes off her suit to reveal a strange beaded bikini. She takes off her clothes again in a strange Ninja costume striptease. <br /> <br /> The end? Well, without revealing anything, it's just a bizarre conclusion that makes as little sense as the rest of the picture. That's something an author gets into when the director wakes him up at 4am and says, "Quick! We need an end to our movie! What's next?" <br /> <br /> The author mumbles slightly awake and the director comes along. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? Part of the music is campy and fun. This classic 60s-era organ music, so hackneyed, is enough to make you laugh. There are some strange seduction scenes, bizarre dialogues and silly moments. <br /> <br /> It's very close to being so bad that it's good. I've managed to watch it from start to finish, without expelling or sobbing. I think that's kind of a praise. '
