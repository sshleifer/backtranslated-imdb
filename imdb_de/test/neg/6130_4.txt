Before I move on, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had time, maybe every week I would have thought about it, if only I could see how the season was going. However, I knew from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" simply did not "fit in". Martha Stewart made a career as a happy housewife, a native diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. Only since her scandalous legal problems and the subsequent imprisonment her public image reflected the true roughness of her character. Sure, she has been captivating for a while, and this whole series raises the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does she have to come out cold and tough? Should not she? <br /> <br /> But when Stewart got out of jail, her attempts to make a public comeback, though justified, never sparked the interest of viewers for a long time. Perhaps a real comeback would have been made if she had returned home peacefully and waited about a year after removing her often mocked ankle bracelets. Instead, she desperately plunged into overkill with two series at a time, the other was her syndicated day streak Martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at its peak, Stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to demand that American audiences immediately accept their push into reality TV. Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on its own instead of being the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The show was basically a tired reissue of Trump's "Apprentice," which, depending on the task, still piques my interest, the cast and Trump's decision (often controversial - probably for that reason). The letter was certainly not a clich√©, but in the least disgusting. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly stressful. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for honestly addressing Stewart's prison while trying to make her a heroine, but the truth is that anyone in the audience can see that she's basically trying to show this nice businesswoman , Never again mainstream, Stewart lacks the friendliness and perceptibility of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic "tenacity" of Donald Trump. Yes, this may be a gender-based assessment of their character, but I mean, it's more about the nature of their business. <br /> <br /> It's not a shock that Stewart got fired, but I wonder if they were meant to last only one season?
