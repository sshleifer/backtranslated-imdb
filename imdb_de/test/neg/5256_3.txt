This movie was highly recommended, but I do not know why. But I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, except for the 50 First Dates, where he deviates from his usual routine with the angry man. Damon Wayans is an undercover police officer and Adam Sandler is the type with whom he made friends for a year to destroy him. Of course, Sandler is pretty angry about this betrayal. Cue angry shouts and stupid facials from the king of diversity. They land on the run and of course they become friends after a big misunderstanding (with Sandler Wayans shooting in the head - he survives, so he's bulletproof). Do I need to continue? You will find out what happens if you look at it anyway. When our DVD player paused constantly (hey, $ 80 from the supermarket were ok?), It was commented that the player knew the movie was boring and refused to play it.
