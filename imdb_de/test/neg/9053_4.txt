Eaten Alive is a small film that opens in New York City and the Arctic, where tribespeople bombard a few people with snake venom. Then a woman enters the police station trying to find her sister, who disappeared after 6 months. Sheila is from Alabama. But her accent is shit, she's teamed with an adventurer who apparently just wants her money and often says it all over the movie. They venture across the Amazon just to find fellowship with humans, and they find the sister, she 'He is confronted with a crazy man who has probably seen too many Jim Jones sermons. He'll take her to a better place, it could be the sky, but no, Mark and Sheila later realize that it's actually a suicidal cult. <br /> <Why do I call Eaten Alive a "little movie"? I can tell you, but when I saw it, I was beaten by all the cannibal attacks. Robert Kerman has a different role than his professor in the Cannibal Holocaust. He is a little annoying when we meet him in a arm battle that looked like Russian roulette, we also know a tough guy. The strong misogyny only brings you together and it looked like I saw it somewhere, oh the scenes where animals kill each other. But the whole movie revolves around these scenes and it's like watching nature with parts of a movie. But after watching this movie, I realized that most of the movie scenes are from other cannibal movies, even the downfall of 2 of the characters, well, the biggest part of the movie is. That's why I call that a little movie. When I found out that scenes were on loan, I felt like throwing the glass across the room. This is not a movie, but a kind of montage.
