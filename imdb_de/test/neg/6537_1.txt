Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow movie with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialogue you will ever hear. This is another road movie that really does not go there. The camera is often out of focus and the constant panning in some of the overlong scenes is annoying. <br /> <br /> The three characters are attractive but sympathetic. The cast also determines what the use of the tired word "Dude" must be an intergalactic record. (Even Howard Stern has abandoned this tired pesudo pronoun.) The three main characters and a supporting actor are promising. They are clearly comfortable and can bravely portray as superficial and even stupid. The character actors all seem to be brave amateurs who have voluntarily volunteered to speak a few lines. They all fit well with their roles. <br /> <br /> All in all, a boring 90-minute time that seems more like an eternity. This is one of my ten worst movies ever.
