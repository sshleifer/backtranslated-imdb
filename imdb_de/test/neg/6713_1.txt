I think Cockpuncher is the best work that has come from the Steven Seagal factory for a long time. This movie was the first one I've seen since this fine movie preview. My point? He's done. Every movie is the same. Maybe he's good at Machete, because he will not be the star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thanks for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was an amazing speech. You really influenced some people out there. <br /> <br /> So I have to write ten lines about this movie? Um ... I like the smoker who killed a lot of fools. Whenever someone smells of Menthol's LOOK OUT. Because there could be one killer with a muffled Glock (and another one) who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> Are you ten?
