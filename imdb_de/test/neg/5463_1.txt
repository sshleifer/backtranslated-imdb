First, the title has no relevance to the film. It started off well, but got annoying when he could not tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to inform the police failed, which just increased the annoyance. There were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than something valuable. The conspiracy never betrayed who had done the crime to him, though a good plot would have allowed disclosure. The end was nothing less than "Hey, we used up the budget, let it stop NOW !!" WASTE WASTE WASTE !!
