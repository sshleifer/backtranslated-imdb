This is one of the star-filled over-the-top comedies that a) could be hysterical or b) wish you had gone to the dentist to pull all your teeth instead. Unfortunately, "One Night at McCool's" is a classic "b.". <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn recently commented on "Town and Country" that in Hollywood, it's a big problem for them to start hiring the actors and make a deal before a script is done. One has to imagine that they not only entered into this picture without a complete script, but also mutilated it daily. Maybe we have to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studios saying, "It's the script, stupid." <br /> <br /> This is also one of those movies where you feel most sad about the actors. They work to try to make it seem hysterical, but they know that most of it is not accompanied by tummy tucks, but by the sounds of crickets that can be heard in the quiet theater. <br /> <br /> Is it a disaster for no reason? Incomplete. There is a smile on the way, mainly because of the efforts of the actors. I probably would have gone out of the theater and thought, "Eh, it was okay." So why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? The end. If, as already mentioned, the rest of the movie is just a setup for the end, then it misses spectacularly. I really wish I could talk specifically about it, but I hate people who betray too much (even as a warning). Suffice to say, as soon as you see John Goodman behind a bent Paul Reiser (nothing is missed here, he's in the trailer), hell out of the theater and think, "Eh, it was okay." Rest of the film is tackled and creatively bankrupt. And you'll be horrified that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you loved "Mad About Mary" or "Meet The Parents" (both great movies) then you should not watch this movie. Let those teeth care instead.
