This movie stunk. There is not much more. The last fight looked like Walker was attacking my grandmother, not a supernatural demon the size of ten men. I found the advertisement more interesting. The acts and jokes were a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the end. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you enjoy bad Chuck Norris movies.
