I have just seen 2FTM. The trailers fascinated me so much that I actually saw them on the opening weekend, which I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see that it's screwed up. I really feel that the problem with the movie was the director and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I'm not an MM hater, I thought he was great in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in these films without having to see him 3-4 times without a shirt. Yes, we all know that he is a handsome man with a beautiful body, but I think most people knew that ten years ago when he came to the scene in A Time to Kill. There's no point in pumping his shirt off and pumping iron like a sweaty lunatic 3-4 times in the movie. I think a time would have been enough. It would not surprise me if they threw in those unnecessary scenes, so that friends and wives would be willing to get together with their partner. No woman wants to watch a movie about gambling in sports unless ... let's get on with it. I feel that his acting was very forced and he did not seem to be very comfortable. I know that his character should be this charming Southernerner, but his lines were cheesy and cheesy. It was almost like referring to Days and confused lines a few times! In short, I did not like his character, though I should. The accent, the shirt off, the wobbly pick-up lines, the weak sales figures. His character was just too much tools like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that's no surprise. Piven is fun to see as an aria ... oooops, I mean Jerry. I just think that this movie was very commercial and badly compiled. It is offensive that they need a great story and add manure ingredients to make them box office. 1. Cool story that appeals to the male man. 2. Hunky Hollywood actress for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with weights removed). 3. Al Pacino, with 4 great voice scenes and 25 great liners, is said to be dressed in thousand-dollar suits and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character as in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw Armand Assante to seal the deal smart casting is unnecessary <br /> <br /> This will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anyone who disagrees with me will wonder for themselves. Would this movie be much better if: A. Director: Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I'll probably be part of Be a minority if he makes the film shit. I realized that when the woman beside me began to cry when Pacino shed a fake tear and hugged Russo. The financial success of this film will ensure one thing. The film, which goes public, receives a large budget for what the film wants to bring to the public.
