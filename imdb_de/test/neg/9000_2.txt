Problems: 1) Although billed as a "loving tribute to Poverty Row," many of the old recordings are not even from Poverty Row movies - many of them from RKO's "The Dangerous Game" (1932), with some of them from the silent (!?) version of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old material is only used as filler (the old ship's material) or as silent shots (for example, when walking, looking or staring at Bela), which are often repeated. <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the Pantheon of the Master Thespians of Poverty Row (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) who use their lines as a punch line feel lines to the "new" drawing jokes (as in Woody Allen's "What's Up Tiger Lily?" or Steve Martin's "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid")? Even Mike Nelson's weak commentary on the colored "reefer madness" is funnier than this one. <br /> <br /> High Point: Gregory Mank's long but highly insightful presentation, which gives Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco new respect and admiration. That's just the price of the DVD worth!
