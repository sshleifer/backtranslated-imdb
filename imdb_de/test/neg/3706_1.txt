The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the dumbest and worst films of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this is just a waste of time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I saw this movie last night, and it was all I could do to finish watching. I understood that this weird crazy man wanted to catch Bigfoot, but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. However, it had some amusing parts. There was this very cheesy and nonsense disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed too long in space I think the director has been trying to fill the time. The worst part was what the Bigfoot looked like. The obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur bigfoot. He was ridiculous. If you want to see a very bad bigfoot movie, then I suggest you buy this movie. Personally, I wasted my time and money on this movie!
