This movie is absolutely terrible ... Definitely a bull story and even worse acting. Too bad that Charlie Sheen is involved in such a thing as he is a decent actor and made some really good movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are "A-Team" standard shot with the classic car and then flipped over with a small fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Of course, the enemy is portrayed as total idiots and dies as fast as he can say, "The evil Americans." <br /> <br /> If you do not play in Braindead movies, do not spend a few minutes of your life with this garbage. Instead, take "The Platoon" or "Apocalypse Now."
