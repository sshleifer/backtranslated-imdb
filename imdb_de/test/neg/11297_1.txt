* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a travesty of a movie! Now he is in Italy and appreciates our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but comes for Clarice (Julianne Moore) in the States and even with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be talked to Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter because it's really absolute, absolutely, absolutely bad. <br /> <br / I mean, the scene just before the end, when Ray Liotta's skull was opened and he was forced to consume part of his brain? WTF? Why was HELL so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did the story go nowhere? I assume this is the Hannibal series "teenager" chapter. terrible, stupid, bloody for the sake of heaven and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, especially if you love one of the other Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising) /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
