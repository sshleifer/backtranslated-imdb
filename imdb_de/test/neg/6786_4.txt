* SPOILERS! * When I saw the preview for the first time, it looked like a good old fashioned brand movie. I love bluegrass music and could not wait to see her. When we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounded even better. The movie was pretty boring in the first half, and now and then a song was played. Then (I'm embarrassed to type this), a lesbian love came in. I was something more than a friendship between the teachers, but I certainly did not expect nudity and longer make-up sessions. I looked at it with my mother and I was pretty embarrassed because I chose this movie. But other than that, it was a good movie. The acting was good, the actress Deladis played was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I do not want to see the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after watching the movie. Followed by followers. If I were you, I would skip the movie and just get the music.
