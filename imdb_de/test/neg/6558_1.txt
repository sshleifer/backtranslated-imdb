Welcome to Plan 9 from Space Star Trek movies. Come on, Wanderer, admit it. This movie is so bad, amazingly inappropriate in every department that it has become a classic. <br /> <br /> The Shat offers the worst performance that Celluloid has ever done. "BOONES! Hi Bones" Brilliant! This is not just ham - there are several large hog farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. Should be under the trade designation law to use such a term. The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this movie. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show was better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yes, Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat. After we fought for the meaning of the words !!!! "Capt. Life is not a dream" Poor Leonard Nimoy, he really needs to choke Shatner for it. Could The Shat have not given us his interpretation of Mr. Tambourine Man or harmonized with Nimoy about Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Sorely disappointed. <br /> <br /> A Sean Connery who looks like he is playing Spock's half-brother. Just because they could not get Sean Connery! Uhura makes a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. 1989 is like embarrassing your drunken grandma at a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> Cat Woman jumps on Shatner's back! Shat whirls her around a few times like a WWF wrestler and throws her off. Yayy the shit! Apparently Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. That explains why Spock has not mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies yet. McCoy has apparently killed his father with mercy, BUT AFTER HAVING FOUND A HEALING. Tell me, this is not hysterically funny. <br /> <br /> The 11-Deck Enterprise suddenly grows around another 400 decks for an escape sequence in a hoistway. Astonishingly, Spock's Antigrav boots also support Bones and The Shat. Should she have used the humpback whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what claims to be God, but I assume that it is actually a kind of extraterrestrial being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The 10 Commandments. Sean Connery the Second is calling on God to share his pain and dies promptly. Or so. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I would like to know what Jehovah's Witnesses have made of this scene. <br /> <br /> The Shat who killed God promptly returns to singing with Spock and Bones. Total Row Row Row Your Boat ..... now
