There are interesting pieces of and about Bruce Weber's likes and dislikes. If a professional editor had compiled it for biography, I might have been happier. Instead, I spent $ 8 at a film festival. For an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about Bruce Weber, except that he likes to look at photos, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenagers, and listen to jazz. The director of Crumb would have made a much more interesting and coherent film.
