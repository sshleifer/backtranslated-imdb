Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are in this ca. 1840 "Western". But that alone does not help with a ridiculous story with innumerable historically incorrect elements. <br /> <br /> Byrl Ives convinces as a 70-year-old tyrannical patriarch, an egoist who sees his 100th birthday. His wild dancing at a party he gives to his neighbors will take note of someone (this guy is SEVETY SIX?). He always demands mumbling Bible verses of respect, while driving sons and friends away with his self-righteous gossip and emotional cruelty. <br /> <br /> The love affair between Perkins and Loren seems absurd at first sight, but will be credible end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. This story was clearly written for the stage and was also dated during the shoot. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not composed until 1882. Critics who knock on Sophia Loren's "mastery of the English language" are rather insignificant. I found her English to be flawless and totally audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a pronounced dialect, often referred to as "real Italian". However, her "accent" hardly influences how she speaks English. As a first-generation German American, I appreciate the efforts of those who study English as a second or even third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in the classical sense. To my delight, there was no logical story and a "reward" for the time invested. Fans of the stars do not want to miss it, but others listen at their own risk!
