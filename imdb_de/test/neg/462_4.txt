The filmmakers apparently had enough money to afford proper make-up effects, but not enough for a creature that could move and attack convincingly. We never have the chance to see the "monster" moving from one place to another - whenever this happens (allegedly), the camera focuses on the "frightened" reactions of the people around. And when a man is attacked by him, he just seems to hold an inanimate object against it so that it does not fall to the ground. This is still not the worst "alien" zealotry (the two "Xtro" films, for example, are even worse); It is actually enough entertaining if you have 68 (!!) minutes to spare. (* 1/2)
