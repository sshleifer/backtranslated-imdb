When this show first aired, I admit that she is fascinated by the premise and the environment. Open-minded, I watched the first two episodes and rejected it of course as a maximum of six months. I have recently seen A / E and saw an ad for this garbage and I could barely stop my surprise. I really hope people will watch this for a laugh and not take it seriously. The characters are really some of the most ridiculous and absolutely ridiculous on TV, in scripts or otherwise. It's obvious that it generates ratings, so I have to give credit to the creators for building and maintaining a fanbase.
