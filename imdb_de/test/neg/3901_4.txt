Do not be fooled by the other reviewers. Although this film has an impressive selection of talents, the material they present leaves much to be desired. The three numbers of Nat King Cole are quite lame and are not near his later efforts, although he impressed with his piano playing. 'Moms' Mabley is not a bit funny, although I remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth. In fact, the best performances are from a few fat guys who impress with a lively tap-dance and a four-tops takeoff, and from the jazz band itself, especially in the number of bassists. The pressure itself is of fairly poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is completely wasted in the circulation plot.
