Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of the wrong marriage in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couples who find out they were never legitimately married, and spend the movie plunging back into true love. It does not have a good reputation and it is easy to see why. The jokes are known from better films, but they do not gel here. And the leads are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is cropped and starchy, and it's doubly sad to think that she died only a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know that he is in the ear of a sow, and tries to make a silk exchange out of it without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "the other man" (he has a nice drunken scene). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock movies.
