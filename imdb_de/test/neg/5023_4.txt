To be honest, the popularity of this show makes me sad. Inuyasha is certainly not terrible - there are a few good moments, occasionally a touch of smart humor and unlike so many animes the dignity. However, it completely lacks the essential elements of a worthwhile story. His premise makes it stereotypes right from the start. At the heart of the storyline is collecting the pieces of a broken gemstone before they can be possessed by evil, and is, you might expect, a totally generic epic fantasy affair. The story follows a familiar pattern of battling various enemies for jewels and is therefore fairly predictable, straightforward and easy to lose. But as so many animes have shown, a bad premise can be saved by profoundly realistic characters. Unfortunately nobody saves the story of Inuyasha. Kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical anime heroine (and reminds a lot of Akane, the protagonist of the earlier work of the original comic author Ranma 1/2); She is nice to other women, but she treats many men, especially her love interests, with unfair, unabashed, unjustifiable brutality. Inuyasha is a tough outside-and-inside type, and Miroku is the pitiful character of the "pervert". <br /> <br /> The mistakes continue with what happens This act and these characters - namely nothing. Despite constant action, the story does not progress. Despite regular romantic moments, the main relationship does not apply. Despite a long time, the characters never really change. And to add a cherry to the salty cup of mediocrity, this stagnation extends to about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My last criticism of this anime is the animation. Though not ugly, it does show an almost irreverent laziness of the creators. The animators seem to enjoy long scenes in which Inuyasha jumps with windpipes in the air, with little to do, but a background to move. <br /> <br /> In short, with all the beautiful animations of the world If you use the keyboard with your fingertips, there is absolutely no reason to see Inuyasha.
