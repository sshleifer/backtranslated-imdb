This movie starts with a pedestrian setup before it gets into the usual kind of excitement, with a clerk busting out trained intelligence officers, etc., with good "surprised" faces from Hamilton and Sheen - but I really do not need that. <br /> <br /> Risible Finale has at least laughed for my pain. If my life flashed before my eyes, I think, I would fast forward these 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two more lines of text to publish this thing. Yes, very resistant suit, which the shine carries. I've made a special promise never to see a movie that bad again.
