Look, this movie is awful ... the "conspiracy" refers to twins who are neglected by their selfish parents and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, the children of which are totally repugnant. Finally, the children have turned ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo into their new nanny. Are you interested, why? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling kids and decides she'll try to sell the twins ... and, oh, you do not want to know. It's all very uncomfortable and not funny at all. In fact, the announcer planned this movie before it appeared on the TV channel I have just seen! Do not bother to waste a single moment of your life on this pile of garbage, y'hear?
