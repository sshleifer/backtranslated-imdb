This show had a promising start as a kind of opposite of 'Oceans 11', but has evolved into a flat representation of T & A. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best, it was new and interesting things that went downhill after that. The only redeeming point of this show is James Caan. The other actors are tired. The characters lack depth and they seem incredibly selfish and generally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a casino" In my opinion, Baywatch is far too generous, much better and more realistic.
