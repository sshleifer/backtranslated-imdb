1st movie commentary ever! I start saying "Come on, was not it that bad ... right?" ... no, actually it was not that bad. I laughed and giggled through the film enough that I can not say with my hand to my heart that it was rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's totally different, this Epic Movie (Epic Movie sucks bad ... doh!). "How come?" People would ask. I tell you how. This movie is not nearly as pointless, not to mention that stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) stuff that happens around and with the characters is really enjoyable in this movie , Not the best, but hey ... what would you expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I think if you write a comment, you should be more objective (my own opinion), but yes, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! Look, I'm not telling you that you're watching the movie now, otherwise you missed the event of the century. What I'm saying is that if you see the movie anywhere, please do not keep your eyes on the credits. See what it's all about - who knows, maybe you'll like it a bit. <br /> <br /> I give 4/10 that I'm not that bad and make me laugh and have unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
