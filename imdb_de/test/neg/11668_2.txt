I saw all three Mad Max movies in a row for the first time a few days ago and was bitterly disappointed with the third part. It destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story that turns the apocalyptic Australian desert sceneries into a weird sand pit that you would expect in a children's adventure movie. Max's character is unrecognizable from his dark and cynical personality seen in the previous films, turning into a predictable, uninteresting savior who betrayed me. If you have not seen this movie, just do not do it. End the story with the Road Warrior and save yourself an hour and a half of painful hours. (Spoiler Alert) The other big problem I had with this movie that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. We had already seen him in the Road Warrior, where he had helped Max, and yet when he reappears in the thunder, it looks like the two have never met. Whether he should be another character or a relative of the Kreiselmanns of the street warriors, I do not know. however, it has not been explained and is a weak element in this overall weak movie. 2 out of 10 points will not score 1/10 because of the thunder fight.
