I can laugh about almost everything, but unfortunately there is not a single one in this stink bomb! I honestly watched this movie from start to finish and did not even smile. I am shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade and so on would put their name on this crap. Worse than the worst that ever came from the worst of the former SNL players. What else can I say? How could such a tasteless, extremely listless drip come from such a pool of apparent talents !! Maybe I lost my sense of humor (unlikely), but I can not remember a movie that I did not like so much in a long time. What a waste of 2 hours I will never get again.
