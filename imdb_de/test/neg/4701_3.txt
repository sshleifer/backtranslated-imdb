This western / musical / comedy is not one of the best in the genre I've ever seen. I thought it was way too slow. It only trudged to the inevitable end. I also found it incoherent. I could not wait over.Randolph Scott is the headliner here, and Lloyd Bridges plays a major role as well. But for my money, Edgar Buchanan is the best of the group. I also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita. Otherwise, I do not like much to recommend this movie. The film is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, who was crazy about a movie of the same name in 1939 and again made in 1966 and again in 1986. The Stagecoach version of 1939 is one in my eyes the best movies ever made. In any case. As for Abilene City, my vote is 3/10
