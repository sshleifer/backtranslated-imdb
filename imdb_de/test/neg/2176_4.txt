Adenoid Hynkel, a low-ranking soldier in the First World War, rises in the following years to the reckless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, anti-Semitic war machine and cultivates a small toothbrush mustache. Sounds like someone you know? <br /> <br /> From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin calls this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States had more than a year of neutrality in 1940, and there was no strong desire to engage in Europe's civil war (remember that Hitler declared war on the US, not the other way around) surprisingly that Chaplin was allowed to banish this excessive polemic. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the story is about the vulgar and dismissive hype and about the reign of terror he carelessly reigns, and about life in the Jewish ghetto. Everyone is friendly, humane, courageous, etc. etc. Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays the Jewish barber, the little hero of the ghetto (the tramp, except the name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, composes stars, composes music and oversees catering. In 1940, the full truth about the Third Reich was not yet known, and Chaplin can be dispensed with having a little less than perfect historical vision, but even by the standards of the day Hitler is mistaken. As a comedian and sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel stupid and unhappy. All this makes him humanize. When Hynkel, the not very warlike soldier, louts around with the big gun and the upturned plane, he becomes lovable rather than despicable. As a dictator, he inspects the technical innovations of his subordinates who do not work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform, etc.), and these passages are to make us believe that the real Nazis are incompetent and can be pushed aside. In fact, Hynkel's regime becomes sweet and sympathetic through his clumsy bodywork. In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this failed polemic. In the heart he was still a dinosaur of the silent canvas (look at the humor, with gags halfway up the street and down or the mime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is supposed to be a measure of European decency, against which Hynkel can be measured, but Schultz looks more like an operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way credible that a Schultz figure (if any) would say to the Fiihrer's face: "Your cause is doomed to failure because it is based on the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people"? And how does Schultz get into the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the subject of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he insist on wearing his Ruritan uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he offers us is hopelessly out of whack with the gloomy zeitgeist. As usual, Chaplin thinks in "silent" comedy sets that are loosely coupled to the narrative clothesline. There is the knockabout with the stormtroopers shaving a man to accompany Brahms, and the globe ballet (pay attention to the reverse section). Paulette Goddard is the perfect Hannah. Just as the ghetto people are incredibly nice and the Jewish oasis in Easter is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, industrious and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of Judaism in Ghetto Cage. "Gee, am I not cute?" she asks after the barber has reworked it. Far too sweet, is the answer. It does not seem close to sound because Chaplin made her a caricature. Would not it be wonderful? A speech that puts Chaplin in the mouth is typical of the author - too wordy and too emotionally unpleasant. Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. It brings with it a touch of much-needed cartoon Brio, but the movie's basic weakness remains. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we fear him? And yet the juddering stop-start of the backprojected train is a good example of a gag that lasts far beyond its weird value. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish barber buy this flawless Hynkel uniform?
