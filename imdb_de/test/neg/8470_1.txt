Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND on television. If you've never seen 30-minute meals, you can not possibly understand how incredibly annoying she is. I really did mean that you can not even begin to be betrayed by her until you have watched the show once or twice, and even then you will miss all the words and intelligent thoughts. The problem is mostly with their behaviors, as you may have guessed. Ray has a stupid mouth and often imitates the parrot. If you love something or think it's "great" (a word she uses about 87 times per show), just say it. And she keeps using terrible, listless words like "EVOO" (extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! What's worse, Ray has two other shows on the network! I think that's a complicated conspiracy of terrorists driving us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
