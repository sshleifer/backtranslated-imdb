Terrible drama, terrible script, totally unrealistic. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is an example of the clich√©s and sentimentalism that film studios love to stuff the audience's throat. Elijah Wood is unimaginably bad in the lead role, and the plot points are fictitious and juicy. The relationship between Cook and Wood is ridiculous at best. But the worst thing about Bumblebee is the script. This is one of the most memorable dialogues I have ever experienced. Bumblebees that actually crawl into my ears and sting my eardrum would be easier to hear than spit out robotically at Elijah Wood's pseudo-profound lines. I wish a "Bumblebee Project" would be done on me, so that I could mercifully remember that stinker.
