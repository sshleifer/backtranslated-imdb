This film tries to capture its classic, bad Canadian movie feel: <br /> <br /> "quirky" and vile characters (some); "quirky" city with "quirky" people; a "quirky" cafe or restaurant (cafe here); many shots of Canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); many mention of "must get out of this city"; almost booooring. <br /> <br /> And it succeeds in all points. <br /> <br /> Something to note. I could not figure out if this movie was just a "bizarre" Northern Exposure comedy or something surreal, like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. The editing of this film jumped nonsensical from one unrelated thing to another with zero timing or motivation. Not to mention half of the time we did not even know where to hop. Take, for example, the first shots of how teenagers are screamed in a car. Who are they and what do they have to do with something? And this under - er action (loosely use this word action) for children who seem to embrace generations. I do not think they actually do, but editing it seems they materialize from the flashback all at once to the current time. Huh What did I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Unless laugh. Or you want to try the inappropriate editing.
