I'm not surprised that so many people have opted for this case. When I saw this movie, a couple of spectators sobbed next to me when they "allegedly" sobbed - or at least felt "touched". As if Hunting had said that he did not love the girl. For example, when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot the name of his role) kept saying, "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, if I just think about this scene, I get goose bumps). I could not care less about what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood's produced characters that they can not even relate to (think Titanic, Yuck!) ... but that really just scared me and wanted to get out of the theater. I think I just refuse to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by all of this. People, not me, it's condescending ... these characters are and for no good reason, because they are unreal. Worse, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all stereotype. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10 points. It's probably not that bad; It's just mediocre ... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave her a 10, so I thought a single vote would not hurt.
