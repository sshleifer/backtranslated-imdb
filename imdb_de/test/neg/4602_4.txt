Obviously, this film was made for a newer generation who might have had a glimpse of Charles Bukowski's work. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly and perfectly portrayed by Mickey Rourke in "Barfly" in 1987 and also played Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen "factotum" should definitely see "Barfly" to see how Bukowski has written his character. "Factotum" lacks the filthy germination of Bukowski's script and the fearless hopelessness of his solitary hero. The inadvertent humor that flows through the dark despair of Chinaski's mishap does not work as well for Dillon as it does for the overweight, dirty, bloody Rourke. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of last night's misconduct a place where another ugly day has taken place in the life of a drunken, unknown writer. Dillon's character misses these hallmarks in favor of a sprightly, handsome, relatively pure-looking Wanna-be writer who barely passes a moment in Chinaski's story. Dunaway's dingy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well Henry. The women in "factotum" can not leave a candle to Dunaway's "desperate goddess" and the use of mundane sexual objects in "factotum" turns out to be more of a gross distraction than a hint of Bukowski's raw and unfriendly depictions of dysfunctions. I was stunned to see how many of the same scenes were used in "factotum" (Marisa Tomei, who bought all the stuff and charged the old man, is an exact rip off of "Barfly"). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best Bukowski stories in the movie, see "Barfly" and "Love is a Dog of Hell" (also called "Crazy Love").
