A Mexican Outlaw (Tomas Milian) steals gold along with some other Mexicans and Americans from a stagecoach. The Americans cross the Mexicans and leave them all dead. One outlaw survives, seeking revenge in this movie that has everything to do with the original Django (the distributors just called it "Django Kill ...") Squeeze out a few dollars more from gullible people. What We Have Here is a slightly under-average western that is too surreal to be so comfortable, so I can not really recommend it to anyone but the westernmost Spahetti fan. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D + <br /> Blue Underground DVD Extras: Part of the Spaghetti Western Collection by BU. Uncut, "Django Tell" (20-Minute Documentary), Posters & Stills Gallery, Talent Bios for Guilo Questi & Tomas Milian; Trailer Trailer <br /> <3 Easter Eggs: Highlight the hidden weapon on the extra trailer page for Django, Run, Man, Run, and A Man Called Blade. Mark the hand in the main menu for interviews on the formation of a rock group and a hidden weapon in the menu "Speech / Subtitle" leads to the story of how Tomas Milian was nearly killed because he was against the communists
