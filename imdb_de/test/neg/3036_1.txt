Sorry, this movie was a bad one for the TV movie. Is the rest of you drugs when you saw him? I thought that hair, make-up and characters were bad two-dimensional guys. The story is doubtful, especially since all the main characters are dead or almost dead. I think it's not played well either ... What about the hair on the main person in the Turtles? It looked bad, and the sideburns looked like they were falling down at any moment. It did not feel like something new was revealed in the band's history and how members got to know other bands and people. I laughed all the way, Frank Zappa looked stupid, as did Mama Cass and the Beatles. They looked stupid and ridiculous. The other band members like Jim Morrison and Donovan also had great success when they looked stupid. Somehow terrible, remembering these people. It's a bad history lesson about music, it's fictional as it was made.
