In the opening sequence of "Where is Poppa?" One morning, George Segal gets up from his bed, shaves, takes a shower, puts on a gorilla suit, and goes into his mother's bedroom, as we later realize, to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her forever out of his life. This is about the degree of humor that you can expect from most images: madness mixed with something that could be called a morbid venture. Segal plays a lawyer from New York who lives with his supposedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life becomes even more complicated as he hires a nurse to take care of the old bag that hits the girl of his dreams. the pleasantly primitive Trish Van Devere, decorated like Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how can you integrate the beautiful nurse into your mother's life? <br /> <br /> Segal is about the only thing that holds the picture together. His frustrations, reactions and comic timing are almost unparalleled (what happened to the guy?); where the movie fails is in other areas. Ruth Gordon's characterization is awful like the mother. In the beginning you can not figure out if your character is decrepit or deliberately vague to prevent your son from undressing. In the end, it's clear she's just crazy. When Segal brings Van Devere home to meet her, Gordon's eyebrows frown and she gets a wicked, scary look. She wants the intruder removed in her son's life. it is not the mode of a senile person. They receive no consistent performance throughout the picture, which is probably as much the fault of the director (Carl Reiner) as that of Gordon. Ruth Gordon's old lady in "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because the audience reacts to her as annoying with the kind of engaging, sounding person Ruth Gordon generally plays. But if Mia Farrow is too shy to fight back, Gordon grows more and more weary, her teeth are digging deeper and we are afraid of Farrow; This kind of compulsion is really scary. Here we are asked to laugh at what we would normally find annoying, and if Gordon plays it completely helpless, we could do that. But she is selfish and mean and mutes the little sense of humor that exists. <br /> <br /> But there are some good laughs. A court scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counterculture punk is pretty weird, and Vincent Gardenia is a good Lombard football coach. There is also an inspired play in which Segal's brother (Ron Liebman), who has been stripped naked by Muggers on his way to Segal, asks him for something at home - and he gives him the gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> However, the script is poorly designed and does not make much sense. Why is a New York lawyer living in private practice even living at home? Why does Segal, when his mother is senile, logically argue with her, "If you spoil that for me, I'll beat your heavy heart." Why does Liebman continue to cut through the park when he knows he will be attacked? Why does he take a cab after leaving Segala's gorilla suit? Why did not he take taxis the whole time? A funnier piece would have been Liebman than the gorilla who terrorized the mugger. Why does Van Devere come back again and again - after her first husband goes crazy, why does she want to engage with this group? I think if I told Carl Reiner that, he would say, "These are crazy people, they do not make sense." This is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script that is full of holes. The moment-to-moment behavior of the characters does not necessarily make sense, but their motivations do, and there is "Where is Poppa?" fall apart; The situations are created only for the gag, and the gags are mostly one-shots, they do not work. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the worst culprit in this whole fiasco. How he has developed this reputation as a pillar of comedy confuses me; Basically it was his career to hold a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while they talk with funny voices. His son Rob has ten times the ability and intelligence as a director. In Show Biz terms, Reiner Kn√∂pfe expresses; a monkey could do his job. And that shows itself most clearly in his design of the plot. Why is all New York filmed in close and close-up, but the landscapes in the country are all far away and panoramic? This is the mentality of Carl Reiner, claustrophobic for the city, spatially for the country. In the last crazy scene of the nursing home, the camera is so far away that you can not even tell what's going on. The abrupt end suggests a solution that Segal could have reached ninety minutes ago. It also suggests that Reiner could not figure out how to finish the picture. So he just cut it off as another example of "weirdness". Reiner seems to believe that stupidity is madness, and insanity without logic is always funny. That's not the case, and the makers of "Where's Poppa" are as crazy as Ruth Gordon Pepsi is in their fruit loops.
