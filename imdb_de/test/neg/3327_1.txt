My daughter liked it, but I was horrified that a character smokes in this movie. As if it were not terrible enough to see actors like Bruce Willis smoking in their films - at least children's films should be more considerate! I wonder: was that intentionally? Has the big tobacco "sponsored" the film? What does it take to ban the smoking of films? At least films that are intended for children and adolescents.
