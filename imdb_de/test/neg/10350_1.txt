The original Australian Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why do American producers need to remake & ruin another classic show? Think of the original version of The Office with Ricky Gervais. It was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to make it new. The producers said the British humor of "The Office" and the Australian humor of "Kath & Kim" would not translate to an American audience ......... WHAT ??? Basically, they say that Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand the jokes, so they need to re-make the shows with over-the-top jokes so Americans can understand the humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague !!
