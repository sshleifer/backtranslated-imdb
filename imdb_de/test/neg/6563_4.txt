Star Trek V undoubtedly deserves the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the actor's good acting efforts, Paramount Pictures generally suffered from financial resources. Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about this movie from the start. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the Enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a paraphrase for saving the earth from an ecological total catastrophe. Their shore leave is interrupted when a disruption occurs on Nimbus III, the planet of intergalactic peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive in Nimbus III to have their ship abducted by Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Sybok brainwashs the crew of the Enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to meet with "God" just past the Great Barrier in the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk then has to find a way to regain control of his ship and fend off Enterprise pursuers in Klignon. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is acting and directing. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest of the cast perform well. William Shatner is also doing a pretty good job of directing this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffered from general lack of enthusiasm and money. Initially, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So Laurence Luckinbill got the role. Second, many of the special effects were greatly reduced, reducing the entertaining potential of the films. Third, the scene of the arrival at the Great Barrier left much to be desired. After all, the romance between Scotty and Uhura made no sense at all in this film ... given that there was no such romance in the Star Trek universe before, and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly arise between the two Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very weak movie. You probably should just skip this movie and go to Star Trek VI. After all, cast and crew have forced Star Trek VI to partially rescue themselves after their debacle with Star Trek V.
