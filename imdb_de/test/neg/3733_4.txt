It's not even two years since I saw this movie for the first time, yet I can barely remember anything about this movie. Needless to say, I found it very careless. From what I remember, nothing is very good. A talented cast is wasted in what I think was a dark comedy, but when it does, it fails miserably. At best, this movie is mildly interesting. In the worst case, the seemingly omnipresent overcast skies are more interesting than the storyline. If you like watching movies that are always wet and cool then you will probably find something in this picture. Just try to ignore what else is going on, because it's hard to see.
