Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and remains a classic example of how the substance goes wrong. Rather than relying on the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix has produced a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible." Did you know that Tifa knows incredibly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically change the camera angle every second? This cloud can effortlessly stay in the midst of the air as it swings wildly with its 2-tonne sword. The English dub is mediocre. Although not terribly bad, it is far from well produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. <br /> <br /> Here I would like to tell the die-hard FFVII fans who can not stop raving about this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could hope for from Square Enix, but even one Trash CG strips like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will be embarrassed by this movie and its thoughtlessness in due course. The days of novelty are numbered. <br /> <br /> Movies like Advent Children make me wonder if Square Enix recognizes the potential of his franchise. After all (and no offense) it is a Japanese company. Japanese developers can offer fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly flat. However, they are absolute psychos when it comes to production quality. Advent Children offers some of the most stunning renderings in CG history, but that does not save it from the tangled plot and cardboard figures. <br /> <br /> Every fan who has followed this movie knows that Sephiroth is coming back. It was a big mistake to bend the story for his resurrection. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The only point I give this "movie" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to make every bleached blonde hair on Cloud's feminine Caucasian head.
