I filmed this movie a few years ago, one night ago, and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. However, since it is an action movie, I can not give him more stars because the humor was not intended. Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the street to see his family, and within the first five minutes, a conflict ensues that causes Chuck to take revenge on the rest of the movie. A good thing, too, because the role model of all those involved got old very quickly. Actually, the judge was pretty good, but I can not really describe why he works. You have to find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> And the Custom Chuck Norris drives are terribly classic!
