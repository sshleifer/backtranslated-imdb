This has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first movie. And of course, we Americans just have to successfully convert everything into English, because the man who reads subtitles is SOOOOO. From what I've seen in the new trailers with the enchanting, now pregnant Jessica Alba (well, that ruins every fantasy of fantasy every teen!) It looks exactly the same, but probably with twice the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery movies I've seen in any language in a long time. I would recommend to take a look at this and skip it all together. There is no reason to observe this because there is no reason to even call it "The Eye 2" except to benefit from the excellence that was the first blow. Do yourself a favor and watch "The Eye" with the volume up and get ready for a probable jump. I looked at it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised what the Pang brothers were in that direction. If the remake of "The Eye" works well, I hope this will be the case for Pang Brothers' film career, but at the same time it seems a shame that people will not see / see the original because very often / almost always the remake is not as good as the original. Look at these if you want to be a bit boring, but the original is not a comparison to this sequel, just in name.
