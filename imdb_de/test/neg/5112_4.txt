Welles said he had been descenting his entire career. <br /> <br /> There was an interesting story here. Unfortunately, Welles seemed utterly unable to say it. Instead, he tried to tell different stories, about Elmyr, about Clifford Irving, about his pompous view of critics and experts, oh yes, and he tried to start his current girlfriend's career by giving up her unnecessary screen time. (Oh yeah darling, when you said you should go to sleep with the director, it does not mean that you're washed up on the beach like a whale!) Welles probably tried to make a lot of money Footage by Clifford Irving as Irving became a household name with his role in the fake autobiography of Howard Hughes. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the subject of his film, Elmyr, got the time he deserved, and probably it was the more interesting story. <br /> <br /> The great tragedy of Orson Welles was that he reached his climax early. Then he spent the rest of his career sputtering, eventually promoting wine and terrible documentaries.
