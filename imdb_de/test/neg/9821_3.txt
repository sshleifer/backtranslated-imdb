The book receives 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> It probably contains spoilers from both the book and the movie !!! <br /> <br /> If you have never read a villain of Geoffrey Household, the source material for Man Hunt, Fritz Lang's story is likely to please. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and have practically memorized the book, the movie will be a disappointing disappointment. I assume that you have already read a summary of the story and continue with my complaints. Household's little novel is one of the most exciting classics of all time, tense and spared, with only a handful of characters driving the action. Fritz Lang and his scriptwriter Dudley Nichols feel the need to bring in the protagonist's brother and a likeable hover, the latter reducing the depth of the story by giving the script an extra-extrinsic motivation where the novel does not need it. In fact, the true highlight of the book was not the escape of the nameless narrator from his subterranean camp, but rather his self-acceptance of his real motive to go hunting at all. And that's another matter: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why not Lang? "Thorndyke?" From what hat did they pull that? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint: the hunter of the household is so decidedly British he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can barely hold the accent, which is just a little deeper and more convincing than that of Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. He looked good in the role and was a good actor for the 1940s, but as a disgusting hero of Rogue Male? Let's search for a more convincing version on Szepter Island itself. Remake soon with fineness and with, please! I manage it for free?
