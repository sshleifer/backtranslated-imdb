Well, some people might see this to see a rubber and PVC bisexual vampire assassin kicking in the ass. If that's what you want and you're wearing a coat, counting your teeth on points and thinking that the name Lilith Silver is cool, then you'll see a good movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, an assassin, dressed in shiny, creaky rubber with HUGE crease, thick make-up and bad fangs, makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies that one sees. I laughed so hard that I almost cried. Ridiculous acting, dialogue and plotting help make this a better parody than Dracula, Dead and Loving. It might be ... <br /> <br /> It's trying to be cool and goth, and all it manages to do is create hilarious every scene. Even the attached lesbian scene is funny (how * did * she take off these boots so fast ... you were tied to * here *) ...) <br /> <br /> Do not look, if you like good movies. Look at it, if you like horrible movies and want to laugh until you fall over ... That's not good, it's just bad.
