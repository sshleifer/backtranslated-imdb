I started to watch this movie on TV. a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. At first, the person in the witness protection system in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about the outside guards and then asks the guard in the house if he can talk on the phone - only to find that the line has been broken. <Soon after, Roy Scheider appears as one of the assassins of the witness and properly executes the witness and his wife - whereupon the Roy Scheider character picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number and then says: it's done !!!! That was it for me!
