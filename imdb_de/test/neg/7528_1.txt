PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with his confusing plot line and terrible acting. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the characters first. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boisterous rage throughout the movie, due to her overwhelming passion to become a Prom Queen. The audience, however, completely unknown why Cherry ever wants to become a Prom Queen. Before the nominations are even read, she storms with constant lack of interest in the school around the school and shows first no interest in the place or his students. Why is she so keen to be her prom queen? Brooke Balderson appears to be a "celebrated" performance, but in reality spends the whole time with an angry face, stomping around and killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you hand over a script to a young actor / actress that only makes him / her behave insanely angry, do not ask for much. They also do not allow the character to develop very well. <br/> <br/> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotions and no connection to her character. When she is molested by her headmaster, she beats him down (after a few seconds) without the feeling of disgust or shock, or something equally traumatic. Her lines are read as if she were reading little things on the back of a cereal box. Throughout the remainder of the film, the students responsible for his kidnapping sound more like they're planning a barbecue instead of deciding what to do. They'll do it with their headmistress sitting in their basement. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry kills several female Prom Queen candidates, and no one notices or cares. (Yeah, I understand, I understand, the whole town is worried about the prom.) Very realistic, at least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that could be asking too much.) For example, right after Cherry Beth goes to the School over and shoots a handful of students. Beth is being interviewed by the local media. The reporter mentions "the shooter" in a way that makes it appear that nobody knows who killed these innocent students, but then a second later asks, "What do you think about weapons in the hands of minors?" or something for that purpose. Where did the reporter come to such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen, the prom is over and the media re-emerges. Beth simply adds, "She understands (Cherry needs to be heard)" and goes away with her friends and smokes cigarettes in a calm, unadulterated mood. No one is even confused by the fact that they have just seen a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the students, who are constantly parked in a yellow zone, and nobody seems to be interested in the sudden occurrence of violence. In the city, Julie lived in a big house with no parents and parents present bizarre party in their house (Maybe I cut off a bit from the scene, but the last time I knew that at school parties nude women did not artistically danced in a pool of water while men bob down on marshmallows and everyone in their attitude "I am so indie and mod bathing), Beth's parents act terribly while her mother acts exaggerated and her father just nods at everything the mother has to say (and not in a fun way), along with stupid scenes like the new black captain chasing after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give to this film is that the photography is wonderful. The viewing angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and sharp with each shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the drama and the screenplay are not.
