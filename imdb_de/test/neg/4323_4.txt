Lon Chaney Jr comes back to mumble as Kharis mummy searches for his partner Annanka, whose soul now lives in the beautiful offspring of Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, Arkan's High Priest, leaves Yousef Bey as the person in charge of Kharis to continue his evil actions. Tom (Robert Lowery) has to find a way to save his beloved Amina from the future mummy scare. A routinely predictable entry into the Kharis series proves that almost every movie follows a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by a skulking, one-armed, masked corpse, who has apparently been endowed with superhuman strength to suppress the lives of rescued men who are relatively easily held back by a mere joke from Kharis. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action and knows a lot about Egyptian history. In the previous film (The Mummy's Tomb), he proves that anyone who has survived a previous encounter with the mummy will surely die when he returns in the next flick. Well produced, but lacking in originality that set it apart from the other films in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine goes through his role as a bad Yousef Bey. An embarrassing script mistake has Kharis, known for putting on a crippled, lame right arm, carrying an unconscious Amina with both arms for long stretches without pathological effects. One aspect, the shocking climax, in which Tom's attempt at heroism does not proceed according to plan, as Kharis holds his needy hostage hostage, lifts the film slightly from the doldrums.
