This movie is pathetic, not because it's misdirected, played, sung, danced, filmed, etc., but because it's really hard to ruin a movie with an ABBA soundtrack. However, this is the only thing that manages the film. The musical presentations in the movie SouthPark were much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you do not need talent to become a director - all you need are ABBA songs singing close-ups in the harsh sunlight and just ruin the song with all the distracting lines on your face. Why this with one of the most talented actresses out there?
