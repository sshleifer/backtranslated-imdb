The TV director uses astral projection to kill people who have the blue man's form. <br /> <br /> Boring, unpretentious horror movie that somehow sits in front of your eyes asking why you see it. I sat through the movie until the very end and can not really give you more than a cursory account of what the movie was about because I kept finding my attention distracted by other things. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this. I think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a double feature and I feel kind of torn off.
