This is another Hollywood anti-communist polemic from the golden fifties. The mature American Gene Barry, the lovely Englishwoman Valerie French and three others are kidnapped by an alien and filled with shells that contain fantastic - and fantastically vague - power. What are the Earthlings doing with this power? Throw it into the sea or use it to wipe out all humanity? Anyone who knows American cinema around 1957 knows the answer to what Commies will do, but the story is ripe when Americans test things in the middle of the Pacific. Then a scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, sets up his own theory and uses it! His smarmy attitude afterward is disgusting, and the happy mood of everyone else is appalling. confirmed enemies of freedom! "That's right - do not worry about the ethical puzzle of killing anyone an alien pill considers an enemy of freedom - just do it! Hurray! No commies Stupid woman - and you were yours into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me baby!
