Killjoy 2 is the same as Killjoy 1. Bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. Honestly, I'm not very surprised that more people have not seen this movie. The only reason I have seen Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to believe that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They did not do it. This movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. That clown ... that goddamn clown ... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I do not hate him because he is a good villain ... I hate him because he is unbelievably annoying! I hope that the filmmakers have realized after trying and failing again that this movie is not repairable. The last thing we need is a killjoy 3.
