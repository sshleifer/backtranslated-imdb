I can not remember the last time a movie was so boring that I went out. The Weatherman and The Island were both so bad that I thought about it, but I stayed there until the end. This film was incomprehensible, not funny and just went on and on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if parts were just French humor that I did not get, or if the characters are serious. I finally gave up and tried to take a nap because I did not want to disturb my husband when he enjoyed it, but he noticed it and let me know that it was alright if I wanted to leave the door and we went out. He would like to know how it ended ... whether Denevue lived or died, etc. (I do not care).
