Impressive. So my friend and I went to the movie store to rent a movie. I like stupid horror movies, so I searched the various terrible movies they had to offer while looking for Michael Moore's "Sicko". Then I found the worst of all (as I would soon learn). The cover looked good and the description on the back looked decent. The fact that there was an IMDb quote on it as a review proves that it would be bad in a good way. The next evening we put it in the DVD player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> The film is completely incoherent, with badly placed leaps in time from past to future leaving you to ask a big WTF? The plot has no coherent story - except for the indefinite allusion to a local myth about a murder, but only in the last twenty minutes of the film comes to fruition. Pretty much for the first lesson, you have the following: random, confusing time jumps; incoherent act; Parents who do not age; bad behavior; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes the hair color; and a wealth of vile characters that can bore you! <br /> <br /> The movie moves so slowly that actually sitting there watching it is a chore. I would rather scrub the toilets, honestly. Do not bother with it.
