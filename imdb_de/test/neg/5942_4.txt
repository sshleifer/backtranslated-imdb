This film captures the brief moments between mother and son in rural Russia while she is dying. <br /> <br /> I'm so torn, whether I'm nice to the film or explain it to a patience test. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialogue capturing the essence of her emotions. There is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows his mother so much care, love and patience that I think this is a celebration of unconditional love for his family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in such a situation, stuck in a joyless place, and caring for a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" is really moving too slowly. Do I really have to drive a train past the horizon for more than 1 minute? With my experiences so far with "Telets" and "Aleksandra" I am so tempted to use "Mat I Syn" as total boredom. <br /> <br /> I think you have to be in the right condition to appreciate the movie. I certainly see the beauty of it, but maybe I'm not in the right mood.
