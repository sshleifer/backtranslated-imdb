In this film, the now infamous Wannsee conference is examined, in which top Nazis met to organize and carry out the "final solution". To begin with, I was astonished when Kenneth Branagh played a Nazi. With his smooth blond hair back, he certainly looked the part, but he did not do the role well. There was no threat and cruelty, and in the end he came out like a grinning cheerleader and held the meeting upright. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get as out of control as in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, the dr. William Stuckart, the man who wrote the year 1935, played Nuremberg race laws and who gave "legal respect" to what the Nazis did. The performance of Firth was stunning, the main vocal opponent of Heydrich's proposal. Best of all, he verbally dressed one of the Nazi thugs. The bat muttered, "I'll remember you," and Firth replies, "You should! I'm very well known !!" The film is historically accurate, but let it boil down to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men at a table discussing, shouting and bragging. There is no excitement, no real conflicts (except for the short argument). It's only 90 minutes to talk! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the DVD is worth the money. I felt too short.
