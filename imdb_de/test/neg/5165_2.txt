With all her wonderful pictures, with all her good intentions, this comes out as another disgusting one-sided, over-hyped, self-propaganda. <br /> <br /> The message is simple: "All Japanese Fighting on the Kokoda track were sadistic, malicious thugs who enjoyed getting rid of every Australian Aussie squad and cutting their throats before Kokoda has not only picked up on Gallipoli's only mistake (that the enemy is faceless, nameless, and apparently inhumane), but proves to be the opposite of Weir's masterpiece, rather than giving us a perfect film with a flaw, we have a terrible mess with a redeeming feature. <br /> <br /> Let's start with: we become familiar with them without adapting to the characters. Apparently quite relaxed, two-dimensional people with whom we never ... EVERYONE sympathizes, we are kept at such a distance that even if we could relate so easily to the characters, they will find a way to stay away from us, that alone is a kra It is a stinging phenomenon, since it keeps us from conspiracy, leaves a lasting impression on the terrible tempo, and makes the contrast between an openly sentimental ending and an otherwise rather slender body of a human being clearly visible. <br /> <br /> In other words, it takes us through a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them), and just as it should end, we're thrown into another eye roll. The skirmish ends faster than it started. So for not yet informed: If it should end, it starts again and ends only when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and agonizing pace! <br /> <br /> What brings me to the ultimatum: This is to inform us about the events of the Kokoda track. It does not come close. Not only does it describe a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (by sprinkling a little "camaraderie" about it to make it relevant), but it manages to do what a movie is as important as it should be , It does NOT matter to us. <br /> <br /> Frankly, my eyes were constantly glued to my watch all the time. The audience around me, all proud of Australian, trembled when it came to how great the movie is going to be, moaned, moaned and wailed disappointed as each of the painful ninety-five minutes (for a short while) boomed. It felt like Apocalypse Now : The difference was that Apocalypse Now was a good movie and deserved the three hours it got, and at the point where suicide could be an alternative, it should be imperative that this movie be seen. <br /> <br /> Although, considering how much the TV advertised this garbage, I would say that it is obligatory in the subliminal sense of the word. <br /> <br /> See if you like beautiful pictures. You should, however, take a closer look at The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway, as they offer superior cinematography and ACTUAL charts. <br /> <br /> Overall: *
