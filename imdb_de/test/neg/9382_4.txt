It starts off well, but after a while you expect more from this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes unclear and unclear. The Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after being transferred to a capitalist country, this is the Czech unofficial, but well-known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything that they think is good when they see it in other films or countries or see it elsewhere. I think that's a good example of how to do "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "film" and money. And it remains to me of / One flow over the cuckoo's nest /, which one can not compare with ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. It could be done better. At least they tried. I'm sorry people. :-( CAN NOT recommend
