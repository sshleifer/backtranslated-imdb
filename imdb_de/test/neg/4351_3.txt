A sadly inferior predecessor to "Who's Fear of Virginia Woolf," this film continues to grow, occasionally reviving your interest to subject you to self-finding maundering and obvious, but obviously exaggerated, plot points. It could give a list as 111 minutes, but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time.
