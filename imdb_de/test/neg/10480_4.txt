Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): The first half is deadly boring, even dreary - but the final stages improve significantly with the scenes that include the raging "monster". In the accompanying Featurette (a rather dry affair of only 9 minutes compared to those created for the other titles in Criterion's "Monsters & Madmen" set), Director Day - who wants to admit, does not make a fan of science fiction to be a genre - trying to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that it has a zero budget to work with (with all the space scenes made up of stock footage!) ... and I would have liked the movie I had not seen CALTIKI, THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) recently - a similar (and similarly flimsy), but far more stylish adventure from Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards, the cocky but unlucky astronaut obsessed with titular achievement, is initially positively bored, but eventually manages to gain sympathy for the audience when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commanding officer and older brother is O.K. as a slim Glenn Ford type; Previously, he starred in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958), another (and more successful) science-fiction film produced by Richard Gordon, which incidentally is also available on Criterion on DVD. The Italian starlet Marla Landi, who struggles with the English language, provides for an inadequate female lead. even their use in the featurette proves to be less sustainable! <br /> <br /> The audio commentary is another delightful track by Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon, which, among other things, brings the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was intended as a double feature with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958) up - but it was finally released as a standalone version to exploit the current news value of the current space race; It's also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by Bonar Colleano (who tragically died in a traffic accident before the movie was released!). Weaver even recalls a few anecdotes from the time he was involved in the production of the DVD filmed by ex-iconic filmmaker Norman J. Warren. Landi, who had since become a lady, was still ready to help carry the equipment necessary to film the interview across several steps! Edwards should have contributed to the featurette, but when he was in London he was reluctant to collaborate with Weaver. The latter learned that the actor had recently contracted cancer and actually died in 2002.
