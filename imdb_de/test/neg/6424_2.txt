I know a few people who look exactly like the lead actress in this movie (or at least like the character she portrays.) They all scare me and I would be the last person to loan one of them even a sharp one Knife. She has a mean and ugly-looking expression. If you can summon some compassion for her, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course I could have the same expressions of concern and anxiety if I had an imaginary friend who killed my true girl friends and acquaintances from the past 15 years. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends in the IMDb, it is sad to say that some colleges and universities in the US are teaching courses on paranormal phenomena and relying on the pathetic defense that it is "academic freedom" and open examination represents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it. You will not have any sympathy for any of the characters (except for Aunt Lydia, who runs out pretty early) and the action makes no sense.
