One of the worst movies of the year, if not all. Anthony Hopkins belittles by even appearing in this joke. I can not believe that the name of David Mamet and Ridley Scott is on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was to refuse. Julianne Moore was as unemotional as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good that I did not know it was Gary until the end of the credits. but eaten by trained wild boars ??? Give me a break! Rumor has it he did not want his name mentioned in the credits. And fried Ray Liotta his own brain and fed it ... I laughed at the absurdity of not doing this stupidity of this strip at this time. I have not seen so many people leaving a movie since Who's That Girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else if you have to, but DO NOT miss it!
