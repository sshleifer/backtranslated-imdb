Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. Pathetic in almost every way. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD right in the bin - I did not even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift store. <br /> <br /> The effects are beyond a joke. The dam control room looks like cardboard. The water looks with the backgrounds from the scale - nothing works. <br /> <br /> Then there is the limp action - as deep as a Scooby Doo cartoon. <br /> <br /> I could not do it. I wait until everyone drowns.
