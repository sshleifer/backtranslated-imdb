I have read all the free contributions to this muddled half-noir and am amazed at the high esteem for what in the Cruel Light of 2007 is a very sloppy, late-RKO assembly line product. All these endless documentations of fish, waves, fish and waves have little to do with the central conflict and only burden the running time. The editing is downright carefree: scenes are about to end and there are other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialogue carries the stilt-like traces of the origins of the Odets: uploaded metaphors that could never have come from the limited ideas of these everyday people. But what is really surprising is the terribly exaggerated triangle on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she growls and warps and fights wildly - an undisciplinary feat that lays some notches below her standard. Douglas exaggerates that he is adorable. Then he goes on a murderous rampage and is just as frantic as Ryan, who unnaturally growls and screams. The less interesting second pair offers at least some recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character by today's standards is a Neanderthal, is still calm and convincing, like Stanwyck's brother (much younger, one suspects) and Marilyn Monroe as his girlfriend. is natural and untouched. On the windswept coast of Monterey (and all the Monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of the city's appearance), in the midst of overheated hysteria, these are two islands of reason. One last point and a spoiler: Maybe the Breen office gave the order, but does anyone believe that the happy ending ends for a second? Stanwyck has temporarily become an obedient wife, but I give the marriage a month.
