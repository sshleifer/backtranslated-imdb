While The Twilight Zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven - with some great episodes, some lousy and many in between. Do not believe the diehard fans - there are a few stinkers and that was definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> In an act that is supposed to be an attack on Fidel Castro, Peter Falk (a lot of make-up and beard) gets a magic mirror that lets him see who his enemies are, so he can she can liquidate. While I believe that Castro is a criminal and a dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will testify to that), it's amazing how that sort of sermon episode gets the audience thinking about American efforts to marginalize the creep , actually laugh Castro seems to be fine !! Think about it - Serling and his company wanted to hurt Castro, but they seemed only obvious, preaching and stupid. <br /> <br /> It is indeed bad - almost ridiculous when you see it today.
