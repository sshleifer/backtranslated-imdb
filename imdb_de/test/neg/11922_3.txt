Laughable. <br /> <br /> Clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Overdosing the style to compensate for bad writing. <br /> <br /> Do you remember when MTV actually aired music videos and other shows on reality shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on such a show? a cartoon from the 90s? Featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the lovely Charlize Theron, is a cold-blooded rebel who is as skilful as a line dancer and as deadly as a viper. It must be her, if she expects to kick the totalitarian government in the ass. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian, tech-fed films like The Island (2005)) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom stack). Aeon Flux has amplified all the issues that exist in these films. That is, there is nothing original to show that compensates for it with the slender style Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux, which adds some points, but the surface scratches and there is literally nothing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all the performances in this movie are abhorrent and some really sore me. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is interwoven with the cheesiest, crispest chick-chic, and it seems like director Karyn Kusama can not pinpoint where to go next. Should she make her more distant or emotional? She does not know! Let's go in both directions! Imagine, you take a shotgun, load it full of character developments of different kinds and fire there in a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> The film Aeon Flux presents all the "compulsory" ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. Society, nature vs. Science, Emotion vs. cold reason, etc. You've seen it all before, and it's better done. Read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley or even check out Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... everything! Avoid this viciously unpretentious cheese festival for as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
