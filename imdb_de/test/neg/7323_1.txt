Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and unreal. She is on and off the screen right away. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves the same as in movies. Her silly expressions make me change the channel. She has been involved in some good films, but it would have been better if someone else had been selected for the role. Steve Martin does not add much to the movie either. He also acts over and ruines an old favorite. The ridiculous part played by Martin Short just adds more phrases to the movie. I tried to watch the movie twice but it had to be turned off both times.
