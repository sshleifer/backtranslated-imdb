I was surprised that the creators of this movie actually said that this movie was a true story. Most of the scenes looked spotty to me. For example, when a girl ate her sandwich and was a roach in it. While she ate the sandwich, the camera on the opposite side showed that there was a roach there. It's funny how the camera just turned on the sandwich when the girl ate it. Another scene is when the gang opened a closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should I say it was thrown away to get the effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It is highly doubtful that the events of that evening were true when the "St. Francisville Experiment" took place. I think the house may be haunted, but not on the night this movie was filmed! The end was amusing when Tim and other girls were chained in a basement. Paul and Madison found her and saved her! I would rather take another look at the Blair Witch Project and then have to go through the St. Francisville Experiment movie again. As I said, if the creators of the film do not say that this is a true story with true events, maybe I like it more. You should benefit better from the Blair Witch Project (though this is not a true story) !!!
