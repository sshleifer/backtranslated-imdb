Since I'm a big Laura Gemser fan, I picked him up in a rental business just to see another movie by Emanuelle. Boy, did I make a mistake? <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but that is the only connection to Emanuelle. Here Laura plays "Laura" (original, what?), A beautiful supermodel visiting her affluent friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In tow, she is a hole photographer Carlo (a hardened Gabriele Tinti) and a blonde woman who is never named. In Pia's villa lives Horatio (the sexy but stupid Al Cliver), a mystique that speaks nothing but nonsense. For the weekend, Pia's two daughters arrive, a short-haired lesbian and the other a brunette. Much sex is implied but rarely shown. A handsome actor plays the Egyptian servant Ali, who is lucky with three of the women in the mansion. Laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde have sex with Horatio at an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks goat blood and is obsessed during an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo raped Laura. All this happens with so little flair that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Far away from eroticism, even the actors look bored during their sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the fact that there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of available sex scenes is uncountable. Instead, a movie that offers a top-notch Eurocult cast and never delivers the merchandise will annoy any viewer, except the hardcore enforcer Laura Gemser. Otherwise, avoid EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
