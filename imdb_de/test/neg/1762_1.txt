<br /> <br /> This movie really has nothing to offer. The Reverend, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, complains about constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5-hour movie. They know that they did not make any cuts and literally let in the crap. It's a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment. Dreadful! <br /> <br />
