on a saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mother let me go because she thought the movie would be ok (the movie is rated G). I was attacked by loud music, strange pictures, no conspiracy and the stubborn refusal to make any sense. We went half way through because we were bored and frustrated and our ears ached. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a revival theater 22 years later. My opinion had changed - it is even BAD! Basically everything I hated was still there and the movie was VERY 60's ... and went out bad. I got all the little jokes ... too bad they were not funny. The constant pitch shifts were quickly annoying and there is absolutely nothing that is firmly under control. Some people will love that. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also all Monkees songs in this movie suck (and I like them). <br /> Only for ex-hippies ... or if you are stoned. I give this a 1.
