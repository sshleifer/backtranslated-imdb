After an astronaut dies in space, he is taken to a military base. Inside the man alien embryos are discovered - he is the host for a terrible alien invasion! This film was made by director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "Attack of the Giant Leeches" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on "Columbo". The executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this ... especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This film is cheesy and poorly constructed. What seems interesting are the bad effects, not the actual movie. A scene shows a closeup of alien embryos and it's an embarrassing cartoon depiction. Even for 1958. And when a full-grown alien shows up, you're wondering why he wears shoes. Or if you're really shrewd, you'll wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other films. <br /> <br /> This is by no means the worst science fiction movie you'll ever see. And you almost have to pay tribute to it - the alien host who overrides the idea of ​​a military base is older than "The Thing" and "Alien." I do not know if these films were somehow inspired (I doubt it), but it was at least ahead of their time. In addition, the film flutters and is only suitable for drinking while drinking. I have not seen the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but that's certainly a movie worthy of their insults.
