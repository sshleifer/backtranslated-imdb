If you're a six-year-old boy and love dinosaurs, you'll love this movie. If you are someone else, roll your eyes about every 15 seconds. If you want to look for things like drama, special effects, dialogue, or the lack of a coherent plot that makes the least sense, you have a lot of material. If you just want a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid, that's enough. That said, there are plenty of entertainment options for children who are much smarter, and some of them are even bearable or enjoyable for adults. If your child is not in an uncompromising dinosaur mood, it may be better to look for something else.
