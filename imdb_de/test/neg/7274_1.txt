Lord, that's shit. There is one type of sex revolution in the 1960s that confuses sexual assault with sexual liberation. This movie is an example. I have lost track of how often women are beaten, beaten, beaten or beaten in film. And then again and again there are times when women in the film dream of being beaten, beaten, flogged or beaten (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it is supposedly part of safe fetish playing. Other times it is obviously not, but you will wait in vain to see how the heroine reports to authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we hear her being taught by her rapist of her inability to "let go." <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie stinks of misogyny (she speaks as a pure, white, married man in her late thirties), not a teenage lesbian teenager student with a chip on her shoulder so you do not get the wrong idea to get. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the good thing about this movie is that it's a strong reminder of how bad it is. Things were really only a few decades ago for women.
