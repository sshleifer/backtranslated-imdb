I heard that this step was put together by a group of students. As an art or theater project at a high school, it's not that bad. If you did not live near Milpitas in the seventies or if you knew someone who was involved in the making of the film, it's pretty awful. Most actors are clearly not actors, but locals who have volunteered. Bob Wilkins (the original host of Creature Features on KTVU in Oakland appears, but only for a minute). Some of the monster effects are done with stop-motion animations and some with a man in a monster suit. They all work fine, but there is no continuity between the two. If you look without dialogue, you would assume that the movie had 2 monsters. I think the most intolerable aspect is that even the main characters, who I assume are the children behind the film, can not even pretend to act. These children must have been involved in the theater somehow in order to carry out this project, but they do not show any credible emotion in front of the camera.
