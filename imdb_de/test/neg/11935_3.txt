I think I should make a fourth change in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN series now. The sequels still amaze or amaze me by their sleaze and conscious _absurdism. They form or forge a fourth way - not classic, not revisionist, not European - but a sloppy Americana akin to the violent vigilante films of the 70s, absurd garbage. Also this part is bombastic and inexplicably uncomplicated and even a bit strange. Well, I find it worrying that these sequels are not just having their opportunistic fans. But fans just can not tell the difference between the style of the original and the extensions. <br /> <br /> These sequels are not boring or bland, but bizarre. Of course they are very poorly written - messy scripts, rubbish lines. It's just crazy. In this installment, each shooter gets several women? Van Cleef's young wife asks him to release a young prisoner; he finally does it. The young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, abducts the woman, rapes and kills her. Then he joins a culprit. Van Cleef, who had previously refused to defend a village, now assembles a small group and accuses the hacienda of the offense; then the wrongdoers calculate the village in which Van Cleef has settled. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, quite active in the 70's Western Western, is the darling of Van Cleef. Callan, very antipathetic, is Noah, a writer and Chris' Sidekick. The rest of the aggressive group are Askew (one of the only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Louder. Rita Rogers is a really hot, fleshy beauty.
