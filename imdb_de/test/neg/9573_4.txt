As I write this in November 2005, I realized that the big British boom in cinema has come to an end, and people assume that much of it depends on the British government for it does not grant tax breaks to filmmakers - poor ones Variety of producers in recent years. Let's take a look at what the British produced in 1995-2005: Funky Gangster Thriller. LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a really great and thoroughly entertaining movie, and people have been trying hard to enjoy the style of Guy Ritchie with mostly disappointing results. Romantic comedies. Yes, okay, I know FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL, etc. were produced by American studios, but they are still unclear "British movies". Unfortunately, as they are guaranteed to earn a profit for the studios, they must follow a winning formula, usually with Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant again. <br /> <br /> Black Comedies. Can someone explain what a black comedy actually is? In the British context, it is usually a sprawling film, often with contemporary political statements that often resemble Mike Leigh's NAKED. Jasmin Disdars BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third type of British film. It was filmed in 1999 but recorded in 1993, with two men fighting in a bus. Later it became known that one is Serbian and one Croatian. So we get a snappy overview of what was happening in the Balkans at the time, the likelihood that two former Balkan enemies would collide on a London bus? This sums up one of the movie's biggest mistakes: irony takes precedence over possible situations. You can judge the final irony of the subplots, but is the result likely? The biggest irony is maybe the title of the movie. It's called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but certainly those viewers found clich√©d stereotypical people I could not believe in as three-dimensional characters
