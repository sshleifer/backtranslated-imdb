Gosh, when I heard this movie was NATIONAL LAMPOONS, I thought it would be great, but I really felt it was a pretty disappointing thing. I have seen most of the films that they have made, from the Christmas holidays to van Wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their name, really bad actors and too intense a movie. This movie is probably good to watch if you see it with a lot of reclaimed people and the ability to laugh about it, but if you like good comedies like I am, I do not suggest watching this movie van wilder a second or third Time to look at this movie ... You were warned.
