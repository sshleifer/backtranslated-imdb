The title, though unique, will no doubt evoke real horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classics about a troupe of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. However, I can assure you that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "freaks" or even the art of professional filmmaking in general. This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, distracting and thought-provoking, despite the low production levels. Yes exactly?? The person who recommended it to me can now consider myself as my personal enemy! The low budget factor is right, but that sums it up. "Freak" is awfully slow, badly done, and every character introduced is downright unbearable? and that includes the freak too. Two siblings on their way to a new life encounter a deformed mental patient who has escaped from the dolly to another hospital and returns to the house where he killed his mother at the age of 9, instead Tyler Sharpe decided it was boring and to make pointless. The lead actress's attempts to be emotionally devastated are pretty ridiculous and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be attributed to the limited budget. Total failure!
