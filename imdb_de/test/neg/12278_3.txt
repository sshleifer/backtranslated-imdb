Tony Curtis and Skip Homier wear black stockinged white canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the blown up tank. For the young stars have probably been too hard. If the real Marines had been on the mission, they would have worn boots. In the first scenes, they took off their leggings, before they made their little trip to the farmer. When they went to the area where they dug the foxholes, Tony and Skip wear combat boots. Later, when Lovejoy and Curtis encounter the Framer and his daughter Tony wears the "Tennis Shoes", they have turned black. The film is about a true story, but did it really need the love interest?
