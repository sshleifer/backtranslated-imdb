This film should go down in the annals of the fief as one of the worst of times. I'll stop saying that it's the worst movie ever, just because I have not watched a movie ever made. I can not set such high standards until then. The story is stale, acting is terrible at best, the "special effects" are no more than a few pounds. Dry ice and a fan. Someone must have been related to someone to make this movie. Mr. Busey sent this one! The dog is well trained and sweet. This makes him the only redeeming quality in this film that can never be done. I will never get back two hours and three dollars of my life.
