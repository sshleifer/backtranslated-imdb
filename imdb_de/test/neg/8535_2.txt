****** Spoiler inside ******* What a boring, predictable, scary snoring. The film had no character development: I did not feel sympathy for any of the characters (except maybe the little boy), and I did not care what happened to them. The movie had so many clich√©s or elements that were stolen from other horror movies. <br /> <br /> The movie was so predictable. Many times I would say to myself, "Let me guess, will happen next?" Yes, I was right. Already in the opening scene, I predicted that the attack on the family would come from one man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Sure enough, that's what happened (of course you have to wait 79 minutes to find out). And of course another "bad man" scenario. Why was he angry and killed his family? Because he is a man, duh! <br /> <br /> As someone else claims, this film may be scary for someone under 13 or for a movie from the 70s, but it is far from being a "scary" movie by today's standards. And like so many other crap-horror movies, many of the horrors were "fakes." Creepy music, Creepy music, Creepy music and ..... A crow suddenly flies at the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old banker manage to walk across an open plot a few times without his father seeing him? I thought for sure that the old man was a ghost. No, just a shitty movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 2 out of 10 because it grabbed my attention enough to go through the whole thing.
