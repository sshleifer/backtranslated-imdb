The wildest runaway in Alfred Hitchcock's career is the director's straightforward comedy cart that links Carole Lombard to Robert Montgomery as a couple who discovers a mistake has invalidated the marriage. Where do they really stand together? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others say, there is an element of tension here: the notion that these two miserable people might be able to escape, free to harm some of them. Another, undeserved buddy , <br /> <br /> It's funny to read here how badly Ann Smith by Lombard is in this movie because Montgomery's role is as much a heel. He abuses Ann, snatches witnesses, crushes customers - the kind of lawyer that gives his job a bad name. Of course, Ann also overcomes the kind of woman who keeps her husband hostage for six days in a small argument over work. He expresses things he had done in Paris when he was 20 and had not even met her. "I forgave you!" She says it's big of her. For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have some illicit pleasure with his "mistress" before they bind the knot for good. For Ann, this is an attempt at premarital sex, which must be repelled with a bottle of champagne on the head, followed by the expulsion from her home and her life. <br /> <br /> The glans does not seem to fall far The tree, when Ann's mother falls into an apoplexy, when she learns what David has tried to pull: "Oh, my poor baby! Thank heaven, it's yours Father dead! " <br /> <br /> This is a rare good line in this laughless, unlikely comedy. <br /> <br /> Let's call this an example of the "remarriage comedy" in which the bonds of marriage are questioned to be affirmed. One can also refer to this as an example of what Roger Ebert calls an "idiot plot" in which the plot depends on the main characters who act like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh about American morality, but can not do much more than do a rash scene in which an older pair of noisy plumbers panics year of release of this movie; It was the last movie of her that she experienced. What a shame, it could not have been better! She was presumptuous in "My Man Godfrey," but in such a nice way, you did not have to go with her, you wanted. Here she plays for laughs that are not there while breaking David's hacks over and over again. Montgomery rolled his eyes like Groucho, a study of complacency. <br /> <br /> The only really decent thing in this movie that takes more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's partner Jeff Custer, who plays a game for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond undermines his many reaction shots and even a drunken scene, all with good success. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** So decent is Jeff that Ann finally refuses him for not battling David afterward. She incites him into a confrontation and calls Custer "a lump of jelly". Jeff leaves the scene and leaves Ann and David together for their future suicide. Here is a Custer who managed to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
