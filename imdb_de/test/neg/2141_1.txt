I can not get over how horrible this movie was. My eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are bubbling blood from the awful, terrible song sound of a song. There are four children and a dog who ran away from a hospital and then stole two cars and a bus. Nobody gives them punishment or anything to correct them. The drama is just so awful that it sounds like a tutorial video for social classes. I can not think of anything that I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the child who loses his dog wanted to have me vomit. He brings his dog back without the lady sees the dog running out the door. Maybe the dog was trying to escape from this movie. Then there is some horse manure in the whole mix. It was a pain to watch this movie. In the end, the eldest boy says that staying together is not a crime and everyone embraces him and loves him. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have gone to the youth hall or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
