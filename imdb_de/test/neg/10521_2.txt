This stinker is mysteriously spinning on a canal, and I've been watching with horror again and again. The script is like joining in with too many drinks with friends, and the production values ​​are admirably consistent. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a children's movie, but has a grotesque (and unexplainable) kidnapping scene; The star dog has a lack of star quality that only matches the other actors. and it generally looks like someone is filmed in a backyard (the football game does not contain more than three dozen extras cheering sadly in the background). <br /> <br /> It's even budget-prone-if the story just stops for relief. The best marks have to be here either the producers - or the majority of extras from the football game!
