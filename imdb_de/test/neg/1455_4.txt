Overrated mob comedy. Director Demme stops the actors after a few funny lines to make the audience laugh and not miss the next line. Seems strange - this director has made "Silence of The Lambs" - now pauses can be used! Casting seems out. Mathew Modine too young for FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell does a Jack Nicholson thing with a squint and he gets a nomination for it! Also, do we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mob lawyer are each understaffed with just one line - they should be the bumblebee. The song score of Chris Isaak is absolutely out of place - better for a movie like "Pretty In Pink". Renew this movie, it's worth it, but with proper casting and director and satire, you'll come through ... even the oft-repeated "forgedaboutit".
