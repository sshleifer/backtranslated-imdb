Wow, another Kevin Costner hero movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even this baseball movie. It seems he makes films that are the focus of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the exploits, the shortcomings, the size, the fall, the salvation. Yes, in the first 5 minutes of the movie, we are all in awe of his character and it's building up more and more. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... history? ... is just a collage of different films. You do not need a spoiler. You have seen this movie several times, although it has different titles. They will know what will happen before it happens. This is like mixing An Officer and Gentleman with Backdraft, but both are slightly better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how a good but slightly underrated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
