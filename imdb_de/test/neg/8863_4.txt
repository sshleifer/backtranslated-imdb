You can hardly call this a good movie, actually it's not that close. But I have to say, there were a few things that made me laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest is not important enough to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with this movie. The action sounded like an idea, but quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just too messy and the actors were not good for the characters. most of them just dubbed. There were also a lot of unnecessary sequences, that was a total waste of films. I realize that the film would be about 20 minutes shorter, but it would only improve him. <br /> <br /> Now with the good and the bad things lined up, we come to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats for this one.
