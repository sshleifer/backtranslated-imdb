After sitting through the train wreck, the first Dark Harvest movie, I could not leave myself alone. When I saw that there was a sequel (or rather what I considered a sequel), I had to increase my pain. To see that this had nothing to do with Dark Harvest should have been good. We did not get any killer scarecrows in this one, instead we ran a donkey through a cornfield and did little things like "Girls!" and "Can you hear me?" again and again. In addition, we got two (four, if you include the two girls, that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in The Shining), unpleasant little girls who could not act. And the cherry on this mess should be the corncob. I should have known that this movie would be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. How I managed to stay awake through this movie, I will never know.
