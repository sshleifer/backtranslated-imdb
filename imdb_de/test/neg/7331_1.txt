Quite simply, they are all syndicated episodes and NOT the original unabridged / raw NBC episodes. It's NOT the full first season, all eps's are edited to fit in for syndication at 9:00 pm, which means jokes are cut, including an additional commercial crossfade. All Harvey Korman intros are not here ... made very bad! Too bad for a series I was waiting for ... booooooooooooooooo! If you're a true Die Mama fan, do not buy that and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments about why we're unhappy are a classic sitcom on this butcher job!
