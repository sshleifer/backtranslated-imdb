The Russian space station 'Avna' with a crew of four Russians and two Americans threatens to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within days. Russia asks NASA for help in rescuing the stranded crew, and NASA puts the Space Shuttle Atlantis in distress. The NSA also has an interest in the Prometheus, a prototype microwave power source being tested on board Avna, and is organizing one of its men to be on mission. <br /> <br /> That's the story. On less important things. The space station and the shuttle are the same obviously obvious models used in "Fallout", "Memorial Day" and "Dark Breed" (and a handful of other films, I suspect). The model effects are so obvious throughout the movie and make the movie look very much in the 1960s. The sets are a bit better, but way too 80s for a supposedly brand new station built by an American company (which later appears as part of a conspiracy to destroy "Avna" and "Prometheus" and claim the insurance. The script has some good moments (including Yuri's farewell and the little game at the end), but is otherwise boring and inferior.The drama is alright, the only truly outstanding performance comes from Alex Veadov, who offers some of the films Better dialogue "Michael Dudikoff is, surprisingly, one of the best parts of this movie, Ice-T is Ice-T," Nuff said, but the film has some surprises that I do not want to ruin. <br /> <br /> Surely one of the better , worst, most modern sci-fi movies of the last six years, but not the best. The movie can be seen, but the special effects and the plot will probably be many Attract Spectators Instead, borrow the other "Stranded" sci-fi movie.
