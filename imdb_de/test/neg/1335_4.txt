Well, I fell for it. I saw the box for it in the video store and thought it was girlfight, which I heard was great. For my own defense, the titles are similar, and they re-created the cover art for the box, so it looked almost identical. To summarize, they have obviously reworked the entire cover / promo overpack to capitalize on the success / success of "Girlfight". I caught up with it and got a bad feeling as they started showing trailers for low-budget snapshots, and even worse than a music video of the main song for the movie, which sounds like lift music and showed dirty slomo clips The movie preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso appeared, I knew that I had agreed to it. (Do not get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but I knew she was not in "Girlfight," the movie I had the wrong impression I rented.) <br /> <br / > So, apart from the fact that I felt cheated and annoyed because I was not looking closer, the movie was okay. The plot involves Belle, a young Latino woman who is the daughter of a former boxer. One of her close friends is a boxer who - and I could tell that it all happened so much ahead of time that it was really difficult - was heavily injured during a fight with a nasty champion called "The Terminator" a female version of a bigger one , more pumped up Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing to do is become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. She lives with her caring, supportive, and protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who happened to be a cop. Her love interest, which is also caring and supportive, but also protective, is also a cop working with her dad. Hmmm, both have jobs that make their lives mandatory. What will happen? She starts training and gets to know a shabby manager who, of course, pretends to be interested in her, but only exploits her. The actor they do looks like a very low-priced Cary Eweles and is so young he barely has a mustache. His acting was also very, very bad. I will not go into the story any more, because anyone who has seen Rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end. <br /> <br /> This was not completely horrible movie. Most of the acting was fine and the lead actress was very good. There were good, strong female Latino role models. The final fight scene somehow interested me, though I knew what would happen a long time ago. The actress who played "The Terminator" did a great job because she was unlikely enough that I really wanted Belle to kick her with a $$ and move for Belle-again, though there were absolutely no surprises , My favorite moment (perhaps the only moment I was not mad at me for renting the film by mistake) was when Belle hit her sloppy manager after showing his true colors, shouting at him, and then turning away to suddenly show off a blow and watch him flinch in fear and show that she really is the person in charge. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really bad, my main complaint. One of her attempts to be funny was that someone discussed boxing and said, "Size does not matter," and the woman who answers dryly, "Where did I hear that before?" Other lines that are supposed to have dramatic effects are "The doctors told me that maybe I can never walk again!" "Come on, you know, you can trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you". I could go on and on. Nothing that you have never heard a million times in bad soap operas or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too mean - the filmmakers went out of their way and I sat there voluntarily ... but only because there was nothing else to see during the training. You could make it worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters), but you can do much, much better.
