Insecure Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is shocked to learn that the love of his life has apparently slept with every guy she encounters. This shocking revelation sends poor Tom off his rocker, and he avenges himself bloody on the men he believes have cheated on his old lady. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really, really bad movies can often be as much fun as really good ones, and no film with a decapitation by a machete-reinforced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely worthless; But although Killing Spree occasionally entertains with his ingenuity and his cheap and joyous crush, I found the dreadful direction, terrible production values, ugly cinematography, subdued sound, terrible lighting, numbing boredom, and stupid narration (which really does include a Dumb Plot Twist, by Beginning to be telegraphed, plus a pointless zombie finale), nasty synthesizer score, inhumane dialogues and thoroughly moody actors have all contributed to make the writer / director Tom Ritter an almost joyless experience.
