I think the movie was okay. I do not think it was great. It was a bit slow for my liking. Lots of drama, but not much action until just before the end of the movie. This movie was basically a drama movie, with the payoff, if you can call it that, just before the end. For me, the scenes of the dam and the water that flooded the city were okay, but way too short. The movie itself is okay. Acting is decent, but in the long run it just did not do it for me. I think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little tension or tension throughout the movie. At least I think The other factor is that I've recently seen '10 .5 'and its sequel '10 .5: Apocalypse'. These are two "big-budgeted event films" that, in my opinion, are very hard to trace in terms of the particulars effects and scenes of destruction. As a result, I have to rate Killer Flood: the day the damn broke 4/10
