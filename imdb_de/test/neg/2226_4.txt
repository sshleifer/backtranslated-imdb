Warner Brothers Social Responsibility is best at preaching every five minutes and talking about how we Americans are. We do not run into trouble, we face our responsibility. It also indicates that you are un-American if you are ready to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters. Walter Huston, who looks bored, is the frustrated DA, and the "average American family" includes such familiar faces as Sally Blane (who is very like her sister Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore as supposedly enchanting Moppet. Both are regularly pushed by Chic Sale out of the ordinary. At that time there were only 47, but they played an octogenarian veteran of the Civil War, who pounced heavily and hammered "amusingly" at Prohibition and thought about how we Americans are, dag nabbit. His old-coot gig in St. Vitus Dance is boring. it's like Walter Brennan, who based his entire career on it. William Wellman directs efficiently and quickly, much like his former "Public Enemy," but he and the scriptwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after happily fading out - d. H. They would probably be ripped off by the mob.
