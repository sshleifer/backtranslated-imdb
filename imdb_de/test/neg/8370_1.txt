It's a real fool that people today can easily make movies because of cheap digital video cams. Normally, I would appreciate that possibility, but seeing such films is a shame. and it is also a pity if people like h.p. lovecraft is abused by such people. I rented this "movie" cuz of the drop "h.p. lovecraft" on it. and i'm a big fan of many of his adaptations, mainly those of brian yuzna & stuart gordon. This movie has nothing to deliver! a cheap landscape on the beach and in an old wine cellar. Digital camera effect "red light" over the entire film. no actors, just a few stupid substandard models who certainly have no idea what they do, stiff as wood. and that's how the director has to be. It is obvious that he has tried to create an atmosphere. but since it's so ridiculous, it just does not work. and no gore effects, just some blood in a river (you drink = you'll be demon) and fall here and there. Oh yes, history: Thousands of years ago, some "great old people" colonized the world and took man as a slave. then mankind became independent, so the "elders" tried to destroy it. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. The only way to save humanity is to find the NECRONOMICON, where LOVECRAFT is used. So these soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine cellar. unbelievable - the whole thing! But since it is also referred to as the "army of the hereafter" and can be found in most commercial video stores, it seems like you could make money with it. I find that fact impressive.
