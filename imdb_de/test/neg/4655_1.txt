A Lassie movie that should have gone to sleep ... forever. So I describe this painful waste of time of a movie. So mediocre in every way that it just becomes a boring, uninteresting mess. This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. It's not even an achievement as a "so-bad-it-good" or "so-bad-it-memorable" movie. The idea that Lassie gets bad is fascinating, but so little actually and so slowly happens that you feel like your life is slipping as you sit and watch the non-actors read their lines in front of the cue cards Waiting for their paychecks. <br /> It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your time or your child's time. Unless you are both heavily medically treated. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will drive you crazy! Hahahah, do you understand? BARKING! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a difficult week.
