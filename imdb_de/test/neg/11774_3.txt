What is the subject of drug addiction, the first-time filmmakers to bring their own opinion on this subject? This topic was made to death. Substance abuse is bad. We understand it. Drug addiction is painful to look at. We get that too. But the grim theme does not give the filmmaker a license to make a sloppy movie. Every film does not have to be Hitchcock's masterpiece of cinematic excellence or Orson Wellesian's Deep Focus, but it's still a narrative film. Verite does not mean pseudo documentation. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white and black. This filmmaker is just lazy, making no contrast scenes with the existing lighting. And even documentaries have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented when it comes to the right material, but the director has obviously overwhelmed her and sucked her whole life out of her performance. Although addicts live in the fog, they still have feelings, but none of these characters seem to exist off-screen. The supporting players have just delivered their lines without creating real humans. I'm sorry to be so tough, Debra, but some things are true, whether they want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie will get better - but please no other drug movie. :)
