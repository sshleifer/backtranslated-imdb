Let's summarize how silly this film is with two details: Arnold to Antichrist: "Let's see who's mean," he said straight-faced. And you can say that they did not try to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight the evil of evil? </ B> Blessed water, a crucifix, a priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes, not even Satan expected them to be so smart. <br /> <br /> After a captivating beginning (reminiscent of Devils Advocate), there is nowhere to go. Someone brings me back these two hours of my life. Never look at it, rent it so it will not be bought. <br /> <br />
