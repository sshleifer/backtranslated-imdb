If you are not yet old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, this is the demolition: They are a couple of film producers and finaciers from Israel who founded the Cannon Film Company in the early 1980s. The only Israeli who got a worse press than these two was Menachim Begin. Begin probably deserved the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a God sent to filmmakers, because no matter how bad your script was, they would happily finance your movie and usually use directors who could not direct and actors, who could not act. In fact, you often had the impression that people would simply go to Yoram and Menahem would ask them for some money and they would do so without seeing the filmmaker's CV. If nowadays only the producers would trust this way. THE YOUNG WARRIORS is not a Cannon movie, but Globus and Golan have funded it and they have their signature. It's badly directed, badly played, badly edited, but it's the script that pops out and attacks you with its fear. It starts with a bunch of high school jocks involved in all sorts of crazy pranks. The first 20 minutes of the movie run like a sex comedy. It's a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS becomes a vigilante movie. But it's not some Vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3. They're both sequels and both Vigilante movies made by Cannon movies, no siree about pretty young high school jocks and theirs Poodle going on mission to exterminate scumbags. This film proves that Globe and Golan have given money to people regardless of their filmmaking skills, and you have to worry about people who seemingly spend their entire reserves on making films that are all about vigilantes
