I went to this movie full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors led by Sir Ben, I thought that this would be a little treat. Oh, how I felt, as if I had cut my eyes out when the credits rolled. That I wasted that movie, which was clearly DOA, 93 minutes of my life. There are some real issues with this movie and it will probably be easier to list them. 1. No kidding, I do not find it particularly difficult to like comedic - high or low - but in this movie there is really no laughing matter. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben murmurs through each line whether he should be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to develop, let alone develop, the relationship between love interests in it. 2 people who happened to meet on the street would immediately have more relationships. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent is completely wasted. Do not be fooled by the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold donkey man, in Gandhi he has rubbed out more people than this slack waste of time (by the way, colored beards look really scary). I was hoping that this would be a slow burner, but in the end, the only thing that can be injected In every life - and justice - Frank takes off his 9 and starts the entire cast, from Tea to himself - sorry, that it was so bad.
