It's amazing that such a clich√©-ridden yuppie-fear movie was made in the first place. The characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired that it's impossible to take care of one of them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to slowly move through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you might want to rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
