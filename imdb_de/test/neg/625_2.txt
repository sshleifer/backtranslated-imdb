When I was eight years old and went through my Marx Brothers phase, my dad read in the TV guide that he showed the Marx Brothers movie "The Big Store" late on Friday night. When I woke up on Saturday - no doubt due to a spelling error on the television program - my father and I discovered that "The Story of Mankind" had been recorded instead. <br /> <br /> "The Big Store" was probably one of the least funny films of all the Marx brothers, yet it is one of the best works of the century in the cinema compared to "The History of Humanity". I can almost justify TV Guide's mistake by showing the Marx brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - in both films. Although they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes in "The Story of Humanity": Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays a guy who talks to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; Chico has only two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the movie is not to mention. They trotted off some of the best actors of the day and let them recite the total garbage. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" has a wonderful physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing it.
