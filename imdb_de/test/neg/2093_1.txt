I can not believe anyone would give the green light, let alone volunteer in it. I will never be able to get back those 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some movies are so bad that they are good. It's gone so far that it's so bad that it's awful. I did not expect much, it was a low budget, a bandwagon jumping, a bashhash, but it still lived up to my expectations. Even TV movies have higher production values. <br /> <br /> There were (very) bad special effects, shocking dialogues, horrible drama and a totally inexplicable storyline. Who cursed them and why, why did the 6-inch snakes turn into 15-foot snakes? Has anyone ever heard of highly toxic garter snakes or pythons? 100 passengers 3,000 snakes? So many promises, none delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments make you believe that this movie is worth the last five minutes. It is not even worth a rent. Stay in it and watch a low-TV movie. You will enjoy much more. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? Oh yes, to shamelessly get rid of the Internet phenomenon SOAP. Shame on you, Mallachi brothers, you are ashamed
