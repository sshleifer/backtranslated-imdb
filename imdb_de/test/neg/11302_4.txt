A typical old black and white film. The dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second half - they become naïve, sometimes terribly naïve and occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally funny. The first third, with background information on Ladd's Gatsby with a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the film. As soon as Gatsby moves into his new mansion and moves to Betty Field, the movie becomes overly melodramatic. The end is yet another cop-out end. I do not know if the novel itself contains this dumb, cliché ending or if the producer of the movie made some changes to it, but I've always considered car accidents a bad way to add drama to complete a story. I've seen this plotter a million times (or if it's not a car, it's a fall from a horse); The author does not know how to end the story, but he knows he wants it dramatically, he adds in a car accident. Lame. And worse, the accident is outrageously random and absurd, both on the plot level and on time. Actually, because Field's lover (Winters) is killed by Field and Winters storms from the gas station to the street, as if she had never noticed in the years that she had lived in It was a dangerous road through her house - and in the The moment she comes out, she sees Ladd's car and mistook it for Field's man's car and then exclaims, "Over here, I'm here, the end so tragic!"; Temporarily because Ladd and Field are involved in an accident that day, preparing to tell Field's husband about their affair. Basically, there is simply too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. It also does not help the film just as Winter's husband Da Silva goes on a vengeance mission to kill the man who has run over his wife; He basically does this by running around like a zombie, going from car to car in search of scratches and indeed behaving very badly. Both the drama of Da Silva and the character's behavior throughout the movie are awful and confusing. Scott Fitzgerald was upset several times when his novels were adapted for screen by Hollywood scriptwriters He was long dead before this movie was finished - maybe he was right to complain, according to the film's naive screenplay. Or maybe his novels are even grimmer and naïve than this movie and have actually been improved by the screen customizations. Or the films are quite similar to the novels. Of course, I could read this novel to find out, but I just can not bother. Fitzgerald's name does not inspire me to read one of his books (and I do not mean the way his name sounds.) He certainly was not Heller, Clavell, or Twain. More like Hemingway? a lot of noise about nothing.
