For a while it seemed like this show was 24/7. Then, apparently, there was a second season or another kind of sequel to this terrible show about the two weakest and most conceited people ever filmed. All the other comments have perfectly captured the essence of these two selfish, haggard airheads. Not much less can be said about them, apart from what everyone else has said. I doubt these two ladies have souls, and they most likely made a sort of Faustian bargain to put on their lizard snouts a television series. May fate protect humanity from further threats from the terrible girls!
