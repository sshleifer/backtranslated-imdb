Although it can be very boring sometimes, this movie is not that bad. Acting is pretty well done if it's stereotyped, and the production values ​​are pretty high, considering some sci-fi movies that would be released later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie are some of the very outdated characterizations in it. There's the guy from Texas, the "professional" scientist and worst of all the scientist who finally recognizes her femininity. For a movie that wants to make a statement about humanity, it loses some of its impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
