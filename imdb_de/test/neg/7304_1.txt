This must be the biggest practical joke. I am amazed that all other actors have a clear face. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from this movie was that they led Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez to act in this film, which has a budget of just under $ 40, depending on how Much of these Nerf bats and the sprayed Catcher's equipment cause the most incoherent movie ever made, and sit back and laugh that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not joking. <br /> <br /> If they did not happen to make a joke and lawfully try to make a real movie, I'm sorry for those involved in the creation. I've had quite a love affair with cheesy movies, but this movie is so bad that I can barely see it. They repeat nonsensical "special effects" so often that it's obvious they're just trying to cover up the fact that they only recorded 30 minutes of footage. If I were forced to watch this movie repeatedly, I would unconsciously beat myself with my own hands after about a half times. No insult to the great Frank Stallone, but I'd rather see Sylvester teach a fingerpainting class for 10 hours than watch this movie over and over again.
