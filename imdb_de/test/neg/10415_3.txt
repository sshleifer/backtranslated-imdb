The only time I seem to have been cured by IMDb comments is when I saw a Duff movie. I guess I'm trying to reassure that it's not just me. So for me, Lonesome Jim was a stupid movie full of incredible characters in incredible situations limping lame and boring on a cursed cop-out. So I look at what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, a bit alienated, since page after page results in several star ratings and gossip that make me doubt my critical abilities. But maybe I should check the comment view settings, because after a while, the torrent wears off and I'm relieved to see my assessments reflecting my own. I feel confirmed. It's a garbage movie, it does NOT hang together and it's a wasted evening running through the movie. Praise be to the kindred spirits.
