That was okay, but a bit disappointing because I expected more laughter. Given the storyline and the main character (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out. Only part of it really made me laugh, for example when Murray lost control of his semis and drove down the street at a strange angle. (You have to see it to appreciate it.) The side occupation was anything but sympathetic. Just look at a selection of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role here as "Tip Tucker" was just annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Others say that these people, the movie had some charming moments, but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
