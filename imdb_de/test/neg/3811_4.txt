It was the first time I heard about this film at Flashback Weekend in Chicago in 2007 for Nightmare on Elm Street. Robert Englund really talked about the movie and he was great in his part of "Hatchet". The same goes for Tony Todd. Knowing that this is a low budget director / author having a low budget for the first time, he supplies just as much as the big budget and also cameo-laden "Holloween" (2007) remake / re-release. Imagination a few places. The alligator attack seen was too dark. When it did, the alligator's dark head became almost invisible against the swamp on the black pants. The mood music in the marsh scenes was too loud and canned like a bad sitcom. And just like "Holloween" (2007), someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course it's just a pause button for the killer. The end, well, as soon as I saw where it was going, I knew what would happen, not very original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we met people and looked at what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who also plays the lead role in "Spiral") the pouting lead role and Marcus ("Not Another Teen Movie") as the best friend and funny man who can turn out to be root during the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry, "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family" movies) give one spiral reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played with television regulars (Richard Riehle, "Grounded for Life," Patricia Darbo, "Step by Step") because the elderly couple you know of has no chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen ) is a pronounced character. I hope to see more from everyone involved in this film, but I think it will be better with home videos than with the theater, sorry.
