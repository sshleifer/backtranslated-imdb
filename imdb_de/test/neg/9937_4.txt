The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it was shot on video. So it has a peculiar "home video look" that distracts terribly and makes it hard to take it seriously as a "real" movie. And "Zipperface" actually looks like a bunch of amateurs merged into a "real" serial killer thriller. It's not quite that way, but it's not as bad as it looks. Having a wife as one of the two detectives in this case takes a look at the genre of exploitation. Dona Adams gives the role an appealingly amateurish performance - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. In addition, she ends up having a great fight against the killer. The red herrings seem ridiculous at first sight, but in the end they work - I guessed the killer wrong. And you have to wonder if Tarantino might have seen the Zipperface type when he came up with the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
