Okay, my question. Who is the idiot who wrote this movie and has the same name as Dean Koontz 's fantastic book? It's awful, nothing like the book ... They got the dog and the watcher, but that's where the similarities end ... Maybe they're good if you did not read the book ... but it really disappointed me. <br /> <br /> You should make a new movie and let Koontz write ... now that would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this film has disgusted me ... absolutely disgusted me. it was awful, it was absolutely nothing like the book. I would never see it again.
