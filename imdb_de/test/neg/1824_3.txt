In scenic Italy meets Lana Turner (as Fredda Barlo), the beautiful lip-synching, older singer and Prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two fall in love while enjoying the beautiful Italian countryside. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza is called into the deathbed of his royal father, leaving Lana in the lurch. Twelve years later, Ms. Turner is an actress from Los Angeles who is about to make a movie about how she falls in love with a king. Turner is romanized by co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then King Pinza re-enters her life? <br /> <br /> "Mr. Imperium" offers a tired plot for the sex symbol Turner and debut bassist Pinza, who performed for several decades at the New York Metropolitan Opera. His career as an MGM feature film Pinza probably acquired in the extremely successful stage production of "South Pacific" (1949). The cast album and Pinza's golden single "Some Enchanted Evening" sold millions. Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds support the casters and give the film an even better sense of wasted resources
