This movie was awful, it was sort of like he happened to be watching a gay porno waiting for the girls, but they just do not come. Instead, it's just a stupid ass walking through a dead cornfield with a camera. It's a mix of Blaire witch and a bad twilight episode. And best of all, they've been filming since October 23, 2005. Do not be fooled by the box, even if it looks exactly like the first dark harvest and had the ingenious idea of ​​releasing it as a continuation of the original dark harvest, which I thought was funny ... the only thing they have in common WILLLLLL does not scare you like the first one, so stay away !!!!!
