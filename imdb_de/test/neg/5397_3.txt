"Do you have any beans, beans are good, you just eat them and go." I could not help laughing at this dialogue. Beans are the musical fruit. The more you eat, the more you go to toot, toot, toot. <br /> <br /> Hmmmm ... OK, I can understand why the actors were there, because they needed paychecks to pay their bills, but I'm not really sure what the directors and the director's intentions are Author's were. Even after looking at the making-of documentation in the DVD Extras, Mike Rooker gave this performance a performance he really did not deserve. I have seen him in other movies MUCH better than this. What would have greatly improved this movie was to throw everything out, keep rookies, and instead make another entry in The Substitute. Rooker would have chosen a great substitute teacher who teaches naughty and morally disabled adolescents about the fallacy of their ways and how they can become useful and productive members of society. Casper, you really should not 'It's just like pushing through the undergrowth, because you could get poison oak. Oops. Never mind. I think poison oak is the least worry now. Well, at least this time, your croak was not done with the tail of a giant python. There are few things that are more embarrassing than being spitted in the chest by a giant snake. At least the death scene in this movie had a bit more dignity. As well as a more liberal smear of check syrup and red food coloring. Nothing says a sad and tragic death like the liberal use of check and red color! <br /> <br /> For the first time I've seen a monster wearing a shiny viscose cloak with a fur collar collar. For the first time for everything, I think. Just to be a bit fussy, if this was an Indian mind, why did it look just like a monster of European culture and folklore? Would the monster have not been Indian anymore? <br /> <br /> Although I have seen this until the end of the credits, I do not believe it realistic that I can recommend it to others in good faith.
