This painful, boring and inglorious film made me believe that Chaplin was the true Hitler, since only someone as evil as he was could torment people with this feces. I've seen this movie remastered, which only made the suffering caused by this cruelty worse. This film is nothing but a pathetic, repetitive film that did not cause two hours of laughter, but caused two hours of suicidal thoughts. After the first 10 minutes I wished that gas would come out of the speakers of the theater. <br /> <br /> If I could give him a zero out of ten, I'd like to do that. Avoid at all costs!
