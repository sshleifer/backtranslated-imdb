Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired police officer who now works as a cleaner-upper. In his last job, he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and does not know that the crime was not officially reported. Oh, that can not be good. <br /> <br /> You hear cleaners all the time, but usually when a mob or gangster is hit, when bodies etc. have to be removed and the area cleared up. This is different in that Tom Cutler works with the police to clean up after police investigate a crime scene. Hey, someone has to do it. You know the police are not doing it. The movie makes that clear and it's up to the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but a subplot with Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story a bit awkward. I think they had to fill some time. Oh, they brought this subplot to connect with the other subplot, but it was still a reach and awkward. Can you see it? <br /> <br /> It was almost a good thriller, because it lacked suspense and tension and slowed down a bit. The music did not help either, as I noticed that the music was better suited to seeing people go on a long journey. You know, travel music. Got it? HA! <br /> <br /> The acting was outstanding in this almost thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
