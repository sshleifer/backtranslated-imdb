It seems unbelievable that the same decade that Star Wars was put on the silver screen triggered such an unspeakable trip as this and many other "adventure" movies. I remember the similarly lavish but equally wretched "Ashanti" outlined elsewhere. Whatever motivated the actors in the A-list to register for such celluloid waste is, frankly, beyond this writer. You must have been very, very desperate. To be honest, Roger Moore's appearance in every movie is the kiss of death. Although he was extremely pretty in his youth, his entire acting career depended on the ability to raise an eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is mediated by this simple strategy. His were the dog days of James Bond. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, took part in some very worthy trips, perhaps the most memorable "Paint Your Wagon" and "The Dirty Dozen". He has a comic series, but he is much better when he is playing. <br /> <br /> The distinguished Ian Holm is a disposable, hardly noticeably weakened as a dumb African. Everyone else just got their paychecks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and observable element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very big model. But it is credibly massive and looks authentic - just like his crew. The rest is not even hokum. The childish comedy shines with the brutality and violence in a story that clumsily walks around as if the script itself had too many voices of Lee Marvin's gin. Here's a director who just does not know where he's going. There are hints of "The African Queen," an excerpt from "The Pride & The Passion," "Gold," and one or two other rip-offs of films whose titles do not easily come to mind. <br /> <Strangely enough, I have seen it 3 times, each time it was shown on television when I suffered from a cold or flu. Maybe that influences my judgment - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any Indiana Jones movie and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I gave him two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it is finally coming to an end, though the sky knows it takes long enough to do that. <br /> <br /> Time for another Lemsip, I think.
