Since I did not own a television and had never heard of this miniseries, I did not know what to expect from The Second Coming and adjusted it solely on the basis of its plot summary, which sounded interesting. <Br /> <br /> Dear God! (Every pun was intended.) If someone had told me that this had been written by a thirteen-year-old class who got the project to turn the second coming into a school piece, I would not have been surprised why did they choose Jesus To portray Mark II as an idiot? Is there anything in one of the Gospels to propose? Okay, an ordinary guy, but a big Nordmorde. I do not believe that. <br /> <br /> Apparently Jesus was all about impressing people, his miracles, because his sermons make sure that hell has never impressed anyone. Without the nocturnal daytime stunt, Lord Jesus Eccleston would have come without a canoe, a paddle, or any other kind of following or cause. Other than, of course, Russell beckoned to his QAF fan base. Jesus appears in the bar to recruit "students" (more thugless losers and, of course, the readiness of the gay writer - the harpy woman, nagging, nagging, nagging). Homosexual rights are rammed down for no real purpose, almost as if Russell believed he owed it to the boys to put Jesus on the spot. <br /> <br /> I can not really see the real Jesus with "Well, I do not mind it personally, buddy." Only someone truly bourgeois and woolly could imagine Jesus so wet. <br /> <br /> And I do not start with the end. "Please come in and eat rat poison, because we can really be free when God dies". <br /> <br /> It was like an Eddie Izzard sketch of God as Bill Gates. "Hello, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out that my global dominance limits your style, I'll give you everything, my clients." And eat the rat poison naturally. <br /> <br /> I'm often confused by the reviews on IMDb, but the high rating of this takes the biscuit. <br /> <br /> Never mind, Jesus for the new millennium - that's Jesus for mindless MTV guys. <br /> <br /> God really help us all.
