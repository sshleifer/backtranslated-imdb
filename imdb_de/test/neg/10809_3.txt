OK, I've read the director's commentary on this film (referred to as the "foremost commentary"), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position. Micheal, I hope your career has recovered from that setback and you went to other, better things. I saw this movie in the MST3K form. Despite all the hacked continuity and the penetrating remarks of the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with ambitious ideas that tried to beat out of the limited budget and the limited actors available to it. And this is one of those movies ("Mitchell" is another) where the MST3K crew made a lot of cheap shots on the main character, even if they actually deserved more. They know they were having an unfair joke at the actress's expense because it made for a livelier episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the movie was actually trying to be something and had some decent, effective moments Here and there it should be kept out of the "bottom 100" ("Tangents / Time Chasers" is another movie with an action and a heart that does not deserve to be there too). <br /> <br /> But it's still not a very good movie. I do not blame the author / lead actress for who she is. It was just that her acting and writing skills took a few more years to mature before she could do a vanity project like this or a feature film. The writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash, and the dialogue often hardly meets the standards of ABC Afterschool Special. The performers are genuinely doing their best, and acting is definitely head and shoulders over abortions like "Future War" or "Space Mutiny," but there are no really professional accomplishments here, with the exception of 'Big Joe' Estevez, who is hammy, but correspondingly intense. I have never seen the complete original cut, but MST's sampling of "Soultaker" was representative enough to clarify these facts. Oh, and the movie has Robert Z'Dar in it. That is, IMO, a real 'Kiss Of Death' for any movie that wants to be taken seriously. Yes, he is tall and scary in his role, but I hate the guy as an actor. (In real life, I wish him all the best and hope that he feels well financially). <br /> <br /> There were little things that I liked about the movie. For example, the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it much easier to see. The idea of ​​a hospital lift that opened its doors to afterlife was an inspiring way to create some weird mood without relying on special effects. I respected who incorporated that into the script to keep the budget manageable. It did not really work, but maybe with a little more tweaking. <br/> <br /> So, Mr. Rissi, with your other projects, a better luck - your involvement in this dropout would not stop me If you've seen something different, you've done it when the "humming" was good , And Ms. Miller need not be ashamed - she was young and ambitious, and the movie was not that bad.
