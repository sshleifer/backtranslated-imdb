I do not understand it I just do not understand it. "Barney and Friends" has been abused by millions of people over the years, and I have to admit I was one of those carpenters. Every child who watches this program does not know that it is just garbage. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add Baby Bop and it gets worse. Add B.J. then you have a very scary nightmare on TV. Then you get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney wants to teach them! What are you doing there anyway? It would be fun if Barney and his friends appeared on the Jerry Springer show. That would surely be one of the wildest moments in TV history! More importantly, this show marks the beginning of the end of public service television, as we knew, as we have seen fewer and fewer informative and interesting public television broadcasts broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s. What a big difference makes a selfish weapon son. When this show leaves PBS, a great sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but in the annals of television history, there has been a big slump. A message to Barney himself: You may not know it, but YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. <br /> <br /> In short, there are other options. Better decisions.
