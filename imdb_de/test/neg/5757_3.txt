Director and FX man John Carl Buechler does not have to do much to scare me; Just the sight of his name in the braces is enough to scare my heart. <br /> <br /> His unfortunate video direct output in the '80s stood on the bottom shelf of the horror department in my local rental business; Twenty years later and his DVDs occupy the same place. It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. You can count on the old JCB to deliver dirt, regardless of format, and regardless of advances in film-making technology. In this despicable offer, many friends travel to a remote city where they make the discovery tour Secret Treasure of Jeremiah Stone, Alias ​​the Ninety-year-old? a malicious, suspected, cannibalistic miner who wreaked havoc in the mid-1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah cursed anyone who was to find his gold, and it was not long before the pickaxe killer returns and bumps the unfortunate treasure hunters. <br /> <br /> With its fearsome script, inconspicuous up-effects and Scooby Doo villain: "The Curse of the Forty-Niner" goes without saying for Buechler. Only the genres Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law give this film credibility, the rest of the cast ranges from bad to terrible (though I'll forgive Alexandra Ford, who is an absolute hottie) /> <br /> Also fans of Bad Schlock horror will be disappointed as most women put on their clothes and many of the off-screen deaths occur (which is probably not that bad since the dead on screen.) Are pathetic). <br /> <br /> "The Curse of the Forty Niner" is another list of Duds for John Carl.
