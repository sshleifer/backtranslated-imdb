In this empty, confused, manipulative film, trying to be a combination of a cute comedy and a revealing drama, a fine, young cast is wasted. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem endless, as the characters only make pugs and emote. The dialogue is filled with matted clich√©s and fortune cookie experiments of pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a moving and profound view of life and love. The only real weight is the burden that the talented cast has to carry as well as possible. But do not worry - they are stopped by the puppet threads of the fictional act.
