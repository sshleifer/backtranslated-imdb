This extremely cheap Blaxploitation / Kung Fu hybrid was released in my country from a questionable DVD label, which is usually only concerned with the transmission of pure crap on discs, so this was not exactly a cheap herald. Several other titles have been released in the same series, including The Black Six, The Black Gestapo and The Black Godfather. After all their bad reviews and negative reviews none of them belongs to the elite of the 70-year blaxploitation hype, neither. "TNT Jackson" is a pretty lousy film that lacks no significant action, but too many ridiculous fighting scenes and terrible acting to make up for it. Apparently Roger Corman? never too embarrassed to earn some easy money? hired two of his most loyal acolytes to quickly invent a simple story that would appeal to fans of oriental kung fu films as well as contemporary blaxploitation films. The result of Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller was "TNT Jackson"; the story of a black guy traveling to Hong Kong in search of their missing brother. She quickly discovers he's been killed by a criminal network of drug smugglers and vows to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson smoothly infiltrates the underground and encounters macho pimps, helpful undercover agents and lots of vicious kung fu fighters. Only one thing is certain; They all want a piece of TNT's ravishing body in one way or another. I sincerely doubt that movie concepts will be more elementary than this, but ?? unfortunately - all other aspects are shit too. The fight scenes are overlapping and also set in a pathetic way. Jeannie Bell and the other poor fools really try to stare menacingly and take a hard position, but in the end they only kick in the air and jump stupidly through the rooms. The cinematography is terrible, the soundtrack is very disappointing (whatever happened with soul music), the few dialogues are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior. Speaking of which, Jeannie Bell is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but she can not hold a candle to Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There is only one really good and memorable scene in "TNT Jackson", namely the famous hotel fight where Bell, aside from panties completely naked, keeps turning the lights on and off while throwing hell out of some idiots. Amusing scene ... I just have not figured out if this is the ingenious light switch or the perfectly shaped breasts of Bell.
