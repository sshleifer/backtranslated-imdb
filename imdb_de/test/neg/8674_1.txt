I'm not a Jane Austen purist, but why shoot a movie like this when you have nothing to talk about? Billie Piper was so wrong that it is difficult to know where to start, make-up, totally false hair (a young lady of her age would not have fooled around in public with such loose and unkempt hair), she did not look very gentle, either upset by the family and me I did not understand why everyone thought they were especially holy or kind. <br /> <br /> The picnic (instead of the ball) was so cheap that it was embarrassing to completely watch the Portsmouth department destroy the point of the play (as well as losing scenes to the oh-so claustrophobic pink living room could have added a tingling counterpoint.) <br /> <br /> For those in charge: imagination (even the budget is not as important as the imagination) To do something useful with an adjustment, please do not pretend You pr Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> It was about 10% Mansfield Park and 90% nothing. <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
