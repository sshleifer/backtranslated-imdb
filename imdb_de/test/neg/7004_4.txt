I came across Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she's only in the first few minutes, where she's obviously the person who draws you to this bad movie. BAD director. Scenes are repeated over and over again with all the actresses. Amber Smith did a very bad job, but the other actresses looked pretty good. I like Yvette very much, but that was obviously a bad choice for her. I can not believe I rented this garbage to look for her. I hope she finds other films.
