I really did not like this movie ~ !!!! It was boring and did not interest me at all. I'm more of an action girl and had NO. I went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left .. but was totally misleading! Do not get this movie if you do not like the dessert and the boredom. I just did not like the movie. It was not my style, but it could be yours. You just have to see the previews or something, but it's my recommendation if you're a girl. Do not understand this movie! Based on some of Godfrey Reggios Koyaanisqatsi's observation strategies, this Scandinavian production allows us to reflect patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from intimate and far-reaching perspectives. that's not for me!
