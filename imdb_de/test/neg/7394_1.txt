A fragile collection of Western tourists in Africa suffers the misfortune when their plane collapses. So you have to get on a bus to travel through the Namib Desert to reach the nearest point of civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass does not work and they turn away from the course to stop in an abandoned ghost town that had been a barracks during World War II. You will find some kerosene (unusable when refilling the tank of your bus), a storage room with half-poisoned carrots in tin cans and a local hermit who looks at them indifferent. One of them, who seems to have something on the ball in terms of survival techniques, goes off to get help. They should take the tires out of the bus and burn them if he does not return in five days: I hope someone sees the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? Well, sure, even if it sounds like * The Flight of the Phoenix * or after a series of films in the lonely island genre. So it's surprising that * The King Is Alive * correctly rated number 4 (if anyone else counts) in the ongoing Dogma 95 series, which reminds me of this ridiculous "dogma 95 vow of chastity" has announced. "Genre films" are strictly prohibited. Oops. Well, you can say it's going to be all sorts of things to compensate for the fact that it's a genre movie. Yes, it does not take long for a member of the group, a crazy old stage actor, to start writing from memory. - the different roles of * King Lear * on paper rolls. The idea is that the execution of the game will pass the time. All of this really contradicts the survivalist's advice to remain optimistic (did the old actor * The Odd Couple * perform a theatrical performance only once in his life?), Aside from such an activity that plays a huge role wasted precious time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I really do not know what to do. It is so monumentally stupid, so full of absurd situations and characters, that it embittered rational criticism. Full Disclosure may possibly be offered at a time: I despise this so-called Danish film "movement" almost irrationally. I think my face even turns slightly red at the mere mention of Dogma 95. If the name of your movement carries the word "dogma" in the title, you have already lost me; Secondly, in this particular case, the insistence of the movement on the rejection of individual artistic accomplishments is a recipe for hypocrisy, considering that the filmmakers are plundering one of the greatest works of the greatest individual writer ever to exist. (But no doubt the dogma crowd believes that Shakespeare's works were actually written by a consortium of Elizabethan greats such as the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the Queen herself. Hell, I may have forgiven the whole company if it were the scenario would have played to absurd purposes (attacking the precious dogma - now that would be subversive!) But the film takes itself very seriously and soon develops into the stereotypes of the genre in which it unequivocally belongs: people who turn against each other; the men grow beards, the inevitable deaths of some of the main actors, all with a straight face. "Is that the promised end?" Well, not quite: we also have to endure the miserable transmission of DV. "This is another rule in dogma. Vow of Chastity: Digital Hand Video Only Some Friendly Advice to the Danes: Your "Movement" is in trouble when your En dprodukt has a lower visual quality than a home video with an average high school degree. Professionalism belongs in the trick box of an artist and his own individuality. "Artisan" and "Artist" are related words, Herr von Trier: Not every Jackass with a handheld of $ 100 can be a filmmaker. Pass on. By the way, allow your dogma directors to be credited for their films while you're at it. The fact that the author of * The King Is Alive * receives recognition while the guy (or girl) is not actually filming is a bit hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Contemptuous. 1 out of 10 stars.
