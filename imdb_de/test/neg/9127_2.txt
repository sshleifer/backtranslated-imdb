The problem with this kind of lyrical filming is that you make either a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little middle ground. That is, to put it mildly, not "Berlin - Symphony of a City" or "Man with a Movie Camera". Unfortunately, it is not much to see. <br /> <br /> The problem with this one is that it's glittering and half finished, as if Michael Moore had come aboard. It does not really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to present a thesis. This is just a patchwork looking for a point. (Although the film inadvertently tells us more about Uncle Sam's thinking than he intended, there is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilization, and anti-media movie that's so deeply mixed with technology "Do what I say, not like me." You just have to love the Yanks, eh.) Tonal, this episode has something sour and misanthropic, both previous episodes had moments of lyric and noise, this time the sound It just does not work over that time, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is a mess in style, and the lush digital stuff is particularly misleading, giving the whole thing a fussy, over-processed look and also undermines the realism of the analogue "found footage." Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film But now optical film is a historical artifact, they have to "take over" the digital domain, but I do not think they can do it. The digital stuff often looks like video links from CNN or BBC World.) And with "found footage" digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just stupid and the wrong color and solarization made me think ... <br /> <br /> ... um ... <br /> <br /> James Bond title sequences. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strange as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the film was simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance. It's about as inconspicuous as a voice by Lawrence Olivier. The pictures have to be happy to face all the charisma. Philip Glass himself has a strange shape; I never thought he would shoot the Verdi Requiem! (Made me laugh, which of course is not the desired reaction to any part of this movie). There is even a piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they changed his pills. <br /> <br /> From our department for idle questions: Is Geoffrey Reggio a Hopi Indian at all? Or has he just made a sweat lodge in Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are the different clips from footage from earlier "episodes" in the trilogy a comment on how these films are also part of the global media sludge?
