The Brave One is about a New York radio show called Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream in the city she grew up in and loves. She has her big fiancé David (Naveen Andrews), whom she wants to marry. One night, as Erica and David take their dog for a walk, they are attacked and ambushed by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is hurt with a broken heart and later traumatized and can barely cope with real life. She buys a gun from a man on the street to protect herself. But one day she shops in a shop and a man comes in and shoots the employee. Then Erica shoots and kills this man and she becomes Vigilante. Kill anyone who tries to threaten or hurt them or others. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is following this elusive, unknown killer and becomes friends with Erica. Erica regains her sanity by killing those violent people, but she is not sure if what she is doing is morally right or not. And as she and Mercer get closer, he does not even realize that the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him. Jodie Foster performs very well in The Brave One. She brilliantly portrays these types of violent, morally corrupt characters. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry and reinforce the film to a certain level. The Brave One looks optically immaculate and gives brilliant camera work, but not everything looks great. The scenes in which Erica is absolutely traumatized and is afraid to go out of her door into the world. The camera swayed in an almost dreamlike way, capturing the moment with essence. While Erica killed somebody almost every time, everything had to go slowly and show her facial expressions in detail. The slo-mo was used correctly when Erica had committed her first murder. But why should this effect be repeated almost every time she has committed a murder? The camera work creates a great atmosphere in most movies, but there are a few scenes here that are simply exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The Brave One is very much concerned with how these murders affect Erica emotionally. Her fiancé is killed by a group of thugs, and suddenly her love of New York City is turned upside down. She realizes there is a dark side in the beloved city, and she says it on her radio show. I do not quite understand that. Erica pretends she has never realized that there can be violence in the city at night, and that's pretty stupid. If she has lived there all her life, she must either be blind or very ignorant. Erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane, murderous people. She does not even have to look for them, they just have to come to her, as if they are begging to be shot for their wrongdoing. The brave first deals with morality and the proper use of force, then suddenly glorifies her. The end is very negative and completely immoral and inhumane. It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, who spends so much time in the film developing evenly, and suddenly his morality takes a turn. The customs in The Brave One are very broken and in the end, they will just splinter everywhere. So violence is alright? Is it a good thing to commit murder as long as it is for revenge? I quite refuse to believe that. You know why? Because I have a conscience that certainly lacks this movie. It is not right to take someone else's life, no matter how bad or how much you hate them. Erica Bain wants to stop these evildoers, but in the end she is no better than the terrible people who kill her. Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard give this movie a lot of power. The brave one has a strong message, but this message is both immoral and false. This movie can look pretty, well played and look smart. But it gets pretty lazy in the end. I give The Brave One 1.5 out of 4. The message is very wrong and morally incorrect and can not really be saved by good action.
