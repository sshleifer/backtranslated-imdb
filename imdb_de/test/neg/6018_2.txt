Mockumentaries have become so strong lately that the approach needs to be injected with fresh and creative material each time it is used to maintain its vitality. This movie is nothing more than worn-out newsletters of similar stories, an aimless screenplay, weak ad libs, unimaginative acting, and a disagreeable, self-satisfied humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems promising. The legend of the Loch Ness monster is made for one of those stupid mockumentary mishaps, with a huge selection of history and legend waiting to be tapped for vile satire. The filmmakers, however, completely waste this enormous potential. We get a fool who puts a fake Nessie in the water. Gosh, that's original. In another scene, a vile idiot threatens another hideous idiot with a gun. Side splitting. Some free shots of a pretty girl in a bikini. Annette did that 40 years ago (and much better, by the way). Somebody always seems to be screaming throughout the movie: I suppose that's supposed to wake up the audience, which is dozing off at the time. <br /> <br /> The worst of all, however, is the relentless salvo of this reality type "interview commentary" of the characters. Not only do you get confused with this tired joke every five seconds, but obviously the actors improvise as well. that's the only explanation for how humorless the jokes are. If lines such as "I've never written anyone writing a book on non-evidence," the writer should be shot at sight and fed to Nessie. No wonder Nessie became violent; it obviously saw this movie.
