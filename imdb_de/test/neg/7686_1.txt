I have only seen the first 20 minutes of this movie, and I personally think that this is the worst movie that has been filmed in recent years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad that it would have been possible for a 10 year old to write it. The acting was sloppy with a rather unknown cast and not only that the action sequences were so terrible especially in the first half of the movie that it was unbelievable the budget to film this movie but the production company now has to regret it , <br /> <br /> For anyone who might come across this movie in the near future, I advise you to distance yourself from this film joke.
