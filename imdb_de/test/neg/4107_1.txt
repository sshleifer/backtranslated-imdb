A sound of thunder. One of the greatest short stories ever written. From one of the greatest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story. <br /> <br /> But what a popped movie! <br /> <br /> In Bradbury's science fiction short story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to return in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one is: Stay On The Path, a floating metallic walkway that does not interact with the prehistoric environment. In a hunt, a man steps out of the way and accidentally smashes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present, the world as they know it has changed drastically. Although there are paradoxes in every time travel route, Bradbury's story was a fast stroke, a parable of the ripple effect. A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia the most published science) fictional history ever) and illustrated the Chaos Theory, Darwinism and the Butterfly Effect (which was only coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the wonder of time travel has been overshadowed by corporate greed, overshadowed by the deadly threat to humanity itself. <br/> <br /> During the film, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by Uneven Peter) Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a group of bad actors repeatedly go through the time portal to correct their mistakes, such as an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The film has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful story except for the initial jolt of the time-traveling prehistoric hunting party. Bradbury's story blends monstrous freedoms-reptiles with a paw-face, plants that overrun Chicago's concrete, waves of time flitting through the city, CGI insectoids-for which Bradbury should accuse filmmakers wearing trousers and underpants Novices Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier were to create a Big Balls Agency because they believe they could add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that could improve them. How do these guys get on a straight line with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is the company owner of Time Safari. With a piece of hair that looks as bad as a piece of hair. Edward Burns is his main hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was in BRAVEHEART Murron MacClannough) is the scientist with the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I can not possibly tell the hundreds of thousands of monstrous stupidities and tiny parts of the dialogue, but here's just one thing that David Oyelowo talks about as a kind of "scientist": it refers to the Pleiades star clusters: "The seven sisters, they look like stars, right? But each of them is a whole galaxy." Uh, no, idiot scientists, they're really uh, stars. These three idiots who paraphrased Bradbury's story forgot they did not know anything about physics or astronomy. Or write. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest, pushing against her disheveled, too-small blouses. <br /> <br /> - Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's movie delusion).
