I would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie is reminiscent of the unusual Melanie comedy "Something Wild", in which a rather eccentric free spirit meets a conservative and very orderly young man, and the two pose as a couple and basically, her personality gradually affects him. He loses himself and learns to enjoy her short-lived tryst. That's exactly what happens here, except for the comfy, store-robbing eccentric Alex (Rosanna Arquette) in the role of Melanie Griffith and the extremely cautious teenager Lincoln (the name is no coincidence, played by Devon Gummersall) in Jeff Daniels Role. This movie even has the same twist and abrupt genre change that the creepy, violent friend suddenly turns up and things end pretty badly. Instead of playing Ray Liotta, who is a setback for the movie idiots of the fifties, it's just Peter Greene. The story is about a young child living in his own little world. He has a certain fascination for the death after the suicide of his brother, and also his parents have separated and behave strangely (the mother is convinced that Christmas will come soon, although it is August). On an evening with the "boys" (one of whom is Jason Hervey of the Miracle Years) who tried to buy them beer, he meets Alex, who decides to kidnap him and his friends' car (with his permission, of course) )), and they embark on a mini-adventure through the deserts of the West Coast, robbing Robin Hood's comfortable shops and, of course, routine self-discovery as everyone asks more about each other's lives. But Alex left a partner in her theft business and does not go away so easily. We are not consistently reminded of him or anything else but repetitive flashbacks or cutting down to his point of view. At least that much was done wisely. <br /> <br /> "Do Me a Favor" (also called "Trading Favors") is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self-discovery, which dates back a little in the first half of the year late, when Alex and Lincoln arrive at their home in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately, the movie is almost over until the filmmakers stimulate you enough. I would recommend if this is the kind of story you are looking for, and although Rosanna Arquette always performed well (even in a poorly written movie), I would still recommend catching them in their best form: " Something wild. "
