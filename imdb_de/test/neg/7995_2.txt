An awesome action movie in which the leading Franco Nero exchanges his cowboy hat, gun belt and coffin, which he carried around in DJANGO (1966), for a complete white Ninja outfit with all the sly implements that go with it! Despite almost uninterrupted action, the film is absolutely clich√©d and unintentionally funny - with a Campy villain in Christopher George. Susan George (no relation) is the attractive woman with a stranded husband, Nero's comrade-in-arms, who tries to oust the villains from their oil-rich land - but the latter has not relied on Nero's martial arts (and stunt) Heavy Gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to engage a similarly experienced ninja for himself, who turns out to be Nero's deadly enemy (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another!). The climax takes place in an arena in which the one-man army "eliminates" Nero George and what has remained from his gang of previous confrontations; However, the subtle way he sends off his nemesis is effectively done.
