Oldboy is based in Korea and starts when a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is rescued by his friend from the police station just to be kidnapped. Dae-su wakes up and is in a small room he wants to be detained for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed and cared for by his unknown kidnappers, but may never leave the room. Dae-su begins to avenge himself after he has come out, what he wants to do by scrapping the cement from the brickwork with a brick chopsticks. But before Dae-su is finished, he is gassed and rendered unconscious. When he wakes up, Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building, dressed and by all means. Dae-su immediately tries to find out who has locked him up. After meeting pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), they fall in love with each other. With her help, Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for, but the truth is a price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production was co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park and has a number of glowing reviews VideoBox) & even won the Cannes Jury Grand Prix, while also being nominated for the Palme d'Or, so is Oldboy certainly a true classic? Well, not for me, it's not like that, because I can not understand why it's so popular. I'd even say that I pretty much hated it, except for one or two isolated moments. For one thing, I could not deal with the story, I just did not like it, thinking it was slow and boring, and while many out there would think Oldboy had the most shocking twist I've ever believed, rather plain and so not very well executed. The end, when Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized, feels like the producers wanted a kind of happy ending. I almost fell asleep with almost two hours, I was so bored, the violence is tame and the thought of what happens, I could imagine, that most people have a problem and not what is actually shown. In fact, Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven and a mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. I have not gotten used to any of the characters and while I accept that Oldboy has a good concept and a premise that he can not deliver, this is a movie I'll never understand why so many people seem based on a Japanese one Manga with the same name Oldboy looks the movie in order. There are one or two beautiful visual moments, though everyone is indulging in the field fight that takes place in a continuous shot, I was quite unimpressed and thought the fight choreography was pretty boring. The actual screen violence is very low. Dae-su eats a live octopus, which is quite normal in Korea anyway. There are some fight scenes, a severed hand, some teeth are pulled out and there is a bit of blood ending. <br /> <br /> The budget was supposed to be around the $ 4 million mark, which is actually a good deal, filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. Acting may look good, but it's hard to say when actors speak a different language. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is a movie I've found an absolute duty to persevere on, subtitles or foreign films I do not care. I've paid attention to the plot while I've followed it perfectly, but I have nothing liked it and it's so easy and uncomplicated. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook's Park Revenge Trilogy, which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005).
