The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to experience her traumatic childhood experience (the death of her friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just one of the first murders to happen. Can their psychic powers help clear up the crimes and stop the ongoing murders? <br /> <br /> You really do not have to figure it out, because, oh my god! That was so bad! I know that all Nora Roberts fans will come to this movie and give them tons of 10. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb rating of 6 and think this movie is worth seeing. But do not be fooled. The end was predictable, the acting TERRIBLE (do not even let me start with the southern accents * y'all *) and the story was banal. Remember, you have been warned!
