I bought it on the VHS as "Terror Hospital", and when I got home I checked IMDb and it was like OMG, it's the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another one of Al Adamson who has clearly learned about filmmaking since the days of Blood of Dracula's Castle. Where this former effort is a more or less totally sclerotic knot, it mixes up a bit and adds a certain element of variety and surprise in the midst of incompetence. Sure, half of the movie is a blind postoperative footballer shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any moment we could cut ourselves off on the cackling disembodied head of the satanic mastermind or Nurse Sherri, who punctures a farmer with a pitchfork, or a little bit of abstract student film that quickly knows with the pulsing stain effects in the owner scene or the casual half-hearted topless piece of time or God knows what else is going on (I forget, to be honest). If stupid ass pieces go from sh * t, this runs to the top. Congratulations, Al.
