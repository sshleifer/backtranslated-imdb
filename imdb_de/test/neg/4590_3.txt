Give me a break. How can anyone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? I know that movies tend to be hockey for the general public. And yes, that was done when the US did not take our sport to the degree that it is today, but really. I have played hockey all my life and seen more, and this is my madness. The scenes on the ice were amazingly bizarre ... the particular example I refer to is the "sword fight", uh, I mean the "stick fight" at the end of the movie ... where everyone just stands around and not with them Fascination to observe that this is actually happening, but in the question of who will win the duel between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie. Yes, the ice history is a little better, I emphasize LITTLE. <br /> <br /> I do not know, maybe it does not make sense to keep going ... I mean, let's be honest: the movie is right. Hockey is just a big battle on ice ... oh yes, with a small piece of vulcanized rubber it occasionally hops in a so-called "gate". Youngblood is either terrible or hysterical, I can not figure out which ... maybe someone else is luckier.
