This wreck begins when Brujo and Alma cross the Mexican border. Alma suffers from a terrible curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and Nickelodeon gac every few minutes, clench her teeth, and mumble nonsense. Apparently Alma has this uncle in Los Angeles who knows how to cure her. They get on a train to get there, and fortunately a friend of them pays their way. Alma and Brujo stay in the baggage car for the entire movie because they can not afford first-class seats. Meanwhile, in the higher class, we see a number of nobles en route to LA, for whatever reason. A bald-headed guy on a business trip, two girls, one of them five dollars tall, and a bunch of cocaine, three stoners, and a few Mexicans. The Mexicans pluck up Brujo and try to take his "weed," which seems to be a sedative for Alma's snakes slipping into her. They realize that the snakes do not attack, they invade your body through your veins! Very twisted and B-movie. Brujo saves the guy by ripping out his heart (Temple Of Doom style) and procuring the snake. For some reason, he may not have hurt the snakes, or it will hurt Alma. While this happens, an anesthetist expert tries to break one of the girls and gets a topless action in return for not being informed about their drug delivery. A mysterious guy appears and has a gunfight. After a grand finale, Alma transforms into a vampire, bites her husband, and then becomes a huge, pathetic apology for a CG snake the size of the train. She eats the train and is blown up into a hurricane of atomic bomb. Everyone then walks to LA. <br /> <br /> In the end, the closing credits are: "Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead persons or actual events is purely coincidental and very strange, or take a plane". Strange, as a line in the film of the bald man "Yes, I hate planes!" The credits say, "There were no snakes in the production of this script, just a kid, but it's cool." There were actually a lot of real snakes in the movie, and they were all very tame. There's actually no scene where CG snakes attack anyone, unless you count the big one, but then it just eats the train and the other wrong snake is just the head and looks like a muppet. The snakes do not attack, they are just ... there. You actually crawl out of toilet paper! <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, is not scary (since there is no real snake attack), and is just a "quickie cash-in" where a low-budget movie company hears of one Hollywood release on a big budget, then they rush to release a similar film or even a parodic version for release just before or at the same time with the big name trick. As a result, many people either confuse one another for the other and see the quickie rather than the biggie, or they both want to see it, for whatever reason ... like me. Avoid at all costs.
