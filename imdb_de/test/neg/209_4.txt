Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have teamed up for a much wiser effort, as this would slip into the B category and could have gotten along with no-name actors and a much smaller budget, since anyway uses 2 armored trucks and a lavish vehicle Warehouse could not have run too much. Because the authors failed to develop a smart raid plan, they focused on the drama of the situation, but even there, there was not much to exploit. Fishbourne and Reno bring nothing in this film except the media interest, they are just expensive advertising. Dillon is fine, but this was a walk in the park. The decisions of the main character Ty Hackett are quite unimaginative and the finale with the "reward" is quite childish. Waste of time, money, actors and so on.
