First and foremost, I take note of the title of this film. "Chupacabra" is not a Spanish word. The name they refer to is 'Chupacabras'. I can imagine that they dropped 's' because it sounds so plural, but I assure you that it is unique in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Next, I thought this movie was made years ago. It came out as one of those B horror movies that I saw as an early teen at home when my stepfather was out of town. Then it would have been scary somehow. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the special effects. The most important effect is the costume of Chupacabras. Considering that this is the main character, you would think that some serious money has been invested, but that's not true. The shape, color, and texture were anything but a dumb haunted house in Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when the Chupacabras went into which no man could go. His movements were jerky and strange at these times, but moving on the ground looked like every normal man. <br /> <br /> Another thing I take as a theme is that there is no animal in the world that slaughters it all without regard to actually eating it. The Chupacrabas would kill one, then the next, but it never seemed to eat the victim. They say, "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so out there that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> From which country does dr. Pena? He sounds like Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something Else, but I think he should be Latino. The problem is that his accent is so bad that even a Russian could say he was not Latino. The soldiers fired round after round on this matter and brought no bump with it, but that continued to fire. I am not a man of the military, but must soldiers, especially the special tactical forces like this, have some sense in order to fulfill their duties? Would not you find out it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? They did not do it. They simply shot away while the Chupacabras continued to slaughter and did not eat them. <br /> <br /> Do you have to kill the little dog? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this streak because it was bad. Why did I look at it? I'm sure you did the same thing occasionally. ;)
