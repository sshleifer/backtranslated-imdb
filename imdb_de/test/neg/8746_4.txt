As a kid, this movie made me green. As an adult, I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I did not have the pleasure to watch this movie about MST3K. Instead, I caught it on a late Saturday afternoon when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters and there was nothing left to do outside but a few autumn leaves to rake. I thought that had to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has some very good elements; a water addicted mystic, a beatnik painter, a few idiotic ranch hands, an older geek and a "bad wind". Um ... I mean ... bad head. An evil head, who will seek his evil body as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each one is complete. The whole story takes place on a wicked "ranch" that apparently does not grow. Harvest and breed no evil cattle. <br /> <br /> As everything is referred to as "evil" by her resident mystic, you either roll your eyes terribly or laugh until your sides divide, depending on your mood. Me? I laughed until tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> I remembered this movie well as one of those who had really annoyed me as a kid. But some kids are also scared of Santa Claus ... no? Anyway ... if you're in the 50's horror camp, this is definitely a movie you should not miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good story, this movie has it. It's the exaggerated drama and almost innocent time that makes it so terrible. The drama was just bad, but it still had some good elements. Maybe it's a remake ...? <br /> <br /> It rates a 4.3 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
