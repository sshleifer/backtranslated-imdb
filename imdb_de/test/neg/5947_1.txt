Tom Selleck plays an absent son for "pop" Don Ameche and tired mother Anne Jackson, who has to make up for his indiscretions (presumed) and picks them up after Ameche burned down his motorhome; In the meantime, Selleck's job has been defeated by the F.BI, his assets are frozen, his wife and children are leaving him, and his disgusting sister and her brats have come to stay. The colorfully painted medical comedy is as realistic as Ameches doddering old coot. Maybe a serious first draft (with scenes like Ameche getting out with two toddlers) was taken in a grim second or third version (Selleck was knocked, kicked, lost a toe and a testicle!). Anyway, it's a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden surrender to his father makes little sense. he hobbles around and howls in pain, but he keeps his heart out of porridge. This movie is mush. * from ****
