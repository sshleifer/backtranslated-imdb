This is the first recorded effort to tone a movie, and the oldest that obviously exists. This historical film piece is the opening segment of the DVD "More Treasures Of The Natural Archives". <br /> <br /> It's just a 15 second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge cylinder. Two men dance next to him. Towards the end, another man goes on stage. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violinist. This "film" had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really a success. From that point on, it took more than 30 years for the sight and sound to be synchronized and the public to be entertained. However, this was a start, no matter how primitive it was. <br /> <br /> For more technical information and the history of this film process, see the other review here of "Boba Fett1138".
