My brother plays "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes were on the floor of the tailor shop. The funniest line is that the movie is "nothing to Stat." Well, that's anyway in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is called / was "Up Front FX". What I liked so much about this movie is that the main character (who is not named on the box because Bolo brings more clout) should be a cop ... a great opportunity to drive around in a red convertible Porsche. I need a copy of it, preferably the director's cut so I can see all the scenes my brother is in. The only scene he's in is the beginning when they're in the dance club. He got the spot because he was with this cheerleader from a semi-professional football team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. This is interesting because his name appears as the first entry in IMDb. Glory does not have him, luck, so much.
