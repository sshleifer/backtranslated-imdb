After a long hard night in Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pickup truck. My neck hurt, my wallet was empty and I finally chatted with a drug addict at a bus stop and tried to sell me gas. Today I have seen "Red Sonja" and can honestly say that I felt much better last night than now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a series of ass kick fighters in various shapes and sizes to find a green stone from a wicked queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, that's so good. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not known in a genre known for great movies until Peter Jackson came away with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best movie about swords and magic I could think of before Lord Of The Rings was George Lucas's kid-friendly "Willow." Maybe you should make the movie a little easier in this context. But I can not - it's badly written, badly traded (with the exception of Paul Smith, who's just average) and terribly pieced together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and sceneries seemingly lifted straight from Bedrock. Given the comic book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child in this or that world is confusing. His personality seems to switch from a spoiled brat to a polite gentleman at a switch. Schwarzenegger has less charisma than a field full of cows and just walks through the moves, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> It's easy to make a movie when you're away from it. However, the fact remains that this is not a good movie. When Nielsen mourns her sister's death and Schwarzenegger tenderly puts his hand on her shoulder to comfort her, and then swarms with that distinct Germanic accent "she's dead," you know you've got a rough ride ahead of her. A few smiles were raised in inappropriate places, such as the priestesses of a temple, who, when thrown into a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy that experience - at least after the orgasm moaning around them the place seemed. If you have to watch a fantasy movie of the 80's that is not porn, look at "Willow" (but never take that as a ringing confirmation). To really say something, go to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he has done with Lord Of The Rings. Trust me, 11 Oscars really mean that it's a great movie - unlike the bloody "Titanic".
