I saw this movie on TV last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen when a highly transmitted disease breaks out. I was disappointed and I think the movie was trash. It did not seem to be real to me. The acting was partly terrible, especially that of the doctor. It was about the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole thing was like a "worst-case scenario" from CNN. Even the obligatory catastrophe films concerning human relationships did not seem straightforward. I've seen some disaster movies, especially the weather movies, which are actually so bad that they're amusing. This is almost as bad, but it's not even amusing, it's boring and boring. Do not worry about it.
