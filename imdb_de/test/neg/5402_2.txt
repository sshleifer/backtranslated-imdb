Many people who have seen this are obviously confused. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would have brought things into perspective for a majority of the audience. I've personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a very bad hangover after a weekend bender), and it's actually very similar to the movie Skeleton Man - a dry, scary movie that provokes regret for recent decisions and one hot movie begs shower. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the selection of the "Skeleton Man" for the title was completed by the distributor (probably the work of some Hollywood makers who do not mind) and not "Cottonmouth Joe". Those of us who have seen the movie know that the Skeleton Man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeleton-manic appearance, not a true skeleton man). The deception of the people who market this movie is unforgivable, and that's why I can not rate this movie highly. Imagine this: When future filmmakers get together to create the true, final Skeleton Man movie, and need a title, they get screwed up and we're all, as serious fans of the genre, weakened for that. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe would have a horror movie alongside Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, "Nature Boy," Billy Conners, Morty, The Wood Dipper, The Booge, Eegah, The Moon, The Drill, And The Driller Icon may be Killer, Mickey Rooney and so on, but he will always be remembered as a sword with a dummy skull attached to the side of a would-be horse skeleton. <br /> <br /> That's too bad.
