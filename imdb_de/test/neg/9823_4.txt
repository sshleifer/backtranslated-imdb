Hellboy is about classic comic / action / superhero genre. In essence, Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on Earth. He is raised by a priest and within a governmental society of a child and has chosen to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural rather than being a threat (the normal career path of a demon). <br /> <br /> Story building involves the creative use of history, combining Nazi experiments with occultism. It is absurd, but so is the idea of ​​a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they came to be handled very well. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact, the opening is the best part of the film, that's the problem? <br /> <br /> Essentially Del Toro, who both writes and directs this piece, fills it. The film is free of any tensions or major conflicts. Hellboy is invincible in the first act, and the rest of the movie is made up of scenes in which every conflict is automatically pretty blatant because we know Hellboy will inevitably be okay and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action / hero movie. Yes, that's true, but once we get pulled into a well-done action movie, we can not help but believe that the hero could die. The Hard works because John Mclane seems likely to die everywhere. He escapes death with the least margins. The stakes are increased because his wife is also in danger, etc. Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior to the hero. The threat and tension is constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the main weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of using Deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear when their skills are needed in the story. The villain can be seen in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Arrives unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene, Hellboy seems to face a real threat (groups of monsters), a character unleashes their abilities - the screen turns white and the monsters are inexplicably dead, but everyone else is alive. A secondary character that establishes itself in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to completing the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship is undeveloped. It is clear that it is nothing more than a kind of prop to advance the plot and make everything meaningful. I do not want to ruin the end of the movie, but essentially, a character who is dead is brought back to life in a wondrous and incredible way. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from bad dialogues and an incident that just is not so wise or funny. After a while, it starts to rub. <br /> <br /> What's more, Del Toro blows the action scenes with a little uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to turn Hellboy's main weapon into a weapon rather than his clattering arm should be fired. In essence, the use of the weapon weakens the concept of the film and reduces the fighting to nothing more than a one-sided shot. <br /> <br /> The few positive aspects are: The cinematography is very good. At any time, the dark light and the darker color palette create a sense of mood. Likewise the use of interesting locations. Maybe it's all a bit the same. <br /> <br /> The use of CGI and FX is well done. We never get an overload. When effects are used, they are well used and the realism is preserved. Much like Nolan FX used in Batman. I prefer this method much better than the effects we often see. <br /> <br /> All in all, that's a pretty bad movie. The real shame is that the movie (although I did not read the comics) has wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has many seemingly momentarily intriguing dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has the ability to see so far, if it's on TV and nothing else to see, it would be worth a visit. But in any other situation I would not care.
