The gates of hell opened and spat out the film, then closed again. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I appreciate other movies I've seen, like all other movies. Nothing makes sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> It would take too long to mention all the plot problems. In fact, aside from a warning, it's not worth writing some of the almost infinite space available on the internet about this movie. <br /> <br /> Shit, IMDb forces me to learn more about this movie write. I think I should warn you against Edison Force while I'm at it. However, if you need to choose between the two, select Edison Force.
