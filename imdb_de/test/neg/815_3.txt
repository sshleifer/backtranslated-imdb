It's hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this film (ie The Authors, Directors, Producers, Actors, Editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 films, jokes with many other actors and seems to be no more motivated than collecting a paycheck. I think there's nothing wrong with that, but if they get paid, it does not mean someone has to look at them. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that there are really good reviews for this film here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art in an art gallery, do not look at this movie. Comedy? Look at a repetition of the flintstones, about the same plot with less wasting time. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives up his usual performance - for better or for worse. And some of the young actors may have had some good experiences with this movie. But Plummer ???? It was embarrassing to see his performance. I was positively fixated on him throughout the movie, knowing that this was Plummer of Sound of Music! I see from his biography that he called Sound of Music "Sound of Mucus", so he guessed that he did not like the millions of millions who loved him in it. I wonder if today He was asked how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is? What would he say ...? Probably something like "Where the Money Is" ....
