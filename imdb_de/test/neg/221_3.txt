I'm so mad at the point that I usually do reviews with spoilers, but in this case I make an exception. The first scenes of these films are weak and then, when they come to the meat and potatoes of the film, it is annoying. This is a movie in which I'm rooted for the bad guys, because Captain-Save-the-Day was incredible and there was no connection to him or anything that made you like him. The lead actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon could not even save this movie. Sometimes there are eye-openers or great moments in a movie that may not be great ... this movie has none. If you are looking for a movie to watch in the meantime while nothing has caught your interest ... do not choose this movie ... save your money.
