Being a sci-fi fan, I was always curious about this movie. I was so excited when Journey to the Side of the Sun was finally released on an affordable DVD (the previous print had brought $ 100 on eBay, I'm sure these people wish they had their money back - but more for a second) , <br /> <br /> However, the premise of this movie (just like Twilight Zone's "The Parallel") is that on the "other side of the sun" is an undiscovered planet that resembles Earth. Of course, this planet is just like us, except that it is inverted. This essentially means that their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sounds fascinating? That's basically all that belongs to this movie. The first hour is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet. It's just boring scenes in which switches are pressed, trivial dialogues, etc. It makes no sense at all. Gerry Anderson managed to find the most boring British actor in the history of cinema, playing the most roles. I mean, they are so boring that I'm surprised the crew could stay awake to finish the movie. However, as soon as the crew has FINALLY landed on the planet (literally sleeping in the cockpit after an endless sequence of astronauts sitting and sitting), Roy Thinnes notes that the copy is on a bottle of cologne lies backwards and jumps to another ship to tell people what he has discovered. Oops, he can never do it when he lands and dies. The end! Wait, there is a bonus scene in which one of the space managers finally hurls himself in a mirror in his wheelchair. I think he also wanted out of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised that a movie like this one was shot in the 60s. Rent if you have to. DO NOT BUY.
