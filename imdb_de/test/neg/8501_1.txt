How did this film come to the Berlin Film Festival? I understand that it is in the Panorama area, but still. <br /> <br /> The following was shown in this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot 2. Terrible action 3. Cruel videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever recorded on video. <br /> <br /> The one little guy responsible for most of the arrest of the festival is the presence of this old standby system: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this movie is that one graff artist gets on with another and squirts him. Then he feels weird and they have a boring old conversation that you have to interrupt that you might hear from your first crush in middle school (with lines like "You kissed me first, old man"). Oh, and that's not a screaming game, by the way ... you see the gay angle in the first ten minutes of the movie. Apart from that, there are usually only bad tags, badly dressed "covert" police, some skateboarding and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the topic is of interest to anyone, I recommend searching the internet for underground Graff videos taken by real graffiti artists. There is a lot out there ... and they are a lot more entertaining than this crap.
