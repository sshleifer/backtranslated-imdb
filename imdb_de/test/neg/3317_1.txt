Do not get me wrong now, I love seeing half-naked chicks wiggle around. It's part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant: to hug the belly dancers. But it's not much of a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is the music. I feel that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat," healing was more the style of music he wanted (though I could be wrong). I know the connection to current "Goth" music seemed like a good idea, but they did a terrible job. Lestat was an actor with probably pretty good vocals. That they have chosen Jonathan Davis as a stage voice is heartbreaking. Second, and someone else said mixing two very complicated books into a fucking movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could be a movie in itself, and a damn good movie if done right. I do not think "Queen of the Damned" is very suitable for a movie. While I would like to see a movie that has a story of creation, there is too much that can be formulated as "inactivity" in the book to make it a very interesting film. And the retelling spotted her pretty badly. Well, it's been a long time since I read it. I always thought that "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more action packed and made better movies /> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who how many cheesy vampire scumbags feel that this is absolutely the worst thing in the genre to be a big movie. I agree with them there. Aaliyah had a nice body.
