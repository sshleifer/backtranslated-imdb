This is a horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever played in Calvin Levels and a weak script. The characters were terrible and it has little to do, and even Chuck Norris stinks! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting. Besides, Norris seemed bored with the whole thing, and I'm not blaming him like me! Calvin levels are one of the most annoying performances in a movie I've ever seen. I could not stand it because I was tempted to rip the tape out of my video recorder. Besides, Norris and Levels had no chemistry! If you are looking for great martial arts moves from Norris, do not go near it. But if you're looking for a movie with an uninteresting story, do not look at the action and the bad drama. This is a horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever reached from Calvin level. Avoid it like the plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris is doing an incredibly bad job here, with no suspense or thrill, and the camera stays at a slow pace! There is a bit of blood and violence. We get 2 bloody impaled, torn out hearts, exploding bodies and a few bullet wounds. The spectacle is really bad. Chuck Norris is not AMAZING because he's usually here and seemed very bored, his insoles are flat and his acting was not great and I'm a huge Norris fanatic. This is his worst! (Norris is still in charge!) Calvin Levels is AMAZINGly annoyed, his shaky, flaccid performance really annoyed me, I was hoping he would do well! But unfortunately he did not. Christopher Neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he did great! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and has everything she had to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. All in all, please avoid this, it is not worth the torture even if you are a big Norris fan (like me). BOMB of 5
