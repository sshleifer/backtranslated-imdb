My tolerance for a crazy direction was overwhelmed by some of the decisions in this really very good waste of time. <br /> <br /> If the "romantic" intervals inherited the story and in "how and why did the filmmaker do it?" Mode, you have to imagine that something is missing; Restraint and taste, I think. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is a capable, empathetic actor - usually. I think he did not like the project or the people and that shows it. I can not remember anything the other person did. Can not even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it does not have to be good to be entertaining; Some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even awesome. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie against the scriptwriter's advice ($ 2.00 at the video store). I understand that he was tempted to delete his name from the credits. I bet it's a matter of pride.
