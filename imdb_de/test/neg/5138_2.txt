A memorable pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie. However, Rob Estes plays a great cop who, for some reason, happens to be Nostradamus, battling time-traveling medieval monks, who run around with rifles and attract people to fire to launch the Apocalypse. Oh yes, there's also a sexy FBI agent who happens to be a Pyschiker and tries to get Rob to believe everything before it's too late. Too bad that they could not predict a better plan. Yawning. <br /> <br />
