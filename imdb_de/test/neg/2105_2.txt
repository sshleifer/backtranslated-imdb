I would probably give this movie a zero, if not for the climax, which does not really include snakes all at once, but rather train in a line. The premise was cooked more than likely during a night of beer after being heard on production by Snakes on a Plane (which was actually released to coincide with the release of this film). The joke is probably not lost to those who seek it. I do not think there's a soul out there that sees it as a serious action-thriller effort (except on an ironic level that is beyond the capacity for rational thinking). It's about a Mayan curse against a woman who was condemned by her family for going with another man. Soon one sees her sick and coughs up green mud, which of course is interspersed with snakes. She and her boyfriend take a train to Los Angeles, and soon the more than clich√©d characters are in line with snakes overtaking the train - the founder herself becoming a snake. <br /> <br /> If it's worth it to list more about the movie, I would do that, but there is not enough time during the day. For the quality factor, it can only be said that it almost exists; There are student short films with larger budgets. Maybe that was a wise calculation for the filmmakers that so many copies were sold, just for the joke factor that they would re-budget their first weekend. Because when you look at the sets (the moves themselves randomly change in the middle of a scene!), The actors (if you can call them that, with just one other actor - the one with the very thin hair that hits a woman. ) Throughout the entire movie (which profited from the film's production), the FX (and the fact that the effects in Snakes on a Plane look like Star Wars) and the actual CGI snakes themselves, with the last huge giant snake, are somewhat What you should see in the sci-fi movie channels. <br /> <br /> All this basically means that it is a laugh that triggers every step of the way (especially as cruel as it sounds when a little girl becomes involved in the "attention" of a snake), with the Rejection of good taste works well in his favor. However, this is also 100% possible, as in a B-movie-Sour-Lollipop.
