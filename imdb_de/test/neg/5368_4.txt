The atmosphere in this show is great. There are many great structures, but that's where this show fails. There is far too much construction for nothing. You'll always see a creepy set-up that looks like something freaky comes out of the corner and then ... nothing. Again and again nothing. You hear many stories from people who talk about crazy events, but you do not see any. They appear at the doors of these people, talk about their deep and emotional past, put on lazier equipment and find nothing! There is nothing in this show that makes me believe in something paranormal. I laugh every time they have to exercise a "terrible mind" that we have not seen as an audience. They get rid of the ghost that never was and everything is housed in a neat little package. A show that looked so crazy and had so much potential leads to one thing ... nothing!
