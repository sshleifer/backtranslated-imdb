Barney is just awful. Like many of the other reviews in this show say. I am not one who disagrees with you (I will not do it). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use kids who look like sixth grade, cheesy plans, terrible dialogues and really crappy special effects. Not to mention this big purple dinosaur. He makes every other children's show look like a winner (Sesame Street won prizes I know). <br /> <br /> Please only look at Sesame Street, Thomas the locomotive or even the Teletubbies. Avoid both this and the movie (which I also discussed). They are both extremely shitty and inappropriate for anyone (even babies).
