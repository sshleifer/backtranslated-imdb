Aimless teenagers on a summer break in a small Ohio town find no meaningful ways to fill their time. Some are considering going to Chicago; others are content to drink and harass their colleagues. In a random act of alcohol-related arrogance, the bully robs a homeless man and steals a strange book. The handwritten text contains archaic spells intended to summon demonic powers. One or two nights later, one of them reads a spell and quickly becomes obsessed. He transforms into a vicious murderer and begins to silently capture his former colleagues. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a small budget. The production values ​​are low, but the filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. Only a few props or locations were needed. Acting is particularly weak and in the script is almost nothing original. On a positive note, the special make-up effects are surprisingly good at low budget standards. Nevertheless, the blood is minimal. Apart from the make-up effects, there is little reason for this film even for die-hard breeding dogs. Not recommended.
