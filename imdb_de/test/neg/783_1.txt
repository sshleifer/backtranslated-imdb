How sad that this came from the same head as Donnie Darko, one of the best movies in the genre. Where do I start? I think that one of the compelling aspects of the film is that we should criticize humanity and yet we do not see any humanity in the film. In no more than 5 minutes of the movie, the death of another person is tormented. These are horrible one-dimensional cardboard pieces of people. Unfortunately, they play with them, which can only be described as a terrible spectacle. Is Kelly really seeing humanity? Judging by the reaction of the audience, this is a terrible encapsulation of humanity. Why do not the characters in the film ask the questions that all viewers have? This is not an indictment of humanity. It's an indictment of the straw men Kelly sets up, who in this situation are almost unlike real people. <br /> <br /> For those who say that this was a wonderful movie to think about, what do you think about that? ? Armageddon? I even saw someone comparing this to the works of Kurosawa. How seriously do you think that this promotes a good existential discussion? For the love of everything that is good in the movie! Even the immoral proposal is ten times greater than the charge of humanity. There we see people who are really tormented by greed and the human condition. Yes, even Indecent Proposal shames this movie for the philosophical discussion, and still gets 5.3 versus 6.0 for this thoughtless threesome. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a more demanding, pontifical and self-glorifying movie fallen flat on his face. This has the depth of a high school movie project, and that's a poor one. That's about the level of discussion promoted by this movie. If you want to see good psychological filmmaking, do yourself a favor and watch The Experiment. If The Box had achieved even that one goal, I would have been willing to forgive some of the cruel acting, gaping action, and sheer nonsense. Unfortunately, it can not even do that. <br /> <br /> The true charge of humanity is that there are people who think that this film is a profound insight into the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! This is a hastily designed and hacker-written 9th grade thesis on Sartre based on some Internet Message Boards. If Sartre were still alive, he would sue Kelly for defamation.
