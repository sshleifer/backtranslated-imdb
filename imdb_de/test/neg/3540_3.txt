I was really disappointed with this movie, which I had high hopes for. It seems to have been rushed to capitalize on the success of the then screwball comedies (including MGM's own "Libeled Lady", which has two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years after their mating, they were still attractive to look at and filled with fire in their scenes, but a faint script and a hectic premise destroyed every chance that it would be a great sequel to last year's "Libeled Lady" and the two "Thin" Man is a movie they made before. "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing retailer, Myrna Loy, who wants to dominate the life of her sister (Florence Rice), her future brother-in-law (John Beal) and her own servants (including Sidney) Toler and Mary Gordon.) When independent, spirited William Powell comes into her life and distracts Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets her match sounds good, right? Yes, an interesting premise is missing, sad to say because Loy's character is so one-dimensional that it's hard to even like her when Powell falls in love with her, which we know will happen soon It's another attempt to get a career-oriented woman by replacing her views on what kind of life she led, something that Hollywood often did during its golden age. When Loy says that she does not have time to run her business and have a man in her life, it's a moan. Fortunately, apart from the Powell, the free-spirited Jessie Ralph is on board. She's a salty, wealthy elderly woman who helped Loy start her business. She has an acquaintance with Powell and can immediately see through Loy's cool claims that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise that Powell intervenes is meaningless. Then, a former wife of Powell appears that is not really necessary at this late stage in history, and the final wedding scene (where a lot of people are trying to get into Powell's tiny fan base) is a feeble attempt at a farce (It is While it is funny that Powell is hit by objects that Loy intended to use to beat Edgar Kennedy, this giggle is very welcome, with so few others being Love You Again and Love Crazy who are demanding, witty and This film tries to be all three, but ends with a refined bore.
