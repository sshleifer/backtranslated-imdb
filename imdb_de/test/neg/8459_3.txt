A pointless and rather stupid movie that is basically a compilation of clips from horror, sci-fi and suspense movies. There are unnecessary recordings for an audience watching the clips, and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among the viewers who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror movies. Not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("Filmhorror helps us to deal with real horror," "You are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theater") and rather banal. The clips are also displayed very quickly and the changes are pretty nasty. And out of context, these bits are not scary at all. And it's really short - I saw it in a theater in 1984 and was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84-minute movie! enjoy themselves For people who want to know more about terror, this can be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fanatic (like me) you'll probably be bored. Good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). I give a 3.
