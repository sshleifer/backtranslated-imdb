If I could rate this movie negatively, I would do that. The humor is the cruelest I've ever seen in a movie. Terrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered terribly without their own fault. There are two actions, none of which support half of a movie. Where is the "depth" that others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film starts well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The drama is very good and convincing, which makes the cruel humor even more terrifying. If you think the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other, if you consider the beheading of a kidnapper with a Bowie knife a real thigh beater, if you think "Schindler's List" is funny, then this movie is for you.
