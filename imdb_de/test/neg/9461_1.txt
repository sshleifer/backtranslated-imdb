One of the commentators is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson movie and he did not die two years after he was made. He filmed a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He shot this for several years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70s. I know that because he used my house and he left a cat there !! It sucked too. That was a big deal when the movie came out. In NC, no independent horror films were shot. This movie did not help. Patterson made Gore effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes in the body shop were really well done. The film was filmed in a building that also housed a 7/11. In some scenes, you can actually see the walls of the walls. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script looked like a kid was writing it. Only Patterson could understand. Nevertheless, it is entertainment and a classic.
