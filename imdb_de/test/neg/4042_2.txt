Words can not express how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the acting is terrible, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> Running for 97 minutes It's about 96 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> It may have been fine as a short sketch in a comedy show, but the premise is far too weak to work for that time without getting bored. <br /> Avoid this, rent a good movie instead!
