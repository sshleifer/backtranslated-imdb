I no longer have any respect for the IMDb ratings. I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the site and voted in favor. This is not an artistic film, but Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the action sketch and the description are absolutely misleading. If you are a Bible that beats Christians or Mormons, watch this movie, you will love it and you will find it truly amazing. For everyone else, do not bother, the story is so elaborate that random stuff happens that really does not follow in a coherent manner. This guy tries to commit suicide because he sleeps with his neighbor. Are you kidding? What a pussy! Anyway, that's a terrible movie.
