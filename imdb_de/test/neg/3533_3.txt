A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone awry. The creators fall into a remote desert outpost and are relentlessly and mercilessly pursued by their own creation called the outpost to help undo the horror lurking somewhere in the dark halls. James soon finds himself trapped with his son and daughter with the others, desperately trying to survive. And with the sealed out inside outpost there is no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is highly unoriginal. The sets are pretty claustrophobic and there is a bit of gore. But as a horror he fails miserably on almost all levels. The script is absolutely tensionless Weak and filled with big holes and the end is extremely predictable. The so-called master Wes Craven has produced this. I wonder if he is satisfied with this garbage. Joe Gayton leads without style. Acting is terrible, only Lance H enriksen can do anything. OK, I'm a big horror fanatic and was bitterly disappointed. Avoid it like the plague - it's the old, boring crap again!
