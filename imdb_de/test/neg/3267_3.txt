When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not know the title. I realized that Chevy Chase had the same name as Caddyshack. So I had the idea that this was Caddyshack 2. When I found out at the end of the movie, it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd thought I was bad. The whole story was bad. Call this movie a different title, but do not call it Caddyshack 2. You give this great movie a bad name. When I saw her for the first time, Jackie Mason looked like his wife. How old is the girl? My goodness. How about making this movie a bit believable? I thought Chevy Chase was good.
