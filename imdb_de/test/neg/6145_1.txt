I have decided to rinse this show from my memory into the bathroom of the bad TV show in the darkness of the forgetful, disappointing, pointless garbage TV show hell. <br /> <br /> The Skyler guy who is the host / star / The creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not very good looking and not funny at all. In short, why is this guy on TV, and most of all, why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny and pretends to be a professional cheater if he's definitely nothing more than an obvious pre-converter? Others have said it here, but this guy is a total scam and scam. If you believe in any of these disadvantages, you should seriously consider having your head examined, because they are all counterfeits, and those that may be true are as meaningless as if you spent the whole day bringing someone along To give you an average meal in a restaurant? Seriously, the guy has to go away, glad that this show was canned.
