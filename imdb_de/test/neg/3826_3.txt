Tim Curry was the reason why I wanted to see this movie, and although his looks are always entertaining, of course, he's wasted in them. The rest of the cast is not doing so well, in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphical effects that are completely unnecessary. To quote a popular axiom is sometimes less.
