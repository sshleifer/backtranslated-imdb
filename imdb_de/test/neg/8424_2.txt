Forget a fearful documentary! This movie is really a thoroughly funny comedy about a 40-year-old pornstar whose goal in life is to sing Junky Circuit Party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can not sing! And the movie gets cut off when he's ready to dive into a song. But Ford and the equally vague friend Blake Harper whine and pique and run around in their sweaters to make dreams come true. Even funnier is "Manager" Kyle, who is the I.Q. from a turnip and its collagen-injected lips look like a bee that stung it. How can adult men be so self-deceptive? Bwa ha ha! As far as the documentary is concerned, the filmmakers seem to have no POV, and the film is poorly structured and completely uneven. There are very few background information about the three ports. Such an inclusion may make the three appear as something other than the aging stereotypes of West Hollywood.
