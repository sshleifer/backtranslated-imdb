Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try to take over the excitement of the 1999 theatrical version (some of the ideas were actually copied), but weaken it a bit to make it more like the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster and schizophrenic production. And like all other versions of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price's character does not exist. Instead, a strangely childish, bleached blond woman runs around who never really develops into a character. At least in the 1999 film, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly anchored as a rebellious tomboy too smart for their own good. This "Fanny Price" is a complete puzzle. One day I would really like to see a dramatization of Mansfield Park that actually contains a depiction of Fanny's character, as written by Jane Austen. A sweet, friendly, compassionate girl with a shy personality and a weak physique. She is restrained and painfully honest, but also strong in her beliefs, steadfastly loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkably astute. A bit late-flowering, she does not begin the transition from an awkward adolescent to a selfish young woman until she is eighteen. And she wants nothing more in life than to bring some benefit to the one she loves most. It's a wonderfully complex character that I'll look forward to someday, if it's faithfully portrayed.
