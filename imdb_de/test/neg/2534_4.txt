This film starts off promisingly, but gets a bit confused and entangled in its stylistic charm. The scenery, the costumes and the music were wonderful - as perfect as you can get. But the more I got into the movie, the more I felt that all these efforts were for the entertainment of the director, not for the audience. Although I loved seeing it, apart from a few short musical scenes, I can not say I liked it. The director has a tremendous imagination, but if he enjoyed the movie, he could not share it with the audience, or at least with me. I have no sense of humor and have not been drawn into this universe. <br /> <br /> One big reason was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can tell she is trying hard, but she seems to have been so wrong that she seems almost amateurish. She is a capable actress, but she has her limits. I've noticed in her acting that she does not really have to react to her colleagues, a mistake that creates a void of chemistry. The language barrier in this film just seems to make matters worse. She and Odagiri are acting as if they were on separate planets. She is not a very good singer either, which made me twitch singing every time, but fortunately there were not too many scenes of it. Odagiri was alright, but does not make much impression. <br /> <br /> I did not even care about the characters. There is really a true lack of characterization. The only reason to look after them seems to be that they are good-looking kings. However, without the captivating love story at the center of the film, it's hard to see what happens. The film also leads detours to smaller scenes that add nothing to the story and actually distract it. I had to rewind, because after going into a subplot, I could not remember what the hell they were doing in the main story. There were also scenes in which it was hard to tell what the action was because it was so stylized. <br /> <br /> Mostly I'm just disappointed because I like the concept behind it and there are many things I like. The music and dance choreography is really great. The supporting performances are consistently outstanding and fantastic in both acting and singing. It's just too bad that the main characters were so boring.
