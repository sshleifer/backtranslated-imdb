If I could not have had any expectations of this movie, maybe he would have received a 5 or 6. It looks like I give it a 3. Acting is bad, the factual correctness of the drugs it talks about is lacking, and I feel no empathy for the characters. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Adam & Paul' just before watching the movie, and I both laughed and cried several times. This movie did not even hit a similar chord. The directors of Human Traffic may have some experience with ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of up-to-date knowledge of drug knowledge. In fact, I find it rather offensive and counterproductive to the struggle to orient the current drug laws less politically. <br /> <br /> Check out 'Requiem for a Dream' if you're looking for an amazing, touching movie about drugs.
