I had not read any of the books or seen the first movie, so after receiving the passes for a preview show, I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> 'Angels and Demons' was a confused, confused film that lacked credibility in directing. There was very little character development and I never took care of the plight of the protagonists; The opposite was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed, as the first half of the film focused almost exclusively on why the Illuminati are the way they are. <br /> <br /> The film leaps from place to place with little explanation or reason and expects the onlooker to believe that everyone in the film is an ally when he meets for the first time. Every analytical mind will realize that this is highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is an extreme clich√© and lets you ask what happened, and wonder why nobody has been thinking about some of these issues. It feels and is superfluous. <Br /> <br /> The actors are not particularly credible in their roles, especially because it was hard for me to believe that scientists, professors and men of the church would act the way they did, regardless of the consequences to do their actions. Events that happen are not the least plausible and the tempo of the film is questionable as the characters jump around on a tight schedule, and I had to ask how the protagonists manage to get from place to place on time , <Br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the film is cinematography. I thought it was a beautiful movie, but it was such a mess that I would not be worth seeing in the theaters.
