I could not stand the woman who played the mother. I wanted her to shut up. She had a bizarre way of speaking and the lines she read did not make it any better. I had no idea why the men of the city were so taken away as to cause all these problems, except that in a man-populated city, she was the only woman over ten and under sixty. Even after a terrible tragedy, her voice seemed to have no human emotions, she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life. She transmitted her lines with the same emotion, whether she said "I love you," "I hate you," "The bank is closing," "My dress is burning." Was that actually shot in Ireland? The sun burned throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest. I lived in the summer of 2002 in Ireland, the wettest summer of a century. Almost everything was still harvested. If farmers in Ireland could only harvest during long dry seasons, the land would have starved hundreds of years ago. It seems like there is not much money left to make the film. The black and white flashbacks looked like they had been filmed with the surveillance cameras you can get at Sam's Club.
