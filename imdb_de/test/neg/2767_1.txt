This movie is really shit. <br /> <br /> Just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this nonsense about a nice girl (Joan Woodbury) interfering with the "underworld" because she needs money (and because of it) she is too lazy to accept a job from friends after offering it to her). Alan Ladd should be the star of this affair, but in the first half hour he is nowhere to be found, and when he appears he stands like a stuffy mannequin. A real guy with enough talky scenes and unlikely (and stupid) characters to make you want to shoot somebody like real fast. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
