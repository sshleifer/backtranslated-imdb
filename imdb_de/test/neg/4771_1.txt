If you value your life in any way, in any form, or form, you will court yourself and watch that seemingly "interesting" movie on the DVD rack. <br /> <br /> I know what you think. "I saw the preview and it looked GREAT!" But beware, buyer, I'm in the same trap. One of my friends disliked this movie, but I forced her to sit down. Oh, how I regret this decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the movie starts cheerfully in a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are lured by another resort visitor to an ancient Mayan ruin. Upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who do not perceive their greetings. As if this were not ominous enough, the tour group sets aside large plant growth and explains that an unused path consumed by wildlife is a perfect route to their destination. I think it would not be a big movie if they made sensible decisions and were just turning around, but well, that was not a big movie sixsome anyway (the resort visitor brought a friend along) stumbled over the ruins, and their doubts immediately become his Beauty and history are scattered. That is, until desperate tribes come out of the jungle, armed with vengeance for no reason and screaming in an incomprehensible language. Since when are brutal verbal abuses tapped by quiet, patronizing language - do not ask me - but nevertheless the cast tries anyway, in vain, obviously. Suddenly, the sixth trail member Dimitri is dotted with several Mayan arrowheads and hell breaks loose. A shot completes the job, and the horrified travelers quickly retreat into ruin. Now, if a movie was planned for this movie, it ended here. The introduction lasted a maximum of 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the film. On the ruins recognizes the now five-year-old, that they are stranded by murderous locals and make countless good decisions. One of them is to use a withered rope to sink one of its members into the bowels of the ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and then trapped in the ruins and the two girlfriends are badly injured as they try to rescue him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film goes on without any notable horror of blood and blood, as shown when a girl pulls out a plant growing out of her, streams of blood gushing and then again when someone has cut off her legs to strangle the same weapon from the girl who later strangles him. <br /> <My only satisfaction in this film was to watch the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, who played Jeff McIntire, became increasingly ragged and desperate and sat long enough to realize that almost all the performers die a terrible, cruel death , Her simulated pain seems to be a fair balance for the time this movie sucked. Presumably, it is believed that the ruin is an old house of dangerous spirits and fends off a malicious, carnivorous plant and consume unfortunate visitors. Unfortunately, I did not get such a warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants, and the only evil in this movie that really shocks me is the writer.
