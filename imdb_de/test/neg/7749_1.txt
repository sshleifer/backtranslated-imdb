The director of this celluloid garbage specializes in terrible commercials that only claim; Last year he did "Dangerously Close," whose good idea (from gangs who got too much power at school and the school newspaper's editor) was lost in a sea of ​​sloppiness, and he would then become "cyborg," Jean Claude, make Van Damme's worst movie of all time (no trifle). This wannabe comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her movie debut - who is a total idiot whose inner baby is not awakened until she falls into the middle of the earth and has a series of badly filmed, impossible-to-follow adventures ( It's not funny, captivating or entertaining, especially with a number of dwarfs who want them because she has big bones (figure making!) Before she gets home for the better, and everyone who watches this is over Protecting Miss Ireland will also be returned - not because of his voice, but because she puts most of the film under tons of baggy gear, with huge lenses - no wonder Cannon, the producers, does not do business Kathy Ireland has done better movies since then ... or maybe that's not great, besides "Barb Wire" is "Aliens".
