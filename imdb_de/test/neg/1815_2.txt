After watching the movie version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I've wasted 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed at how poorly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he had omitted much important information, the performers just did not seem to fit in with their roles, and the entire movie seemed to be completely emotionless. The book shows vivid landscapes and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> You'd think a director could fit 76 pages of a book into a movie of at least an hour and a half. The differences have completely changed the story for me. For example, if the character of Kurtz's fianc√© is not straightforward on the fact that Kurtz died, he completely changes the end of the book. Not to mention that the scenes and scenes of the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. It truly feels like Roeg is filming a different story with references from Heart Of Darkness. <br /> <br /> If you look at the film without knowing the title or expecting it to be Joseph Conrad's story, you might find it a good one. Although I thought the camera work was bad and the cast unsuitable, it's still a fascinating story. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, do not look into Roeg's movie.
