Is not it depressing how the most violent cartoon on the Cartoon Network targets girls? While I do not watch soldiers being shot and blown up on Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it would be nice to have a cartoon, or at least something on TV, that I could watch to satisfy my violent urges. And something I would not have made fun of. I've seen some episodes (I was supposed to be turned for that) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do I find a gun?), And it's pretty clear that after the first few episodes it lost its spark. If you like to see 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds and are slaughtered by toddlers with one-foot-feet, this is a must. After a while, however, it gets boring, and with such a show even original ideas become boring. The movie just felt like an overlong episode (I can not remember any), and the rogue would have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. This show is a joke. The same basic premise sequence after another is spent, and though it may sometimes be a mystery and an intrigue, the end will always be the same - "The Powerpuff Girls Save the Day!" Everything is good and nice, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give 3 out of 10 points because I'm the only cartoon on CN that's about violence, even though it's about girls who care about girls So I will not vote for it forever. I have established myself as a fan of war and violence films and will not let this reputation be destroyed ... 3/10
