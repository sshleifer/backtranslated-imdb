Standard "outbreak in remote areas, expert taking vacation in the area is taking on the responsibility" movie. There are only a few deviations from the norm. For one, the children involved are pretty reasonable from the start. Usually it is monsters that keep watering the works until they finally redeem themselves. Another is that the doctor, who is usually an obstacle at the beginning, is never completely excluded or redeemed at the end. Perhaps, as this seems to have been done for the faith-based PAX channel, they do not want the believers to be too appreciative. After all, there were no nasty local politicians / recreational economists trying to cover up the whole thing. The absence of these clich√©s has been refreshing - if we have the PAX channel for it, maybe I'll have to try a few more quotes. Apart from that, however, this was pretty standard. You have seen everything before.
