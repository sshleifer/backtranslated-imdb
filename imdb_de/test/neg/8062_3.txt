Like all the others who bought it, I was outwitted by the "20 Extreme Gieseln" and "banned in 20 countries" or whatever is in the box. I have to admit that I'm a big fan of Gore, and I'm always amazed when movies make him fat and convincing. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are among the best in the industry. The revolutionized make-up effects in the 80s. Today you do not need them, because everything is done on the computer. However, computers can not compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could evoke. But I digress. <br /> <br /> If you watch fantastically bloody films like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even the grand finale of Savini's Friday, the 13th chapter, you can appreciate everything needed to make a horrible bloody movie , You can not tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox, except the blood that is supposed to be omnipotent in this movie. If that's why you're looking for this movie, you're wasting your money. As many other critics have noted, most cases are after-effects. You see neither the torture nor the bloodshed, it looks like you can see whatever the words look like. <br /> <br /> Well, it's here, but not as much as you'd expect or expect. A man is neutered and a woman is hung on her breasts but other than those two scenes and one that involves a scalp; There is nothing really different about this movie. The scenes of Gore himself in these three areas are still pretty tame compared to what you were hoping for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experiences in the horror and gore genre, but I expected a bit more. Call me sick or twisted, but is not that the only reason why people even see this movie? Honestly, I found myself bored in many places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just another movie trying to capitalize on the excitement of a superior movie. Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great movie, but much better than this threesome. If you do everything to buy this for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
