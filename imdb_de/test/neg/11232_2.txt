The worst part of all is the bad scripting that leads to superficial plays. Dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss himself has the annoying face. The character of Holly Hunter is overly self-centered, and Hunter himself treats himself as usual heavy exaggeration. Brad Johnson was made of wood. John Goodman made the best of it. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole thing about death / mind has become a bit over the top and now seems rather lame. <br /> <br /> Hard to see if you like old planes.
