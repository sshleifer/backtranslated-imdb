1. watched 24.06.2007 - 4 von 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK Thriller, but a bit too predictable. This story is based on Germany, where the film is also shot. It's about a young medical student who gets a chance to go to a premiere school in Heidelberg, and sees some weird things. Someone she met and rescued on the train turns up at the school's experimental table, and she immediately suspects a bad game. She is investigating and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called AAA (and it's not Alcoholics Anonymous), which has something to do with the anti-Hippocratic oath and is used to conduct experiments on living people that the doctor does not do You can usually do that. She learns that her grandfather (the Dean at the school) was instrumental in making sure that the members of the school were busy filling it. It's an interesting story, but the problem with this film is how quickly the public is informed what's going on, and then it's a horror movie in which the heroine fights the bad guy in the group who takes things to the next psychotic one Level brings. Although filmed in Europe, this film plays in front of a young American audience focused on gore, sex and horror film (which is really the big downfall) and explains why he probably made good money and produced a sequel, but not. It definitely makes a good movie.
