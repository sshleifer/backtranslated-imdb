"Queen of the Damned" is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I've already seen. The only thing I like about this movie is the soundtrack, but that's not it. (Since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and so many bad decisions that I do not even know how to start. So many stories have been cut, such as the legend of the twin (one of my favorites), Armand and Daniel's relationship, and even Louis is not present, just to name a few. (The plot was dead) First they should have made a film of "The Vampire Lestat '' because it's the second book after '' The Interview with the Vampire '' and not '' Queen of Damned ''. You tried to compress so much information in a single movie that you get virtually no information, unless you read the vampire chronicles. <br /> <br /> So many meaningful characters seem to have no real meaning in this movie. This is, for example, the case of Pandora. The actors they choose to play all characters do not agree with many descriptions of Anne Rice, especially Marius, who are thought to be beautiful and tall. Imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being Lestat) I did not understand why they made Lestat's maker Marius and not Magnus. The interview with the vampire was a fantastic movie I loved the actors and Tom Cruise, because Lestat was PERFECT and far superior to Stuart Townsend. (I'm sad that Tom Cruise refused the chance to play Lestat again). Far superior from this crap movie titled "The Queen of Damned". Anne Rice was so picky that I did not know how she sold the rights to this dreadful production.
