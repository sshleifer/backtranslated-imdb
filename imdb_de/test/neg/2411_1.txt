I'm sure I saw FUTURE KILL for the same reason as most people: the great poster by HR Giger. And like everyone else, I was disappointed to find that the movie could not do the poster justice (Giger said that director Moore actually asked him to). When I saw this for the first time at the age of 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I would still think if I had not seen any specific movies on MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> The plot has a lot of annoying college boys driving to the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang leader for their fraternity. Then they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psycho who kill the leader of the gang and blame the lads, as an excuse to chase them and seize power. The rest of the movie is mainly chases. A handful of guys are trying to fight their way out of the mutated city (which is supposed to be LA even though it was made in Texas). There is pseudo-political evidence that the boy boys' society is pro-nuclear weapons and the mutant society is anti-nuke. There are discussions about how Splatter became a freak by radiation. Most people get cancer from radiation, but Splatter only shoots spikes and slaughters girls. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Once our heroes save a mutant girl from two nuclear weapons, and she shows them "how the other half lives." The other half, it turns out, are all punk kids dancing to a bad 80's pop band. Our little epic is so stupid and outdated. That's really all that goes with it. Frat Boys walking around in derelict buildings while boys who look like bikers try to kill them ... Oh, and it's the future. <br /> <br /> I do not think you doubt why Ron W. Moore has never made another film. The thing is a real stinker. If you like Giger, you buy his books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie), or just look at ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time nobody needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the picture sound good, there is another crappy movie that does the same, but bigger and better: AFTER THE NEW YORK CASE. It's crap, but it blows FUTURE KILL off the screen.
