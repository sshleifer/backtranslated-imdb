The presented topics are very interesting. Suburban culture, Suburban Sprawl, public transport, oil and gas consumption, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc. The problem is that this is a pure and shameless piece of propaganda. A point of view is presented and then repeatedly hammered at the viewer. They see the same handful of "experts" repeatedly making their case. The supposed "narrator" sounds like a news reporter, but in the end he preaches even the dogma of the film. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the movie is not so much the grim and ominous news of oil exhaustion, but the feeling that the people in the movie are actually a post-oil society and everything they have with them brings, wishes. They paint this picture of a utopian society in which we all return to the independent village model; Go to work, shop in the area, grow our own food, and generally live an idyllic 19th-century lifestyle. For them, the post-oil society seems to be a big vision of a better world. This would certainly mean the end of globalization and even better the end of Walmart. I will give them some credit for exposing the weaknesses of some over-promoted alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave her 3 stars because I appreciated the old material and the premise.
