I remember when I first heard about Jack Frost. I was in Video Ezy in Miranda with my family on a monthly tradition of hiring videos. It was at that time that I had the courage to go over to the horror area of ​​the store. While searching the various titles, I finally came across Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the movie was beyond my eyesight. Years later, the movie disappeared and was replaced by the inevitable but unnecessary episode. I once again ventured into the horror department and picked up the case, only to come to a conclusion: the movie would be scary? But not on purpose. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: The Revenge of the Killer Mutant Snowman (pretty much a title) follows where his predecessor left him. Sheriff Sam is seeking advice for his exams, and Jack is now in antifreeze form. To escape his past, Sam and his wife move to an island hotel, where he deals with a variety of Slasher film stereotypes, including busty female models, stubborn sports jocks and Caribbean staff. However, Jack is released from his liquid grave and is icy again. He goes over to the island and kills anyone who would turn out to be a terrible death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this is a direct video movie, so it's bound to be bad. But that's terrible in the eyes of other top films as well. The camera works badly using a camera that makes a soap opera appear majestic. Half of the actors look like they came out of a porn shoot, and the other half looks like they came from an old people's home, but in fact they actually came from an asylum. The film often makes use of special effects that tend to switch between bleak puppetry and CGI that can be improved by a toddler, and the death scenes are usually seen in front of the screen, the victims. But the movie is most memorable, because it's a killer one-liner like "There's Something That Needs A Little Christmas Gift" and "I Know You're Officially Dead!" After all, the whole purpose behind a movie like this is to make a popcorn movie boring for that Friday night, and even that fails. To make a sequel to a movie that was a bad slasher, with a concept that would make a child unbelievable, he must have taken some nerves out of steel? or a total frontal lobotomy. To director Michael Cooney? Thank you for wasting my time. To everyone else? Avoid as arsenic.
