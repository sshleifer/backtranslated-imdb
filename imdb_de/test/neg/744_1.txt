Northanger Abbey is not my favorite novel by Jane Austen, but it has its charm. This movie does not work. It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the cutest man in the entire Austen canon (unless Emmas is honored by Mr. Knightley) is called heartless and mercenary. One or two completely alien characters are introduced, and a touch of corseted perversion hangs over everything. I was so disappointed when I first saw it in 1986 when it was released. Even today, it's on the list of films that are disgracing the books they're based on. Even Robert Hardy fans should go for it. It has nothing and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G to recommend it.
