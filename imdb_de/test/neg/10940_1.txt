My boyfriend and I rented this movie and within the first 5 minutes we had no idea what was going on. It felt like it should have been over in the first 15 minutes. It was a horrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some in the movie, and the plot (if you can call it that) was full of holes. I would never recommend this film to my worst enemy, but also to anyone I really like.
