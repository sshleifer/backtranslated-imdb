Perhaps the worst movie in the genre. It was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic. I do not think anyone could have done anything more terrifying and irritating if he was specifically asked to do so. It's toilet humor from its worst side, I would even avoid seeing the trailer. I only looked at it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python you will love it. Who wrote this was either biased or seriously disturbed. I'm still confused how to honestly believe such a statement. Rarely do I leave the cinema. It really is very exhausting that a movie has this effect on me: This has made it in only 30 minutes.
