"A comedy with biblical proportions!" These masters of exaggeration, the film-day rowwriters, are back; The 2003 sequel, Bruce Allmächtiger, barely produces a giggle. The only thing that arouses my interest in this film about total indifference is its dogmatic Christian overtones. Sorry, make these overtones. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel ignores Jim Carrey's rational mind to refuse a reprisal role and plays Evan Baxter, the complacent news anchor of Bruce Almighty, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the Acropolis, the pressure of change takes its toll on his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), who was apparently flown out of Stepford, and three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips, and Johnny Simmons), who are looking for a stilted job in the accompaniment of a piano, pray that the family comes closer and almost out of debt does it too Evan. <br /> <br /> In what must have been the biggest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) actually appears, but the whole pesky "working in a mysterious way" makes it all the place by telling Evan he should build a Noah Esquire Ark to prepare for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or an X-Box or something. And in a truly mischievous deity style, he also forces Evan to wear beard and long hair and wear worn and sticky robes. I was sure that razors were hard to get that day. The beard was inevitable for Noah, but I'm almost certain he had nothing to do with spirituality. The same applies to the robes. a massive construction work is certainly more difficult with such unpractical clothing. Could not God have conjured a pair of steel-toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I find the notion that God is dealing with us a bit disconcerting, and Evan, who fights him every step of the way. And who would not do that? God basically lets him fire, dispels his loved ones, makes him a laughing animal, and actually threatens him in one place. Of course, it turns out that God is right, and the sensible, hard-working family man, who gets along well on his own, has to eat a big piece of bittersweet, modest pie. It's almost as if God were left alone, Evan had to tolerate and encourage him. What kind of message is this? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a highly commendable ecological bias, with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage done to the world. It's also the first movie to offset its carbon emissions, and this is certainly a milestone in a Hollywood studio. Without the banal, condescending banner of American Christianity, Evan Allmächtiger would be a harmless family movie with a laudable environmental record. But with its confused religious dogma and the relentless message of "blind faith," it is one of the most disgusting films of all time.
