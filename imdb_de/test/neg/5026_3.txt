Let me tell you right from the beginning. I DO NOT hate this show. I like some aspects pretty well. When I saw it for the first time, I quickly became addicted. I just started getting out of the whole "Anime is for Kids" stereotype, and the mature elements of the show intrigued me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after watching the whole series and watching a few of them, I can say that my attitude has changed, and almost all pitfalls that plague "bad" anime fall into place. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on TV. In the end, only one friend and I still watched and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain the plot to you. You can skip this paragraph if you do not want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical fountain near her family shrine. When Kagome comes out of the well, she was transported back to the time of the feudal period in Japan. She meets with many other characters and they form a group of about five companions who embark on a journey of revenge / justice / touching in a single case =). Overall, they try to regain the pieces of the sacred jewel splinter, increasing the power of the demons they use. <br /> <br /> Although there are many, many side-stories and story-arches, there were no close enough to occupy 167 episodes. The only arc of interest that is interesting enough to see is still boring (the sevens band). After the halftime mark in the series, or perhaps even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the action is frozen and whoever made the series chose dozens and dozens of filler episodes instead. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no effect on the story and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters who have played an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes simultaneously. Many episodes follow exactly the same ausstechmustern as the stories before it. Inuyasha shoots Windscrew at the enemy. Windscar distracts. Characters gasp in horror. The enemy turns out to be a barrier. The characters spent three episodes killing the enemy before Kagome finally fired a sacred arrow at him and turned to dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** IMPORTANT SPOILER: THE FINAL IS ALLOWED ** The lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you spent 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** IMPORTANT SPOILER ABOUT ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and in some cases outstanding. Even so, reused animation cells plague most action scenes and it's very hard to ignore when it's clear that the same stone has passed a character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> On On the other hand, all the characters are very well developed and the romance novels between some characters were really gripping. Also the character designs (performances) were brilliant and the best I've ever seen, especially with the sevens band. There is definitely no lack of cosplay possibilities here. Nevertheless, I hoped that a character would die just to have a move in the plot. And the humor in the show between the characters is used over and over again. A special joke (sit boy) can be found in the first five episodes, and one can literally assume that he will be used repeatedly for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good aspects of the show and it's easy to see why it has a large following, the show seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls drooling over Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Definitely worth a look, but not worth the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and pleasing to everyone. But then it just gets boring and boring. Watching a TV show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series does just that. Do not expect much from "Inuyasha" because you will only feel disappointed.
