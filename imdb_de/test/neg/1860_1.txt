Impressive! This movie is almost too bad for words. Obviously, the authors wanted to somehow link this with the Ghoulies franchise, so they got Pete Liapis from the beginning to repeat his role as Jonathan. Only now is he a police officer and has no similar character traits as in the first. The ghoulies in this case are not the ghoulies of the last. The cheap-looking dolls were replaced by even cheaper-looking little people. Rather than being a major enemy or being evil, they are more like the comic-relief characters who appeared out of nowhere for no reason. <br /> <br /> The first time I watched this movie, it felt like I saw it before. Why was that? Because everything in this movie was stolen from another movie. All cheesy policemen and action scenes are by Lethal Weapon. The ghoulies were quite similar to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except they were not funny at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies movie were scattered throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I think the target audience should be for adults, but the mix of black magic, cartoon slapstick, police drama and bad drama does not do this work at all. I hope they do not make Ghoulies V because I do not want a movie studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 min. R for violence.
