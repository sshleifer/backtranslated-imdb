After liking Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in The Dream Hunters), I thought Mirrormask was a safe bet and was very disappointed. The beginning of the live action section of the film was fascinating enough. The relationships between the characters were believable and easy to empathize, and I loved the sets, costumes, and artwork of Helena. The subsequent computer-generated scenes were tormenting. The dialogue was unpleasant and overbearing, terrifying the interaction between the live actors and the CGI. The events occurred for the weakest reasons, and most events seemed superfluous for any possible conspiracy. I've only seen the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend that you see nothing of it at all and stick to Gaiman's strong written work.
