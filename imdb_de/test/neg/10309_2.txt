Do not worry if you look at the cover of the DVD. In this cult classic Sandra Bullock appears only a maximum of 5 minutes. The entertainment value is very high here. <br /> <br /> Just to name a few of the highlights that should be considered: <br /> <br /> - The doubled evil voices of the top villains - The special weapons camera - The strange masks and outfits of the killer - The eye-catching ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - The abundance of bottom-up shots - The spacey scene in which Bullock becomes unconscious on the street - The over-clich√© Italian Moe (LaMotta) - The cheap synthesizer background music - the hypnotizing exaggerated weapon fetishism <br /> <br /> And last but not least: the super-sharp fistfighting scenes. I wish there had been more ... <br /> <br /> Additional point for a successful attempt to make me laugh.
