Again I fell for it, in my roots I long for a funny and bloody horror movie, even after a vampire movie. Even if it's stupid, I'm a happy camper, as long as I get my fun in the mix, it does not take much. So I saw the cover of "Bled" on Hollywood Video and was curious what it was about, it looked kind of interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this film not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my breakneck and senseless violence and nudity, but I was bored. This movie has the kahoonies to tell, it's a vampire movie and it really is not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money, because this is one of those rare times when I actually turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist meets a vampire, I guess, I do not know, I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I'm assuming he might be a cockroach eater, who likes to freak people out? I think, I do not know. Anyway, he thinks the artist has a certain torch for the dark, so he gives her a drug for an alternate fantasy in which a vampire exists and needs blood to come alive? I think, I do not know. Their friends are excited and decide that they also want to try the drug, I think, I do not know. After they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I guess I do not know, and the vampire is now enjoying the busty girls in their scarfed clothes. I think, I do not know. But are some girls really vampires? I think, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I-Dunno's", this may be one of the worst reviews I will write, but that's because this movie is just awful, boring and confusing. I just like to see that these actors are actors of whom you can say that waiters are looking for this "big break". Not too smart that they get into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it's not like they should have read the script in this case. Since the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, and everything about this movie was just bad, I strongly recommend that you hand over the movie if you see it in your video library. This could possibly have been an interesting film with its concept of another dimension, but why did you choose this director to show his "creativity", if he has any at all? This was a bad movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
