First of all, "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is Bullcrap. The story is about a Chupacabra who kills all the villagers in the small town of Furlough, Texas. I assume the distributors have renamed the original title, so he would make some more money. And I think it really works, because I bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. Anyway, the movie is not good. Actually it is damn bad. But I did not expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster. If you enjoy low-budget horror with bad dialogues, actors and something gore, you should watch this movie. But I have to warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst acts I have ever seen. The actors make a great effort and it becomes completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in the normal way. They always have that completely wrong tone about everything they say. It's so stupid it almost looks like a crazy parody. It's like they only shoot each scene once and are happy about it. The worst of all is the blonde girl who is supposed to play a fool. She is the worst of them all. I've never seen such a bad actor (and I've seen Pteradactyl). Even if her friend dies, she can not stop being a fool. I hate them. <br /> <br /> Some shots in this movie were actually pretty good. Those who were picked up during the day are pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot at night when the chupacabra hits and the lighting is far too dark. The Gore scenes are small and short, but really grisly and violent. The effects are really funny, but that's the way I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messed up and it's easy to see that it's a man in a suit. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie should only be seen by extreme fans of cheap flicks, and it's very important not to see this alone because you're likely to be bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and beer.
