I loved the original P.H. and was a bit pleased with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw Part IV. Oh boy ... As a Pumpkinghead enthusiast, I did my best to give Part 4 as much recognition as I could but it is pretty bad. The fight for the wedding ceremony right at the beginning of the film is on the one hand a terrible mess. The Hatfield and McCoy plot is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©d. How did the producers come to use this tired family feud story? Wow, unbelievable. Acting is below average in addition to Henrickson. The plot and the script are stunning. The actual editing and the cinematography are average, as is the direction. I mean, the movie is not a total loss. As always, I enjoy seeing Pumpkinhead, I like Haggis the Witch, and I like seeing Harley's mind in action. But all three characters had far too much screen time. I thought Haggis and Harley would go to a supper club to eat and drink an evening treat, as they were in their cabin. The bottom line is .... is that I wanted all the characters in that puking of a plotline to be dead within 20 minutes of starting the picture. Where does sci-fi get these so-called "film production professionals" ?! I could do better writing a script, cold and drunk. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! See it if you're a fan of the other three, but only once. And then go back and stay with the original two. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
