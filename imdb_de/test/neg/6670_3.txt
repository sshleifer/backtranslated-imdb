As I write this, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours screaming and yelling at old slogans about his always suicidal nurse. In fact, reading this will probably have joined the afterlife and the obituaries will record an almost 80-year career of hysterical gaiety from the lovable sparkle with the curved checkered cap. Most of these obituaries will not remember how Norman Wisdom had committed a kind of suicide in the late 1960s with this astonishingly poor but strangely overriding intent for his film career. <br /> <br /> The signs are ominous? "Tony Tenser Presents" go into the title. You scratch your head? "Where have I seen this name before ...?" Well, to the titles of many of the cheapest, craziest British movies of the 70s, so just choose yours. <br /> <br /> Then it is called? "A Menahem Golan Production". Oh my dear. <br /> <br /> What I found out is a combination of confessions from a holiday camp and Last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourist Board. Norman Wisdom is very versatile, being here Norman Wisdom (or a variation of it). Even in such a junk, he's never out of shape and somehow holds you through the severed fingers as he paws and dribbles over a (clearly insane) Sally Geeson. Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were responsible for some true cinematic horror between them, but the bedroom scene in cinematic cruelty was reborn. Incidentally, Sally plays the role of a lobotomized sex toy. <br /> <br /> I wonder if maybe one of the crazy young cats who populate the movie scenes of this movie might have thought of themselves in a quiet moment "Umm?" old Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess !! "I think it was a payday for her. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the pretty things, they probably thought" Yes! This will do for us what Blow Up did for the Yardbirds ". <br /> <br /> And the career of Old Manson's leading man ended up freezing his little balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> Me Once there, it was a depressing place.
