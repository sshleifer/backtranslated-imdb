Cairo or Pulse, as known to the English speaking public, is located in Tokyo and begins when Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso), an employee of Sunny Plant Sales, visits her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to inquire about a computer disk When he comes to him, he gives her the disc, but then commits suicide ruthlessly. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently connected to the Internet and receives scary messages and pictures on his monitor. He asks the computer what happens to Harue Karasawa (Koyuki). It does not know, but it seems The place people go to when they die is full and they need another place to go. The earth is as good as any other, right? These spirits do not like sharing them, so they somehow make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something. I do not really know, because the movies are a bit confused ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. I hated Cairo, I hated everything and proves that Asian cinema can produce something like any American filmmaker. The script is a mess, the thing just does not make sense with scenes that seem like something from another movie, sequences that make no logical sense or are explained in any way. Cairo is also the most boring movie I've eaten this year. After two hours, this is a real job to go through, I really wanted to rush it, but I'm fair, if nothing else, so I kept it to the bitter end and frankly wished I had not. There are so many things that are not right with Cairo. I think the filmmakers wanted an unreal, ambiguous, and intentionally incoherent feeling, but these are qualities that I despise in a movie if they are not done right. Then there's the whole internet, which I just have nothing to do with. I use the internet all day and I'm not scared at all. Add to that the fact that Cairo did not entertain me as a movie, maybe I'm a Neanderthal, but I like the movies I watch to entertain, sort of make sense, and not get bored. <Br /> <br /> Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate remedy for insomnia for me. If you're having trouble falling asleep, plug it into the DVD. They fell asleep within 10 minutes. I guarantee you. I did not think Cairo was scary at all, the whole internet was ridiculous and what's scary is you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I get. Now that's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I am sorry that I have to address this fundamental point twice more. Forget about any action, tension or gore, as there are none. If you have a very nervous disposition, there may be a few scenes that you could sneak out of, otherwise this kid-friendly, PG-rated stuff is all the way. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film looks so boring and boring, it is untrue, the camera only sits for very long shots and when it moves, it moves very slowly, it has the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Cairo is a subtitle, it's difficult to judge the original performances, so I do not have to worry about it. It's hard to interest someone who does not even speak the same language and you do not know what they say. <br /> <br /> Cairo is crap, I hated it and it's so easy and uncomplicated. Just because it's an Asian movie does not make it good automatically, and the mess of storytelling, the holes in it, the fact that it makes no sense, and it's absolute boredom means that Cairo rightly was torn to shreds by people if it were a American production. The worst movie I've seen at some distance this year. Cairo received a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).
