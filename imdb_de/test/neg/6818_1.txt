Absolutely ridiculous movie that makes fun of college admission. While it is true that the SAT's are not everything to evaluate a student for college admission, what the movie is all about is absolutely ridiculous and not worth repeating or seeing dumb people doing the whole process estimate extremely tight. The film is an insult to hard-working high school students who have to work hard and then go through a long process until they receive the letter of admission or the rejection of the schools they have applied for. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves a rejection at all levels.
