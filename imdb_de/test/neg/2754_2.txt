Make no mistake, High School Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot is about a geek who is planning a plan to get rich and win the girl. However, he goes all wrong, and of course the end of the movie ends with some other people gratefully holding the girl. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is all that interests women About is wealth. For us men, too, we should just accept that we either "have" or "we do not have"! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie could be rated 1, but it is above the worst movies. Acting is not terrible and the production values ​​are not terribly extreme. All in all, it is a bad movie and not worth seeing for many reasons. If you insist on tormenting, check out the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 1.5 / 10)
