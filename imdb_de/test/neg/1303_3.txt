I'll address it directly to you, this movie is absolutely boring. It's about a flood, that's it. Blah blah blah a little about family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah boring. <br /> <br /> Blame the weatherman, poor guy. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a tough guy who expects everyone to be clairvoyant, an extremely irritating character. <br /> <br /> If you are from the United Kingdom or any other place where it is flooded, you might like this movie. It is as if earthquake films are estimated where earthquakes occur. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie in which the weather is the enemy and you need to overcome it, or literally overtake it, it's more of a time bomb that needs to be disabled. <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie, it's understandable why Britain thinks the world is overpopulated, that's not it, but for them it does. Really, the movie is as exciting as collecting crusts and I can not recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, way too long. <br /> <br /> The problems with the film; I will not go further, as the film does not deserve such a dissection. Tip to you, Londoner - buy more boats. If you bring kids to this movie, they'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored, screaming demons.
