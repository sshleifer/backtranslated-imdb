"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you had when I was a kid in the late '50s: a spectacular biblical epic with well-known artists, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it. But I remember that "Solomon and Sheba" did not impress me at the time, which was strange since I had enjoyed a lot of "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helena of Troy" and others. When you're a kid, you ignore things in pictures that adults do not do (bad behavior, for example), and it's easier to satisfy warriors in their armor, battles, sword duels, and action, so if you're not impressed then There is something wrong with a product of this genus. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has some of these features, it is definitely standard and average. Yul Brynner's wood performance as the Hebrew king does not even ignite when Gina Lollobrigida, the voluptuous and half-naked, provocatively dances around him. She is better and makes an acceptable spectacle. George Sanders does not seem interested in what he's doing, and Marisa Pavan (twin sister of Pier Angeli) does not fit in as a kind of conscience from Brynner. <br /> <br /> The last sword duel between Brynner and Sanders is just for the storyline and it lacks interest and intensity (it had to be filmed, that's all). <br /> <br /> No good farewell to director King Vidor, Solomon and Sheba are likely to remember as the last unfinished Ty Power image.
