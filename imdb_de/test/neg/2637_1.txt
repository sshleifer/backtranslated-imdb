Stay away from this movie at any cost. I was thrilled to watch this movie in a bet to see who knew the "worst movie ever". Needless to say that this has undoubtedly won. It is long and tedious and has no purpose or conspiracy of what I can collect. A movie about a killer child raised by a fetus bred outside the womb has no place in your video camera. If you are extremely bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you prefer to keep your mind, stay away.
