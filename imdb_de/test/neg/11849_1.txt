<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT ************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you really appreciate bad movies for their pure entertainment value, though not for their quality (Case of John Carpenters DARK STAR - Highly Recommended) <br /> <br /> If you like movies about dinosaurs in general - <br /> <br /> CHOOSE THIS CINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECE! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Make <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> the most from this miserable attempt of a Dino / Slasher strip. Take, for example, the scene where the watchman meets his fate in the clutches of Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why this? Quite simply, because this scene was removed directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a lousy movie at first. <br /> <br /> The end was a copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who were unhappy enough to make it through. Video losers. Again we see Mr. Rex fighting a bulldozer that alternates like a forklift truck with the wonder of -ta-daa! - Stock footage from the above CARNOSAUR 1 & 2. Of course, the end ends exactly - The beast falls to its death when the complex goes up in flames. <br /> <br /> A real insult to the intelligence of everyone. <br /> <br /> But it's still better than seeing the ROSIE O'DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * by ***** <br /> <br />
