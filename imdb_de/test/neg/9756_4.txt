When I went into the movie with the right expectations, I liked this movie a bit. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was gossamer and clich√©d, and I was able to predict every turning point from the beginning. But the dance sequences were very well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical dance and hip-hop dance (both, which I like to watch). The music / soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the drama scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were fine as actors, but the dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie that's worth it if you want to see good dance sequences. and this movie is MUCH MUCH better than "You Got Served" in terms of plot and drama. On the other hand, that does not say much, does it? = P
