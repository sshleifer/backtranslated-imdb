Nothing about this movie is either great or terrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, that's what kills him. Boredom is just not good. I can not say that I expected anything better from Will Smith, but I definitely did it from Kevin James of "The King of Queens" - but I'm used to saying that a lot lately. This film tries to profile itself as a funny romantic comedy, but never hits the mark. In fact, it never hits * anywhere * within the target. The allergy scene is worrying. The fact that Kevin James can not dance is something that does not hit anyone unprepared and therefore (in a movie like this one) is not funny. This movie is constantly trying to win your heart, but always with the wrong trick at the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm looking for examples in my brain), but I really think this movie should be avoided.
