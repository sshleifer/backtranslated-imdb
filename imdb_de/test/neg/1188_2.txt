As a big fan of the three TV series, I was very interested to hear that LoG is coming to the big screen. However, in my more honest moments, I had doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the authors would be able to uphold the high level of wit, comedy and horror that permeates the original series. > Unfortunately my fears were not unfounded and the movie was a big disappointment. I'm having trouble understanding the other comments on this site. Of course, people have a right to their opinions, but the guys I've seen them all agree with me and are just as big fans as me. <br /> <br /> Acting was not convincing, but they are so good Even if they are not at their best, they are still good to watch. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. Worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the cinema. So seldom have I felt so uninspired of a movie and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> I'm writing this comment as a warning to other League fans. If you love League, you may be able to convince yourself that they have not completely messed up their move to the movies. If you can not convince yourself of this, you have dulled the otherwise flawless genius that exemplifies the TV series. <br /> <br /> LoG in the cinema? More like a log. (or small brown fish).
