I visited Random Hearts with 3 friends, and at first I thought maybe it was just me who did not enjoy the movie. After all, I did not like As Good As It Gets and the movie won all kinds of prizes. Well it was not just me ... nor any of my friends liked it. It was incredibly slow, like pulling teeth. The only action in the movie is in the preview. We did not go out of the theater because we all assumed that something more would happen. We were not as smart as the 7 or 8 people who left the house. I've never been to a movie in my life, but I should definitely have. It's all hard for me to write, considering that I can enjoy relatively easily when it comes to movies. I think a movie is great, but I do not like it. This movie did not even come close in the same category. Not only was the movie about two hours too long, but it was two separate stories in one, but they were not stitched together seamlessly. Plus, the "soundtrack," if you could call it that, was so annoying. Like Seinfeld, the same riff has played over and over again (the difference is that I like Seinfeld). This movie had this jazz riff that he played again and again, which sometimes sounded very inappropriate, especially when people die with death from ... the plane crash Hard to explain what I mean, but believe me, it was awful. I can not say enough so people do not waste their money. After leaving the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the film company and reclaim my $ 7. Sheheeesh, I could have had bowling or something for that money.
