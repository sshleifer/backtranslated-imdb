Right from the start, this film is moving with you. Clumsy overdubs that explain the story, monochrome spectacles, boring sets, total lack of humanity, swing or style. The actors look like they are drugged. Maybe an interesting story that is completely wasted. Surely someone realized how bad the production was?
