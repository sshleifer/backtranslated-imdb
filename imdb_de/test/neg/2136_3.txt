WARNING: CAN INCLUDE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The waves following the first "Jaws" movie were still important in the 1980's and beyond. Movie monsters have changed from radioactive monstrosities to unknown and gluttonous beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie, the ocean, space, genetics). Although "Jaws" was a milestone in this particular area of ​​film horror, few films could achieve the visceral impact of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (also known as Devil Fish or Red Ocean) is a dutiful follower of the original "Jaws" formula. After several unfortunate boats and sailors were brutally murdered by a marine resident, there is a first impulse to discover the animal, then the failure to study it without terrible results, and a final urge to destroy it. Although the filmmakers tried to breathe new life into the equation through technical elements and corporate conspiracy, the result is downright catastrophic. This film falls under its own weight of uncanny cut, brittle acting and cheap fear. <br /> <br /> The most offensive, captivating feature of "Devil Fish" is the cookie-cutter cut. From the beginning of the film, when 3 different scenes are mixed together, the viewer has the feeling that the film lacks any technical credibility. It seems that the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and making the necessary changes to the music. In addition, each cut is a cut, and it seems as if the editors have never heard of the terms "fade", "wipe" or "dissolve". The influence of scenes can never be adjusted as they are interrupted immediately after a last line and a new scene begins. There are many silly camera tricks when two of the main characters spend a private moment on the beach, putting some kind of time lapse picture of their act over their bodies. <br /> <br /> The music is just too bland. The creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the "Jaws" theme with minor variations. Although I like keeping my reviews without MST3K influence, Mike described the gritty score as "softcore porn music." Failure to create excitement in a movie that depends so much on the film is a death blow to Devil Fish. Acting is stale, relationships are confusing and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. The question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level as to create a huge chimera of a marine monster to protect the interests of the oceans, why should not a more practical use be made for a better humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this movie is the monster's idea, though its film presence is less than outstanding. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is bad enough to be mediocre. If "Jaws" had never been made, the film could be described as average, as its subject would be new and exciting even if it were executed ineffectively. Unfortunately, as a copy of the original thriller by Spielberg, it is most comfortable on a garbage heap of cheese.
