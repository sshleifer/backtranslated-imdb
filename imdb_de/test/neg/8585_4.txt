Stone has tried another kind of movie. Every Given Sunday lags behind the above-average The Last Boy Scout and the below average of all odds. Stone can be awesome, see The Doors, Natural Born Killers or Platoon, but he can repeat himself when he sees Nixon or Born on the fourth of July. His true brilliance is evident in the Michael Caine perfection The Hand.
