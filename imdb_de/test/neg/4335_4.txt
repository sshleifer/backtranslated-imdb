Ben Stryker, a former beret, stops in a small town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend. Soon after he had driven into the city with his Suzuki and settled there. A motorcycle group called "The Savages", led by tyrant Pigiron, invades and takes over. Stryker does not want to get involved, but that changes when friends become the real targets. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say about this crazy item? A difficult call, as the only reason for the wreckage of this low-budget car accident is due to the crew's huge B-cast, who managed to get involved in this project. I do not think it's a complete job, but it's not good either. What a cast! Strangely enough, Lance Henriksen (as the main character, he has not the top billing, but the last), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Well, what went wrong with that shabby low-budget blunder. The superficiality of the material is too one-dimensional to borrow borrowed ideas from better films (namely, Mad Max) and come up with a complete jumble of ideas that simply would not work out and could have been better thought out. The clich√©s that are used can be manipulated into a good ad despite predictability, but "savage dawn" seems to be on the short side without the viewer absorbing everything. The cast is mostly lost in nothing. The bleached blond Henriksen is extremely solid and even with his inviting presence, which gives his character a mysterious glow. He does not mind much and sometimes gets lost in action. Too much subplot, but when he kicked some motorcyclists in the ass, passed the good times. Karen Black's hissing performance is very weird and it's all about screaming and cursing. Although she gets into a memorable catfight with Claudia Udy's coquettish vixen character Katie. George Kennedy, wheelchair bound, roams aimlessly until the last attack, and Richard Lynch acts as an unpredictable priest / mayor in a superfluous role. Bill Forsythe simply hugs it as the headset of the infamous biker pack. The junky story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has this cheesy cartoon style and is heavily influenced in the Western genre. Just look at the bad guys. How they got their names is a mystery. Maybe they pulled her out of a hat. It's quite a second-rate material that moves more often in a lackluster scene after another. Unpleasant funny elements are put in and also a bit sleaze. Sticky exploitation that is not hard enough and the deaths are pretty ridiculous. An awkward script contains kinky details and unbearable tricks. Simon Nuchtern's spotty direction was lukewarm with the numbers. One or two intense scenes can not adapt with their thumbs because of their turtle-like gait and many stunts. The cardboard boxes had a dirty look, but this organic feeling is missing. Gerald Feil's pebble-like cinematography was easier to work with if the focus was not on the city, but on the desolate backdrop (like the beginning and end of the film) with some neat camera touches. The chunky music selection by Pino Donaggio is drowned out by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is a memorable midnight short film that for the most part is a misfire. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same kind.
