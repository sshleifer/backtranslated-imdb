I have just seen lonely pigeon, return to lonely pigeon, Laredo streets and Dead Man's Walk. Everything was excellent. This sad piece of garbage is cheap and poorly played. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gus McCrae are known as hard respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that every time Caption Call is played by another actor, everyone quickly convinced me. In Dead Man's Walk, the guys are credible, the younger versions of the seasoned rangers Texas. In Comanche Moon, there are only a few dumpy rednecks. I had to stop looking. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made that stinking bunch. It's a sad end to an otherwise great franchise.
