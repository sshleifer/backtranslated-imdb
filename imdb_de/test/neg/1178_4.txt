There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based films. Anyway, the filmmakers give themselves creative licenses to the story. If you have such great ideas, why not use this talent to create something original? Otherwise, stay with the facts. This could have been a good movie if only they had done that. Ed Gein was a terribly frightening person. It is said that if you put Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface in one person, Ed Gein would still be sicker / scary. So why can not anyone make a movie about him that can convey that? When will they find out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? <br /> <br /> I've read books and watched news programs about him and now I'm not a scriptwriter or anything like that, but I think there's enough documentation about Gein, so it does not take much to write a story about all those atrocities he committed without producing murders that had never been documented. I'm aware that he was found guilty only of two murders, but with all the evidence found in his house and barn, there should have been many other ways to put this film together, rather than the depot's relationship with his Mother and his girlfriend use pen and far too much of it. <br /> <br /> I think I wonder why ... At the end of the movie, I knew more about the minor characters than about Ed Gein? Why did not we get to know his mother, father and brother and the relationships between them ... What made him a psychopath who he was? The only thing we got from his childhood was lightning from him as a little boy who is running. <br /> <br /> In the end I give him 4/10 stars. That's 2 for the Gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Although, in my opinion, it was a kind of bad casting, considering that Gein is a small man and may be effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and not what I would consider female. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
