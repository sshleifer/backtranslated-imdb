Ho hum. The rich, good-looking child gets into trouble, the poor girl falls in love with him, jealous ex-boyfriend causes tensions ... yadda yadda. I actually laughed a lot in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just stupid. As one scene passed to the next, I often wondered how we got there, as if I had skipped a few chapters in a book. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty pathetic and did not have me or my wife was very concerned about one of the characters except the hooded friend. If the ex-boyfriend now got an ax and chopped up the girl and the rich kid, then ... then we would have a movie, and all those stupid dialogues and plot jumps might be acceptable. But since this movie tries to touch the boat and is totally overlooked (and ultimately resorting to the romantic equivalent of a divine intervention to try to tear a tear) it just falls flat. > Avoid this movie. Cut your toenails instead, you will have more fun.
