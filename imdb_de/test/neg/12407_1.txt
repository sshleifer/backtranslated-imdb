Disclaimer: During my stay abroad in a foreign cinema, I loved a variety of films from various genres such as horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, just to name a few. So I enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of the drama as well as the mindless popcorn fun of action movies. With a wide selection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I'm confident that I can spot, appreciate and complement bright spots in movies. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, this overrated swordplay epic features the infamous "Slideshow" action sequence, which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. You just have to show a series of close-ups of grim faces, swords, legs and / or arms and then a corpse. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in the poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and incoherent that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this film is non-existent, as it is important that the characters tell the viewer that they love or hate someone instead of actually developing and displaying such elements on screen, which everyone does Makes characters generic and colorless and makes the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the plot itself is an absolute disaster, as too many characters are introduced too fast with too many plotter devices. Plot complexities in movies can be used to great advantage (eg, A Tale of Two Sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes an exploitative rubbish, if it does nothing more than to swirl a very simple drawing with no seemingly good reason. > In fact, the entire movie looks like a series of smoke screens to cover up its shortcomings. Horrible action choreographies are obscured by "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movements. Non-existent character development is obscured by the characters who openly say how they feel. And a thoughtless action is obscured by the bewilderment of the viewer with the convolution. As if that were not bad enough, this movie was extremely boring and seemed to be over 150 minutes instead of the actual 95. <br /> <br /> rating = A rare 0/5 stars.
