This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style, but the marketing strategy. Part 2, Part 3 may exist ... until one day the product life cycle ends, provided, of course, that Part 1 has commercial success. So many things seem to be hidden and the story seems incomplete. the action design is boring. Stage design is ok but not good. Maybe Edison Chen would one day be a big star. He even looks really charming on big screens. The most impressive is still Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
