This film is about a gap between the real world and the world of the dead. There is a lot of hocus-pocus on the internet (ie, when you install a program on the computer, you see dead people - much like when you play a videotape you die in RINGU). Honestly, most of it seemed pretty stupid and lost me. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live in their own existence - to be completely alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a lot compared to most Americans. One genre that has become popular in the last few years and that I simply can not identify well with is these horror movies. I know that they are very popular - especially since they are reproduced so often in the States. I have seen both RINGU and THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and, despite their popularity, was rather ambivalent. The only recent horror movie I really liked from Japan was SEANCE - a reworking of the big British movie SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what did SEANCE do differently, in my opinion? Well, in contrast to the other films and KAIRO, money and money were not terrified for special effects or for the public, but the focus was on the story. The bottom line is that these other films are very similar to American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday the 13th - with frightening things that only scare the audience, and the plot is (at best) secondary. For me, I want a story - not cheap thrills or ghosts as the main focus of the movie. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high score, I know that I'm in the minority, but I do not think so. This is a very satisfying movie. All too often there are little things that could easily upset someone - but the characters start screaming and crying and behaving as if they were saying, "This is the scariest movie ever made, so shiver better. Well, I think it's just too hard and I wish it had been more focused on life at the end of the film and the plot - not scared tactics.
