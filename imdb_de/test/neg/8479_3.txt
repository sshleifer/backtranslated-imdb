This movie is not worth going to the cinemas to watch it, and I did not like it, the effects on the movie are really well done, and you laugh here and there, but the story is really bad It seemed as if they had run out of ideas, and what is that for Loki and Odin? that completely destroys the worst mythology, and I think they forgot that Loki's powers worked only during the NIGHT !! If you really MUST need the movie when it comes out, do not go to the movies! <br /> <br /> You could have done a lot more with this movie than you would have done to make a movie to show off cool animations and effects
