Even the tough John Wayne fans have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is named after the gang that killed his parents, led by half Apache, half white Renegate Pandro Zanti posing as Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many stupid points to count, but one of the outstanding points is Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell), who ties a captured Zanti around his boot. All Zanti needs to do to get rid of his boots! Tobin's friend Dusty (George Pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a knife in the back and returns as new for the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin rides a makeshift tree trunk through a drainage trough surrounded by walls in the middle of the desert. He misses his mark and chases Zanti on foot through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but OOPS !, He has not seen the sign above the waterhole, which says "Do not Drink Poison". As Zanti breaks down dead, Tobin continues his hunt for the rest of the gang and conquers the entire property by inflating a cliff that seals a secret passage in Dusty's cabin - how convenient. <br /> <br /> At the conclusion scene, the new sheriff Tobin is on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), the daughter of Dusty, Ruby, who was previously a kidnapping target in the film Zantis gang was. Apparently, the studio hoped Wayne would get the girl in virtually every movie she shot with him, as this sort of ending is completely predictable for most of Lone Star's films.
