I enjoyed the first "Toxic Avenger", but the sequel simply did not work. There are some funny gags in the opening involving members of the home for the blind, but after that I just got bored. The sequel is also filled with a lot of quirky humor. Only this time it is not funny! Much of the gag revolves around crunchy Japanese clichés. Almost every Japanese character seems to chop fish. Does everyone chop fish in Japan? The Troma movies are known to be more than a little disrespectful, but if you use humor with racist clichés, at least make it funny. I can not laugh when I'm handed the same crap I've seen a million times! One thing I have to acknowledge is the unfounded nudity. There is even more unfounded nudity than the first. But all in all, I was very disappointed, and the movie ends with a boring chase scene where I had to breathe and puff before the movie went black. At least there's a funny line from the movie that made me roar with laughter. After the villain has said a line from Shakespeare to one of the resident citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) replies with the words, "Fuck you - that's from David Mamet." <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
