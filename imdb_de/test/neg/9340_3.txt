I found the movie a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14 years old and told her to watch the video. she is 6 and she loved the movie, some pieces she did not like, but I did not know that either Eddie was the star of the video I thought it was Jordans video ?! but she enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I noticed the mistakes, for example, that Jordan did not really play the guitar in the end, but she never did. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie for when you're seriously bored or 10 and under. <br /> <br /> it calmed my cousin well. <br /> <br /> though they all I have sung then the rest of the day.
