The only interesting part of this movie was jazz and reggae from New Orleans. One tries to be one of those films where there are two fights the heroine has to overcome, one from the past and one from the present, which she does not convince. Acting is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised that this went straight to the video. The end result of this movie leaves nobody satisfied or confident, including the actor himself.
