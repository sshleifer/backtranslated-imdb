Despite decades of tax incentives, the Canadian film industry still lags behind most Central African and Islamic countries in terms of international visibility (surprisingly, few Canadian films are shot outside their homeland), and Nouvelle-France, also known as the Battle of the Brave an example of why. More than any other country, commercial Canadian cinema does not seem to be able to develop its own identity, and is caught in pale imitations of other countries' failures. On paper, this historical drama might look promising. The history of Canada certainly has a wealth of untapped material, as the French and British fought and bought and sold the colony, though none of that makes any sense unless you count the strange Blink-and-you-Miss scene of characters who say "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is no more" before returning to the soap operators. But even though this is not a history lesson, it's not a drama or the epic adventure that the new title promises: There's no fight in the movie, unless you count 10 seconds of half a dozen shots and another collapsed dandruff. The town square we've ever seen in Quebec is a rather obvious, flat-lit studio interior that gives many scenes an old TV miniseries, as well as director Jean Beaudin's reluctance to bid on long shots or even outdoors. What you get for your money is a simple but tedious harlequin romance about convicted lovers who are constantly being separated from events beyond their control. The biggest surprise is that Fabio does not appear in the cast. It's a kind of movie where whenever two characters want to do the two-back pet, the camera goes over to a comfy, raging chimney or waterfall. <br /> <br /> An English-Canadian-French co-production that does not work. To unify once-belligerent nations and throw every country into stew with a decent tax hike, this massive cash catastrophe should clearly be considered Canada's Titanic - though someone has failed to tell the producers that they meant the movie, not the ship - It However, it is more like a cheap revolution, without the battle scenes, the masses or the few moments that threaten to be short in the face of overwhelming adversity. The Montreal Mirror described it as "so bad that you can not even find the strength to mock it." That's pretty unfair, because while the movie looks almost like a minor 80 miniseries, the last half hour is suddenly very funny, and the characters inadvertently accidentally put their legs in bear traps and insidious husbands explain, "They never will. " see your beautiful lover again, cuckold honor! They will both pay for it! "and accused our heroine of murder and - gasp! - witchcraft in a process that was funny enough to have been in Demi Moore's version of The Scarlet Letter." Throw caddish British governors, insidious slaves and Celine Dion to the end and you have something that almost feels like some kind of movie that Timbo Hines was aiming for with his legendary, incompetent time (and he still managed to be wild) version of War of the Worlds, but without the amazing technical incompetence. The versatility of leading man David La Haye seems to be limited to the number of other actors he can look like in the course of the film: He Starts Like Andy Garcia, takes on the look of the Al Pacino Revolution, flirts with the Shaved Tch√©ky Karyo style before transforming into a younger Ted Danson as he grows older, during his opening scene in which he witnesses the death of his father He responds with an expression that looks like he's waiting for the director to tell him he can go home, promises a feast of bad drama, he actually conveys the impression of a mediocre support actor, the latter Minute had a guide, as the one who was originally occupied, the script finally read and gave the deposit. He willingly shows himself and tries it, but the grace and charisma the part needs is simply not there. Billie Piper-Lookalike Noemie Godin-Vigneau's leading actress does not light the screen closely, though she's in the limelight when the peasant girl who is the spoils of Vincent Perez's corrupt and perverted Intendant Le Bigot (that's really the name of the character), the doubly bitchy, drunken, drunken lackey Sebastien Huberdeau and, regrettably, the bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest of Gerard Depardieu in a gray-haired wig. It's a truly pathetic sight to see a once-great actor at the very bottom of his game as he shuffles through the moves, looking as if he has not only lost the will to act, but also the will to go with him Life. He obviously could not bother to stay for the English dubbing sessions (or even a few long beats in which he's noticeably doubling). No wonder he talked about retiring at the time of the movie's brief release. <br /> <br /> Jason Isaacs offers a brief comic relief in his standard Patriot mode, which dubs Wolfe of Quebec more like an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton on pace, while William Pitt of Tim Roth stands on the sidelines with the occasionally confused smile of a man housed in a pretty hotel, with excellent room service and many days off, even though they like Benjamin Franklin of Colm Meaney 'both in the movie for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour put their heads behind the door for a few minutes, but make no impression, funny or otherwise.) The supporting actors are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as genuine and adopted daughters of the heroine and a strikingly beautiful one Irene Jacob, who is looking for the whole world like a young Fanny Ardant, is refreshingly good and deserves much better.
