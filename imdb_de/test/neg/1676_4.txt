A child puppeteer, for a public-access children's show, goes deep in his head when he discovers that children he maintains in a hospital are victims of horrible abuses. This movie has some of the worst indescribable monstrous parents you could ever meet. No exploitation film, nor an after-school special on the dangers of child abuse. Apparently harmless, Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it appears that the police are castrated by a lack of evidence to convict vile parents of their terrible abuses against their children. The children are emotionless and zombie-like (due to the many abuses), the parents loud, unimaginably hard, contemptuous and warlike. Especially the mothers are so obscene that you are responsible for their execution. They are basically miserable people who express their frustration with the children. Our detectives are tired, disappointed with the entire trial and how often the police are unable to prosecute those who condemn their children to submission. While the crimes themselves are abhorrent, the film does not explicitly explain the gruesome activity on the screen. I would say that the reason is that Tom Basham gets into psychosis as an unbalanced man and child. Between Basham's Mr. Rabbey and his guardian, shortly after he had murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child, it is a strange sequence between the tables, whether he lives in a fantasy and how what he has just done, an indelible (Be aware of the behavioral changes, rather impressive work that turns from innocent to creepy.) Peter Renaday is Lt. Hayes, the detective who is responsible for the homicides, expressing on his face the burden that incriminates him There is an early performance by John Ashton as Detective Matthews, who always raises the wrath of Hayes because he is unable to follow instructions, not to mention that he believes parents are abusing their children Clumsy relaxed bluesy score, which seems inappropriate for a movie like this, controversial conclusion that even children can only tolerate so much A bit too slow for my liking, but I have the feeling I'm using Basham's eyes effectively before he takes care of his business and waits patiently as he prepares for the attack.
