I saw this movie at a party, we were very confused from the end, it ended rather poor. Although the whole movie is not that great, I expected something better. This movie is pure rubbish, but I suggest you look at it if you find cheap horror movies with a weak script quite funny. Personally, I loved the ad, it was my overall highlight, the fight scenes were simple, a shot of a knife, some shadows in a window, wrong blood. I have to say, the grandma costume was pretty scary. This movie is a mix of deadly joy, stockblood and swampy Brook 2, except that this film has slightly better camera wok and color handling compared to stock blood.
