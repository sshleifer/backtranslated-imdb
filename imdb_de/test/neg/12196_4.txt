I saw this movie without any idea what it was about. I was fascinated for the first hour. It was a great thriller. A very talented cast and a good dialogue. Then I noticed everything at the sight of the first vampire. I could not believe my eyes. A big thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from this point was totally awful. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 stars for the brilliant beginning. I find that a bit generous, but I was entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all. If you are, you can not agree with me.
