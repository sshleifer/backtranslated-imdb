Patsy Kensit and a random Australian guy play a duo of would-be inmates investigating a series of murders related to art galleries, but in between they can still find time to shoot adolescent shop-lover and the brand-new woman the male cop of the Adulterer is. The serial killer is suddenly no longer important when the alleged lover of the woman (who is basically just a colleague of hers) is found murdered and the male police officer becomes prime suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really boring, implausible and tension-free Aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sex thrillers like "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and pretty much every good cop / bad cop clich√© is described in detail in the script. The fighting position of policewomen in a corps full of men, the question of shooting first questions, mentality, alcohol problems due to stress etc.? Even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a gag. Yawning! Kensit is keen to make this film more bearable, but she lacks the credibility and talent of a true movie heroine. The final twist is more or less interesting (not original at all, mind you), but then you have long since stopped taking care of the characters. The scenes shot in the sex clubs are ridiculously fake, and Clive Fleury's direction is completely uninspired. What a total waste of time?
