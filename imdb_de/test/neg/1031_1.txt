Here's a summary of a typical Rachael Ray show: <br /> <br /> 1. The awesome title song starts to play, and Rachael gets off with her Snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre freight elevator. 2. She walks around screaming and / or insulting the audience, then she screams to sit down. 3. A clumsy monologue. <br /> <br /> (The next ones are in any order) 4. A segment where Rachael's own horn is turned (eg, "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes," "Rachael Ray saved mine Life "," Rachael's Fashion Tips. ") 5. A completely pointless DIY tip (for example, how to engrave words in casserole dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, and how to build a tube of lipstick with light on it. 6. The release of horrible recipes for the unsuspecting audience (first bouts of reaction bites are never shown) 7. A prominent guest with a clumsy interview, followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience Rachaels cronies (ie I say to all that woman who has nothing but overalls, and I do not have time to put on make-up housewife). What would they do without you, Rachael? * Gasp * <br /> <br /> Reasons why this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. Fakeess: Rachael Ray claims the entire show is blank. Many people Those who participated in tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is a script. Many of these people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Your Show Jumps Too Much: While Oprah, the best-rated talk show host of all time, has a specific theme for her show, Rachael jumps like an ADHD soda kid on crack. Her show covers an average of 10, short, worthless segments of a show. Second, you'll get some fashion tips from Kojo, and the next Rachael will produce "Spanish" peppers with Manchego cheese, and the next will be a giant anaconda on stage, and next you'll get a picture. <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a poor hostess with bad ideas: Apart from her scratchy personality, Rachel's hosting ability is terrible at best. Her questions to her celebrity guests are poor and often not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are uninteresting and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> In summary, you do not have to waste time with this lock. It will be canceled soon anyway.
