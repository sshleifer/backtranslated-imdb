If you have smoked enough weed, it might make you look weird or nostalgic because people in the early '70s went completely crazy. There is a strange innocence in this movie and the sex is a lot awkward and playful than the steel professionals who are now doing it for the cameras. <br /> <br /> The real curiosity here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and that shows. She has a classic WASP-like look - like a really cute Ivy League student. So what the hell is she doing in this cheap, cheesy strip of skin? From my point of view, she does not seem to be into drugs at all (which she could perhaps explain) and she really seems to be incredibly committed to the role. When she sings her first song, she really pretends to think she's going to make Julie Andrews flippin or something. I just have the feeling that this girl really believed that this would be her big break or something, instead of the close career killer who it was. Anyway, she's damn cute and it's hard to believe that she would even strip naked on the screen, let alone a masturbation scene, some oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then the real deal as a climax to the movie (snark) , It is definitely not a body double. This is our little Kristine taking one for the team or for showbiz's bigger glory or something. It's quite amazing to watch and it's definitely inspiring (um), but somehow I wish she had not. This was a very pretty, talented young girl who received really bad advice. Anyway, I appreciate that Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long been hoping this movie would go away. She was very sweet and appealing in "Meatballs". It is almost impossible to believe that this is the same girl - but it is so.
