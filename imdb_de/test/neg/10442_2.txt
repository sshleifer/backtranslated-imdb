Well, from all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement slowed down afterwards. Antonio Sobato Jr. plays a superb role as a son looking for the shark that killed his father. A Megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and also the most dangerous. The view of the shark was scary at some angles, but the effects were blurry and the scenes were somewhat weak in some places. With the weapons of the mini-submarine, that would eliminate a whole school of sharks there. It was great that the son would get exactly the revenge of this monstrosity, even though it would cost him his life. As they say, revenge has its price, but was it worth it? This answer could go on and on, and this movie was a big letdown. The beginning was good and at the end was the Titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
