One reviewer says that those who may not like the movie appreciate that "only movie goers who are tired of the movie as a distraction" appreciate it. I think that's pretty unfair for those of us who find it boring. <br /> <br /> I'm not tired or disappointed with film or filmmakers, but found this boring and selfish. But it's true, I'm not too deep in the meaning of meaning. I feel that for those who know, it can be very important, you know. <br /> <br /> It is very slow and it takes a long time to try to formulate your individual points, using pictures like that. But in such days, it seems possible that a movie like this movie might appear in one of those dark and discouraging cabins in modern art galleries, rather than the screen of a popular movie theater.
