The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is terrible, the main actress is chubby and the story is ... wait a minute ... there is no story ...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you want to see piranhas, you might be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with the Piranha films of 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of a scene with piranhas. <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about this movie, besides being only about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It was written and sung by Jim Stein and means "love all things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie. It's so bad that it's not even funny to look at it. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I'm the guy watching everything.
