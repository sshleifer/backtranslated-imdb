"Undercurrent" offers a first-class cast of wonderful actors that could have been put together for the perfect salon comedy. Unfortunately, they are pretty lavish for a "female point of view" potboiler - and a very thin one as well. Although Katharine Hepburn shines as a tomboy / old maid who eventually marries, her husband is deeply disturbed and harbors dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli has absolutely no idea how he builds this very beautiful plot, which was compiled by Edward Chodorov from a story by Thelma Strabel. The friendly, top-notch cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) remains in murky waters. ** from ****
