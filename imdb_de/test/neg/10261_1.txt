Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And where is all the blood and blood that was in "Demons", which is a good movie and was not scary at all. My brother said that this movie was bad, but I had to give it a try because the first movie was very good. When the movie was over, I understand why my brother thought the movie was bad. The only advantage in this film was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. And I've seen that there are four sequels to this movie. I have not seen any of them, but can they be as awful as these, I have no plans to see them, but maybe I'll see them for some time.
