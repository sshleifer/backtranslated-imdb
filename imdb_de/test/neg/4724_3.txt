This movie was a Mexican horror movie from the late 60s. It's not that good, but it's not that bad. There's a lot of lock and it's pretty heavily padded with nudity and violence, but it did have a conspiracy and at least tried to stick to it (even if the conspiracy was the same damned Frankenstein inspiration: "Do not manipulate God's domain") - film drive). There was some upholstery with female wrestling, but it was done in Mexico and wrestling seems to be very popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. The other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy, but dad has the idea to transplant the heart of a gorilla for his son to save his life (I do not know, I'm a lawyer, not a doctor). The transplant works, but the son becomes a great ape, terrorizing naked women and killing anyone who gets in his way. There is also a subplot that includes a policeman and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really did not add too much, but if you wanted to insert masked wrestler, that's a good reason). <br /> <br /> The movie was kind of cheap, but not bad for a B-movie of the day. The plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that were not so well connected. This movie is somehow fun in its own way (I do not know why), maybe because it's a Mexican horror movie and it's in my normal bad movie diet. I suspect it may be because it's a mix and mash of some weird things. <br /> <br /> Watch if you like cheesy foreign movies, nudity and female wrestlers.
