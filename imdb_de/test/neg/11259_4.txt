If you have ever heard any of the James Lee Burke books on tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree that Will is the personification of Dave R. Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I have heard) and no one better represents an IMO, but he is not a Cajun. His delivery is all wrong. I have lived in this state for several years and can still hear the strange patois that has a Louisiana accent. TLJ does not have that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen would have been a good choice for Bootsy, but I failed to see Cletus (who will play in that role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke?) he must be tall). Overall, I thought the movie was only a 4 - the plot flopped like a fish out of the water and did not have the normal interesting, linear continuity the book normally has. <br /> <br /> Hollywood will try another JLB book. "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We would ever see some of JLB's best bad guys.
