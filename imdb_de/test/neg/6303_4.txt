Shaggy, friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: If you want to make it in this world, it's not enough to have imagination, you have to live up to your place in society and that means, after the (heterosexual) Rule Rules Live The Drag Queen Comedy Drama from Australia is a mostly optimistic journey of three male friends crossing the outback in their pink bus, Priscilla. Although it is not a formula film in itself, there are the obligatory "road movie" sequences (sticking by the campfire, looking down at the rednecks, etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott pursues every potentially evil moment with a sense of humor and sympathy, but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative, a horrible subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and alienated son who feel well - and the child wise - with his lifestyle) and a third act without any energy. It has a nasty transvestite humor and a pretty playful character, but a script that seems to be watered down the path. ** from ***
