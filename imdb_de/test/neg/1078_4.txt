I was really disappointed with this movie. Great performer and possibly a great plot, but it just seemed to be limping. Charlize Theron was a master of her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her computer screen work was in chases with Austin Minis. Product placement went wrong, so very wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction also seemed out. Edward Norton is evil, and it was so obvious from the beginning. Each time the camera passed over him, it stayed too long and Norton grimaced or something. Come on, Hollywood, give us a little bit of appreciation! It's alright to surprise us with a plot change without having to telegraph it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I've always been someone who appreciates the work and talent that goes into a movie, but it simply did not.
