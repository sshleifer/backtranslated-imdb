I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I really had high hopes to watch this DVD last night. Mainly because I try to avoid ratings until I see something myself and form my own opinion. Big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment, which is actually quite decent for fairness reasons, and if they had made the movie about the characters in Section 1 alone, it could have gone beyond the 5/10 mark. Territory stank it to the sky. Ryan Reynolds has wonderfully captured the essence of an actor on the edge, but as a gay TV writer and famous game developer / devoted family man, he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box, I expected a flashback thriller like 'Memento' - unfortunately that's far from the standard of the movie.
