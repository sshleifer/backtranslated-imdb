OK ... that may contain spoilers ... but who cares? Do not waste your time with this garbage heap if you value the seconds in your life. There is not one single quality in this film that you can redeem ... and I say that as a full fan of the Vacation series of films. I loved cousin Eddie from the other Vacation movies ... but he only works as a supporting character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think he's a great actor ... but this movie lacks any cohesion ... the tempo is out ... it's just insatiable. And the actor who plays the "third" ... Jake Thomas ... was just terrible, more than likely, because there was no real sense of direction. I do not know why ... but his whole character scared me. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this is a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not there ... it has nothing to do with it. The script, director, drama ... special effects ... everything is a train accident. With orphans. And kitten. Oh ... and the train has also hit a few old people. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do ... Stay away from this filth! I call it filth because it pollutes the name of the holiday franchise.
