The comments to Commune sound like a very interesting movie that I would be very interested in. Unfortunately, the producers did not see fit to include subtitles for the hearing-impaired and the deaf. That leaves me and countless others like me, who depend on closed captions to follow a movie, completely out of the game. <br /> <br /> This is not to be excused for any movie produced in 2005. In a world where all sorts of disabilities and disabilities are housed, it is annoying and ironic that the ever venerable entertainment industry does not shut down all productions and movie theaters are subtitles.
