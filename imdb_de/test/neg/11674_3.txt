I'm terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch picture was enchanting, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, this one is just colorful! Lana looks like 51 (actually she was 31 then, but obviously depressed) and tries to play a shy girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the widow the role by "playing" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta, although she could not sing - crazy! She sings only one song - the title role of a Lehar operetta, that's really funny! The only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end: glamorous! And after watching this scene, take a look at the introductory waltz scene in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes! Similarities?
