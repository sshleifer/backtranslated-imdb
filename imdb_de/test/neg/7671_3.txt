My take: The stupidest of the AIRPORT films and probably one of the worst catastrophe movies of the 70s. <br /> <br /> As if to milk the franchise with all its might, the producers of this third episode of AIRPORT throw in more action, stupid subplots, free star appearances and goofier elements. CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the largest airport so far and so far one of the worst catastrophe movies of the 70s. Due to the poor box office results, it is no wonder that the genre has overtaken its greeting. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a fairly catchy score by Lalo Schifrin, which is supported by stunning recordings of the title plane in its former glory (the same aircraft used in this movie would crash in July 2000 cause). But then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the "all-star" cast, which is nothing more than faded Hollywood stars, TV actors and not too popular B-actors. The conspiracy is stupider than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, who after the Summer Olympics is now the pilot of the Concorde (piloted together with co-driver Alain Delon) on the way to France. On board is the reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who has just discovered that his friend, the well-known gun manufacturer Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), sells their weapons to terrorists. In order to prevent her from revealing the news to the world, Harrison sends his most advanced rockets and best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from landing Loy or a singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson, who transports a living human heart into a cooler (!), Martha Raye as a bladder-type woman (and the character does not go deeper), J.J. Walker is a pot-smoking saxophonist (arguably the film's most annoying character), Eddie Albert married "old" wife Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as a Russian coach with a deaf daughter, and a love story between reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (much to the evil eye of coach Mercedes McCambidge). In addition, the film is closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever before, with the dumbest cameos of Charo (and her pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Camp fans will undoubtedly get a real kick-in-the-ball in this stupid entry in a long line of disaster movies of the '70s. This is a true disaster in more than literal sense. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 of 5.
