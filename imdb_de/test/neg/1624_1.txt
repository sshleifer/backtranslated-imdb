I have just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he has stated in detail that this movie is only available on the TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I find this advice really helpful! I mean, a movie that tries to be so good and this exciting is just not what the movie wants to be !!!!! So, yes, watch this movie as in this show, and instead of giving this movie a star of ten stars, you can give it ten out of ten stars! Until then my 1-star rating is only for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie !!!!!! Do you have that now?
