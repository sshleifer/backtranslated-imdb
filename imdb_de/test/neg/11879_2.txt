What can I say about that? Such a big prestige production - but in the end? Wasted time, wasted money. <br /> <br /> This work, which is a disaster, is historically. Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> * Augustus is often called "Gaius" - his first name (pronoun). But the ancient Romans did not use that name. Correct would be the last name (nouns Gentile and Cognomen) or the Octavian, Caesar, Augustus. Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But that is historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was shown as a nice young woman - but she was not. Adultery and (maybe?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of her expulsion. <br /> <br /> * She was not in the dying bed of her father. She was never allowed to leave her exile. And she was around 50 years old at the time! Not as young as she was shown. In the same year that Augustus died, she committed suicide because Tiberius had stopped giving her a pension. Augustus was much more ruthless than shown in this film. Author and director, however, seem to believe in Augustus' own 'Res Gestae'. <br /> <br /> What's left? Historically extremely dubious, bad demeanor, poorly built and equipped - 2 out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
