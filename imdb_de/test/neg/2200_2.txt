This is basically just a stupid story of persecution that is almost identical to the trillions of other persecution stories in terms of drama, suspense, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack thereof) and tempo. The "The Net" differs from traditional persecution movies in his Material: Computer. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters obviously did not understand the differences between a calculator and a cray. Computer novices should not see this movie because it will make them paranoid about computers. Whatever Hollywood is trying to tell us, it is not easy to erase a person's identity by hacking. There is still too much paper documentation in the world, and in 1995 there were more of them. <br /> <br /> Computer pros should not see this movie either. I mean, a magical virus that can melt your entire PC when you press Escape? You're welcome. And the whole virus, including the cool multimedia effects of your screen (what's it all about?), Can fit on a single 1.44 MB floppy disk? Yes, anyway.
