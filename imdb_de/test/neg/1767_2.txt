First, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion, both films have created and defined the Si-Fi horror genre as we know it today. I've noticed that Lifeforce was often compared to the aliens saga - after watching this movie, I would absolutely disagree. There are some special effects with the alien vampires, and the plot may have been acceptable. I just can not pass a naked space vampire who is absolutely absurd (though she looks good). Add some bad British acting and it's pretty much over. Most of the film is in London or somewhere in England. After the first 20 minutes, you lose the settings for space and the hope for real sir-fang horror action and suspense
