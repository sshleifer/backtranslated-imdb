This is one of the most miserable, predictable and malfunctioning movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been so bad, I've never seen anyone less convincing on screen. I laughed at him the whole way. Then there's this romantic relationship between him and the gorgeous Rene Russo, which was even more miserable than the one between Mr. Connery and Mrs. Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. What is not to like about this movie? I ask: what should I like about it? And the answer is John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best villain of the movie (he even saved Con Air, you know). But that's it. <br /> <br /> This movie is In the Line of Fire, but "Bodyguard 2: the rip-off" seems to be a fitting title. Watch only if you are a John Malkovich fan. Otherwise avoid it at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
