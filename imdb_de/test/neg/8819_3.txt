This early film by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") did not really pump my noses. In fact, it really annoyed me. It's a theatrical troupe that sails to a funeral island made up of dead criminals on which they want to summon evil forces and revive some corpses ... The leader of their group, a conceited blackmagic enthusiast and possibly homosexual, seeks Satan's help in the revival of an exhumed corpse that fails so they bring the corpse to the nearby, abandoned caretaker house and play with it ... Nothing interesting happens until the last 15 minutes when the undead finally spring up their graves and go to the Creator. The make-up effects are fine, the Gore is VERY minimal (PG rating) and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way too much, which really annoyed me. I guess a group of terrible actors arguing for an hour should amount to a "comedic" status, but I found no humor in it at all. The whole concept is just ridiculous - how those kids are willing to rummage around with a dead body for as long as they want. The characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just boring ... do not waste your time with it ...
