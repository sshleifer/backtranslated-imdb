This film tries to make the success of the Richard Curtis films, especially "Love Actually" - a series of different scenes that follow the love lives of different couples. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea that is badly executed. The script tries to be a bit too smart and just does not resonate. Most of the acting is stilted, which is more a reflection of the director than the actor. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on the plane) was called "Scenes from a Park," which is a fitting title because not all scenes were "sexual in nature". <br /> <br /> I was so looking forward to this movie, but in the end it is disappointing. Do not bother.
