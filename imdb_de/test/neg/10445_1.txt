a really horrible movie about a 30 meter long shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad action even a confusing end to a complete. Half a time in my view, I thought it was a TV movie, but then I saw that I could not imagine paying to see that amount of crap. Please avoid this movie at all costs. Even if you liked jaws, which I did on average, you will not see it, even if you are interested in paleontology. You also do not see it if you like stupid movies with stupid actors and not, I repeat, DO NOT bother your mind with that ridiculous apology for a sci-fi animal thriller, some people gave it ten shouts were not
