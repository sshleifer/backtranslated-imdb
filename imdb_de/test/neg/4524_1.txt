What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> As a diehard fan of the original series (with Don Adams), I was really looking forward to it. Poor fool me. This is stupider and brain dead than the butt of a monkey. <br /> <br /> To say it was bad would be a heavy understatement. It is / was the worst movie (well the first 30 minutes) that I have seen for a long time. I could not stand longer than the first half hour and preferred to dismember my hard drive. <br /> <br /> I can not tolerate bad ... bad is OK, sometimes sweet. BUT with the invented Hollywood crap (and that must be the worst for many years) I will not say. This film is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five year old daughter could have written better - and she is not even awkward !!! I'm really tempted to look at the rest, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making pizza dough and watching him rise. What a sad disappointment. No ... I left! What a dizziness! As Mel Brookes once said; "Piece of shirt!"
