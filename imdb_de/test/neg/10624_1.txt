Okay, it's a movie for kids, and it's not a movie adults will enjoy too. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of which have gaps in the story. For example, the boy needs a computer to get his father back to normal, and he does not have the money. So, he asks his father for the dough? No, he STEALS and gets caught. Children, if I ever become invisible, I pay your permission, ok? While this child is at the police station (undoubtedly accused of a criminal offense), his beautiful blond teacher comes in and announces who he is and where he works POLICEMENTS! To make matters worse, they sit down instead of taking a short break in the parking garage of the police station and laugh at their successes. You know, I hate to vote, but the kid stole something and has to face the consequences, but maybe it's a punishment enough to be in this movie. You avoid it!
