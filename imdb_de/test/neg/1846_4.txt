Anyone who has written the script for this film has apparently never read books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biography, from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual mistakes, but it would go on for pages. All in all, I think Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who can only be portrayed by themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be angry at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the film seems to me sloppy.
