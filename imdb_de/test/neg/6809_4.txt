Dustin Hoffman's debut is not as bad as it supposedly is; A Spanish-Italian co-production that was filmed in Italy with the director under the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!). The film is inconsistent, but generally distracting, and deals with a multitude of dodgy characters in search of one of gangster Cesar Romero (who, although he was billed third - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence ever first rolled!). Hoffman's performance is obviously not as nuanced as in later films, but manages to avoid embarrassment by playing what is basically a gracious Kluzzer - an accident-prone American treasurer of Sicilian descent (called Puzzu, whom no one is capable of seems to get right!), who was sent by his company to retrieve the money and tell him to remain "unobtrusive" but instead get in trouble forever - even though he's surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot, the crooks thwarted and the girl wins (Martinelli as Romero's daughter who is wasted here) !! <br /> <br /> However, the best moments of the film are offered by the passionate gangster Riccardo Garrone: Apart from his hard-core personality and the funny handling of dialects, he is accompanied by a trio of nitwits, which is more than a hindrance to fulfillment his different plans! Given the history of playing in Rome, it is also strange that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (no doubt a necessity of the co-production agreement)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've missed Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - a few times (I think, mainly because Leonard Maltin rates it only 1/2) in his "Movies & Video Guide "... but then MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); With Pietro Germi, the director and co-star of the juicy Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of this film are certainly more respectable and I really hope that he soon reappears on Italian television ...
