I have little to add here to the bulls-eye commentary from bowlofsoul23. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and living in Rio de Janeiro, in a neighborhood just a few miles from the Vigário Geral favela featured in the film), he comments on the US-funded "Favela Rising" here IMDb. I have mixed feelings. Firstly, it is good that the terrible situation of Brazilian favelas is receiving more attention from filmmakers and media from both Brazil and abroad, as local governments have long since given up. On the other hand, it is incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" turns out to be a missed opportunity to educate non-Brazilian audiences on this issue, as first-time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who come from the US and are understandable), newbies In the matter), the biography of AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sá glamorous canonization in this superficial, one-sided, under-researched and misleading documentation. Good intentions, kinky results. "Favela Rising" looks like a television ad, flat as a prime time TV interview and biased as a promotional video. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" feels uncomfortably wrong for a Brazilian viewer and not just because of his hype visual treatment of a bleak reality and his misguided sentimental happy ending. "City of God" is an obvious reference here, with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen for no apparent reason other than "hype." "Favela Rising" is supposed to be a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sá, but be careful: if you see the scenes shot in Favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio coast, you might as well be warned that Vigário Geral (the house) of AfroReggae and Anderson) is located in an area of ​​Rio, far away from EVERY beach. Strange choice of place, to say the least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably confusing to non-Brazilians, who will not know many of those interviewed (and the movie does not tell them either). and wait until the final credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are NOT from the AfroReggae band (though you'll be suspicious when you start listening to Pink Martini, of all people!). You also do not know that important issues just go unmentioned: why does the film express the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners who provide them with substantial financial and logistical support, such as the Rio City Hall, private Brazilian companies, multinational record companies and international NGOs without which AfroReggae could not even exist? Why not make it clear that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars and that its inhabitants are still living in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and police? Why not make it clear that many archive footage showing police violence and corruption did NOT take place in Vigário Geral? HOW and WHY did the boy Richard Murilo finally come to AfroReggae? WHY about freaking earth, he was not interviewed again at the end of the film? <br /> <br /> As far as Anderson himself is concerned, the film leaves the viewer with many loose ends: What about Anderson? "two" mothers? Is the baby he holds in his arms his son? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé woman appear on the beach when Anderson's "miraculous" recovery after the accident is mentioned in the films? Is he a Candomblé fanatic? Why should not he declare the contradiction of founding a group that fights drugs while praising Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a proud movement for Favelas blacks, why are the girls in the AfroReggae band limited to prey routines? No, you will not receive any answers to these questions. <br /> <br /> Instead, the filmmakers are keen to turn Anderson Sá into a mix of pop star, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ the last image of the statue of the Redeemer of Christ on the hill Corcovado, immediately after seeing Anderson on wondrous Way after his surgery showed. And that's the worst thing the filmmakers could do with Anderson and his cause: make it a special CHOSEN (when they show their surgical scar, you're ready to believe it's a sign of God). <br /> <br /> Because what's special about Anderson - the most common man you could ever meet - is that he did not help change his environment, but copying and fitting winning projects (like the Olodum Movement in Bahia, etc.) to his own community, with strong support from friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, business people and the media. If you do not speak fluently Portuguese, you probably will not realize that Anderson is not very smart or articulate (unlike his ingenious partner, José Junior), no matter how talented he is as a singer, lyricist, or musician. But his "vulgarity" may have been the true "inspiring" core of the film: to show that EVERYONE can truly make a significant contribution to his community with idealism, perseverance and constant support, he does not have to be incarnate. Because what really counts is the movement - AfroReggae - and not the type. Do not we have enough of the personality cult? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising" you probably will not know much more about the favelas of Rio than you did when you came in. You will only see what some of them look like.
