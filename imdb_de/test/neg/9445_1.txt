I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I can not believe I wasted $ 10 on blockbusters. This movie should be burned and anyone who has ever thought of it has problems. Who actually spent money on this movie was insane = D This movie has terrible actors and some scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie does not make sense. Even the part where these "men" come to the diner (Department of National Securities) was the worst part of the movie. How dare they say Frank Sinatra's name in vain? And what about these glasses? If the man and the girl are in the car and "drinking" water, you can absolutely say she does not even drink! And what about the crazy dinner guy? And everyone knows that you do not stab tires, you cut them.
