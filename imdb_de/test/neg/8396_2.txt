Immediately after seeing this movie, I logged in here and felt it was so horrible that at least its ratings could be entertaining. But all the wrongdoers seem to like it somehow. And since I want the work to be done right ... <br /> <br /> From the opening shot, the film shows its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing a completely unobtrusive image of an irrelevant bridge for a long time , long time. Then it's time for slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little bit cool, but then adds a touch of excitement, superimposed on the most repulsive soundtrack song I've ever heard. A girl screams in whispered French about what sounds like plywood boards beating together. Anyone who has decided to be there has never ridden a skateboard, I guarantee that. It seemed to be there to test the limits of patience of the audience. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie runs about 50 percent in slow motion. Do you know what's worse than an unlimited slow motion? An unfortunate slow motion shot of * nothing happens. * Here a man walks along a path. Here is a man. Here a man looks around. Here a guy looks at another guy. After a while, I started watching the movie at twice the speed, so the movie was always shut down when people appeared on the screen and engaged in dialogue, which was rare. Amazingly, I slowed down the movie once to find out what a girl was saying, just to see the camera show it, but it sounded another terrible, terrible song, and her actual voice was inaudible. This reminds me some great advice I once heard about writing. If you have nothing to say, do not use fancy tricks to pretend that you are. Get back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, like the slow motion and the strange lighting and lenses as well as the freaky music, are what the lack of content looks and sounds like. Many people seem to have bought it, and they are aware of emotional gravity and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting this onto a movie that did not involve any of the work.
