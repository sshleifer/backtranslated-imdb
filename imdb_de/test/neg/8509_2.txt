If you have not read Tolkien's masterpiece; Get ready for perhaps the best movie experience ever! But if you did ... After reading the books many times over many years, I loved the characters and the story and I feel that I know them very well. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton, and the Character Gallery. For me, the movie was a disappointment. Why? It determines the appearance of the characters (inevitably), changes events, removes important plot strands, does not remove such important storylines. Big chunks of what makes the Lord of the Rings what he is are simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects can not do Tolkien's (and your own) imagination. Peter Jackson made a sincere attempt to make the impossible possible, and I do not think anyone else could have done better! But the fact remains, I'm sorry to have seen the movie. The next time I read The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will leap forward, not mine.
