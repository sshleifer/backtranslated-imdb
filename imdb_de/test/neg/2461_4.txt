I think that's about as much a movie as a superficial director like Joel Schumacher could. A group of medical students has to die for a few minutes; In reviving, they discover that their sins have somehow or somehow manifested themselves. Since some of the characters are visited by the dead and some are only persecuted by their guilty conscience, it is not clear what the connection is. Why the students regard their experiment as a kind of big journey that will make them famous is a mystery, since the results are completely unprovable and, as the film has repeatedly mentioned, been documented many times. Still, it's nice to see Schumacher training for his train wrecks in Batman with some of the old neon paint and colored light bulbs. And William Baldwin is a plank.
