Well, it's been ten years since this movie was released, and the sands of time have not improved it a bit. Once again, like the other comments, the Australian filmmakers should have a bit more drama than middle-class Australians who drive around in beautiful places with their motorcycles with not much in dialogue. Middle class is neither funny nor rich. There is also a mishmash of plaster. Why does a young woman marry a man old enough to be her father? It's a shame about this movie, it looks like a wonderful place to go on vacation. Anyway, it's an hour and thirty minutes of my life, I'll never be able to come back. Life too short to see this movie.
