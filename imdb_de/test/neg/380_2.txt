This one is like a previous film from 1987 "Masters of the Universe", based on the cartoon "He-man". Basically you have a great old world, and for some reason, almost all the actions of the movie have to take place on modern Earth. Well, I think it's not that modern now, and it's now an old world of strangeness and an abyss of good times. Well, I think I can understand why they have housed almost the entire movie in this and that movie these days. To save money on costumes and sets. It's much easier to comprehend what's going on in the present than a strange world like Eternia's in He-man or an ancient world of cults and strange pyramids, victims and alien creatures hugging you to death. This movie is unforgettable and not very entertaining. Her first hint that it will not be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is there. The only thing that has to offer him are the animals, which are not as prevalent in this animal as in the last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad that he is in this condition. The guy was a pretty good actor who had limited himself to doing a sequel to a movie that really did not need one, and even if it was five years late.
