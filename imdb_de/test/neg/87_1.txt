I can not believe that people rated this movie on this page with good grades. The writing is unbelievably bad as people come in at just the right time and show exactly what the heroine is doing to escape. (Do not you just hate it when that happens?). And the spectacle is so very, very bad, that you might get a splinter in your eye from the whole scene chewed on to call for help rather than scream when she was brave enough to shatter windows just a moment ago yelling at these kids. <br /> <br /> She is finally free and alone in the house. Your chance to seek help, what will she do then? Walk around the house and lie down. She is in the basement, locked up. So what is she doing? Take a nap Come on! The biggest part of the movie is that the nut wanders away and thinks she's sitting there and slumbering when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the author is too bored to really write an action, why should we be careful? I think the key here is that it was originally a piece for the radio, so they filled up with the heroine who just slipped around instead of pretending to be a paper-teller and actually writing some action is terrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely implausible, terribly written and almost comical. Beware of this movie at any price!
