I lost almost all hope for Nickelodeon after seeing their latest hit, The Naked Brothers Band and ICarly. If you have not noticed yet, ICarly is now the # 1 Tween-sitcom on TV! After hearing that, I decided to watch a few episodes to see what this hype was all about! I have a word to describe this show in general ... "EFFORTLESS !!!" I can not believe that DAN SCHNEIDER GOES THESE LOW AND MAKES THIS CRAPPY SOMETHING !!! IT IS TERRIBLE !!! Let me tell you the details ... <br /> <br /> The ICarly cast begins with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Unfortunately, Carly does not really have such a personality in the episodes! I think she should be the average girl on the show (because a lot of people have an army veteran for a dad, an artist for a brother, and a popular teen web show that's been stocked with thousands of dollars of gear!). and best of all to say Miranda: she is pathetic !!! It sounds like a 3 year old girl with Tourette syndrome on a high half! <br /> <br /> Next we have Sam Puckett (good God, where do you get those names from!), played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is the CO-HOST of Carly's web show! (Wait a minute, when Sam is hosting the show with Carly, the show should not be "ICarly and Sam?" Hot, I bet Sam feels like she's been torn down!) Sam is supposed to be the tyrant in the cast! (Yes, because EVERY GIRL wears a pair of tight-fitting shirts and pants with blond hair extensions!) She too should be a tomboy. I would find that a bit funny, but it's their clichés that do it all !!! The word "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" is used far too often !!! GIVE THIS GIRL A WRITING !!!! and give her a coffee, do not get me wrong. Jennette's acting is okay, but during the half of the episodes she looks like she's ready to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Next we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is the technical producer for the show of Carly and Sam! There's not much to say about Freddie except that he's a techno freak and loves Carly, which never works. HERE WE GO WITH THE Clichés !!! Does not it stop !!!? Nathan's acting is okay too, but sometimes seems to be overkill! He is too boring !!! <br /> <br /> Finally we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Let me make that perfectly clear. IF IT WERE NOT FOR HIM, THIS DIRT CLUSTER WOULD BE A SHOW MUD !!! Spencer keeps the show alive! Spencer is the older brother of Carly! If you had a little 5-year-old boy who was both high on caffeine and constipated, you would sum up that character! Spencer also earns money as an artist! (Hmmm ... I'm wondering ...) You'd think a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yes, I love sarcasm! HIS ART IS FAST MUCH LESS MIST !!!! I mean, what kind of sculpture name is "MERRY SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT!!? THAT'S TOO MUCH CREATIVITY THAN HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH ON DROGS !!!! IT IS STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> THE PLOT SETTINGS AND MORALS ARE SUCCESSFUL BAGS FROM POOP !!!! These shows now tell kids that stealing, lying and an asshole is a good thing for your parents !!! IF THESE ARE THE CHILDREN OF EVIL CRAPPY, SHOWING THEM THAT THESE DAYS ARE DIFFERENT TO KIDS, THEN I WANT NO PARTICIPATION IN THE OBSERVATION OF ANY OF YOU !!!! THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE CRAP I've ever seen on TV! BAR NO !!! NICKELODEON, "I'm with you !!!!" END OF THE STORY!!!! 1.10
