I saw this at the Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and left the cinema halfway through this "movie" (with a bunch of other people), so maybe I'm not the one to comment on it, but I think "SC" is reason enough , to do that. S.C. is another movie. People who need a coherent narrative, characters or line of action will find no information in it. It should be an experimental film that relies on the power of images. But these pictures have no power. They are so forced to intentionally exploit people, so they have nothing else to say. The hustle and bustle of the off-teller is just boring, the look is cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that's the only thing, why is that important? Hussein's film wants to shock and encourage thought - instead, it's boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no more creativity in breaking taboos - especially not when things are done as badly as in "S.C.". I would suggest that director Hussein should go to either a psychiatrist or a film school before he confuses crap for art again. Note: I never want a baby to be cut again during birth.
