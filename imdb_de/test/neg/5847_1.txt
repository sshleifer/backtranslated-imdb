Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. You meet Robert Redford and he is really rich. He likes Demi, and since he is a gambling man, he makes the couple a "naughty proposition": a million dollars for a night with the movie's little woman, because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course, Demi will accept the offer. If not, there is no first half of the movie. Of course, this will affect the marriage of Demi and Woody. If not, there is no second half of the movie. And of course everything will be fine when the credits roll. If not, there is no happy ending for the cash register. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing you can say about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest ... The script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligible. I suspect Redford, Moore, and Harrelson blush and change the subject each time the movie is mentioned. Do them - and especially yourself - a favor. Unless someone offers you a million ... Miss It! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
