This is a glossy soft porn. a boring soap opera that focuses on one thing: sex. They actually made the sex boring, sad to say, because I disagree with looking at it by chance and telling me what the plot was. What that is is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off her great body, and for Mickey Rourke, a lot to smile about. That's it. Rourke's complacency is so bad that it gets sick, and Bassinger looks cheap, despite the great figure, as if he were beautiful. No character development and no action - that can not be compensated. Let's face it, this movie was created for the sole purpose of captivating male viewers. In this regard, it has probably succeeded. If I remember correctly, that's why I saw it as a fan of Bassinger's appearance, but I actually expected a story, too, porn is just fooling myself.
