As a fan of the series, I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well, I got my answer. Some movies should never be done. Why do we call it a remake of the series, when the only similarities are that there are three main characters? The Pete character in the series was not a crying little baby, as shown in the movie. The only good thing about this movie besides the music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. What about this dance scene ??? The only reason I did not leave this movie was because it was so bad it became funny. Maybe that was the plan! It's really bad when a cheap TV show from the '60s is better than a $ 20 million movie for the' 90s. El Mariachi costs only $ 7,000 and is a much better movie. Do not even waste your money on tape, it's not even worth renting.
