I've always said that the original form can not be beat: the comics. I proved right again. Like all other Asterix-series footage, this was not impressive. The creators of this movie do not know that what makes all other comic-turned-movies (x-men, superman, etc.) successful is that they all deviate from the original comic versions and make them more observable. The film agreed, in the sense that it was a cross between two Asterix books. Asterix and the Great Crossing & Asterix and the Normans. Uncharacteristic for the Asterix series (except Asterix and the secret weapon), a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced. In the end, a childishly immature plot emerged. The funny parts were very rare. All in all a total waste of time and money, if you observe this, let alone in the theaters, even at home.
