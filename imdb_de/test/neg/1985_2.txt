I bought this movie in spite of the "outdated" review on DVD and that was idiotic ... This review was absolutely correct and I have not seen a worse "erotic" movie in my long life! Although it was filmed nicely and had an interesting environment plus a nice cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica (c) movies are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft, delicious aspect), with probably less than 100 -fold of which movies budget! The story has no logical connection with the first film or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) element of slavery training, apart from some very strange and sad developments ... Then the male main character - Klaus Kinski - did not look anything like the second master of "O" he tries to play ... And not even the pretty Arielle Dombasle looked delicious in every scene!
