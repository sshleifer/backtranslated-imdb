I just had the misfortune to see this really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Think of this scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow panning of this woman. Now take out the pan, add breathable and unshaven men, and you have what the entire two and a half hours of humanity were. The inspector is a real jerk, not even a jerk, a weak, slow, monotonous trick. How they ever solved a crime goes beyond me. <br /> <br /> Mandatory sex scenes are awesome and rewarding. <br /> <br /> Any villain of the play (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl) is signposted very early and no surprise, unless you are similarly weakly dressed. <br /> <br /> Uninspiring camera work. <br /> <br /> The director said it was the job of the audience to even offer something interpretation of the procedure. I suppose he also meant to provide a dialogue of his own (there is everything else - which adds to the boredom), imaginative camera work (just static footage, the complete beauty of the landscape in which the film is filmed strip off) and the plot! <br /> <br /> Really awful. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10 points.
