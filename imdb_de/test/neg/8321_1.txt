Are we serious ??? I mean, wow ... just wow. I think I saw this streak in an old issue of the War Journal. This is pathetic, the originality is completely dead. Instead of trying to formulate a new idea, we get a mild repetition of an old plotting line, and to "switch" it, we simply change the gender or race of the original character idiotic and all should be tired of seeing it ... but i think that's just kidding and will most likely fall on deaf ears if another shit hits the loo of water like the best western ever since 3:10 to yuma ... ( wait for that) ... 3:10 to Yuma! Thanks to Hollywood for killing the movie as an art form and turning it into a commercial barrel of neo-pop junk and blatant delays ... wonderful !!!
