I wish I could tell you that this movie is as exciting as its theories. But I can not. Another species could have come and mutated while I was waiting for an action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you do not know the crazy theories, you might almost mistake him for a stamp collector. The filmmakers have made Darwin a fool who does him a disservice. Even if he lost his mind because of his tireless theory, it was not interesting to watch him. Maybe great thinkers are stupid people? I do not know what I was expecting: an eccentric forehead with wild hair and eyes that supported his love of all things monkey, the sheen of madness being dragged by a contracted forehead? A long-haired hermit babbling with animals? A mind-blowing madman whose eyes are lit like landmarks? That would have been great. These are the films for Scorsese's sake. <br /> <br /> But that did not happen. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe. Only Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtle as the Breath School of Method Acting. I can imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a maddening train. Why did this film just play - chuck chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.
