Before I start, let me take something from my chest: I'm a big fan of John Eyres' first movie PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-grade cross by THE TERMINATOR & THE HARD, is not the work of a cinematic genius, but an extremely entertaining action movie that has become a cult hit (with two sequels and a spin-off). <Judge and Jury begin with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called "Bloody Shootout" (what looks like a bad name for a murder rage? Meeker) kills three people while trying to to rob a supermarket) and is led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene in which Meeker talks to the priest to live for sex but to meet his only true love (who was killed during the shooting) and to express his revenge for the person who killed her? Michael Silvano, a washed-out football star who spent his days practicing his son Alex's football with his high school team (and in the end molested his son's coach). After his execution, Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls "a hamburger without chips") whose sole purpose is to avenge himself, essentially resulting in Silvano's life becoming misery. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out that judges and jury are not a real horror movie. It's a supernatural action movie in which Meeker chases after Silvano. He uses his ability to change shape (akin to David Keith as the magnet of an Elvis imitator, a French chef (with an accent like his mustache) and a drag queen (a clown and a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive shots and leads to inviolability (though Martin Kove is not prevented from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle) to repay Silvano for the murder of Meeker's wife. <br /> Director John Eyres shines Not interested in characterization but focusing solely on action scenes that the movie is plentiful in, but this is the main flaw of the film, since nothing connects the action scenes, the acting is surprisingly good and Keith performs the best , supported by Kove, and Paul Koslo, who plays the washed-up policeman pretty well Kelly Perine is annoying as the taxi driver who tries for example u help, but the situation worsens.
