Before I start, I have to tell you that I love passionate horror movies. LOVE HER! I have seen thousands and rarely does one come along whom I do not like. I really forgive the horror genre. One of the biggest lines in film history is in the movie "Ed Wood", in which Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) breaks out and shouts at overly critical producers after commenting on the cheap sets of "Plan 9" and the continuity problems "You don" , Do not know anything! Have you never heard of 'Suspending Unbelief' ?! "Well, I'm trying to bring this" suspension of unbelief "into any horror movie I see, and it usually works. Unfortunately, Cheerleader Massacre's performance did not work. <br /> <br /> Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you'll notice about this "movie" is that it is shot on video and has this lousy handheld digital camera style. The camera work and the quality are so bad that day soaps seem stunning in comparison. In fact, Troma and Full Moon video releases look good. And that is bad. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski. This "filmmaker" probably considers himself a chip from the old Corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. Roger Corman shot fast, furious and under budget, but could deliver a tight original film. Although Wynorski delivers a cheap movie, he cheats on his viewers (and maybe other artists as well) by stealing entire pieces of James Homer's "Humanoids From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" and improperly tearing them into the cheerleading massacre. At the back of boxing style and at the beginning of the credits, the musical sound is falsely attributed to Dan Savio (an addition to Wynorski's "Deathstalker II"). You'll also notice how cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to film and back, while Wynorski captures scenes from "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From the Deep". Wynorski used this delusion fourteen years ago in his terrible version of "Not of This Earth." Strike Three: <br /> <br /> While the cheerleader massacre is doing I have some nudity (40 year olds playing teenagers and the grossest fake boobs I've ever seen in a horror movie, ugh), the murders are relatively bloodless. What the hell is that? The film is titled Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen killings do not lead to a massacre in my opinion. It does not even make a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The "movie" story is fair enough - an invisible killer pulls a vanload of cheerleaders (old girls playing teenagers) until the van runs out of gas and the "girls" are forced to to stay in a secluded, two-story house in the mountains. I will not ruin the end for you, but this is one of those "movies" in which the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer. Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if shot in the movie, directed by Joseph Zito and with special effects by Tom Savini. Instead, it is an effectless travesty created by Jim Wynorski. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I beg you, do not buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, more of this talentless video waste will be produced. Instead rent "The Prowler", "The Last House at Dead End", "Delirium" or "The Burning". You will not regret it.
