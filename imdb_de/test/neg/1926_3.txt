To be honest, it has been a few years since I saw the bile that prescribed the celluloid "Here on Earth". Forgive me if my memory of the film is a bit sketchy. I stick with the main points that plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer. Scene One: Chris Klein, after being thrown out of preschool (because he looks like a seventeen year old - yes, very believably), gives what I suspect is his valedictorian speech ... to a field. Let me repeat that for you - a field. I think we should be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he does not express. Klein has the delivery and the facial expression of a cardboard cutout. He's a decent-looking piece of cardboard, but not much anymore. <br /> <br /> Scene Two: After some joyous and pyromaniac teenagers, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett tore something to the local restaurant that forced him to rebuild. Of course. For who better to help with the construction than any random idiot who has fallen into it / burned it at all. Better yet, let's say that a random jerk came in on Josh Hartnett's girl, Miss Sobeski, the girl he wished for ... her equally wooden liner delivery? <br /> <br /> Scene 3: Chris Klein's character goes out with Leelee Sobeski and decides to name her various body parts to the states on the East Coast. My soul is crying. How can this scenario go really well? Surely you have to alienate millions of people if you suspect that their home corresponds to Miss Sobeskis more ... er ... female areas. Second, naming her breasts in New York and New Jersey causes some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is actually unusually disproportionate. Scene 4: Leelee is running. She falls down. That gives her ... knee cancer. "We always knew it could come back," says her father (?). Law. Knee cancer from stumbling. Maybe I missed something. As I said, it was a few years ago. I certainly missed something. I have not For the love of God, please tell me that the girl does not get sick of KNEE cancer. <br /> <br /> That cry you just heard was that my soul died.
