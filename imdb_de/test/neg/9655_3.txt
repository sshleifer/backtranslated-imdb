This movie is certainly a strange movie, to say the least. The basic plot consists of 3 old business partners who invite two strangers to their home to return a lost $ 10 wallet. The two who show up fall in love. The three elderly businessmen die and return as ghosts to help the two younger guests. Okay, that may make sense, but then we have 3 old men who seem to have some living bread ... a bit weird here ... Harry Carey plays his part off the base sting. I really mean, decide that I can handle it. Then there's Richard Carlson, who plays James Houston from Texas ... hmmmmm, he sounds a lot more like a southern gentleman from Kentucky than a person from Texas. This is not even close. Then we take the three ghosts who have a better chance of helping the New Orleans Saints win an off-game than actually helping you are even in the movie beyond any knowledge. Stupid movie in which a cast of characters seems completely atypical .. You can avoid this ..
