Unfortunately, I could not contradict the last comments. Frankly, I thought that would be worse than Carry on Columbus, enough said. Last movie for the usually brilliant Charles Hartrey, who was out of the ordinary as the humor in the buses moved to the hilarious level, whose films were filmed at the same time character like a flirting girlfriend of your mother who still thinks she is I'm eighteen, on holiday with another Scotsman, Rabc Nesbit is not. The series was miraculously rumbling with Duffers like Carry on Behind and Carry on England. Carry on, Dick was not bad, but really with this movie the end of the series was almost a pity, because up to this movie I can not think of a bad movie before that?
