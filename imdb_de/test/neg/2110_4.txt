So I was energetic during my queues on a plane weekend, after the movie we longed for something more. Why not snakes in a train? How bad could it be that his snakes are likely to kill people on trains? The snakes should be rattlers. At first, I and my buddy had thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy rattling sound clip. In fact, we've completely gone through the whole thing to turn it off (we're too lazy to go over and hit the eject). Next we knew we did not know what the hell was going on, but in the end, something amazingly funny happens. It's one of those ends where you rewind a few times just to express laughter because you've suffered so long. <br /> <br /> An "8" last 10 minutes, rest of the movie a 2.
