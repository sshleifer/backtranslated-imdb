I AM NOT LYNNE BATES MY NAME IS RITICHIE, BUT LYNNE IS MY MOMMY. I USE YOUR ACCOUNT! Barney and Friends (or Barney, as it's called here in England) is the craziest show ever. I never really liked it, it was about 3 or 4 years old when I was born, so it was nothing new. My friend, however, loved this dildo of a show. I was about 6 years old and I was in his house once, and he had a Barney VHS cassette on the TV. I turned off the power and he burst into tears. GROW A TALKING DINOSAUR FOR THE CHRISTIAN SAKE! Anyway, I saw the Barney movie on TV the same year, and I loved it. I got the VHS from it a few months later and I used the tape. I loved it so much! I gave away this band a few years ago, but I loved it back then. But the show! My God, the show was bad! Several children fell victim to pedophiles because they have so-called entertainment! Never again, never again! It's not just me who hates Barney! 85% of all comments on this show are bad. Just look at the number of You Tube Poops and videos that make Barney mess. And do not start with Blow Job BJ! Why the hell would the producers dare to call such a sexual name! Another subliminal message in a children's show! And the baby Bop is the worst since Osama Bin Laden! All in all, I give Barney and Friends MINUS 1000 OFF 10!
