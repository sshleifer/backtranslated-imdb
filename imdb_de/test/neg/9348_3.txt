Impressive. The story was incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie should be a comedic genre. But even nonsense should at least make a vague sense. <br /> <br /> Water has become an incredibly rare substance. <br /> <br /> Well, that's weird considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the richest substances in the universe. And pretty easy to do. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voila, water. Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or something similar should have been used as a plotter, something the pirates would pursue afterward. Water as a plot was just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" seemed tedious, thoughtful and forced. The comedy in the TV series "Red Dwarf" was worked hard and invented and forced, but it was really amusing. Instead, I wanted to say, "Ha ha, that was so funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> Sigh ... all the money is in sets, costumes, actors ... What a a waste ... <br /> <br /> Instead of just whimpering and moaning and complaining about his lameness, I recommend doing it better: 1) Use a credible plotter. 2) Get rid of the "comedy". None of the actors was really good at it. The movie would work better as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br /> The authors' obvious intention was to make a spoof comedy, but they did not quite finish it. It is unlikely that I will ever look at it again. It's too much hacker job.
