This is a very strange movie, with a no-name cast and almost nothing on the web. It uses an approach familiar to those who have watched creepshow fans by introducing a trilogy of so-called "horror" shorts and linking them into a connecting narrative of the people involved in the segments coming from a bus climb. There is a narrator who rattles about relationships, but his conversation adds nothing to the mix and only adds to the confusion. As for the stories, well ... I swear, I have no idea why this film received a British certificate of 18, which would bring it into line with Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing is scary even remotely. There is no thrill, sex, nudity or even an insult to bring things to life. This is the kind of thing you could post on children's television, and nobody would ever eyebrow. I can only imagine that if it had received the rating it really deserved (a PG), no serious horror fanfare would be seen, so the distributor probably beat the BBFC until it waned. Anyway, here are the three stories summarized: 1. A man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car until he alienates his fiancee. 2. A man living in a dirty apartment understandably flipped out when a living organism evolved from his six-month-old tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks she found the perfect man through a computer dating service. That is, until he starts acting weird. And there you have it. Some of them are quite amusing because of their fancy rooms (my favorite is number 2), but one feels they should be a) scary and b) morality games, unfortunately they are unhappy on both counts. In summary, this film is an obscure curiosity .. for very good reasons.
