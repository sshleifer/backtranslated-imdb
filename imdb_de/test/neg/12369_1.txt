San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is gone, your camera gear is older and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Tod St Bridges of Different Strokes. There are probably ways to play at least one movie. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. <br /> <br /> At first, most of the cast seems to have been selected to make Bridges and Estevez look like they're the Oscars. How hard is it really to play a priest or a presumptuous mother? In a city the size of San Francisco, there are certainly some professional actors willing to work for a few euros and a video credit. Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger, who play these roles, clearly have other talents like landscape gardeners or waitresses. They should be fine tuned. Joe Rosete as a killer (yes, the serial killer is simply referred to as "The Killer") is pretty awful in a psychologically ill way as well, but I'm almost ready to give him the benefit of the doubt since his character is with Nullart A boring, almost ridiculous serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as the ABC family movie of the week, with no nudity or violence of which one could speak, and the R rating clearly refers to the stimulation of adults.This movement meanders like an 85-year-old woman driving around in a pair of rotating sunglasses and turning on her turn signal.The only occasional horror comes from Estevez 'Face with a look that looks like his jaw has been removed. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a great movie, a I had rented San Franpyscho, but I do not expect the numbing boredom either.
