Just when I thought that nothing could be as offensive and / or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this dump. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be prosecuted for smuggling this script into public space. The actors must be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime before the eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> This disclaimer: "For dramatic effects, we have assumed poetic license with certain facts" or such inadequate statement to fully prepare you for the absolutely disgusting recast of a bible story for which no drama was needed. What you have added was enough to your I.Q. There are three points for every five minutes of playtime. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license" makes the characters so bizarre that you only recognize the names of a few and of course the ark. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot both live in Sodom. Maybe Abram was on a ski tour in Switzerland. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and as she turns to a column of salt, Lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar. If that's "poetic," I'm a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah, who has now started drinking wine in a crowd that might help to levitate the ark, whines about the hard work of the construction project, he awakens One morning it turned out that God has supplied enough lumber to facilitate its load. At least I believe it was God. It looked like a delivery of 84 Lumber, neatly stacked and bundled. Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent for God ????? Instead of boring you with the loaded cargo, I'll reignite you with the pirate attack account on the Ark. Inappropriate, do you think? This movie is full of offensive nonsense. After an indescribable time on the water, Noah peeks at a pirate ship. And who could be the salty captain? Well, it is of course Lot! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you slaughter an action line, slaughter everything. The piracy attempt is unsuccessful, and the tearing was pathetic, not poetic. I believe that around this sign my nausea prevented me from punishing myself more. An ugly, meaningless, feeble-minded distortion of something that resembles a Bible account. On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is a deliberate abuse of mind. Dull and offensive, you'll be more entertained by reading the yellow pages.
