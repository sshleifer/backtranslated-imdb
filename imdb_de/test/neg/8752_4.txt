I love this movie. Although I rated it as "4", that's because the acting, the plot and the budget were earmarked for the "B" universe before the release of this film. But that's fine! An entertaining movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 From Outer Space": a movie that is so bad that it's great! Without the UFO - alien plot, The Thing the Could does not rely on the supernatural (divination, a buried head looking for his body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell his story. The acting is stilted, the camera looks second class and the settings are limited, but boy! What a movie! This movie is available in stores. If you find a copy, buy it!
