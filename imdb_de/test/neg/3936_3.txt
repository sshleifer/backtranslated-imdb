I happened to see this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston, and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and obscure. French cinema seems to have lost ground these days, and this is a good example of how a colorful script can waste brilliant actors. While some classify the "playfulness" of the screenplay as consistent with the dictates of Euro-Postmodernism, the entire project seems more like a death after the death of the golden years of the Euro Cinema and truly fabulous talents is vaguely remembered by Bunuel, but without the charm or wit.
