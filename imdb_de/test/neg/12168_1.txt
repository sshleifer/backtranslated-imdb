Please - if you have not tried to get through this trash and are considering watching this mini series, do yourself a favor and find other tasks. Brushing your teeth, learning to play the cello, beating your dog - everything you choose will make better use of your time than to look at this garbage. This is not a bad movie from which you can make some giggles - it just sucks in every way. Boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for the animal lovers out there who find my comment insensitive - if your dog could talk, he or she begs for punches rather than suffering from watching this mess.
