Do you know this commercial for mouthwash, where the guy has a mouthful of Listerine or whatever it is, and he really does not try to spit it in the sink? That's a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, though it was really difficult. However, if you hold mouthwash in your mouth, you will have a minty, fresh feeling. This film left a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> The premise is trite enough to have fun. For the first time in over a thousand years, Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all priests who know how to fight and kill these things are long gone. It is up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things, before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise in bad dialogues is completely lost and is not as enthusiastic as the human leads. The best actor is the CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie feels like Van Helsing of a poor man. Checking your brain at the door could lead you through a dull Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
