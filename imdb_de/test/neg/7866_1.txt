If this film were rated on a scale of 1 to 10, a new rating system would have to be created, as it should not even be qualified. The plot of the film (if you can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former agent targeted by a brother of a man he killed while still working for the US government , If that sounds like an interesting scenario, please do not be fooled, as this movie will not deliver what its action-based story suggests. Comedian Chris Rock once said, "When you see an actor, a bad movie that you want to get to send $ 50 to the actor, given that the actor desperately needs to spend money doing such a bad job." After watching this movie, you might want to send Stephen Baldwin $ 100. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin has not dealt with his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run all over Los Angeles to protect his "honeycomb" (wife) from the death of a brother of a man he had previously killed. However, it seems that Baldwin is barely able to jerk anywhere throughout the image. His relaxed performance succeeds in forsaking the tension that the film may have wanted to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who loves watching very bad movies and laughing at their shortcomings, then this movie is for you. But if you're looking for a well-made action thriller, you'd better look elsewhere than rent this movie.
