I was a recognized chess addict and was pleased to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I had hoped to take a deep look at the game and much of what Kasparov had to say. Boy, I was wrong and misguided by a mile. This documentary is similar to many modern documentaries - there is a lot of Flash, but no real substance. After watching, I'm sad to say I felt like wasting my time. The most annoying thing about the documentary is that it does not stay in one place for a decent time. It has the typical MTV-type cut, where the camera shows different pictures and fast sounds of people every five seconds. It is very sad that the film was watered down to the attention span of a ten-year-old child. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is difficult to make a movie about chess, but that does not mean one should make it noticeable. However, Game Over had some interesting ideas. It brought up the idea of ​​whether computers can think like humans or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. That's what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go deep enough with this idea. This film also tries to introduce a bizarre theory. It is attempted to imply to the paranoid that a human being made the movements with the help of the computer. Kasparov had a suspicion in this regard, but to this day there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film, he tries to suggest the bizarre that Anatoly Karpov may have been the man secretly trailing with the help of Deep Blue. Interesting to think about, but I do not know how plausible or realistic it is. I still would not recommend this movie, not even for cheaters.
