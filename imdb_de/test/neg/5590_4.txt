STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a couple in Budapest for business commitments and stay in a luxury hotel. One night they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and invite her to where they end up in a threesome. Everything is fine until David gets some negatives in the mail and he and Tish are finally blackmailed. However, when some individuals involved in the deception are found murdered, things become messy and they are forced to go into the subterranean world of pornography and hardcore bondage to find the woman who holds the key has everything. > While the original movie was about the concept of snuff films, this sequel, direct to DVD, is about the healthier (!!!) theme of threesomes and dirty sex. It's like a porno movie, a cheap bit of tickling with a lot of hot T / A action. If that sounds like a good movie to your mind, you probably like it, but in a porn store you're probably more at home than a video store. This tries to copy the original The film is dark and voyeuristic, but although he does it quite well, he still can not live up to the original. It has an apathetic story with a dubious narrative flow. And compared to Cage Schaech seems to be infinitely durable. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought, it would probably be better than the average of one of those direct DVD sequences that hit the market a lot these days, but have not we seen enough? **
