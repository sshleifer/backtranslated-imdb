Tense and humorless (especially given his rather dubious psychology), but good and snug, this exemplary body-count film underscores the unusually hypnotic presence of Angharad Rees as a young woman who is regularly obsessed by Jack the Ripper's evil gore effects amid the Edwardian character. All this is fairly common for Hammer, but it is treated with much visual elan, although the central relationship between the psychoanalyst Porter and Rees drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.
