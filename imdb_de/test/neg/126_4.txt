It is worth the entertainment value of a rented tenant, especially if you like action movies. Here you'll find the usual chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shots with the 40 grenade launcher and even terrorist-style bombs. All of this is entertaining and competent, but there's nothing that will really blow your mind if you've ever seen your share. <br /> <br /> The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, but this is hardly profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped - the angry veterans, the scared illegal aliens, the crooked policemen, the indifferent government officials, the bitchy, hard women's station leader, the crooked politician, the fat Federal, who looks like he was a Mexican Hollywood movie from the 1940s. Everything is passable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were pretty well done and played pretty well. At the end of the movie, you certainly knew who the good guys were and not. There was an emotional boost as the really bad ones got their righteous deserts. Very simple, but you did not expect Hamlet, did you? The only thing that really bothered me was the constant cuts in VD's daughter during the last fight scene. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.
