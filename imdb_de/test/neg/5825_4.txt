I do not understand the many good reviews here. I found the photography and scenery beautiful and the two main characters appealing, but there's nothing else to recommend this movie. Most annoying are the fake southern accents and the poorly written dialogue. These do not sound like real people to me. While it is refreshing to show men how to explore different forms of sexuality without the usual hallmarks and stereotypical traits, most of the story is without motivation or logic. The only thing that makes a lot of sense is the responsibility that Griffith has over his mentally ill aunt, who was heavily overrated by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more persuasive if the dialogue he spoke with were more natural and his motivations clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a drifter, but his actions, which the film draws to a hasty conclusion, make no sense whatsoever. This movie is worth a look, especially because it has a nice atmosphere, but it is slow and deeply flawed. A serious rewriting and editing could have spared this, as the premise and outline of the story are promising.
