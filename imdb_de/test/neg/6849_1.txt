To really appreciate this movie, you had to be there (acting?) Or be a crew member. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am "Selena" and at the ripe age of 42 I have serious doubts about what we did / did. <br /> <br /> It all started as a kind of "John Waters", a kind of friends who behave badly in bad movies. At some point, the fun was stopped, people who were supposed to be friends, no longer spoke and BAD was worse. <br /> <br /> I regret the bad image I may have projected one size gold spandex pants,) <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the movie is so bad, I would not even see my mother let it be seen. <br /> <br /> To my director, cast and crew I say: <br /> <br /> "Why can not we all get along? <br /> <br /> It's already over twenty Years ago, PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
