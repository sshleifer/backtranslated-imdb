Only desserts was, I must say, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible and even the plot was ridiculous. I gave him a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because I enjoy laughing at agonizing stupid movies. My expectations were not high at first, but it turned out to be a bit more moody than I expected. I thought maybe it was not so bad when it started, but when the name of the contest - The Golden Whisk - came up, I started to change my mind. From there it went downhill. The only thing I liked about this movie, apart from its absurd plot and dialogue, was to giggle. However, since this is a movie about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked everything. I would recommend to watch the cooking channel instead of this movie. You see more food being prepared, and you avoid the miserable lines. However, if you like crazy love stories, which is sometimes fun, then look on.
