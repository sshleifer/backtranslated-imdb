This film looks a bit clunky around the edges, as if it had not been thrown enough by Zaniness than it should have been. But it was the most fun. <br /> <br /> The plot is more than a little absurd, so there should be no expectation of something "real" in your viewing experience. Check your brain at the door. It is not needed and could otherwise be an obstacle. <br /> <br /> I have Clennons performance as a real Dr. Baird really enjoyed it. His role was just right to give Aykroyd's character a protagonist. What a plaster the real Dr. Baird was. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as a buddy of the main character. At first annoying, but ultimately adorable. Type of. So'ne kind. Or at least the use of soap and plenty of water would have been more than helpful. <br /> <br /> Actually worth seeing? If you fancy a parody about the psychiatric profession, you do not know why.
