This film follows in the footsteps of The Riddle for a British cast in a downright horrible movie! Bad CGI effects, bad editing, bad targeting, a cast that I hope has been well paid, as this is a nail in many career coffins. <br /> <br /> at least laughed! <br /> <br /> It was like a particularly long and drawn-out episode of "Torchwood," but without the fake Canadian Ph.D. at camp ... it had the same dramatic music. constantly repeated, in a futile attempt to stir up a certain tension. Oh, humanity!
