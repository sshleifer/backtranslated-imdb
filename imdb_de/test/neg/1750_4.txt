I had the feeling that the film Skammen directed by Ingmar Bergman was very dry. It shows what people will do to survive during a war, and the shame that results from those actions. However, I feel that it was not complete or held the attention. He has never fully entered the plot or deeply into the emotions or reasons of the characters behind their actions. The only thing I noticed in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters Jan and Eve. Many times during the film, only the two main characters were sitting around or doing their daily chores and did not even have a conversation. I understand that this should show the reality of these people, although I believe that there are other ways to show the reality and have it entertaining. I think Ingmar Bergman could film this movie in a more intriguing way.
