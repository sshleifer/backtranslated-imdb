I can not believe they even released such a movie. The only good show came from the water in the movie. This is one of the worst (if not the worst) movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only creepy part of the movie is the bad acting, this movie deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> The storyline, and if you can call it the storyline of the movie, seems like written to a high school kid. Of course you have to wonder if maybe it was better with better actors. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and wait for it to be shown on TV. <br /> <br /> and even then it will be a waste of time.
