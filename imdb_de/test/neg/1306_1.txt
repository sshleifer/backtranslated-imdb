Well, as the headline suggests, this is not the very good movie that I hoped would be him. i thought it would be great with mr fully monty yourself but not tragic. From the beginning, I literally lost interest when two women were making tea, and suddenly she points out that random water is leaking from under the door. The rising water level outside not to notice or at least to hear. I'm sorry that this sounds like a scream, but it really drags my gears and has influenced me. Most of the acting was bad and the story tried to copy almost every clich√© in every catastrophe film, but failed in that sense. CGI was bad, I could do a better job with MS Paint, including directing, and in the end I was not interested in a character at all !!! Do not waste your time, folks, no wonder it was released directly on DVD. Thank you for reading xxx
