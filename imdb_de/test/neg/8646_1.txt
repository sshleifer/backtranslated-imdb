I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case has praised so many great actors, and I asked myself, "Why have not I heard of this movie?" Then I turned the case over and saw the director Lee Tamahori, and so the answer began to explain. <br /> <br /> First, I want to beat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie. Above all, I think I should explain why this movie is so awful. Okay, the script is awful and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I've ever seen at Chazz Palminteri, and I'm surprised he would do such a ridiculous thing. However, undervalued but talented actors need to earn their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional cop as stupid as a C-Movie Mob stoop. Together with the main detective (the ill-steered Nolte), the great but simple Michael Madsen and the late Chris Penn (whose role was completely thrown away with Madsens), he formed an elite squad of detectives from LA to rid the city of gangsters at some point in the late 30's or 40's. The film introduces this team as police officers who will break every law to ensure that those who believe they are above the law do not operate in their city. At the beginning of the film, the cops dig a local restaurant, grab a supposed gangster (William Peterson) and take him to a place where they call the Mulholland Falls. They dump him off one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive, and this is to show how seriously these guys are liberating the city of crime. What ever. This was nothing more than a cheap excuse for using a crappy title to commemorate LA and its famous landmarks. Later, they find the body of Jennifer Connelly and the conspiracy begins. <br /> <br /> Continue in the direction that was nothing less than amateur and babbler! Apart from the fact that the characters were in B-movie quality, the exaggeration of people like Treat Williams, the man who plays the police chief, and the dreadful Daniel Baldwin were just a few highlights that made this film look like Lee Tamhori's first movie. Apart from maybe Melanie Griffith, there is no good performance in the film, some of which claim that she was the worst in the film (she won a Razzie for this film). In the end, it was her character that was not great and she really did not have much to do. <br /> <br /> As with any bad movie, everything starts with writing, and this script was not a gem. The plot is simply formulated on the basis of the setting of the next scene and never takes into account the motivation of the characters. The behavior of the characters was incredible. Policemen who take the law into their own hands are credible under the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case, it seems that these guys can get away with anything, including murder, and never keep an eye on that To throw clean. I think we as viewers should just assume that nobody has seen anything and that people are not asking questions. Everything in the story is predictable and so well fed with the spoon that we understand everything that will happen quite a while before the characters. However, we do not feel smart, but we are angry at how stupid the hero is, even though there are no heroes in this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, the best part of the movie was the great score by David Grusin. From the beginning, they called out CHINATOWN, which quickly faded as I realized how incredible everything was in the movie. It did not surprise me to learn that there were a whopping eleven million at the box office. What I want to say is that it's worth watching this movie. Nick Nolte's acting is like an unsuccessful house dog, and I laughed every time he was serious. With each of the slow motion hits used in the movie, I almost fell to the ground (I think there are three with one during an important combat scene). If you need to use slow motion in the heat of dramatic moments, you obviously have some problems. Therefore, I will recommend this film with my negative criticism only to gain laughter, that is, if you appreciate the good movies like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
