ok, we have a movie that some people call one of the best movies ... but i'm sitting here thinking of hell !, the stories sux {which have no story), the Diolouge is pretty simple, artistically, nothing great! and acting is not real. So if you want to pretend that you're Artie, say you like it, but if you have a real view, say you do not like it or explain why!
