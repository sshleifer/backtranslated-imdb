This movie is essentially a "how-to" of how to become a well-connected pedophile. I am amazed that so many people - especially other gay men - have seen this movie and read the book, and no one has voiced the fact that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in jail and have time for it Child Abuse Poor Peter Johnson Weber took this poor, naive (though incredibly handsome) teenager he found in a midwest high school wrestler training camp into his home and brought thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them head-on to Nudes Johnson's teens. This is not art. It's child abuse. Worse yet, Weber earns a lot of money with it, and poor Johnson will have serious "problems" for the rest of his life. Weber's lascivious love for the boy is downright scary, as well as his quarrels with famous (and not so famous) people he knows as he tries to complete Johnson's "education." Creepy and then just boring. The only redeeming thing I can say about the film is that it is a fascinating study of self-delusion. But I wonder why nobody ever thought about the implications of this on "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson) itself.
