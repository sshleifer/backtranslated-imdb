I seem to be in the minority, but I found "Radio" pretty awful. It seemed to contain almost every clich√© in these types of "heartwarming" films. <br /> <br /> The motivation for the characters who fall in love with radio has never really been explained. We should just accept that everyone loves the radio, except a few bad apples. <br /> <br /> You could see almost every major moment in history from 100 meters away. When the movie wanted you to go "Awww" or pull your handkerchief, I rolled my eyes and wished I'd see "Rudy" instead. Too bad that they did not want to get a better movie to appear.
