"The Cellar" is an unbearably boring and very kid-friendly cheese parade of the 80s directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of the much better movies "Witchboard" and "Night of the Demons"), in which the incredibly untalented Patrick Kilpatrick can be seen allegedly a guy with feelings. The tempo is really slow, the plot feels way too familiar, the monster effects are anything but petrifying, and the movie starts and ends with boring narrative screaming that somehow does not feel attached to the actual theme of the movie. The voice-over keeps chasing wind and creatures riding in the wind, but what the hell, there's no wind in the plot? Like so many horror movies of the 80s, "The Cellar" revolves around cursed Indian landscapes and all too real mythical monsters hidden in cellars and wetlands. Mance Cashen and his family move to a house built on the former Aboriginal residence, but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the script is wasted on explaining the origin of the monster, but I can easily summarize it for you: An ancient Indian witch doctor summoned the creature (who looks like an oversized paper mach√© rat) to destroy the white people who are over him land was streaming but he buried it again because, and I quote, the SOB also kills Indians. Mance's irritating son accidentally wakes the beast and of course can not convince his parents of the big hungry rat in the basement. The supposedly emotional family situation (Daddy wants his son to always love him) is very pathetic and unnecessary, and the movie needed more bloodshed! Kids movie or not. The adolescent hero (Chris Miller) is pretty annoying, but we definitely saw worse kid actors in the 80's. "The Cellar" is not recommended unless you are a fan of kitschy and typical 80s monster designs. The big shady rat thing is a real scream.
