Jerry Lewis was a bit funny when he did not write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he started to write and direct his own films, the small talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. Whenever his movies fail on the American market (and they earned the money in France), Lewis always accused everyone and everything but him; For example, he blamed the failure of this film that he was published according to Lewis on a double bill with the porn film "Deep Throat". If anyone should have complained about this situation, it should have been the producers of "Deep Throat". This is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the richest man in the world (Lewis), who was rejected as a military service during World War II and decides to equip a special "cadre" who travels to Germany and captures Hitler himself. Apart from the many mistakes this film has (the script is insanely unstable, Lewis's "directing" is absent, the film seems like a cheap home movie), Lewis apparently thought he was surrounded by no-talent - Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller were a good idea; he must have thought that they would be so bad that they made him look good. He was half right; They are embarrassingly bad, but he gets worse than she does. For a "comedy," Lewis's character is grumpy, angry, and intrusive; The way he abuses his subordinates makes you wonder why they would ever follow such a bullying idiot on a dangerous mission as trying to capture Hitler. Amazing is the fact that this movie has ever recorded money. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen - I've heard that "slapstick" is even miserable, but I can not bring myself to see if that's true or not - and should be avoided will be all possible costs.
