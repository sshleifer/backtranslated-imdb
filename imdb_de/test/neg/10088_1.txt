It was awfully simple. What was her message? Where did the movie go? It contains all the ingredients of a sub-B class movie. From actionless action over bad acting to cheesy, slow cinematography. I'd rather see a movie I've already seen, like Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale or even Fat. There are no sympathetic characters. In the end, just everyone should die. Save 2 hours of your life and skip it.
