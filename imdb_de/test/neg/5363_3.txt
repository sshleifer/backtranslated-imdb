Even if Ryan was not that annoying person, that would still be bad, I said, even if, where do we start? "Director's Record" You will feel the urge to grab your tape recorder and hit it with a hammer or push into a lake, a haunted lake of course. Oh, I wish that "Dead Time" was more literal, contrary to what they mean, but unfortunately no death, maybe a pillow that does not fit, or a "buzzing noise", oh, wait, that is the cat. I actually expected that there was some evidence or at least something to check their antics.

No, in fact they have less than nothing, they are wasting their time. They accepted my challenge to do something for the paranormal challenge. Now you're actually doing something for the paranormal, you could say, go in front of the camera and say, "I love the paranormal so much that I draw stick figures of the spirits" or "I love the paranormal so much that my name is Co-Eds pretending to be ghost hunters "They would waste film but waste the paranormal. Or you could say, "I'm dressing with a demon," but do not say it's name, you could get hurt, and you know, God does not like that, that would be something for God, but he would not like it so do not do that.

"Captain Log Star Date 541.2 ... oh I mean" Director's record, I've just brought it up on a few new investigators, a couple of 8's and 9's, but that's chic a 10 .... at yeah .... we have a new case ... weird things happen .... ....... focus on one of the kids ..... wanted to investigate ... " Now we bring a medium, we have not told them anything, this is TV.
