I like vampire movies, I like B movies, I love B vampire movies. But this one has almost nothing to offer. Some of the acting is awful, especially with 3 of the male leads. The story is not very interesting. At a relatively short 88 minutes, it still seems to be too long, and you will move forward fairly quickly. There are a lot of kung fu vampire attacks. Sounds cool It's not when it's done on a low budget. It repeats itself very fast. There is some blood and blood, nothing to be happy about. There are some good wire works where you can see the wires. It has some good landscapes that were filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Not worth the rent
