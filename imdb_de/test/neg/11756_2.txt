This is an above-average movie in itself, but why was it made in the name of Bog? It's impossible to treat it as one thing in itself because it's an almost shot-to-shoot remake of an 1960's 1960s Hitchcock classic. You can not see it without the 1960 movie coming into your consciousness. <br /> <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we ascribe anything to Van Sandt and his co-workers other than deciding to use different actors, sets and colors? Anne Heche is attractive, but lacks Janet Leigh's determined determination to become a respectable middle class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who made her unsuccessful attempt to marry and settle down, the desperation of a woman who faces forty. And Heche does not project fear like Leigh does. The scene with the CHP official looking in her car window illustrates the weakness of the role. In the original, the officer asks, "Is something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not, am I behaving as if something was wrong?" The officer hesitates before answering: "Well, frankly, yes." This exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change is undoubtedly the replacement of Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It can not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in his role? Perkins is nervous, bird-like, long-necked, wrapped in an externally sexy appearance that masks an inner vacuum. His every move (eating sweet corn, with his Adam's apple) and every utterance, the faint laugh, the dry giggle, is just right. He simply can not be improved. Vaughn brings with him the presence of a short-haired, beefy guy who's just been released from the US Army as Lance Corporal. In order to suggest his psychosis, he can only lay a manic giggle about what normally appears normal in norm and language. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn does not even stumble upon the word "fallacy" because it resembles "phallus.") He could just hang around at the motel, waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship at UCLA. <Br /> <br /> The direction deserves a few comments. I do not see what the story brings when we see Norman masturbating while looking at Anne Heche. I'm not referring to it. I wonder why it's there, just as I'm wondering why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> To impress me with how much color the visual experience adds, Van Sant seems to be doing a bit more subtle hitchcock stuff. Heche gets underwear in all colors - green, pink, orange and - mango? Is that a color? If so, what kind of color is that? Never mind. The point is that when the walking camera first looks through the Phoenix Hotel window, the original camera captures Janet Leigh in the bed, wearing a pure white half panties and a white bra. Later, after stealing the money, we see her back in her underwear - this time both her panties and her bra are black. This is a small thing, but Hitch is one of them. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​photographing in color was not bad, except that the black and white shoot of the original was outstanding. The color and the odd light effects in this version make the ordinary, boring and subliminally ominous motel something that looks like it belongs in the most sophisticated part of Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Most of all, the 1960 movie was shocking in more ways than one. I remember seeing it in a drive-in movie theater in San Diego and stared in horror as it became clear that the central character was indeed dead - halfway through the movie! Nothing like it had ever been done before. <br /> <br /> This murder in the shower was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel in both films. By the way, the author writes something like: "The murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off his head with a knife." I do not believe it. Well, not quite. Van Sant's film also gives us excess here. There is more blood and more naked meat. And when Hitchcock first came to the blood that circled the bathtub drain and dissolved into Marian's open eye, then slowly withdrew the camera to make her face visible, he turned the camera from a slight tilt to the correct vertical and gave to the viewer a feeling not only of the murder, but of a dizzying unbelief. Van Sant does not tilt his camera 10 or 20 degrees like Hitchcock. He practically twirls it around his axis. <br /> <br /> It's not good to make a mistake with Hitchcock because that's not the case. It is a financial plunder of Hitchcock's material (already in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV and "Psycho: The Beginning Years" and "Come in My Salon: Mrs. Bates' Revenge" and "Hand Me") The Knife , would you ?: The true story of Norman Bates. ") A reinvestigation of truly original stuff, a criminal act, if not criminal, not to mention the many homages in other films, especially the French, like the infamous" ocean of boredom "between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the much admired" La Mere de la Nuit. "(Perhaps I'll add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt to make a parody of academic critics, and if a chicken gut grinds grain, it's a" crumbly "act.) I will not keep saying these gags, shabby as they are, are more fun than the movie.) So, who was it made for? I would guess kids that are too young to talk about that To hear original and who do not like black and white movies children hoping to see another normal Slasher movie? Chimpanzees?
