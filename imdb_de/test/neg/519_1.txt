This movie has to rank with the Ed Wood movies. A horrible screenplay and bad, bad acting. <br /> <br /> A machine gun fight in front of glass panes; Minutes pass until someone is hit and nobody has cover - no window ever breaks. You'd think the big U-Haul truck would be a mystery after such a fire fight - not a scratch. <br /> <br /> Make CIA Agents and Government Entrepreneurs = Shout = Top Secret Information in a Stand Up Cocktail Celebrate with hundreds of people. <br /> <br /> There is no actor you are interested in. Everyone is flat and basically unlikely. <br /> <br /> A Hawaii-tethered 747 flies from Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". A short time passes when the stewardess tells the five other passengers that they have only two hours left. on a 747? <br /> <br /> The rescue teams reappear the next day and, surprisingly, the six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A movie that starts moderately and gets worse and worse. <br /> <br />
