Many flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, many beautiful sets. I do not believe that the conspiracy has supported so much effort. The story could have been told far more effectively and would have been more psychological if there was not so much macho bomb in production. In my experience, Chinese films tend to do so. and I think that has a negative impact on the movie.
