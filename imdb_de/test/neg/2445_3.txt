Genre: Cartoons without dialogue, African and Leo. Main characters: Inki, the lion and the Minah bird. <br /> <br /> What happens: A lion wants to eat an African girl named Inki. There is also a pretty confusing Minah bird. Is he on Inki's or on the Lion's side? <br /> <br /> Message: Um <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, that is rather mean for poor Africans !! :-( I like that the main character Inki (who is an African) is a pretty pretty main character, but they still portray her roughly and do not particularly like a younger crowd just because she likes HUNTING !! GRRR CHARLES M I like I do not think the lion very much and I think the Minah bird is ALL RIGHT (suppose) I personally prefer the cartoons of Charles M. Jones' Looney Tunes in the future. <br /> <br /> If you have this Anyway, I recommend the site YouTube, just type "Inki" in the blank on the main page and you are there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones would have been nicer Inki in this short So, there. <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People who are interested in old cartoons and / or people who only deal with You Tube.
