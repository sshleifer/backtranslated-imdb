First of all ... I've seen a better acting and more realistic make-up in porn movies. How bad was "Chris Moltisante" as Stewie Ungar? At The Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then you throw in "Bobby Baccala" as one of his Vegas friends. It's just too much to shoot a dramatic movie. None of the actors can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who made the makeup for this disaster? I want that person to be MY make-up person for the next 25 years so I will not age a day. That's all I'm writing in this movie because it's not worth it to waste more time with me. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
