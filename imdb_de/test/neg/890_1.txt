When you watch this movie, all you have to do is ask: what did you think? There are so many conspicuously bad parts of this movie that you might feel that the movie is deliberately bad, as a kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing about the movie is the director. In this movie, there are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements that are ridiculously bad. The funniest example of this would be in the beginning, where the party guests receive their invitations by email - the same camera angle is used for each shot (which takes impractical 2 seconds apiece) and the same computer screen appears with the same desktop / window / program and so on. It even looks like the thing is shot on the same set every time. The whole sequence was also completely silent, without music or sound effects. All in all, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an e-mail was sent throughout the city. If you listen carefully, you will find that the music sounds very similar to other film music tracks. This is no surprise - most of the songs, including the song that opens the movie, are in fact minor changes in the results of other movies (see if you can guess which ones). I also noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds like it was written and played on a low-end MIDI keyboard. If you are familiar with the LucasArts SCUM adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else about the movie is just shit. The spectacle is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the movie that is funny from a distance, unless you see the entire movie as a big joke played by a paying audience. Do not rent this. Do not even look at it when it's repeated on Comedy Central. Just forget it - it's awful.
