I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised how completely WRONG this movie was. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what he had to be part of this travesty. The biblical accuracy was absolutely nonexistent, and I really could not stand the movie with my children. My children were astonished because even they know that Lot was not even thought when Noah built the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed because producers are allowed to taunt the word and cause even more confusion in a world that knows little about the truth ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM !!! I've thought about burning my copy, but I have every intention of writing to the producers and sending them the scripture references they should have read before making this movie !!!
