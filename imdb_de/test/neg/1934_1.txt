It's probably a cultural thing - somehow the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny. I experienced this phenomenon first-hand, at an open-air cinema, where this film was shown before the feature film. Most indigenous listeners laughed, and no, this was not in a sanatorium or clinic for backward children, this was in a wealthy area and the audience was mostly educated adults. So it must somehow be possible to find that amusing, but honestly, I have no idea what matters - maybe it's in the air or in the water, prolonged exposure that causes this condition. Something has to cause it, of course I can only say that I'm pretty sure it does not cause it: the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are no jokes. It's brain dead, stupid, nonsensical, unsteady, lame. In short, it's a waste of time. Every Tom and Jerry is funnier, damn it, even funerals are funnier. <br /> <br /> Just in case you were lucky enough not to have seen any of the Stooges' performances: There are three men who behave, run, even talk like backward children, all kinds of insatiable ones Cause chaos, without conspiracy, without real purpose and without any real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite annoying because you feel like you're at a party with a bunch of batting heads and you are the only one who has not smoked anything yet Has. So, if you're not ready to get intoxicated to make it bearable, or be provided with anything that makes you think you're watching three ugly old men who act like idiots Funny, my advice is: stay away. Far away.
