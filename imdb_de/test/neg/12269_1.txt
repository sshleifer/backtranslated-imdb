I like to watch Australian movies, but this steaming pile of crap was just embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, do not judge a DVD for its cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that the Best Actor was awarded a prize, but the competition must have been really bad, as the acting in this film is pathetic. It only seemed that the director thought he had the talent to direct and act, if he really should concentrate on one part of the film making and do it right before he spread out too thin. The music was pretty ordinary. The story really did not go anywhere. It was just a series of struggles strung together with a bad script and kitschy dialogue. However, I will say so to all aspiring filmmakers. Watch this movie It gives you hope that your movie will win something at a festival. <br /> <br /> But you are fine if you go there and try. I hope you have learned some lessons and your next adventure is a bit better.
