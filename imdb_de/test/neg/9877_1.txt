I will talk about this film from two different perspectives. First, it is out of sight if someone sees the movie and never reads (and possibly never reads) the book. The second is from someone who has. <br /> <br /> (film without a book) From the point of view of the film, it was an ok movie. Nowhere as good as one of the underworlds, but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about the plot. The visual effects were questionable in many parts, although the wolf conversion was very beautiful. The characters have little development, and Vivian did not seem to really care that their "love" killed the rest of their species. Some of the other characters could have had more airtime, like The Five. The plot was similar to Underworld for my liking. <br /> <br /> (movie MIT book) As many have said, apart from the title, character name, and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing like. Gabriel was much older in the movie and was the father of Rafe (hence Astrid was once his buddy). In the book, Gab was about 24 years old, had never been paired with anyone, as wolves mate for life (Astrid tries to gain his affection) and Astrid was the mother of Ulf, not Rafe. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. It is Vivian's fault for the film, and her entire family was killed by it. In the book, the original leader of the Five, Axel, killed a girl from her school. Hunters sought out the wolves and killed many of them (including Viv's father), so they had to move. Vivas mother, Esme, was also a protagonist. <br /> <br /> One thing in the book that would have made the movie better would have been the "bat dance". For those who are unaware, it is the ordeal in which all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who the new leader's companion is (since a fight for the males took place before). Vivian won it when she tried to save her mother from Astrid (who is a terrible evil woman in the book) and was therefore to mate with Gab. There was no prophecy! However, if you have read the book and you liked the book, I strongly recommend NOT to watch this movie.
