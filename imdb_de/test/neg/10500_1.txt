Usually I do not give movies "1". Although I am a HARTLESS critic, I try to find everything that makes the movie worthwhile (that is, observable). The main thing I am looking for is a coherent action. If that alone, I can see it! Let me start with the fact that this does not even deserve the name film, but rather a primary school project ... went terribly wrong! And I've seen every sci-fi movie special ever made. <br /> <br /> Many times I've read professional review articles that say "crap": "This was like a TV screen ..." (etc etc etc) "and I kept saying," Oh come on, I wish they were thinking of a REAL criticism. "Well, that's worse ... much worse! This is really the worst" thing "I've ever seen, as long as a movie (if I think it's a movie, it would be my new worst movie ever) Times), and I've watched every movie Uwe Boll made! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I'd rather see Jaws the Revenge all day and then see again ... even 5 minutes of it ... there was a good scene and it was the end! ;-P OK enough to bomb the works of Ron Hall now for the serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The script is poorly written, the dialogue is kept on wood, the effects are cheesier than those of a power ranger show and do not even let me start with the screen covers (ugh) .Someone actually looked at the thing, edited it and then said, "Okay, let go"? burned it rather than let it go! At the end I can only say: "Luckily DVD and VHS players have a Stop & Eject feature! "My advice ... do not rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you have to stop and throw! :)
