Why is C Thomas Howell making these films? Cruise (Howells' one-time co-star) follows a massive blockbuster from WOTW and Howell follows with this lame effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Production values ​​- I start with the good. The look and feel of some scenes in this movie are not bad, to be honest. The setups are ok in spots and the direction is not too bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of crazy scenes that could be played in any order through the movie. It was countless how many times the scene blackened a second later in the same room and reappeared. Very bad action (but also the cruise WOTW) has some guilt, but a lousy script kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Okay, I do not want to be too hard here as budgeting was smaller than Cruise's lunch break - but in the overall context of the movie the impact is bad. Some shots are pretty impressive - especially far from destruction footage of bridges, Washington, Liners. As a rule, the "strange" machines and tentacles themselves are terrible. Also, the camera quality is blurred in some shots and cuts off completely in others. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'm a fan of Howell, but since he's limited to working in these low-budget flicks - he succumbed long ago to the "over-effective" bug. Take a look at his performance at The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He exaggerates his facial expressions, his arched arms and legs (where did he get that running style?), And for a last coup, he looks at the scene in which he loses his family photo. Hysterical. But after saying that, he is still the best actor shown here. Busey is embarrassed to look at it and Peter Green (Zed is really dead, baby) mumbled incoherently through his only scene. I honestly could not understand a word he said - I even tried to activate the subtitles in this scene - but the DVD had no subtitles. This also seems to be a real affair as Howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer make it all in the movie. None of them is good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> Rating - Sorrow. <br /> <br /> All in all a lame duck effort I will not do anything for Howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. He should look at Rourke and try to figure out how he got back to the A-list, but if he does that, he will not make a career fast enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10
