Telly Savalas mated it as a Mexican revolutionary (although played by Chuck Connors as a military martin) in this witty, but rather boring pastiche about the life and times of the famous historical figure. An earlier attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and in the lead role of Robert Mitchcum treated these events more soberly and on a larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is an all too typical European endeavor, which, despite its talent, is an indistinguishable one. The end result is more silly than amusing - although a few moments, especially the action sets and a scene where a fight takes place in a church, give some mild pleasure. Oh, and Savalas can even sing about the last songs!
