We searched for these hard-to-find VHS after seeing two excellent Merchant Ivory images in a row. Since I knew it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rent, I thought it's worth it anyway, based on M-I's reputation. Pity! Nine years ago, one of the objectives of the Liberal Agenda was to destroy the Founding Fathers, and in fact they had some success in eradicating the founding fathers of many American classrooms, such as the United States. New Jersey; Their extermination of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times put the New York School Board and its subversive deed in the spotlight of truth. A small part of this was the alleged link between Sally Hemmings and Thomas Jefferson, ignoring inconvenient DNA findings that did not support the crazy left's agenda. Never mind! They got James Ellis, a dubious author, to put it in a book, and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> As for Jefferson in Paris, the Liberal Agenda Spin begins the opening scene in which James Earl Jones claims to be the son of Jefferson. The spin is simply continued in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person considers the lie to be true, the Hemmings' claim is a trivial detail in the broader matter of Jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (and the Netherlands, where he secured important financial support for America ) was when our infant nation was without money). <br /> <br /> Apart from Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing of interest in this dreary and boring movie. Part of the other story is indeed - adding credibility to the lie - but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please do not ask me why the liberals want to throw the founding fathers in the bin because I do not waste time explaining the deeds of such people. Do not ask her either. They usually respond to such questions with the same answer: "SHUT UP!"
