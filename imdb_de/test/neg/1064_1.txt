In this film, there is nothing original, human or insight. The acting is average, the pictures are amateurish, the writing is subtle and the scenes are very simple ... something very close to a soap. <br /> <br /> In 2: 37, the movie turns into a suicide, an exciting drama. We watch partly because we want to know who is dying. The different characters each have a problem, and the film shows how bad every problem is for them, but only as a way to get them to a place they believe they could kill themselves. Despite the camera's different views on key events, there is NEVER another way to see the events for themselves. In 2:37 the Arseholes are Arseholes, the angels angels. Thats is quite easy. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film becomes a voyeuristic story of youth and violence. One hardly gets to know the children as well as the breasts, the bodies and the hobbles, which the filmmaker gives as characteristics. <br /> <br /> If you know ALL about film in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature rip-off of the elephant - no meditation, no progression. While the filmmaker and the distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every opportunity to give the movie a certain legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive contributions to IMDb avoid strangely mentioning or simply appreciating originality. If you want something with heart and voice, avoid this exploitation of adolescents. I was surprised at how old the filmmakers were when I found out when I saw this movie - I assumed a 13-year-old had made it. The Twenty Something I always knew was too busy expressing anything real to lift an old man's job.
