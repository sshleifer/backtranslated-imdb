One of the movies that I just did not want to see. I got it in the preview, but damn, the drama was very bad! At the end of the film (I'm still surprised that I saw the whole movie ...) I wondered why I saw the movie a book by Giphart) found it very bad and was disappointed that his film was released this way has been. Next time, he wants to have a role in selecting people for the cast.
