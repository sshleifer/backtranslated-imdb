Scarecrow Gone Wild begins as a high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his mates, the diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) to behave as something villainous. Mike and his buddy decide to take Sam to a cornfield, tie him to a cross next to a crazy scarecrow and leave him there all night, sounds like fun, right? Well, things go backwards as Sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from low blood sugar and the vengeful spirit of Sam goes over to the scarecrow, which comes to life and begins to chase the children who are responsible for Sams unhappy life-threatening situation are responsible. Can Sam's best buddy Jack (Matthew Linhardt) & his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save the day and save Sam's life? <br /> <br /> Writer & Director: Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third direct video entry in the Scarecrow series & while I have not seen any of the previous two, after seeing Scarecrow Gone Wild I'm in no hurry to change that situation, which is safe. The script actually has an almost decent premise, since the unfortunate soul of Sam seeks revenge and his friends somehow have to keep the real Sam alive, but the way he is told is bad and I think that's basically it An irrelevance to the fact is that this is the case of a movie about a killer scarecrow running around killing people in a not very bloody or imaginative way. However, there are one or two scenes that will save it from rating with a star, the fart gag in the cornfield is funny and something that many unripe guys could do (like me) when two guys bury their partner in the sand and then over Pissing on him and peeing on him is also pretty funny in a ridiculous, youthful way and a cool piece when a guy starts to sing a terrible song so the scarecrow throws a pole that impresses him! However, these OK pieces are only a few and far from each other. All in all, this is a stupid, boring, poorly written teen slasher movie with very annoying characters that irritate. It is also very predictable and has a stupid ending where the scarecrow does not really occur at all. This is a problem, because if you watch a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild, you expect a scarecrow to get wild and I have to admit that it looks pretty cool as a horror character. <br /> <br /> Director Katkin is really doing a decent job here, though, what's on earth with this hospital at the end and all this neon lighting everywhere and the fact that there is only one patient & two co-workers? The cinematography is much better than the usual low-budget horror movie with direct sales and there are some nice, albeit totally unrealistic, lighting. The film lacks real fear or tension. Some of the medical terms that are used in this area are a little questionable, and I say that as an insulin-dependent diabetic. There are not a lot of thrills here, there are a couple of scenes where an actor puts some false guts on his stomach to show them how they are marginalized, but it looks pretty spotty, there's a burnt face too a few others, but nothing else. There's a whole lot of naked female boobs to see, if that's your thing. <br /> <br /> Technically, Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good considering some of the cheap atrocities I've been through lately. Unfortunately, it is still a bad movie overall. The least of what is said about acting is better. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the horror movies that have appeared lately, but they said it's not much better. It's still a bad movie when all said and is done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both also went directly to the video.
