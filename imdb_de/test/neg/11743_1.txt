A terrible movie, poorly thought out and crude. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so far inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version that they must be seen to be believed. There was no reason to take this picture, which only shows how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was and how inimitable. There is also a creeping, penetrating insensitivity in the film that is not present in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but you could really feel it for everyone, even the pathetic Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and fiery humor that the remake does not have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance, when and where it should be shown, whether it's a near or distant shot, or whether an actor is sympathetic when it makes him terrifying, and so on. The remake has none of these features and does not try it either. It's an idiotic exercise that amazed me, even published it.
