When Uwe Boll, Cinema Conman Extraordinaire, released the first film adaptation of House Of The Dead on the well deserved ridicule, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one must be incredibly moronic to make a sequel. Hollywood's per capita ratio of idiots must indeed be high, because we not only have a sequel, but it was also distributed in the antipodes of Sony, a company that is not usually known for expensive depreciation. Published directly in America on television, the sequel in many ways improves on the original, but is rather bland than interesting. The extent of the scenario is increased. The action takes place in an abandoned city that happens to surround a university where experiments have been carried out with a virus that can revive the dead. In particular, the action is widespread throughout the university, where the first infected inhabitants can be found. To put it simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs in a house where there are dead people. <br /> <br /> The occupation, on the other hand, is a real step backwards. Emmanuelle Vaugier resembled one Angelina Jolie with low rents, while the rest of the cast never reached the level of a draining JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out under this occupation is Sticky Fingaz, who probably did not want to be so easily recognized by the people he met at home. Simply put, these people could not order pizza convincingly on the big screen, even under the best guidance. Say what you want about Boll, but he has inspired actors like Ona Grauer to defend himself against his inability. However, those involved seem to at least be aware that their film is shitty and that they might as well enjoy it. The main problem with the original was that the director believed he was making a misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. Since the actors do not take their characters or the situation seriously, the small dramatic tension that might have existed will be undermined. Much of the plot deals with the search for a Generation Zero victim from whatever plague resurrects the dead. Or, to translate it into practical terms, they try to find someone who has been infected just after the virus has mutated into a menacing form. How this could help if an unmutated strain is normally required to create a vaccine can only be guessed at, but the way this search is conducted poses problems. The we-has-to-go plot device is used to filter out the runtime, but the actual timing of the additional search is also problematic. Once we are told that the city will be smashed with cruise missiles in ten minutes, but the heroes are heading back to the university, seeking the sample they are looking for, and fighting with enough zombies to eat the Chinese army Period. The filmmakers note that it pays to be specific over time when it can hinder rather than hinder dramatic tensions. While Uwe Boll simulated the death of the characters with idiotic Drehkameratricks, Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details that allow his budget. Neck bitten, arms cut off, heads shot. All this leads to a more convincing throughput, but also prohibits the mockery of obvious fakes. The photography is also greatly improved. As DVD Crypt put it, the fact that it's always in focus makes it an improvement over the original, but it also fools us to laugh at the expense of it. Writing is also an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games are offered, the most obvious being Run Like Hell. The first few times they work because they cleverly integrate titles into the normal everyday dialogue. But after the eighth time, they get on their nerves because they remind players of things they would rather do with their time. Interestingly, House Of The Dead 2 cost only six million to television screens across America. Since Tom Savini alone would cost more to work on a movie today, I have to say that I'm a bit impressed with the visual results. Unlike the much-cursed original, the zombies here look more like real zombies than extras that are badly made up. In a further contrast to the original, the actors seem to have an indication of what they are doing. To conclude the deal is the fact that the characters, apart from some real Zingers scattered around the world, speak like real people. However, history is not something we have not seen a thousand times. When aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were released in recognition, they came to the conclusion that these films were either doing something we had not seen before or doing so well that it was not really us interested. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it does not bring anything new or especially brilliant to the table, so we do not care about it in the end. <br /> <br /> For this reason and many others, I gave House Of The Dead 2 two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. If you are not as into absorbing films as me, you should stay away from it.
