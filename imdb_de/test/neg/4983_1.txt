God, I've never felt so offended in my life as with this crap. There are so many ways to describe this crap that I think if I said everything I could think of, I would be banned from this site. <br /> <br /> How do I start? Well, for one thing, one does not need the knowledge of the original series to know that this film is a slap in the face of the people who saw it. The biggest slaughter of a title song ever made is from a metal version to a crazy RAP version. What did you think of? How do underdog and electronically heavy music style fit together? The story is so basic that I will do something I usually do not do and do not even give a summary. Just think the following: A dog gets super powers, fills in the rest. So predictable is this movie. And then the jokes come ... please kill me now. That kind of humor that may not even make the kids laugh is so bad. Well, expect this punchline after sneezing. That was a bit funny. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me most is why Jason Lee (Ny's name is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim) are all here. In the said shows / movies, the actors do a good job, in my opinion, and apart from Lee they are the best actors in the movie, but that does not say much. The rest earns Golden Rasberry nominations for this crap. I am very sad that such good actors have been buried by this disaster. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is as bad as Doogal, which I've also looked through, and my head would explode if I saw something worse than that.
