This is a really horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this in. The use of miniature models of the train is ridiculous. The plot seems to be on the run (there's an alien on board, oh yes, and an eco-terrorist is on board too, oh, the conductor is dead and the train is out of control, oh, and the train drives one) Drive into another train an hour before, oh, and this train has nuclear waste ...). I mean, come on! The alien monsters are not scary (though there are many of them) and the spectacle is miserable. Look at the guy who plays the "next president" - do you really think he could be president? For God's sake, he spent his entire acting career playing bad guys!
