That looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, all right? And a $ 42 million raid - sounds like a gross movie. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment - I think the stars got all the money because the production values ​​are bad. <br /> <br /> But more than that it's the pseudo-reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the slight crime goes awry. It is very well done for watching TV. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointing - it scores for what it is - but it loses it massively, because it's outspoken and not at all very interesting ...
