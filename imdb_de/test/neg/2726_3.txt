"The Vindicator" is a funny little Canadian B-movie. At first glance, it seems to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "Terminator", but strangely, it also shares some qualities with the original "RoboCop", which was not even released when "Vindicator" appeared ( 1986). Coincidence? Who knows? The story is, anyway: Scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy working for a government secret high-tech research lab that reports to a seedy boss named Whyte, with whom he fights project finance early in the project , Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "lab accident". But wait! Carl is not really dead! Whyte pulled out Carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project, a kind of experimental biomechanical spacesuit. When Carl wakes up in his new body, he understandably gets a little crazy, dumps the lab and escapes. This is a problem because Whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with a Rage Reaction program, which will kill anyone who touches him for any reason. In retrospect, this little enrichment of Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> So Robo-Carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while killing some random Muggers and other background characters until he returns home and contacts his wife (this scene is said to be heartbreakingly touching, I suppose but weird, because Carl's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that she can hardly understand a word). Of course, he asks her to leave the city and never come back because she is in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Finally, Whyte engages a gang of commandos, led by "Hunter," a seemingly ninja assassin who is played by Pam Grier (!) To hunt down and destroy his runaway creature, using Carl's wife as bait becomes . <br /> <br /> I'm a B-movie guy, but "The Vindicator" was so half-hearted that it quickly became a high-end comedy. I'm assuming that a good deal of the budget went into Stan Winston's robo-Carl suit design, which actually looks pretty cool, but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap, television-built look. The script could have taken much more work, but maybe the filmmakers got wind of "RoboCop" going into production and hurried to "Vindicator" so they could not be accused of tearing them down. Judging by the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one who has noticed the parallels between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop". Obviously, "Robo" is the superior movie Sit by this piece of nonsense, unless you want to see a movie that can best be described as a rough version of "RoboCop" if it was made by an 8th student.
