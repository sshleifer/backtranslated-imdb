When the American film industry tries to take a critical look at its own government, they damn sure make it look good, even if it's bad. <br /> <br /> The movie does one thing right, it perfectly shows what's wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be to fuck with the one who needs it to get things done !!! Mix an American congressman, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to fuck the Ruskies. We thank the USA for giving us Osama Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The film's disappointment is that the themes are mixed up: footage of Afghan children without guns and the stories of Soviet atrocities and their making a blatant attempt to establish a connection between them and the backgrounds of US aid , Every reasonable person knows why the $ 1,000,000 was raised ... not the dying Afghan children, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, the serious issues are included in the bullshit dialogue dialogue. "Here's for you, you M *** r F ***** s" Hoffmam sings in the end, all that's missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military. The movies can not help but leave the aftertaste of American pride and joy over how we (the Americans) saved the world ... once again. Not even the last five minutes of the film can save the film, which tries to stop praising itself and waking up to the fact that it is just another American. <br /> <br /> The acting and editing was good.
