I saw this movie a few months ago when it first appeared on the shelves of Blockbuster. It's officially the only movie I wanted to see. Let me first say that I like "B" movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" as one of the best comedies of all time. I also notice that I'm a writer and that I've met the director / writer of this movie wonder. <br /> <br /> Assessment of Acting: If I chose a bright spot, I would do so. I must point out that Dionay's role played a wonderful acting debut. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer, not an actor, so we give him his lame death sequence. Why does not he even shoot the shotgun? Budget? To highlight the bad drama, one would need pages, so I stay with The egotistical leader Ryn Baskin. Ryn (who looks like a name chosen from a comic book because he sounded cool) has the maximum face time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. Its appearance is perfectly fine, but its delivery evokes memories of SNL ripping soap operas. I guess he could do so much with what was written for him, but part of the guilt is definitely his. Special effects: Not my specialty, but for a low-budget movie, I assume the make-up and the gun game was acceptable. It did not bother me, but it did not impress. <br /> <br /> Writing / Director: Oscar for the best script is not something I can imagine Gerald Nott ever won. The plot is not only rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and stilted. I understand stylized Hokee-Ness, but that was just bad writing. The thing that bothered me the most was the theft. Nott stole scenes, recordings and Viggo's facial hair from a number of other films. The scene where Russel Crow walks through the wheat field in Gladiator, Whole sequences from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, these kinds of things just can not escape me. I will decide not to comment on the shoot because I do not know what it takes to get a good shot. Bottom line: do not borrow this movie, not even a pirate. It's too bad to waste time. The good reviews may be completely wrong after meeting Gerry. It is more than likely that he will publish it himself.
