Okay, so this was already done in 1993. Directed by Robert Iscove and loosely by John Miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story. Hard to believe that someone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. It was clear from the beginning that this lady was everything she could get. Tim Matheson, who looked a bit older than I remembered, played the man with the empty head, who was looking for something romantic, boring and empty life. Well, it came to him like Tracy Pollan, a somewhat vacant girl with muddled sex as a means of conquering her boys. Come on, phone sex, even in the 90s it was old hat. I can not believe anyone would fall for this old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him a lot. <br /> <br /> The most difficult scene was when he finally threw the lady out of his apartment and put all her garbage in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. Since I had enough of this banal film. I wanted to wish that the lady had tried it on me, so that I had the satisfaction of taking her on a hike. <br /> <br /> I gave this chestnut a 1 out of 100 points it was. I think you can not blame the actors. But they were terrible. Did you actually try to play with a straight face?
