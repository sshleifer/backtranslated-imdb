One of the scariest movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first one!). Well, as with other movies, they have totally ruined the Carrie franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the film trudges like a geriatrics in a wrong-way van. There's little fear, and this movie is full of all the different high school stereotypes (ie The Football Jock, the bitchy cheer leader, the supporters and of course the black nail polish that carries outsiders). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what happens when you see the opening credits. Sure, sure, the girl is humiliated three times and then turns into a crazy mental assassin ... Yawning ... <br /> <br /> Was there. Finished. <br /> <br /> Even the actors look like they're forced to shoot this movie. Emily Bergl is as frightening as a cabbage doll, while Jack London ... Let's just say I did not pay to see wood. Aside from the actors, the flasbacks are more than irritating than connecting with the first movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you can shine around objects like Carrie, then for the love of God you will shine the theater ......
