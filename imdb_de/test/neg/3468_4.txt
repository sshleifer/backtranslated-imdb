'Leatherheads' is trying so hard. Try to be carefree. Try to be a comedy. Try to be a love affair. Let's see, it's trying to be a 'His Girl Friday' with 'The Sting' with 'It Happened One Night' with a dozen sports films. Unfortunately, it does not try and the movie is as muddy as the last playing field. <br /> <br /> A movie fan would see the big fight scene in the Speakeasy between the Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers realizing the fights John Ford has seen in films like "The Quiet Man" or "Donovan's Reef" or "The Searchers "staged with so much style and momentum, were perhaps easy to do, but obviously not. I bet that George Clooney thought channeling John Ford would be easy too. How hard it could be: masculinity, run amok, beatings, broken bottles, an unwavering pianist ... just put it on the screen with some music. We are sorry. It takes a master to make battle scenes come to fruition. <br /> <br /> Films are not wanted. Humor is hard. Romance is hard. Slapstick a lost art. I once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. Something about not wanting to sting the fantastic bubble of performance by hearing the bumps of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the lifts. This movie is so ... all the hardships and good intentions, handsome actors, beautiful sets, but it races through its footsteps and not like galloping like the original galloping ghost, Red Grange, on which the movie is loosely based.
