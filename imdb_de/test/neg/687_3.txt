I have as much testosterone as the next guy, and Raquel Welch at its finest is certainly worth a look. However, the fact is that a cardboard cutout might work better, and one and a half hours in which Ms. W shows her considerable fortune does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> If you look at the cast, it's surprisingly as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner and his tough guy Harry is as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, whom I usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines. And as for Edward G ... well, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck. <br /> <br /> This film is a mess: from non-existent storyline, to stop-start action and unpleasant scripts, to punk slapstick and annoying 60's caper music. If Miss Welch had not been, I would have given her a 0. That is, she is a feast for the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'Bedazzled' - and for that reason alone, I gave him a 3.
