The movie has a good story, the action is good in some parts, but not all. Some of the parts, I just had the feeling that the bad guys had not taken off yet, from my experience with martial arts. Some actions are lengthy actions, as always for the boss, but for the less important ones they were killed or emaciated with a few strokes, but for others they were unrealistic or did a better job. <br /> <br /> The least important actors or stunt people were the right picks for the movie. My girlfriend had a crush on her that she started watching the movie more than she spends her time with me. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, that's all I can say.
