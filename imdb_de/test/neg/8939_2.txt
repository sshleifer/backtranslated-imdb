The most obvious mistake ... terrible, terrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined by bad dialogues, continuity issues, things that were never explained, gaping hand holes, negotiations that went nowhere, and sheer stupidity. Not to mention the horrible, clich√© directed by Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could have saved this movie. So it did not matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette made terrible appearances. The thing is that they are better actors than this movie makes believe. The best of the Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) has some nice moments - like a great scene at the beginning, in which she painfully pulls off her handcuffs - but by her standards she does a poor job overall. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When trumpets fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is far worse and acts without conviction or emotion. But I will not blame the actors, who were good in other roles. The script is terrible and the bad direction does not help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
