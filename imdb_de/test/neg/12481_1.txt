This lately fulci-thug is an utterly abominable mix of an incurable gambler (Brett Halsey) who decides to pay the beard-beast type by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you've ever seen happen to be wealthy widows ! The Fulci-written script also includes integrating some black-and-comic elements - which only results in a corpse with a corpse that does not stand still being an opera singer sacrifice that never stops singing, etc. - not to mention from a doppelganger theme directly from THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE - although in this case the two personas communicate via recorded radio messages !! In the end, I can not say that I am surprised that this film shows no trace of the sophistication of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON (1970), which is similar in several respects and that he is content to only amass the disgusting Gory ( but not too convincing) effects of dismembered limbs and compressed or melting faces, with which Fulci unfortunately had now completely connected.
