For a thriller to arouse fear, tension or emotion, the story must be credible. There is nothing credible or realistic about this film. The protagonists have several options to leave the table or turn around, but can screw it up every time. The antagonists, who had allegedly planned this and had adapted their shuttle specifically for the case of humans, certainly left many improvisational weapons. There is actually a scene in which the "smart" girl has a gun on the head of the main enemy and decides to scold him instead of pulling the trigger. This was a thoroughly predictable, mindless "thriller". Every character was one-dimensional. The "victims" were the usual discouraged, brainless sheep who deserved to be slaughtered. Is there anyone on this planet who can write a smart thriller?
