I am surprised at the number of people who have classified this entry as their favorite "chan" (have they never seen "... at the opera" or "... at Treasure Island?" - the latter) ironically written by John Larkin (who dropped the ball here). This action is a train wreck and overloaded with pointless characters. First, viewers must remember the filthy details of Steve McBirney's (played by the venerable thug and HUAC squealer Marc Lawrence) of 1929. Let's not forget that he escaped court murder with a single policeman in the face of a court murder. There is also a victim who was fished out of a river eleven years ago that nobody seems to care about. Then it is necessary to lift the disbelief when all the characters seem to be trapped inside the Wax Museum (though Inspector O'Matthews manages to swing his thick, wet tail through a window). Why is Joan Valerie (as Cream's assistant) in this movie? She can not even handle the pincers properly - I know Chan suffers the same boo-boo, but yes, he's 66 years old (and has less than 10 lines) and her character's motivation is too weak to ever to be adequately 'splained' (excuse me if I'm on a parole, I write like Ricky Ricardo.) The character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is described as a zealous, wide-eyed idiot who seems to be romantic only for the vapid Horndog's interest exists Lawyer Tom Agnew (played by the ferret-faced Ted Osborne) Why is Willie Fern a character? Why could not McBirney's henchman hit the switch at 8:20 (no spoiler, okay ?!) With the IQ of lint, he manages to To dress himself or why he had not stepped in front of a bus years ago: Toler himself gets a little more effective rope than usual (a plus) and the real kudos go to the stage designer Thomas Little and cameraman Virgil Miller, who created a really scary atmosphere ... but this entry has less logic than a movie by Ritz Brothers mocking how a toothpick can be used as a blowgun.
