Rent this from my local blockbuster titled SPECK - so you can search for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several nurses in Chicago in the 1960s. When watching the film, you feel that it follows the crime to the letter. Unfortunately, this is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was the almost constant music that let us know that this was a scary movie and a horrible story that let us know what it was motivating bacon. The drama was average for this type of film; To give credit where credit is due, the film is beautifully photographed for my taste. Their mileage can vary. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the topic, it may be worth your time.
