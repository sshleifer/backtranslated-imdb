"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one of the not-so-well-known early American Hitchcock films. But if "Lifeboat" (which, unfortunately, also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the films signed by the then suspense master (early 40s) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, it is not really a loss not to discover this movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is an average and conventional screwball comedy in which it is difficult to find the touch of Hitchcock. Perhaps you can catch a glimpse of his shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is eventually capable of (but hidden in an impersonal package), in a dizziness scene where two of the characters are trapped above from a fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother. And that's it! Even for the Hitchcock fan, there is little to connect with. <br /> <br /> And there's not much more to the screwball comics amateurs: nothing is over the top to be really funny, and we're a long way from Hawks masterpieces. And if one or two scenes are quite amusing, there is not even the funniest in Hitchcock's filmography, which has created weird situations in almost all of his films (even "psycho" might be considered a very dark humor). So there's really little to save in this movie that will not annoy anyone (or maybe just the two hardcore fans of Hitchcock and the screwball comedy that falls in love with Carole Lombard), one of the not-too-familiar early American Hitchcocks Movie.
