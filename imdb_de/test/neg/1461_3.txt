When I saw "Race Against Fear" for the first time (do not you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to scratch my head again and again. Was that meant seriously? Why could not the main character even walk like a normal person, let alone a star runner? How did I know that the coach was evil just a minute after the movie? All these questions and no answers. Then I just let the inhuman script and horrible direction sweep me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie became funnier by the minute and I am now one of my top ten junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented, but the material was flawed - I disagree. Not only does she not convince me that she's an athlete, she's wide-eyed through the rest of the story as if she's just landed on Earth. Maybe the carriage broke out of jail and got her killed ... at least I hope so.
