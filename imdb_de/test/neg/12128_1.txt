Maybe I was too young when I saw it. Maybe I did not grow up with Grease and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I did not make it. I get "black" comedy (Black Adder etc.). I get irony and parodies. I do not understand that. <br /> <br /> I've made it my mission to find out the name of this movie (the help of people in Usenet and the best IMDb forums) so it could be my first 1-pointer. Dreadful!
