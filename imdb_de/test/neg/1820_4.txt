It 's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it' s not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. Rickman comes into these mediocre movies? Judas Kiss has several wonderful actors, an interesting conspiracy and intriguing twists, but the weird visual detours and the hacking cut destroyed a great crime drama. In many scenes, important information seems to be missing to explain the character's actions: why did our hero immediately become suspicious of his bosses? Why did he mistrust the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly could not say if the director meant Judas Kiss as a legitimate detective or campaign parody. Why else would he throw into a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene for the first two minutes (this little surprise has certainly chased me to the remote because my kids were playing nearby!)? Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such dreadful New Orlean accents? As an Alan Freak, I must confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy, in a crumpled, tired way to take him home. <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a great movie, but there are some fascinating moments, but I do not recommend it, unless you try to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
