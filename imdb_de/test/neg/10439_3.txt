In the middle of the 19th century, the Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia to seek part of the gold of the continent. Instead, Mr. Hopper is branded and thrown into a painful prison. There he is raped by a gang. Following his release, Hopper joins with aboriginal David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge on the sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Finally, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and supported by ordinary people and hunted down by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "barely human" performance certainly fits the unrelated feel of the film. Mr. Gulpilil leads a strong supporting role. Mad Dog Morgan employees are not only worth a look, they are also a big disappointment. Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora - Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
