I'm sorry, people, anyone who thought this movie might be something great, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard the movie wanted was completely ruined by a very simple storyline. So easy, that the film develops only at the end. I was wondering if this was not the plot, but the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I've found the character is inconsistent. Either he is a professional killer or a brother with guilt feelings. But both things do not go together, because the child he tries to lead puts him in dangerous situations in which there is no professional killer himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a handsome actor, but he played his character somewhat unnatural. I did not believe his acting, it looked like the director was trying to rob him of a personality he could not offer. And he did not have to, because his less crazy behavior was scary enough. The only one whose show was great was Diane Lane. If not you, I would give this movie a star. <br /> <br /> Finally, I expected to see a well-played movie and an interesting storyline. And I totally blew it away with my high expectations.
