Film Noire is a genre that requires a degree of tact, prudence, intellect and imagery. This movie does not have any of this, although they have really worked hard with the pictures. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie your cousin Marky, the dump truck, is always talking about how he's going to make it big The movies would one day do. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is made of wood and lifeless. While the visuals are obviously expensive to produce, they are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably because of his lack of cerebral capabilities. The acting ranged from below average to just bad. The story may have been saved by a real writer and director, but I suspect that such people would not have touched it with a barge. <br /> <br /> At about a quarter of the way, I've noticed striking similarities with the scene in Sim0ne, where Viktor, desperate to get rid of his actress, makes the worst movie in the world. I figured I'd check IMDb to see if there was a similar effect in this movie, and to my surprise, it does. I'm almost tempted to award a 2 out of 10 points just because it's exposed to the demanding groupies, but I will not do it. It is so bad.
