First of all, even IMDb will go down with this movie as the list of actors is VERY "gappy". Even main characters like Buddy are missing here. <br /> <br /> Now back to the movie. I like to watch movies, but this has tormented me for 82 or so many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much is that I was pretty much looking forward to seeing it before. <br /> <br /> The line of action itself is good. It could have been a great movie if done right and carefully discarded. Golden Brooks was a huge disappointment. I see now that the only role in which she can be good is the loud, fun-loving, energetic sexy chick she plays with Girlfriends. Melodramatic roles are not for her. She basically killed her character Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some of the actors like Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they could not save this catastrophic movie. Of course, it's just my personal opinion that I can not stand Hill Harper as a man, and he did not help me like him here any more. The voice of Golden Brooks disturbed me so much that I actually had to force myself to finish the film. It seemed she was whispering all over the joint. The director, with whom I did not even waste board space, did so badly. The cut, photography / camera focus and pretty much everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and often downright weird (if it makes you cry and look deep inside yourself). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was seriously messed up. I would NOT recommend it to anyone unless they are a cinematographer and want to see an example of their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a nice day, all !!!
