1) Bad spectacle. <br /> <br /> 2) For a number of Castaways on a strange planet, it looked like home, especially the houses and streets you can see in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) Terrible plot with stupid characters making idiotic decisions and tirelessly losing precious survival gear and clothes left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 5) An interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching Space 1999 often). Too bad it's so early in the air. The escape ship was also sunk too fast. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists might find some aspects of the film interesting in relation to the behavior of primate groups.
