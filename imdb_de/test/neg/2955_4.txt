Mild spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's lackluster first talkie. She and Dressler look like the only ones who know what they're doing in this movie. The old man playing Garbos father (George F. Marion) in the movie is soooo ah-noying !! Everything he does is stumbling drunk in a completely wrong way and yelling "dat alt dah-veel sea". He accuses Garbo's "past", his whole life and everything at sea! He seems like a stupid X 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the rough 'n' Tumble sailor Garbo falls in love with, and he's fine, but nothing really outstanding when Garbo unleashes her "terrible secret" about Bickford and her father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats perfectly with Bickford on the table. Then he soon goes on a tirade across the sea. <br /> <br /> I almost had to force myself to finish Anna Christie. It is melodramatic and creaking in many places. There are many good early talks, but this is not one of them. If you have not seen Garbo yet, try something else in front of Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
