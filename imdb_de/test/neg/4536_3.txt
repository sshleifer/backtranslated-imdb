Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto, who temporarily removed Neoedision and flixer.com (a formerly promising online film community) because of his film direction and method of filmmaking for his next film GIRL'S BEST FRIEND. <br /> THE HOLE suffers this "Look at me, I'm a filmmaker" style of filmmaking, which is becoming the current Hollywood standard, to the detriment of the content. <br /> <br /> THE HOLE actually begins with a unique concept, but this concept and the promise to destroy captivating content soon will be destroyed by the "look at me" style of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments that still seem to be on the lookout, but it's a painful short film to watch. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when the new generation of "filmmakers" choose not to be a servant of history, but to dominate on and off the screen. Heck, they do not care as long as they get their studio offer, a beach house and a new car, content and presentation are secondary issues. <br /> <br /> The really sad part of all this is Hollywood embracing the "look at me" attitude so much that the overall aesthetics of filmmaking change. Instead of presenting a story in a simple way that puts history first, today's directors become "experimental," "look at me." <br /> <br /> Is it me or I am the only one who was really asked before Sena, the first few minutes of SWORDFISH. This movie went beyond Sena's directorial efforts to the movie "look at me". Unfortunately, this short film by Mr. Ishimoto is not the case. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 ratings by Elec Tv.
