I do not know how this movie got so many positive comments. You can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but these things do not make up for the empty storyline that was filled with sexual allusions. I wish I had not wasted time watching this movie. Instead of being biographical, this was a bad excuse to promote foreign and unsightly behavior. It was just another attempt by Hollywood to convince us that this life is normal and in order. I've been wondering from the start what's in the movie, and I kept looking, hoping that would change, and was pretty disappointed that it went on like this. I'm so glad I did not spend the money to see it in a theater!
