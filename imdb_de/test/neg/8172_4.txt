Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago and wanted to cast Dilip Kumar in the lead role. The film was finally rewritten and recorded in 2003, so the theme seems temporary and too superficial. > <br /> Like the reason why Amitabh-Hema is separated is too superficial, even if the youth is shown, it is too bad, as Gulshan in AVTAAR. <br/> <br/> The news is good, but things are cliched. Salman's character is the worst, looks right out of a picture book, while Bachchan's high point speech is good and also the ending, the sons do not forgive, is good. <br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra is doing a good job. Music is decent Songs that are sung by Bachchan are outstanding. <br /> <br /> As usual, Amitabh excels in playing an older, strict dad, but here he plays a victim and portrays it well. His last speech is great Samir Soni is alright, Naseer and the other sons and wives are decent, though Divya Dutta notices ke, Mahima is okay. Paresh and Lillete are adorable
