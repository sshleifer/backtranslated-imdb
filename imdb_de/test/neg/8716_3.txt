But even cartoons need a plausible plot line. I believe that in 1934 some of this audience would enjoy this lukewarm farce long ago. It does not age well. Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts receive experienced and knowledgeable support players who take the lead. Pendelton, who is prominently featured in the Thin Man series, is trying his best, but is outscored by his witless plot. Since the scenery is a stage play with gangsters, it is not exactly original material. Movies Rescue is the ever-winning Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But do not waste your time looking at Everett in this movie. I would encourage everyone to observe him in his efforts in Holiday, along with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Same era of 1936, but much better script and story. Better gag and needless to say, Star Power.
