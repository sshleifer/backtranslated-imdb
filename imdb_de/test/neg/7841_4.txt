Although predictable and invented, not a bad movie. It maintains what Van Damme hopes. The ubiquitous "twin" device is reused (as in a large number of Van Damme's films), but it only bothers longtime fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth seeing. Action is decent, not spectacular for Van Damme, but exciting. I can recommend fans of Van Damme and even those who do not have an action movie with a good looking head couple. The Russian Mob is a nice concept and up to date for the day. Of course not his best movie, but by no means his worst.
