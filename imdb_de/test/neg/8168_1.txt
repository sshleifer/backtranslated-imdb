This is a movie that reminds me of avatars with Rajesh Khanna from the 80s. The question of the parent-child divide is interesting, but it was handled in a rather unoriginal way. The characters were not fully developed, and the children seemed to go from extreme love (in the first 15 meters of the film) to a completely carefree relationship, this transformation was not credible, to say the least. You examined this a little more closely. amitabh and jaya were miscast like this helpless old couple. first of all, amit was not too convincing in this role because he just did not look like he should be helpless. I mean, why not just work back where it's needed instead of being w / kids they did not want .. hema was not convincing, as 60 year old either ... she did not look over 50 years old. .. then there was the whole story of the book Baghban, which won the Booker Prize, which brought credibility .. all in all, a movie that dealt with an important topic, but was made better, I give it 5/10
