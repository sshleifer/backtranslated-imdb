I really tried, but this movie just did not work for me. The action scenes were boring, the drama was surprisingly bad and some of these characters were too stereotypical to even be funny. Pam Grier tries, but if you have nothing to do, her considerable talent can not prevent a catastrophe. Even with the standards of this weak genre, this movie is pretty bad.
