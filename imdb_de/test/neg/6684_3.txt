First, the recent campaigns of this film are a huge hoax. Judging from the cover, you might think that this was a kind of scandal movie in which Kylie played a character who had sex, took drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap market plan. She is hardly there and does not do any of the things. The marketing here is incredible and I'm surprised the filmmakers do not mind. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was a big disappointment to me. It seemed like a Sunset Beach episode directed by a Quentin Tarantino in her teens. And that's not a compliment, mind you. <br /> <br /> I think the film's weakness is history above all else. It does not seem to work for anything. Hardly any teens stumbling around and living on the edge. The characters themselves have a certain personality, but the film does not use its potential. As I said, there is no history of substance here. It seems too much to engage in cool dialogues and looks like a colorful MTV ad. It definitely has that feeling. <br /> <br /> I guess some people like it, but I would say that there are far better films.
