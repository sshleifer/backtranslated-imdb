Amnesian women who take off their clothes in an instant (or a blouse?) Are the only salient points in a movie that are otherwise slow and aimless. Although the basic premise of history offers a wealth of possibilities, they are never satisfactorily developed and exposures are almost non-existent. A large part of the film consists of walks through the corridors of a multi-storey clinic / clinic. The overall effect is bleak and sterile, like THX-1138.
