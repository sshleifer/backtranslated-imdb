Simon West's remake of the horror classic of 1979 is a pathetic attempt to bring the thrill of the old school to contemporary audiences. Talented teenager Camilla Belle joins in when a Stanger Calls does not even make you look shocked or even surprised. Bad attempts to scare the audience range from blurry coats that look like humans to tense music for a cat that walks out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay her dad a bill by babysitting. She is invited to work in a riverside house for the night and believes that this is an easy way to earn money. But little does she know, a stranger lurking in the house and constantly harasses Johnson over the phone. A pathetic apology for a movie.
