I know that many people would call certain movies "the worst of times", but I believe that Redneck claims this price. A combination of quite a terrible spectacle by both Mark Lester and Telly Savales and the progression of the plot that challenges faith. <br /> <br /> To Telly Saveles: Was he drunk when he acted? He seems to play a cunning, laughing madman without conviction. Maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, I do not know. <br /> <br /> To Mark Lester: A performance that is more wood than a joinery. His cut-off British sounds do not belong in this film; and his transformation from a protected teenager into a gangster apprentice in 24 hours is crazy. And the strip scene with Mosquito has no relevance to the plot; Maybe the director likes something like that. <br /> <br /> Plot Logic: If Memphis and Mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why does not Mark Mark's mother say or do anything to get her son out of the car before the Loonies chase it away? She lets them all go without saying a word !! On the other hand, you have to see Redneck - you can not believe how bad it is!
