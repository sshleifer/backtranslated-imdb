I seem to disagree with many people here. But I really did not find this movie as brilliant as the reviews I read. It was, without a doubt, a touching story, and the background of the partition provided the space for an epic. But the movie was a flop. especially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. Despite the lead played by Sunny Deol and the incessant songs, I have to say that Gadar is the better of the two. The story is practically the same. Partition did not create any depth in their characters as well as in the scenes that should have an impact. Kristin Kruek's accent and the smallvile image that was not easy in itself. the characters just did not seem too real. not that I criticized the acting of one of the leaders. it just did not work. The atmosphere was well worked up, but the movie was really lacking in substance. Not that I'm a hardened Rambo fan, but some action cuds have gone through the movie or a character development. It all seemed like a rush to the finish. and the ending added only to the dissatisfaction of the viewers. <br /> <br /> Nonetheles, I have to say that it was at least a good effort of the director who was in seemingly unknown terrain. and if you have not seen gadar yet, then you even like it.
