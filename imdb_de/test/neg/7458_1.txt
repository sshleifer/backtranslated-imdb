Everything about this movie is bad. everything. Ridiculous haircuts of the 80s. Ridiculous mustaches. Ridiculous action and fight scenes, in which one can actually see that the opponents do not even meet. Bad, bad, bad music of the 80s. Repeated scenes of people running through forests. A villain with a silver plastic hand and stupid hair. Stupid dialogue. The action does not exist. Everything looks extremely cheap. This movie even surpasses "Plan 9 from outer space" in its utmost viciousness. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny bad", it's just bad.
