This movie is very similar to the Cannibal Holocaust. If there was not the unnecessary animal killing in the name of 'shock' ("Oh, let's watch, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films"), these films would find their way to my dusty classics shelf - I am a big fan of cannibal movies and zombies. But as it stands, this is another example of a shock that clutters the last straws of the pile to make desperate efforts to make a bad movie more hype. In summary, it can be said that a crunchy gusset strip with limited appeal acts. A fan of 70's Gore should try this, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should pick something better for their popcorn party.
