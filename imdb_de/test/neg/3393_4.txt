Here is the reason why this movie has fallen far short of its potential (I do not read a lot, so I do not care what the novel was like). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man from Lambert's Tarzan. It was stiff and although his Tarzan reputation was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. You screwed up the story. Maybe the book will work that way, but as far as I can remember, Tarzan's first comments were "Me Tarzan, you Jane." Jane is the first encounter with human Tarzans. I liked the natives in the Weismuller version a little more than the shoe polish, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. Tarzan is first and foremost a love story. I'm sorry, but the love interest enters the picture for over an hour. That qualifies her for a supporting role. Supporting roles and leads do not coincide, not enough time on screen, sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell extremely pathetic (most likely because her strong southern accent could not be masked). The chemistry between Tarzan and Jane was an incredible 0. I never believed that they loved each other, which meant that the Belgian guys closed their voice frankly stupid. When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you like, a feeling he has never experienced before. Jane reveals humanity in him and he brings out the untamed side of her. It is this chemistry that makes up the story of Tarzan. It's not that Lord Greystoke's dying wish is to completely preserve his land, and this young boy will do it for him. Even a good face lift could not help this movie. It needs massive internal reconstructions. Oh, and could we possibly be shooting more in the jungle, or at least using camera angles that do not represent the soundstage like the qualities of the place. Final verdict, 4 out of 10. I'm sorry, Tin-man, and if you really want to act, drop Lambert and look at Leonardo Dicaprio.
