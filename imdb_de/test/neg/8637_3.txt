When George Sluizer was told that he could make an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei" / the film "Spoorloos" (outside Holland, this film is also called "The Vanishing"), he was told that this would only happen when the ending was changed - he was told that the American public would not approve of the original ending. Of course the original ending is much better and without it the movie loses its effect. Since I have already included this in the trivia area, I will not give the original end and keep my comment spoiler-free. If you want to know the original ending, look at "Spoorloos" or read the book. This movie is absolute rubbish and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I do not like. Take a look at the original Dutch movie, one of the best thrillers in the world.
