Man this thing bites! I am sorry that I ever sat down! Friedkin was insane because he had made a film to win the audience's sympathy for this maniac. If it were up to me, I would have made the audience hate that shitty life, instead of looking at it with all the gloomy eyes! He killed people! Pretty grizzly I could add too! And Friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he is "not right"! I say, Friedkin can forget it! I hate the guy on which this movie is based in part and hope that they are wise and give the juice to his sad butt !!! Do not waste your time in a nutshell! It is sick and perverted!
