Okay, I had pretty high expectations. The controversial topic was a good concept. As a horror fan, I admit that I was fascinated and very excited. <br /> <br /> It turned out they had a great idea, but it was done terribly. Just take a look. This movie seems to run in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be. The "happy" parts that I believe should be different from the "dark" parts do not work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The movie changes very badly between these 3 modes, I can not say how much the director and the editing shit. There is sex in the most unappetizing and un-erotic way. I do not complain, but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and filler. The characters are unlikely except for Paula (Potente). Her friend from Munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies I've met recently. <br /> <br /> There is an action that I do not go into detail stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. There's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy. Do not try to understand everything, because there are huge storylines here. <br /> <br /> It's all so modest that you do not care about the victims, the perpetrators, anyone. And to think that could have been great. I can only say one good thing about it, the film sheds light on today's unethical medical procedures. With the advancement of genetics and controversial sciences, this could be a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions. But you will not find that here, just a series of scenes that are loosely put together with people and things you do not care about. <br /> <br /> Skip this and look at Flatliners instead. <br /> <br /> 3/10
