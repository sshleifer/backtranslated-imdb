Made in New South Wales, the Australian film titled BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for his various releases is problematic for his producers right from the beginning, with multiple personality conflicts and a longer shooting time that prematurely consumes his assigned budget sometimes quite detailed, under the usual rework finishes and too much cutting paths is the matter. Tom Skerritt plays as Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with a "passion for building" who is building a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains. Unaware of the fact that his business partner Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, far more than the actual value, and plans to destroy them as a result of normal summer fires to obtain a handsome sum through fraud , In accordance with this unauthorized plan, Fane initiates an arsonist who does the arson, a young man who also happens to be a friend of Anderson's daughter, and because the future resort is in the midst of a critical fire department (one of the many inexplicable elements of the script). Julian has the expectation that his insidious design comes about without any serious obstacle. Since the local insurance company affected by the crime is majority-owned by Fane, the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters, Lloyd's of London, employ senior investigator George Engels (James Mason) to investigate the nature of the crime, including death More sinister may be the murder case of an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who appears to have come close to the cause of the arson in the following clues. The backdrop for the film is the week before Christmas, the keystone of summer on the antipodes, a dramatic backdrop, but the connections within the story are not pieced together smoothly, resulting in events being presented that are more difficult for a viewer to follow Problem with unpredictable processing, the aforementioned sharp cut and poor sound and image quality. Sembl√©comatous and booming style is abruptly suppressed by this subdued sound processing, but Mason, as always, is very effective and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes as a premature investigator. Doleman wins acting laurels with his appearance as malicious Julian Fane.
