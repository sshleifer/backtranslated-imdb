As Americans, we expect Crapiness as "par for the course" when it comes to HORROR and unknown directors staging unknown actors for unknown writers. We assume that this is really shit and if they do not suck, this will be a success overnight. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a success, neither over the weekend nor over the month. This works from start to finish and my only recommendation is to go into that knowledge, enjoy it, what it is, what it is not & if you have something better to do, leave it on the back of the burner. It's entertaining to see older people crossing a busy street during rush hour, but you should not expect much - they are almost never hit by a real car, it's just a lot of old people.
