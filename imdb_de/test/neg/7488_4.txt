It is clear that Andreas Bethmann wants to wear the crown of Jess Franco, while he desires the wife of the old workhorse, Lina Romay (at least cinematic). Romay plays in this modern, ambitious W.I.P. Movie. With a few exceptions, many of Franco's films are improperly produced and directed in a sluggish, hurried manner. Recordings do not always intersect and the sound mixes can be terrible. While looking at "Angel of Death 2" (aka "Prison Island Massacre"), I was wondering if Bethmann deliberately tried to reproduce Franco's patent cunning, or is he just like his mentor? Is this film intentionally bad, what would be self-destructive, or is it just neglected? After a hitchhiker is forced to blow a gun, her rapist fills her mouth and then her vagina with drugs. A few minutes later, for unexplained reasons, she is taken to a prison on a cliff, where she is exposed to denial and hard dealing with employees and other inmates. Since this is a WIP movie, there are many lesbian scenes and lots of violent behavior. The blood is bloody and sadistic, with pleasures like pulling teeth and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame, but in every frame there is a love for sleaze and an understanding of what trash fans like. Unfortunately, the flat script makes for a flat movie. Despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex and a guest appearance by Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But are not these the most Jess Franco films?
