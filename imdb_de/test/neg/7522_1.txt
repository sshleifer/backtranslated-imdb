After reading the novel, which has been read for about an hour, watching this movie became a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in Prince of Egypt, Simon Wells somehow managed to write a screenplay that took all the drama and mystery out of his source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I'm a fan of cheese and lager, but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or in any humor. There was no thrill, and that stupid bookend with Addy's character throwing Filby into the air with his hat was the last straw. I felt very hurt when this movie ended, and I still refuse to believe that it only took 90 minutes. I wondered how the studio and the director could have done such a lousy script, but then my friend suggested the film to me exactly as it was, and I said that sounds great, but what happened to the movie? ?
