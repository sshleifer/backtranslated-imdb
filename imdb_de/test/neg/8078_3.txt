A few teenage dirt bikers are out in the woods and driving in circles. You have fun. They do not know that nature is released by an Emo refugee from a movie by Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes. He is equipped with matches and firearms. And he has a bleeding eye or something. Why light a park? I do not know. Maybe he does not like Smokey the bear or something. But he wears army / navy business jerseys, if that helps. <br /> <br /> The rangers send a single helicopter to fight the emerging flame; That's all you ever see except a few people in a base who talk a lot about the fire, but do nothing. A police officer, a ranger or a militiaman or whatever he is falls from the helicopter on a broken leash. <br /> <br /> Everyone now rides their dirt bikes as if auditioning for motocross. They bang wheelies forever, jump with Evel Knievel, turn around, etc. They argue incessantly. Recordings of the fire are as fake as a 3-dollar bill; It's the same material from a dozen different angles, and the flame never grows or moves. And you never see a fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> SyFy Channel movie that includes about 0% science fiction. What you can expect from it: bad drama, cheap effects and a story that goes nowhere (like bicycles and fire go nowhere). Laughable sleepless healing.
