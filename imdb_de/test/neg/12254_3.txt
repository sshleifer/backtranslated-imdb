Although this must be the nadir of season six, this lingering episode is not bad written or acted. It's just that most of us were anxious for the X-Files to grab horror / thrillers that end without simple answers and move toward dark but unfathomable plots. The sixth season featured a series of witty comedies that undermined the continuity of the show and, frankly, made Simpsons' Halloween specials look like a great thriller TV. In this episode, Victoria Jackson of SNL Fame plays the boring girlfriend of a man posing as a rainmaker. But her weatherman boss is the one who really loves her, and Mulder needs to get advice on his dating to leave the city. <br /> <br /> There is some playful fun in the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but not over-demanding characterization of Midwestern Hicks. It's not something you want to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It's hard to find Season 6. The creator of X-Files, Chris Carter, seems to be bored with the whole story of the "conspiracy of syndicates" and leaves the responsibility to the black comedy writer.
