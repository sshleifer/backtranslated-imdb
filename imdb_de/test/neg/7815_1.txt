This is by far the most horrific movie I have ever seen. I have never rated a movie with 1 in 10. My advice is not to look at him. This is not even classified as a movie. <br /> <br /> It would be better if you would rather sit on the couch bored than watch this movie. The spectacle was terrible, but the worst thing was the plot. Very unlikely sequence of events that are not even funny. They are actually very lame and stupid. A very stupid decision by Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid, who are involved in this film. Could even upset her career a bit. <br /> <br /> When I entered Blockbuster, the focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret this. <br /> <br /> If you are only 10 or 20 minutes before the movie, you can basically predict what would happen. I was hoping it would get better, but instead it got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating. The movie is awful. Do not look at it. Hope that helps.
