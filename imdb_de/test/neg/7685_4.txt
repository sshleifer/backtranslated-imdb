Ivan The Terrible is more a filmed stage play than a "big-screen opus". Citizen Kane - in many ways a similar work - is the opposite (in the way we expect such a tariff), as there are for example many locations for filming locations. <br /> <br /> Acting is intended to convey a sense of motivations and thinking of the character for the audience; If you manage to understand the character, what does it matter, HOW was it done? And how, given the small amount of events, should one express events that influence history, and consequently the machinations and decisions of characters except "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> There is also a historical level why the acting style should not be surprising. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced the backward filmmakers to make films as they knew it. Being denied access to more modern works showing the development and techniques of cinema, they used only what they knew. The Nazi control of the Nazis in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the twenties because of their total control over this film industry. And propaganda films can only "entertain" German troops like that; hence the need for popular German silent films of the twenties. Many of Ivan The Terrible's techniques had come from such German films that were made available to the film crew (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There was nowhere confusion and although it was personally found Ãœberhyped is by no means a bad cinematic experience - and definitely NOT among the worst movies ever. The drama is fine and part of the cinematography (even by today's standards, more on that below). By no means a popcorn strip; you can not leave your brain outside this door. Maybe outdated and very symbolic - worth a look only on the big screen, if you can not watch the movies at home with the lights off, because many of the cinematic elements will be lost in the main thing of the B & W experience of these films. It all depends on what you expect ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: Do not read the comments below if they affect your personal view of the movie or movies. <br /> <br /> ... and if you do not mind the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan, Stalin saw himself - obviously in his influence on the direction of the film (see other comments) - and anyone who is world-historically aware outside of the US perspective will definitely understand this. Maybe Ivan was or was not an earlier incarnation of Stalin; This is more a shame on Stalin and his motivations, decisions, loneliness, promotion of lackeys etc. - using the person of Ivan - as any true historical account of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of certain colors in the sequel: Red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the US) during certain shots when the usurper wears the crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many excellent visualizations, such as the profound use of shadow or the outside shot of the begging people Ivan returns to Moscow.
