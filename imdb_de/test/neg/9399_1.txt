Ridiculous, disgusting doggerel with terrible spectacle; awkward, superficial and condescending, he scours through all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, about divorce and midlife. The lead actor nervously straightens the way through the film, trying to portray the appropriate level of self-satisfied self-pity the worthless character and script demand. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can not have been that bad! The camera is permanently outfitted with an earthy yellow "Tuscan" lens filter (maybe the Tuscan sun was not Tuscan enough?) That they forgot when the scene moves to Rome and (how inventive!) The Amalfi Coast. You have never seen the white marble of the Vittorio Emmanuelle monument in Rome look so yellow ... I mean Tuscany. One of the worst films of all time and therefore worth a look.
