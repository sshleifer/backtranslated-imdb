After the success of Star Wars, interest in sci-fi movies increased. This was one of those cheap attempts to make quick money. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors of a spaceship on a planet on which stop-motion dinosaurs live, where half of them are systematically killed (humans are not the dinosaurs). Porn movie theater. Cheap special effects, also for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort has been invested in them. <br /> <br /> Costumes were pure 70s, as were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70s. I expected a disco to break out at any moment. <br /> <br /> Nothing is recommended in this film.
