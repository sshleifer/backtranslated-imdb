This is one of those road movies that would tell you something about women, the universe, the better life, the terrible loneliness of the brilliant Manhattan architect, who is all connected to all people, including his three-year-old child who has it all seems irresponsible. Actually, the hero undoubtedly wins on selfishness and the scene with his old schoolmate, which begins as a kind of conversation from ancient times and ends threateningly, is the oasis in a desert movie. <br /> <br /> The scene with-the-father-who-was-home-as-I-was-a kid was told and told and TOLD. Of course, it did not stop the offspring from paving their way. And if you see the attitude of Hero's wife, you may think she never heard of Women's Library. <br /> <br /> Best of all, the soundtrack contains great songs by Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt ... but you can enjoy them without this boring, presumptuous work.
