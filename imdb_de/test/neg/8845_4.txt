The design, locations and photography are of great use in this film. It is a turgid and melodramatic affair that exposes the limitations of cinema to convey the truth. The case is the use of soundtrack music: a mixture of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber, which is constant and loud and would have forced Max Steiner to grimace at his excessive use, as it makes the audience aware of how difficult it is is; how ecstatic; how tormented it is to be an artist. And then it really counts that the story triggers the details in the end. <br /> <br /> This intensified and cheesy exploitation of emotions was once ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd via a Yukio Mishima book: This is not writing, but Barbara Cartland. The same criticism can be made about this film: a misleading, mavkic vanity project.
