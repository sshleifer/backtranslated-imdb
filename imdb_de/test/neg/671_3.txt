I am surprised that so many comments on this film are positive. After the book has been read several times (and all other historical novels by Mika Waltari), there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story, I could think of it as a reasonably good epic. Bringing such a brick book on the big screen is of course a task that should not be envied, but it could be done with the lesson. I can not understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov, as Kaptah and Marlon Brando would probably have made Sinuhe better, but the general attitude is to Hollywood to ever live up to the book. Mind you, Mika Waltari left the premiere of this movie in the middle of the show. He liked it that way.
