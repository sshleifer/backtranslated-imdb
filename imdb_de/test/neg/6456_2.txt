A "revenge" movie has something wonderful in it. Everyone wakes up in the morning and thinks he / she is the star of the movie. Anyone who interferes in his personal agenda is in some ways the enemy. Revenge Plot movies work well when a person has low self-esteem. Instead of defending himself at the moment, the "hero" relies on the built-in fear of living a single act of power to restore balance. Of course, in the "real world", this kind of revenge rarely solves the tension because life is not a movie. After the revenge is done, the actions have their own consequences. A good revenge strip helps people to ignore this bitter pill. The credits roll in the movies and all responsibilities are solved. <br /> <br /> "Swim with sharks" is being promoted as a comedy, no doubt an act of the producers, to find out how to sell this weirdness. It's dark, but it's not a dark comedy ("Company Of Men" and Todd Solondz's work is getting much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal that they are "torture porn" in front of the current genre that everyone is so obsessed with ("Saw", "Hostel"). There are some laughs. There's also laughter in "Saving Private Ryan," but it's not called comedy. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this movie is that it did not deserve revenge. It is allegedly a young man who is abused by his boss and finally takes his boss hostage to "pay him back" for all abuses. The hero (fittingly, "guy") is an "everyman," so vague that we literally know nothing about him. What does he do with his free time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get to where he is? What are his interests (this becomes an ongoing theme in the film, undoubtedly inspired by the author's own struggle ... "What do you want?", The answer we're denied by a vague cheat of an end)? It's very difficult to take care of such a character, even if he has done well (even Tom Hanks is in the wrong role for crawling, like "punchline"). Kevin Spacey as boss "Buddy" is said to be a monster, but is too charismatic as an actor. The best laugh came when he abused his assistant - he seemed almost as surprised as the audience is likely to be, which Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is tortured, the view suddenly becomes empathic for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a sensible monster. By that time, any message the author had missed had been lost; There is no "hero" in this movie, so no reason to worry about it at all. <br /> <br /> One can not assume that this story is based on the author's troubled career in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and I can say that it's not that far-fetched. At that time I had similar wish fulfillment fantasies and thought that I was entitled. I thought you could win the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the ONLY woman - all four of them seem to be in the universe of this movie) just because you are your avid, naive self, and that zeal became a winner and a boss you abused because he was a mean person. Time and tide have shown that most "monsters" are actually just the demons of an individual's personal psyche, and resentments are usually based on the self. If Guy was so unhappy, he just had to leave. The film offers no solution at all, yet the "surprise" ends. We still do not know about the protagonists, we can not even be sure that anything they said was actually founded and everyone likes to have their cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point at all in this story, just to point out that (movie!) The movie business can be pretty brutal. <br /> <br /> There are many good movies that tell solid and satisfying revenge - style fantasies, both the feel-good variety ("9-to5", "Working Girl", "The Devil Wears Prada") also less ("War Of The Roses", the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes")). This is not one of them - despite a hilarious turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role of "Prada" and some interesting works by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly boring creation - forbearance of one Director, who hopefully "worked out everything" ...
