I am very disappointed. First of all, the German synchronization is bad. It might have been better in the original version (with subtitles), but the whole movie looks like director Luna Papa and Black Cat are seeing White Cat and trying to do something in that style as well. But failed in every way. It's an incongruous mix of a weird, incredible story and very childish gags. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sex humor. I chose 2 because 1 is the worst and the other point for "Sybilla", she's really cute. Sorry - I like Eastern movies, but this one is really superfluous.
