Of Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers born often find none. The Beautiful Country is the story of such a child, Binh, who was rejected by his rural village and then looking for his American father. The film begins with green and wild land, but falls into dirty, sweaty ugliness and boredom. The considerable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are on pointless and ill-conceived roles aboard the rusting freighter carrying Binh, wasted and dying brother with seemingly stormy seas over the sea. New York City offers slave labor and stereotypes. Although it is very uneven from the beginning, the curiosity of this film is the last segment. Nick Nolte receives a top bill for the cast. Jokingly, I suggested that he would probably only be in the final scene and not far from the truth. When the journey brings Binh to Texas and his father, the film assumes a calm and austere simplicity. A tough life together connects these two men to a family of father and son. The ninety odd minutes of garbage we've just seen are rewarded by a deep and subtle performance by Nolte as they slowly interact. The credits were rolling and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas-based Terrence Malick.
