Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic womanizer, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse) can be entertaining or fun. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who had to make these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment, but I strongly believe that these films are fueling the fire of hatred and further misogyny. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects, unlike humans. We call ourselves "civilized," but I believe we still have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of the civilized.
