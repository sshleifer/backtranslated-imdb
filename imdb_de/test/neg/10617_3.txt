I saw this movie, which I thought had a promising beginning, but then I ended up disappointed. The problem I think with this movie was that the director was trying too hard to make this movie funny and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" that annoyed me through the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they disappointed me in this movie, they could have done a lot better. This movie seemed promising at the beginning, pulling in the middle and disappointing at the end. The film could never outdo Stanley Kubrick's ingenuity in terms of controversial themes, craziness and originality in movies.
