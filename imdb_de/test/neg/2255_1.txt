That usually sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for walking) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and * will * try * not to urge him to call him a "hack" ... which is pretty hard) Do not enjoy a movie before you see it. With cautious hesitation, I went to the cinema today to see "Inglorious Basterds." <br /> <br /> Well, it would be "unfair", "rip-off rip-off" would be unfair here. Tarantino is fortunate enough to receive the title of Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not his plot points (ie, he assumes all other genres of films). "Inglorious" opens with a Nazi officer and his long interrogation against a farmer who hides Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax as the dialogue is stale and the result is one kilometer away. Of course, one of the hidden Jews escapes (but more later). We (obviously slightly pleased) audience will be with the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, this name sounds almost like B-movie) treats King ALDO RAY .... ha-ha Quentin ... let's get these 'tributes') and this character will be played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt played (sorry, DALLAS was the only good he's ever played in) and Mr. Jolie pampers us to a dog-pounding, southern, grinning NS murderer. In the meantime, Tarantino forgets that adults can actually be present and assumes that the Teenyboppers have not heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'. <br /> <br /> Raines' train consists of (John Cassavettes). bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers, all eager to reward Adolf Hitler. Tarantino, with all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, occupying his long-time best buddy (and his homely colleague) Eli Roth (who wields a baseball bat, the "Bear Jew"). The other guy's name is Hugo Stiglitz (and I bet more than half of the QT fan boys have never heard that name before this movie.) Keep up the good work, Tarantino, you've made about 6 or 7 "homages" so far (in the first 15 minutes) add it on and it might distract from the plot (or lack of it?) <br /> <br /> Still, a long (and extremely boring and tedious) story is too short, both Raine as well as his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the only survivor of the first chapter, both have separate plans to kill Hitler in the demonstration of a propaganda film of the Nazis in a French cinema (owned by the aforementioned survivor, now grown up). <br /> <br /> More boring (and more meaningless) conversations follow, while Pitt takes care of the audience. And any real tension that leads to the murder of the deadliest tyrant of all time is thrown away by the directors' insistence on placing a 1980s David Bowie song in a World War II movie. <br /> <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this film is the recurring problem I have with most Tarantino products ... he rarely knows when to start or stop. I do not need a "homage" to "homage" to get the * joke * (whatever it is) that I received from Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the last crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone knew a compelling score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars. If the best you can do is Barad Pitt, suppose you (Mr. Tarantino) are the main attraction here? I do not want the audience to direct the movie. I pay to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity ... NOT how you (over and over) can patch endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time that the fan guys (on IMDb) do some "hard love" on their "idol" (god knows, if not ... the studios should do that?) <br /> <br /> The Tired old quarrel with Tarantino worshipers is "good if you can do it better ... do it" Let me tell you if I was a 46 year old director with the (unfortunate) train QT ..... I would like to offer you much more than just a warmed-up mess of better WWII films than this threesome. The directors he tried to imitate made movies so bad by mistake or for budgetary reasons. It is a policeman who over and over again hears his fans camping his lack of imagination as "art". I'm sure he will be able to get better (but once he has given him the benefit of the doubt ... and not to mention, two and a half hours of my life ...), maybe he is not?
