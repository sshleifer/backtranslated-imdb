I have the impression that I have seen a different film than most of the other people I know who have seen this movie. It's not really that I found the movie offensive, except that the script for a movie that obviously had a bit of money was incredibly amateurish. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. I knew it was desperate to be Traffic's "racism" version, but I do not think traffic is really a movie worth rapping right from the start. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is the way it shamelessly feeds the public. Does Haggis really believe that we are so stupid as to demand a shot of the gaps? Do you really need to see the phonebook on Farhad's dashboard, with the address circled in black text? Can not we do something for ourselves in logic? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue that was so "on the nose". I've heard that one critic has said that the quality of the dialogue is deceptively high, because although people may not speak that way, they certainly think so. That is irrelevant. It is the task of such a script to use the dialogue in a way that helps to improve the characterization and credibility of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are established. These characters all speak the same voice and speak only about racism. <br /> <br /> The purpose of such a film should certainly be to promote the fact that race should not really be a problem in these situations, but if it makes it the only focus of any scene, it will not a thing inherently racist? The characters wander around with their philosophies and conveniently store statistics on race relations as if they were rubbing fragments from the research essay just written. It is absolutely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A movie should gradually reveal its meaning, not hitting us in the opening scenes, and never fading. I can see that Haggis' intentions were honorable with this film, but I dare say that by directing his own script, he was unable to identify and overcome his shortcomings. I really hope that writers / directors will be very careful in the future as they approach this "mosaic" style of narration. It has been done well a few times, but it is very difficult to find the balance between personal and political rights. And Robert Altman will not be outscored in this department.
