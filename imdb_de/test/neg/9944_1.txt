This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's supposed to be a remake or an update of "The One-Armed Swordsman" by Chang Cheh. Due to the fist-filled directing and the shitty battle choreography, the fight scenes are not even worth seeing. The script tries desperately to look serious, but is full of stereotypes like, "And then I knew that nothing would be the same again ..." or "If only I had known what high price I would have to pay." , And who is the girl who plays sing? Someone finds her and has eliminated her !! She is terrible If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you're in better hands with Lau Gar Leung.
