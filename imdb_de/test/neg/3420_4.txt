Summary: Not very familiar with Macbeth's Shakespeare story, but I suspect that this is quite close to the original and only plays in this day and age. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valued hitman and in the favor of leader Duncan. But he and his wife have higher ambitions than that and are planning the assassination of Duncan and any competition for the throne. This is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death. <br /> <br /> Comments: Very interesting idea, I have to say. However, to use the story, change the setting to the current time, but keep the original (?) Dialog. It represents a great contrast between classical poetic work and violence. Promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that it lives up to, but not in the term I have imagined. It is really bloody, but the violence is slow. Not just in the figurative sense that it is calculated, whatever it is, but also literally. A lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion, and that's what brings the movie to its knees. What could have been a unique strength, the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialogue and the extreme violence is now turning into something completely different. Now both slow down the trigger painfully, so much so that sometimes it gets boring and boring. <br /> <br /> I too can not figure out the context in which the three witches work. Presenting time and reality, I think that such a magic witchcraft had no place in the film. Apparently it does, but it seems completely out of place to me. No subplot, but a complete Substory with its own rules that are completely different from the rest of the film. Seems completely out of place. Certainly it was also possible to turn this part into something modern. Drug-induced hallucinations maybe (which I suspect the director alludes to, but he's left too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now they bring only parts of the film that are clearly next to the story, and I was just waiting for the actual movie to start again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but maybe something for Shakespeare fans <br /> 4/10
