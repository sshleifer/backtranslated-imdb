This movie was written in Blockbusters "Coming Attraction" capital. I was looking forward to the release date, 08/07/02. The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a page splitter, but whoa da; Apart from the "off-the-wall betting events" this was a pretty boring affair. <br /> <br /> This will never be a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it did not help John Cleese's reputation for comedy. Rowan Atkinson, now he was pretty funny, in a kind of Rowan Atkinson!
