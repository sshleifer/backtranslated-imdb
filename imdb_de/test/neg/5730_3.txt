Red Sonja is a career move in the wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. After making a couple of "Sword and Magic" films (as Conan), he had dealt with somewhat more serious acting roles in films such as "The Terminator" and "Commando", only to mysteriously revert to the swordsman genre of the 1985 debacle to return. It's hard to figure out why he bothered, as it's weaker than the two Conan movies in every department imaginable. Supposedly this was to be the third Conan movie, but for some reason the emphasis was on the female protagonist, the ritual redhead, which made poor old Arnold play an incredibly boring minor role. Also think of director Richard Fleischer, who has awarded the world class names like 20,000 miles under the sea, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his penultimate film - Fleischer has also made a gigantic career move. The evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world, and for that she needs a priceless and powerful talisman. She and her brutal army storm a fortress populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman, massacring the helpless priestesses as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery red-haired warrior who, after hearing of her sister's death, swears revenge on the evil poem. Sonja rides over the country in search of Gedren's camp. On the way she picks herself up with a young prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith), traveling companions. She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - Sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her search. Originally, Sonja does not want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), but rather proves that she can attack and defeat her enemies alone, but she warms up to him and accepts his help. Red Sonja is a stunningly bad movie, even more so than you think it was made in 1985, when the genre of sword and sorcery almost came to an end. It seems so simple and amateurish that it could easily be considered an early example of its kind. Overall, the performances are bad, from Bergman's embarrassing OTT villains to Reyes' incredibly irritating spoiled brats to Schwarzenegger's wooden and unimpressed hero. Nielsen is a little better than the heroine - probably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first lead role - but she is greatly disappointed by the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser's script. The film is full of stupidities, including a scene in which Schwarzenegger is seen in close-up shooting down baddies, but in a long shot in the same order, no corpse is in sight. Technically, it is also very unfit, with special special effects and terrifying mechanical monsters. There are some compensations, such as the enjoyable music of Ennio Morricone (Morricone spent much of the '80s delivering good music for terrible movies, such as The Island, Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another compensation is Giuseppe Rotunnos objectification of the filming locations. In fact, it is much more satisfying to look at the beautiful landscape than the actors in the foreground! After Red Sonja, there were very few sword and magic films. In a way, he could go down in history as the movie that destroyed his own genre.
