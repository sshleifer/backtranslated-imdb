This horror movie starts promisingly and there is a moment when I thought "this is going to be really good". In the end, it gets boring rather quickly. The acting is pretty good, as well as the location and the story starts pretty well. The problem is not enough kills on the screen and an end where the monster basically turns its tail and runs. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene, in which I thought the film would improve and become a winner. Unfortunately, the movie showed the monster very little and the back of the DVD had lied when I was told that the desert literally came to life among humans and was able to devour their flesh ... now that would have been a movie , an almost inevitable situation. Granted, that would have made the audience uncomfortable and it could increase the tension, but that's what horror movies should do! Instead, we have very few creature or creature settings, and if we see it, it's mostly on the defensive. Nevertheless, it was not all bad, it just needed more horror, less hunting and more chomping.
