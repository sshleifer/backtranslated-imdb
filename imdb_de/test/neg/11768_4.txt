This movie is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! Acting is ridiculous and Corman has not improved his piranhas since 1978. 90% of the special effects are canceled by Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). Piranha II: The spawn looks like it's on the American Film Institute's list.
