Everything was wrong in this film and I do not know why I watched it until the end. It would have been more fun to see paint dry. For loud crying I even liked D-Tox and it was a lot better than this. Here is the basic story for you: A redneck is bitten by snakes holding the evil of 13 killers and becomes a dead machine killing undead and killing teenagers with zero personality. During the film, I lost hope when it did not scare me at all, when the killings were bad and there was BAD-CGI blood and CGI snakes. It got even worse when the thin cardboard characters killed her friend by holding her by the legs and not letting go, so she was impaled by a tree and when the villain like the shark in Jaws went underwater. I'm still upset why I've ever studied it. I think because I'm a horror movie fan.
