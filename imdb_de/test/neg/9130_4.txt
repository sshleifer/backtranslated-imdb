What I had hoped (or even expected) were the familiar "stop motion" images and extreme slow movements, extreme zooms and all hugging fisheye shots. In short, the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in ways that the human eye is unable to reproduce for the human eye to see. The stuff that made the other hits of Qatsi. <br /> <br /> I was just wondering how making the whole thing would fit the title. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I feel like the focus is on this third part was on the message and not on the packaging. That's fine, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew the message and it seemed like there was nothing left for me. More than half of the film was solarised or colored or transformed by other filters. It looked very much like the effects of your video camera, which you never use. Many of the pictures would have been nicer without the filters, like the giraffe and the zebra search. You could say that "technology or whatever is a human source that has distorted our beautiful nature", but why should these seventies be used to symbolize it? At the point where this cheap-looking effect was more than 10 minutes in a row, I was ready to go. The hope that the rest could not be so bad made me stay. But then there was slow motion: slow motion is good because you have time to analyze the moving picture. However, if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, the movement is not enough to slow down. Please make a note of the movement to slow down faster, as if you would make the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some) of the laughing people and the triplets to soldiers. I admit that archive images can not be recovered, but I've already seen a lot of the footage anyway, it could have been done without it. Searching the archive footage must have been a lot of work, and the effects could not be easily applied and arranged. In addition, much work has been mixed together. It shows that the creator was not concerned with extending the film or sparing oneself. But I did not like the mixed stuff a bit ... The idea behind it was sometimes nice or even smart, but the implementation was inadequate. The computer generated images did not bother me so much, but outdated. The "bits" that flowed along the circuits (in the first part of the movie) looked younger and were nice. Mandelbrot is always fun, the Fractalberg was less. I was glad that a cello played an important role in the music. A little less vibrato at certain times would have been appropriate for Glass's music, but that's a matter of taste. Of course that's all. I hope there will be another Qatsi story soon, in which computer images will play a lesser role, inspiring someone to come back into the field. <br /> <br />
