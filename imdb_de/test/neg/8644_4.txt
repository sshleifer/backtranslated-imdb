William Petersen (this guy from C.S.I) has a small role that is not in the credits, but it's the best part of the movie. His character is smart and hard, and it's a funny surprise to see him. He has a range that allows him to play just about anything. After 5 minutes it looks cool, just not much. They hope that his character reappears in the movie, but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Worth a watch on TMN or pick up at the library, but not much else. Too much reminds you of L.A Confidential, except that the movie where it starts to get complicated is so loose. 2 out of 5 stars
