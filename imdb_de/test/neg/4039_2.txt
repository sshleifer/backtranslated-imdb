As you can see from the other comments, this movie is just the worst movie ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, laughable, lousy, stupid, terrible ... I could go on with such descriptions, but you'll probably get the point. <br /> <br /> I would have given this a 0, if possible - bad acting, bad direction, bad production, bad plot. <br /> <br /> This was done in 2001 and looks more like 1965. Very low budget, boring plot, horrible drama, really bad special effects etc ... <br /> <br /> I rarely see a sci -Fi movie, which I absolutely consider bad. I mean, that's pure garbage. It has nothing to offer either. As for a "B-movie", this is the end of the series. <br /> <br /> I think I would be more entertaining if I stared at a blank sheet of paper for 90 minutes. Junk like this gives good low-budget "B" movies a bad name. This makes Ed Wood movies look good. <br /> <br /> When watching movies with direct video, you see, if you think you've seen the worst, you see something worse! <br /> <DJ Perry is a terrible actor and has no individual traits that set him apart. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh, the humanity!
