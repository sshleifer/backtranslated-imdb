A man wonders if his hunky colleague is gay. At a farm sale he finds a jet cannon called "Gaydar". You point it at a person, press the trigger and it tells you how gay it is. He tries it out, it works, and he sets out to find out if his colleague is gay like him ... <br /> <br /> Promising idea, by an inglorious script (after a promising start) and terrible spectacles was ruined. The entire cast overlaps and basically always sticks together. It gets annoying and after a while very embarrassing. The saving grace is that it's short, there's a scene where the cat is stolen (I love it when it falls out of the kitty's bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his brief moment. But all that does not save the movie. I can not recommend that at all.
