As an ancient movie fan, I had heard a lot about the controversial film, which CALIGULA had ambiguously rated as one of the most realistic epics of some and considered one of the most disgusting pornographic films by others. I decided to see it all in its entirety, to rate it for myself, hoping to find something positive that would accommodate the many allegations against the film. I sat on my chair one fall evening and watched. The initial quote from the New Testament shocked me a little and triggered my first controversy ... Why should I follow a sentence from the Gospel of Mark in the film about pagan Rome? However, the opening scene with a half-naked, half-naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed rather sentimental. The music, which sounded memorable, while the credits provoked me in a positive sense. But the negative feelings that arose in me, especially when Tiberius died. The cruelty seemed very intense and the sexuality exaggerated. It was not so terrible in the middle though. In the second half of the film, I had the feeling that I had not seen a historical epic, but an extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself, "This is one of the films you can really hate" ... I am aware that a film may be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go that far, all the limits of taste to lift. I hate this movie for many reasons, but most of all. CALIGULA does not serve an ancient epic (that it wants to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse. The pornographic magazine aims to combine film art with pornography. I think that's the most serious thing the film can be accused of. Film is an art that should be dominated by taste, message, a sense of epic grandeur while destroying all boundaries of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most vicious and decadent side of man. Some scenes are so disgusting that I do not think there are people whose psyche is not affected. Some say Rome under Caligula's rule was so brutal. Yes that is true. At that time, corruption flourished, and various sexual deviations were preferable to Roman citizens. However, I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations and make them a focus of an old epic. I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> GIANT HISTORICAL ERRORS: The screenplay by Gore Vidal is known for inaccuracies. It stands out, for example, in the figure of Prokulus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. However, the film shows him as a simple soldier, whom Caligula imposes on his most decadent forms of torture and rape. In addition, Livia was not a wife of Proculus, who was raped at her wedding by Caesar. What's behind it, transforming the stories of historical characters into stories of incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife along with his sister Drusilla. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after his sister's death. The sexual abuse of his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical foundation. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure idea of ​​the director, which has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST: From a technical point of view, the film is nothing special. Cinematography can not boast exceptionally well, and the sets and costumes are nothing out of the ordinary. However, the only strength of the film are the performances, especially those of Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. In the lead role, which represents the madness and cruelty of the Emperor, he is perfect. McDowall increases the value of the movie. If you disturb everything in CALIGULA, you can at least admire its performance. I also introduced Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (though the movie is based on a gossip by Suetonius Caligula loved his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole plays his best in the Capri Grotto sequence, depicting the decadence and exhaust of the old Emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA is the performances. Therefore I do not rate the movie as 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The film's historical inaccuracy goes hand in hand with little continuity. Let's just analyze the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto, where he sees the terrible joys of old Tiberius. After about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome, where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed is a bad omen. And immediately the characters are back in Capri, where Nerva (John Gielgud) dies ...? <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not recommend anyone to visit CALIGULA. If you want to learn the story, read Robert Graves' novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch the mini-series by Herbert Wise with the magnificent performance of Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick movie whose serious crime is the destruction of art. It's for the most part a porn movie that should never be called an epic. <br /> <br /> There are films that are really artistic and sharpen people's taste for beauty, <br /> <br /> there are movies that are average entertainment; nevertheless they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> there are films that show extreme violence; however, they still convey something moral, <br /> <br /> However, there are films that show illness and decadence for their own sake and, as a result, damage people's minds. Unfortunately CALIGULA belongs to the newest group
