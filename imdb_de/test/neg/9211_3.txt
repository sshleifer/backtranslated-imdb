Something not so great. "Silence of the Lambs" is still the only good movie from Demme, and of course I include all the overvalued, left-wing exercises in big screen movies, some of which I have not seen - and never will. <br /> <br /> This is a light comedy in which the thriller is filmed half way. The first half is a bit hard to sit on; it's neither funny nor interesting. Daniels plays a superhuman fool who is so gullible and trusting that he defies belief. His animated drama is often annoying and hardly funny. He actually lies to Griffith and tells her that he is married, has children, and is actually divorced! Throughout the history of mankind and movies, every man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie - if he lies - and say that he is NOT married. (Later, the not really credible or credible reasoning behind it was revealed: he wanted to "protect himself." What a lot of crap ...) The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does because of all the stupid things in the movie I actually thought that Liotta met him in the apartment of the former. <br /> <br /> What happens then in Daniel's apartment is the classic end of the todd-to-the-to-the-to-the-to-the-movie, which is the good guy - though the very stupid good guy At least the last half hour has some action, something is going on and Daniels has no way to animate himself. The film lacks believable characters (whether main or marginal figures), and the feeling that it works to 80s, means that the film looks rather bland; visually ugly. Sayles once again makes a cameo as a police officer. The movie may be a bit too heavy on the side of coincidences. Griffith again plays a soft-spoken fool-bimbo, but as always she convinces, because she is a foolish bimbo. This was a previous movie before her lip augmentation and breast augmentation; Compare the natural breasts she shows in this film with the explosive balloons she flashes years later in "Nobody's Fool". <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Griffith and are interested in other Hollywood Intellectuals contact me by e-mail.
