For some reason, I did not like it at all, and I felt embarrassed at how bad it had been since I bought it and seen it with my family. We all hated it with passion. It's a nice kids movie, maybe in the year it came out. But think about it: an outdated children's film? What's the point? Children do not like looking at such old movies anyway, and I do not see what adults should get out of this movie anyway. Some children's movies (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz can already be enjoyed, but Time Bandits is outdated.) For your information, and I think applicable in this case, I did not like Dr. Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all I disagree with these similarly outdated movies, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There's also a terrible case of overclocking, as I remember the 'bad guys' - think of the two stupid "bad pirates" in the Pirates of the C. movies, except in Time Bandits they are not even funny remotely. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can. People who rate this movie as high must have liked it many years ago, if you have not seen it yet you should not watch it anymore.
