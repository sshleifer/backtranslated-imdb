My buddy and I decided to look at this obvious piece of rubbish based on its slogan. After almost 30 years of lousy and rudimentary teen slashers, I can not believe that right now a nerdy horror mental patient is coming up with the brilliant witty slogan "They Axed for it"! Besides, "Miner's Massacre" is just as random, annoying and memorable as the rest out there. Maybe more! The script contains all the typical stereotypes and contains all the horribly stereotypical characters you want a terrible and painful death to. The Gore effects are computer-controlled and thus beyond compassion, and the compulsory "big" stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are totally wasted despite their top-notch billing. Cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns create an ideal horror environment. the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" found this out in the early 80s? but his boring film simply has no innovative ideas or even surprising elements to offer from a distance. A bunch of greedy twenty losers, who call themselves friends although they obviously do not like it, desecrate an ancient mine in search of the gold that is supposedly hidden there. Of course, they awaken the zombie miner in this way and he has only 150 years of rest to prepare for a massive teenage massacre. Yay! The cast is exceptionally irritating. The girls all have impressive frames, but show nothing. Instead, they prefer to moan endlessly and take unnecessary risks. The stupid patterned types clearly serve only as a screen filler. In just under five minutes of playing time, Karen Black still manages to make an idiot of herself by portraying the most prototypical and hysterical nut woman of all time. The zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but he looks okay and rather threatening when shown in the distant shadow of the moonlight as he swings around his pointed ax. Since the best of "Miner's Massacre" concerns the above slogan and you can read that on the box in the video library itself, there is very little to recommend. Director John Carl Buechler scored some humble hits in the '80s, like the original "Troll" and a fair "Friday the 13th" episode, but it's time to retire now.
