What a horrible movie. The effects were small, especially by today's standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible replenishment of every catastrophe film ever made for this rubbish. The acting was awful and I mean WONDERFULLY. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and running for their lives. (By the way, they had to find a very old fat dog, so as not to make Mrs. Green look inappropriate). They manage to overtake the water for some time before resorting to it. What a speed! Later, a fast car is not fast enough to escape the torrent. God, she and this dog ran fast! If you want to watch a good movie about a dam break, this is not the case. Porchlight Entertainment shows some good family movies, but this time they missed the mark.
