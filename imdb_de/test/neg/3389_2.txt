I disagree with the previous reviewer: This film has amusing moments, but hardly a laugh uprising. (Unless, of course, you really think you're slipping out of a septic tank and heads exploding in a truck are a laugh uprising.) Actually, the only reasons I gave these 2 instead of a 1 are because a. The soundtrack is above average with some moody pop songs that are used as contrast media, and c.) the Monster Truck is pretty scary, overwhelmed by relentless rudeness, cruelty, and meanness. The former best friend character is one of the most annoying I've ever seen, and the little grace that had the hitchhiker character disappears in another twisted ending that makes little or no sense whatsoever. <br /> <br /> A waste of the main character, who shows a nervous charm, and the aforementioned actress, who represents the hitchhiker character ...
