Jack Brooks' quirks are a bit charming at first, and they make a big impression on the intentional feeling of the beginning of this movie. In the end, hoping that the payoff would be worth the tedious wait. <br /> <br /> The climax can not make up for the whole setup time. <br /> <br /> Usually one might expect flat characters from this genre. But the fact that the pre-action index is so high should mean that the interim is devoted to an interesting character development. <br /> <br /> Not so. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not without its original charm, it ultimately makes it angry and disappointed. I wish I could regain the entire setup time and reinvest it in something that pays off.
