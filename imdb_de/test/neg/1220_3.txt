The Jaws rip-off is the trashiest of all Italian genres, and director Joe D'Amato lies behind the big Jess Franco in the trash movie productions. Put the two together and what do you get? Of course a huge garbage. Unfortunately, it is not garbage in the good sense of the word, because Deep Blood brings more in boredom than in serenity. In fact, in gratitude of the film, he tries something that borders on an act; but to take this loan off the film - the conspiracy is garbage. It has something to do with a group of friends taking an oath and then with an Indian curse that manifests in a shark. Or at least I think that's how it was. In any case, most of the film is filled with boring dialogues and "dramas," and the shark itself, who must not forget, is the only thing we really want to see, and is just in a cameo role. Or not, since the shark is mostly stock footage! Although it's a garbage genre, there's actually a lot of fun for Jaws rip-offs. But with this, Joe D'Amato makes it clear he should not even bother, and the result is arguably the worst Italian shark movie of all time. Avoid this slag.
