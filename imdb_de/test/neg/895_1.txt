I know it sounds crazy, but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated part 3, and then part 4 came. I felt like you were kidding me? Kid 'n Play is nowhere to be found in this film, and that would have been fine if they had not foolishly called the film House Party 4 a title, shape, form, or fashion akin to its predecessors. Every time this movie runs late at night in the US, I shoot my TV with a rifle. Honestly, it's really so detestable. * hurling * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining fan of Kid 'n Play who will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), I was appalled. Do you remember this stupid little boys group immaturity? They sneaked into the house party 3. Okay, alright, but how can Part 4 be about her and nothing else and it also seems that they are not even the same kids from Part 3. * Confused !!!! * House party fans: Do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. In addition, everything else is ridiculous.
