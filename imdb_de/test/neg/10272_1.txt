Simply put, this mini-series was awful. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd Plotting 2. Override 3. Scattershot Approach to Characters. 4. Annoying story. 5. Inability to generate viewer interest. <br /> <br /> This movie can not even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. I'm sorry I did not read this award-winning novel, so I only rate it as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where you will see dozens of appetizers. They look at the variety and want to try it, but suddenly they pull back and wonder where they went. It's like this movie where too many characters were introduced and never pulled out. There are enough stories and characters in this movie to make a series of 20 episodes, but we have less than four hours to digest everything. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reaction shots of Ed Harris than you will find on 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extremely slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so superior that their characters are not believable. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The stubborn river metaphor becomes banal. <br /> <br /> And probably the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. That evil and vindictive cat following the hero to scratch him and his seat covers - well, come on - it's not even good, Stephen King! <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting character in the film And one that is not well-drawn is John Voss, the distraught boy whose last despair is the only thing that works in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's incredible that everyone in this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> To sum up, there is not much to be enthused about. The drama is a poor melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.
