Cujo is a huge, lovable, gentle and affectionate St. Bernard owned by the Camber family. During the opening sequence, Cujo chases a hare across fields and through a forest somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The hare disappears in a building and Cujo pokes his head in the entrance hole. The hare disappears from Cujo's sight, angry Cujo begins to bark and wakes up unintentionally and annoys a bat colony, one of which bites his nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real husband), whom her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising, discovers. Obviously, their relationship is strained. Fortunately unimportant about all of this is her young son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) repairs cars from his barn on his farmhouse. Joe is planning a weekend with one of his friends, Gary Pervier (Mills Watson), when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 in the lottery and decides to take her boy Brett (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) on a journey to see her parents. Once in Gary's house to pick him up, Joe finds him dead on the floor, goes to the kitchen to call for help, and his dog, Cujo, who is now angry, attacks and kills him. Donna and Tad drive to the Camber farmhouse to have their car repaired. The place is deserted, except for Cujo, who is now mad and foaming at the mouth. His coat is stained red with blood and insane in pain. Cujo attacks the car to attack Donna and Tad, luckily the windows hold on to them, at least for now. Donna tries to start the car, but it completely collapsed. Both are trapped with nothing except the hope that someone will come and rescue them. Cujo lurks, ready to attack and kill anyone crossing his path. Under the direction of Lewis Teague, I found the film a bit slow for my taste. The first half is trotting, the second half building up steam, but I still feel it was a bit repressive and uninspiring. Acting is fine by everyone involved, I have no complaints. Technically, the film is OK, photography, music, special effects, editing and generally well done. The big problem is the screenplay by Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier and especially the first half, most of which seem to extend the term. At just under 90 minutes it felt longer. It is also a bit predictable. Cujo as a monster has never really scared me, I just do not find it scary that the overweight St. Bernards is scary. I think there's nothing really wrong, but I do not think I'm in a hurry to see it again. Average, not bad, if you can find a copy that is cheap or gets it on TV for free.
