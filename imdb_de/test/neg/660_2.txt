The porn legend Gregory Dark conducts this kitschy horror film, which has Glen Jacobs (Kane from the WWF / WWE / as he calls himself today) in his movie debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer who takes people's eyes off. However, the property is being cleared by a group of troubled youths who are clearing up the historic hotel where GoodKnight resides and later being released from him. Hemmingway is not. Starts as a funny dopey B movie, but soon becomes boring to have fun. I am glad that I had rather low expectations, but also these were not fulfilled. How can you have a porno king as a director and still suffer from nudity? what a shame. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble barely exposes her ass
