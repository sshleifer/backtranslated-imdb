Everything about this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie will be terrible. However, you can not tell how bad it will be. <br /> <br /> We begin the film with a seemingly endless intro scene supported by gay music and without dialogue. When the camera moves up and down, big guys who try too hard to look like Mental do not provoke the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What starts then seems to be one of two different stories. The first half of the film is made up of wallowing wogs competing in paid midnight battles with other ethnic groups. Of course the women always win because they seem to lift weights and have "respect". In these scenes, we first see the degree of bad drama, editing, script, and hatred for the people who financed this movie. Finally, the main character and his companion are sent to jail. The entire prison section of the film has nothing to do with what I believe in the plot, and consists of a series of struggles. <br /> <br /> Once the jail (3 years for murder?) The main character and his companion is unite with the mums. They then go to the "other side of the city" and try to hide because apparently everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon the wogs will be set up for the rape of another gangmother girl and hordes of various gangs will fight in the city. This point of the movie can be likened to an arcade game as the wolves just run around and fend off enemies that get worse and worse as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film ends with some massive consequences of the climate battle scene, in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) pick up any gang they have fought so far. Apparently the other gangs have no problem getting into the rest of the wogs (the skinheads do not care about Asians). After about a million people have been beaten up by the invincible Wog brothers, the film ends with the main characters going home. However, they can not make it home because they are burned by the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is more like a computer game. Then a movie, because that would explain how two guys can see around a million hits from a million different people, who are usually twice the size. <br /> <br /> There are also tons of stupidities inexplicable events in this movie, such as an Asian fighting its own gang and killing a katana just to let the waves go. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this movie is not that bad It's funny, it's just so bad.
