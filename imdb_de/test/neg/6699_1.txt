As an American member of the service, please believe me when I say that this film is in no way accurate about the emotional state of our Soldiers / Sailors / Aviators / Marines returning from missions. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a big, steamy clich√©. The actors are terrible (with the exception of the little girl) and the characters' backgrounds are weak and ridiculous, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I created an IMDb account to warn everyone half a brain away. <br /> <br /> The Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente really, really, should be really ashamed. If he does not approve of US foreign policy, he should write a letter to the US government and not punish the entire English-speaking world with a monumental crap movie.
