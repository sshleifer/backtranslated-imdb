This movie is TRASH right from the start. First, there is a report on a season that took place 16 years ago! Who cares? This film was about as deep as a bottle cap. It turns a complex person like Bob Knight into a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Swearing does not bother me, but I'm still amazed that ESPN has shown a movie with more curses than a Kevin Smith movie on a base movie cable channel. The F-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible and anyone connected with it should be embarrassed. I rate that on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Everybody Wins ... 2 movies that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
