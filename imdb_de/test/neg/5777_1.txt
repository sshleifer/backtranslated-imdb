A group of douche bag teens goes to an old mining town to find gold nuggets. The only problem with the Haar-Brain plan is that the ancient supernatural miner, who owns the gold, does not want to part with his treasure, and so begins to send out the invaders accordingly. Literally clich√©d dialogues, terrible drama, something terribly terrible "southern dialect" and a lame, unforgettable killer similar to Jeepers Creepers (without the predilection of the aforementioned boys by nature) make this stinker one Draw unsurpassable. Even the cult legend actress Karen Black in a small role can not save this deviation. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (poorly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
