This was Monogram's first chan movie. What are the values ​​and standards of Fox? I was shocked to see my first monogram after seeing the great Fox movies. This is boring and uninspired with wild music as Chan walks quietly across the street. Chan now works for US intelligence and not for the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays Tommy No. 3 son for the first time. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also debuts as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, and not Chan's later chauffeur in the later films.
