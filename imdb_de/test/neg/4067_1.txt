My suggestion ..... This movie should actually be a "comedy", right? !!!! If not, the producers, directors, actors and "hairstylists" should really choose a different career! Well, my template guidelines require a minimum of "10 lines". How can I add more to this? Hmm ... Let me see. Oh yes, the beginning of the movie was pretty weird with the "Crash Landing" scene. Too bad that the plane did not hit the tanker. A bunch of "Martians" would have fallen out of the rubble (apparently hidden) and decided to take over the planet "world" and make a better movie. Well, that would have been a great start! <br /> <br /> T
