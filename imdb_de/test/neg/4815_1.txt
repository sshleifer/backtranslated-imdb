The stupidity that made the cartoon "Bullwinkle" funny a quarter of a century ago proves NO DEAD HEROES that you can pull off a good movie (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) without copying a single piece of quality from your looting object. Acting is barely on the TV scale with cable access, the plot is less nuanced than an old "Sgt. Rock" comic, and only the villains of Boris J. Badanov are missing in the commies. This movie has the unusual power of being too bad and too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with reluctant thumbs.
