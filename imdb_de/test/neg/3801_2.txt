Sequels, there are many reasons to do it, but what went through Irwin Allen's head to find such a boring idea goes beyond all logical things. There are so many open answers to this film that it's ridiculous ... like The Poseidon, a monstrous ship with passengers, drifts on the ocean and only Michael Caine with his miniboot and a nasty Telly Savalas discover the boat ... Well At the beginning, the French marines are wheeling their helicopters over the wreck, but as a sinking cruise ship, it's a daily business, they just fly away ... What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Caine goes aboard with sally Field and he could get anything he sees (diamonds) if no Telly Savalas on the ship was looking for weapons ... my God, why am I wasting my words here? It's ridiculous and knowing that both Field and Caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts ... certainly not diamonds ...
