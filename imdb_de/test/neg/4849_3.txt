This is the kind of movie where you question your earlier admiration for a specific director before you stop, and remind yourself that there are very few people whose work does not contain some clinkers. The casting in Lelouch's films is of the utmost importance, because it brings the viewer with the characters in such an intimacy. The actors need to bring real screen magic to match the intensity. Otherwise it is only hollow. <br /> <br /> None of the actors in this movie, in my opinion, had any of this screen magic. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas stayed far behind in the main presentations. Irons is a talented actor, but he was wrong in that part. The lovable villain did not fit his strengths. His charm has hit a wrong note for me too. The personality of Iron is too decadent to fit in a Lelouch love story. <br /> <br /> Although I would hesitate to forget any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that an American actor would have worked better here. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so intimately tied to the respective poet's Americanness that it seemed uncomfortable to let Jeremy Irons play the love interest - even if it did not matter logically. It's still somehow messed up the flow of the movie. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course it should have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great. And he would have turned the screen into magic. Brad Pitt would have done a great job by delivering his special combination of charm and nervousness. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. When I read about her, I learned that she has a very successful career as a singer and many fans. I do not know, but I found her screen presence as a singer very boring. In fact, she was a much better actress in her speech scenes than in the scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song. Nothing she sang touched me. She was pleasant but boring. <br /> <br /> By contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only vocal coaching French, would have done that part a million times better. Not to mention all the overwhelming French talent you could wear. It was eerie to see Patricia Kaas appear on the screen when there were so many charismatic French actresses who could have become actors instead. <br /> <br /> The music was so important in this movie that it could not really work without the music. And since Kaas delivered so badly in this regard, the film had no chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch sealed the film's fate as he cast Patricia Kaas. JMO.
