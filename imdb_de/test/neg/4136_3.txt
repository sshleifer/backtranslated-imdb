I can only assume that the previous posts came from executives of the production company ... <br /> <br /> Visited the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook were there (I probably knew I would be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey it is for a movie. Sometimes I felt sorry for her when the audience burst into laughter in serious "thriller" scenes. <br /> <br /> But maybe I missed the point. Maybe an element of the joke was planned. If so, pure genius. If not, career genocide. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Zane always shines and Brook can actually act a little. As the other half said (when we walked out of the cinema, with broken ribs), this movie can be forgiven, as they both look like nice people! The screenwriter should be castrated.
