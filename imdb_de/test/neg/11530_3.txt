Bad shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaptation of a novel. It does not get much worse. Decent drama and good popcorn saved me for those one and a half hours - more like three hours - boredom. Occasionally good one-liners. <br /> <br /> David is a feeble-minded young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He trusts in a mumbo-jumbo video of Chinese philosophy, though it does not seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a collection gang, where each member has an IQ below sea level. A missing script, along with uncreative filming and even worse editing, leaves something that might have looked like hilarious incidents of failed debt collection, like an amateurish, homemade reality show. David rents an apartment at a primary school teacher Haraldur, who drops David a few sentences because of his own importance, convincing him that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A badly missing script offers David nothing to support his opinion. A few scenes in which Haraldur showed something that David misinterpreted would have done the job. The potential of film as a medium, unlike the text of the book on which this film is based, is not exploited. <br /> <br /> First, David's connection to Haraldur establishes his status within the collection party. However, the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is OK, but it's based on the book. This could have been a much better movie. A good scriptwriter could have made something out of this material. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is distinguished as David and credible. Eggert Þorleifsson does not have much to do, but he does his best with very little material. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a tiny role) make it all right. <br /> <br /> Overall: What could have been a pretty funny and entertaining movie about a hostile anti-hero in a collection book becomes a boring, poorly built movie made after a bad manuscript. To stare at the toes for one and a half hours would be more pleasant.
