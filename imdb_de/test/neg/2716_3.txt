The uncomplicated, but slightly entertaining softcore comedy of the early '90s includes Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey) as three teenagers in space. Xena's parents have been on vacation for a few days. After some stubborn persuasions from her friends, Xena agrees to take her father's spacecraft. The final result? They have used up the gas in space and land on the planet Beta 45, AKA Earth. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) have traveled to California to spend the summer with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez), a beach lover who lives on the beach. The three finally meet with our three space maids who crashed out of scratch. Uncle Bud is about to be thrown out of his soon to be sentenced beach block, thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives at the top of the hill and was in a relationship with Bud. She's also a bikini magnate trying to win a $ 30,000 bikini design contest ... just what Bud needed for his property, so the girls decide to win the prize for him. And that's it, people. The filmmakers knew that their paper-thin storyline was barely enough to sustain a full-length movie and challenged us scene after scene of endless beach parties with countless extras circling their half-naked bodies in the scorching sun. Oh, and do not let the sex forget. There is quite a lot of it. Before I move on, I have to put this film in context. It was released in 1993, long before the emergence of such soft-core labels as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, edgier, more explicit films, the softcore films of the 90s are certainly a bit mild. When Beach Babes From Beyond came out of full moon offshoot Torchlight Entertainment in 1993, it was called the debut of a label specializing in movies with mature audiences. Of course times have changed. This particular film genre has evolved from a few hot but short sex scenes and fleeting insights into the female nudity of the woman to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to get into the realm of hardcore. Looking back at Beach Babes from Beyond after its release in '93, one can say for sure that if the same movie was done today, the sex scenes would have a much bigger meaning and less time would need to be spent on plot and dialogue. The sex scenes themselves tend to run hot and cold. Our three space girls do not waste time looking after the boys this evening. So every couple gets a soft core scene with annoying slow motion and too dark lighting. They are really not that horrible and in some places surprisingly graphic, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry, which takes place behind a trailer. But the only sex scene that REALLY leaves a lasting impression and surprises you in its overall intensity occurs in the movie early on. Sally participates in a topless photo with three of her models posing by a pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautiful, but Nikki Fritz sets herself apart from both thanks to her enormous presence. Remember this point in your career has not yet achieved the kind of huge popularity that would soon follow. Her naked pose by the pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence in which she shows her soapy body in a bath and then when she leaves her bath. As we approach the bed to an almost naked, pumped-up guy in waiting, we get a full length nude scene with her almost heart-shaped back and perfectly shaped back. It's good that Nikki's back is so muscular that he's doing a good workout right now. Nikki spends the next few minutes completely naked with a handsome man in various positions in a scene that is completely different than the other three love scenes filmed. No dark light or annoying slow-motion here ... just two actors in a huge bed with no sheets and duvet covers that seem to be barely working at the moment. Nikki's ecstatic body language proves that few other actors like to film sex scenes as they do. It really is the only time that Beach Babes From Beyond really delivers the goods. But even without this spectacular scene, I recommend this movie gently, just because it is quite observable and never boring, thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of which in the rest were directly featured in video features of the decade.
