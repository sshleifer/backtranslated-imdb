Dr. Chopper begins shortly after the death of teenage mother Nicholas (Robert Adamson), he is still gnawed, but every cloud has a silver lining. In this case, his mother seems to own a log cabin on Lake Tatonka, which is the self proclaimed "friendly place for happy people" of which she told him nothing. Nicholas, his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) are on their way to a nice weekend. Unfortunately, things are not going according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a rundown shed and their neighbors turn out to be dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two nurses who kill everyone who encounters them in terrible experiments ... <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn. This movie seems to have a hard time on the IMDb. Hard reviews, though I think that Dr. Chopper as a horror movie is pretty worthless, I do not think that some of my criticisms are quite justified. The script, which takes itself very seriously, is attributed to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...), who plays a role in the film as Detective Crocker according to the IMDb cast list, though I do not remember any character of that name Maybe he was at the beginning of one of the cops? Anyway, the basic story is fine, although it's a bit boring and takes too long. It's a typical slasher fare with a kind of vicious character that runs around bouncing off our annoying American teen occupation. You know the exercise meanwhile. Apart from a brief and undeveloped nonsense that Dr. Chopper body parts used to fill his deteriorating body, there is not much to tell here. The script seems to be just to invent situations where girls can strip off their tops, there are the inevitable sex scenes, there is a sequence in which some girls have to complete the introduction of a sorority house upstairs & there are even a few Lesbians here, one of which is seen without their complete clothing compliment. Oh, and when I say topless, I mean that they do not wear tops, but they stop all their bras, so you might want to remember that Dr. Chopper does not give complete nudity in frontality at all. So you really have it, it's an average story that ends up with a slightly surprising turn that's wasted. She's populated with bad clich√©d, stupid characters who are only there to showcase some cheap gore scenes and girls in bras. To be honest, I expect a bit more of my films, but on the other hand, maybe I'm just picky. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn is okay, this is by no means the worst-looking movie I've ever seen even though it still looks cheap. There is no style here, I did not think it was scary and also no atmosphere. The throat is restrained and confined to a few corpses and severed limbs, there is nothing new or particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of the films where character decisions and motivations are ridiculous. Technically, this is a bit rough on the edges, but quite reasonable in terms of the forest's probably rather low budget. The locations are adequately isolated, though the cops' bureau looks like someone's front room and the two nurse outfits start out like strippers Look outfits. Acting is okay, it could have been better, but I've definitely seen worse. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper is indeed introducing a doctor who drives around on a chopper motorcycle, but unfortunately that's not enough to satisfy me, though it's a pretty proficient production because of the lack of real blood, nudity, or a decent storyline leaves no traces.
