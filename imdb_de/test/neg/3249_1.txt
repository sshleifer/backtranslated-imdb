This movie made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So incredible and the worst action ever. Acting was bad too. I do not know why so many popular Bollywood actors and actresses recorded this movie. The script must have been a joke. The visual effects in this film were extremely painful to look at. I think a kindergartner could have made the visual effect better, and a monkey could have done better to work out an action. The plot has numerous attempts to copy important Hollywood movies like the Terminator, but it works miserably. I laughed when I saw this movie. A total catastrophe in Indian cinema history!
