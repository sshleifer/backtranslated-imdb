I saw this movie when it first came out and hated it. I only saw it again 27 years later. I liked it ... although Robin Williams was totally wrong in the role. What most reminds me to hate the movie is that it was almost the complete opposite of what I understood when I read the book. Since I have not read it again, I can only give you my impressions of the past - but I'm sure of one thing - the movie is a kind of family life, while in the book almost ALL the traditional institutions - including and perhaps most of all Marriage - are straitjackets that we would get rid of well. The only positive thing about the book is the wondrous nature of the children ... something that really only captivates the beginning and the end of the movie (with this incredibly beautiful baby floating in the air.) Too bad that Williams has no tenth of it's charm My low point is therefore the fact that the film misrepresents the book. As a film on its own it is better - but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think everyone who watches her would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow, a former footballer who has undergone a sex change operation, is fantastic ... he has never pitched a single camp or made the character anything but praiseworthy - and so his performance was incredibly honest. I watched him closely in all his scenes, and he was never anything but female. Nothing in its performance came close to the performance of a drag queen ... and that made all the difference. In fact, he is the only one of the people in the film who is unerring. This film is only worth seeing for its performance.
