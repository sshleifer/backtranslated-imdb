It was like watching the trailer of an aspiring movie, except that no movie came out. The film is so unsatisfactory and obviously unfinished that it is almost ridiculous. The theme of this movie is about a very short timeframe and frankly, in the 90 minutes of screen time, not much happens. I was hoping for the definitive Australian film about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought terrible conditions in unbelievable conditions. That's certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> However, the spectacle was great and the venues authentic. This could easily have been a great movie that offers much more money and time, instead it is not even mediocre and I can not recommend it at all.
