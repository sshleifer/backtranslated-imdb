Caddyshack Two is a good movie in itself, but it can not stack up in comparison to the original. Robert Stack is a terrible substitute for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while witty just can not keep up with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, the only character of the original. Most other characters in the film lack the punch of the original (such as Henry Wilcoxon), with the exception of the hysterically witty lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office. Make a fire with the Chippindale, maybe fry the Golden Retriever (arff arff arff) and eat it. And then I come upstairs, and I pack you to your Brooks brothers Your brand new BMW makes a tight **! Do we understand?). However, his small role compensates for Dan Acroyd, who obviously is not a substitute for Bill Murray. His voice is more than irritating and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. Overall, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the fantastic original, it simply can not be cut.
