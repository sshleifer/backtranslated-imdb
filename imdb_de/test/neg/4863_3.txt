Would you be surprised if I told you that this movie is a conspiracy? No? How about I tell you that the ringleader was a shadow puppet? What? You do not believe me? ... OK. Yes, I thought so. It is a pity that this film could have had a sense of humor. I understand that Charlie Sheen did that at the time - another movie made more money - than for Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Do not even let me start with Stephen Lang. He was as much fun as the party crashers in 'The Hard Way' and now this garbage. <br /> <br /> Ah no matter. Everyone involved should be ashamed. If you want to make a bad movie and be successful - it's crazy - but I seriously doubt that's what they were aiming for here. The story stinks, and we really should take this yak seriously. You're wondering if this movie had a glimmer of hope at all. Seriously, I doubt it and in an industry that is so closely encircled with the purses that it has turned green, which was just green. Perhaps even more frightening is how this dog pile found its way into the theater! Oh, Sam Waterson, how great you are in Law & Order. Why are you here? Concentrating on the role of the President of the United States I would like to add is being bombarded by a biplane with remote control controlled by the Gonzo bomber. On the other hand, this is a masterpiece of the work of George P. Cosmatos, whose "directing" points include Rambo: First Blood Part II. Hmm ... the case?
