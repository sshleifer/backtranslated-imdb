This movie was pure boredom from start to finish. Okay, I welcome Boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in Burma, but that's all he achieves. About 10 minutes after the movie, I thought, "Oh no, now it's time again," and I could have told you exactly what would happen in the next 80 minutes. Patricia Arquette was overwhelmed in such a role and her acting was made of wood and not convincing. Mind you, being saddled with such a dreadfully conventional screenplay may be boring and so reflected on the screen. Much of the movie was just ridiculous. At one stage, Arquette's older companion is shot and he lies on the floor. In the next scene he sprints through the forest and obviously tries to break the world record of 100 meters! - or maybe he just tries to run away from Boorman !! If it's hard for you to sleep one night, play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and you'll snore in no time. I rarely criticize a movie as violently as this one, but in this case it is completely justified.
