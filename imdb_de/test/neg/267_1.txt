What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought it would ever happen? A huge mess, which is lost halfway and can not be traced back. I was surprised how bad that really was. Really! I've never really seen the end, because this movie is just unbearable. I'm a big fan of the first, but that's a lame excuse for a sequel. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the robbery if they returned the money? The movie is just boring and so sluggish that I can never go through that. It is really bad. Just stay that far, repeat as far away from this movie as you can. It is worthless.
