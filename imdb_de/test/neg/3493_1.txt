This movie is bad. Absolutely bad. Absolutely bad. <br /> <br /> The dialogue jumps off the screen and puts you in the face with its thoroughly artificial skirmish, then it unfolds its own ability to detect traces of subtle subtleties. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be particularly bad. I live in the city of angels, I can confirm that. What is so terrible about Los Angeles bigotry is its insidious nature. It sneaks up with a knowing look or a swallowed word. Until just on the verge of a fist fight, it almost never comes out right and says, "Why did he have to be black!" <br /> <br /> I can see quite clearly that the jacks are black, the partner of the detective is Hispanic, the DA is white. As long as the film passes through the projector, I can let myself be guided by the pictures, the music and the words to this conclusion, without telling me the conclusion. Emote characters, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. This trust is being raped by this movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie takes you as a spectator in the directions and guides you with clues to get to a specific point. This movie beats you down with its point and offends you and your intelligence on the way. My unanswered question is: Why did we, as a society, say together, "Thank you"?
