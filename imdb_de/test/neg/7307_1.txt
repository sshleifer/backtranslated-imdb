A true leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is bad. Acting (if you can call it that), lighting, sound, script (if any), editing, directing, camerawork, everything is disgusting. There is no single element that is well done. If I thought this was intentional, then maybe I would give some credit to the film, but I can not believe that people would set out to make such a great movie.
