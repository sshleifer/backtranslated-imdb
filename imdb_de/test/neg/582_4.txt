Lou Costello (without Abbott) plays a self-contained small-dust collector (and the inventor of a timing machine!), Who secretly hovers around the niece of the big city. After a spit, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) bumps into a misty cave - why we're getting foggy, we never learn - and appears as a 30-foot giant. Provine is certainly a good sport, and she does not bother to look ridiculous (it would have been impossible anyway), but the writer is really cruel to this character and makes her not just a giant but a torturous harpy Well. Provocation boss Costello around, while confusion is caused with the army troops who are come in, but nothing is done with the transformation. The film, which was trumped last year by "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman", shows Lou Costello in his last bow, but offers little else. The special effects are marginal, while the script requires smoother lines and faster pace. * 1/2 of ****
