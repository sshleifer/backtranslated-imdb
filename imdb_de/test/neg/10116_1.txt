It's hard and I did not expect it ... But it's really the worst movie my wife and I have seen. Awesome dialogues that unfathomably go beyond time for no apparent reason except to fill time. Storytelling does not follow a comprehensive, understandable path? everything is a mess The action and the dialogues appear at jumps. What disappointed me most was seeing Dominique Pinon as one of my favorite French actors. uh? I do not even know how to describe it without being polite. The rest of the actors were the worst. Susan Paterno interpreted her character terribly and made a flat, expressionless performance. Bad special effects. I do not think it was a complete waste of film, but it's close? If I say, I would advise anyone not to watch this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Sincerely, I never thought that I would say that about a movie, but? There's always a first time.
