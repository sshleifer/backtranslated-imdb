I decided to like this movie. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, the Boiler Room, etc. I went into that movie and thought I was on the edge of my seat. Besides, I'm a big Pacino fan. <br /> <br /> What a garbage. Maybe the worst movie I've seen in five years. This actually makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday good. First, half of the movie looks like Matthew McConaughey lifts weights. OK, we understand it. You're in shape Matt. We do not have to see every other scene in which you wear irons with no shirt. <br /> <br /> Second, how many action holes are there in this film? Why should one initiate the call of Brandon's long-lost father and never call him again? What was the point of his mother hanging up - why did she even call to say that he sends her too much money - what did that bring? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? And since sports betting in New York is illegal and recognized, how can they guarantee a bet at the end? <br /> <br /> This was just a very poorly written script. It had potential, but it lacked a coherent conspiracy. I thought Pacino had learned his lesson on script selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My God, that's the same actor who played in the godfather! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
