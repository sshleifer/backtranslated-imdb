In the 20th century, an architect by the name of Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) commanded a space station that he personally designed. As can be predicted, a special unit is sent out to retake the expensive station and take the merchant into custody. Upon their arrival, they experience that he participates in a strange ritual with a mysterious cubical. During the interrogation, he reveals that they have to finish him, what he started, or the hell he has released, bathe in blood Box and the reasons why he is here in outer space ... <br /> < br /> The film, which essentially coincides with Hellraiser, was The Quickening Highlander. Something that should be ignored and forgotten, as it will not affect the story of Hellraiser too much. By far the shabbiest of the franchise with a far inferior feeling than its predecessors (who is it in B or C class movies)? <br /> <br /> Sometimes the drama seems to be influenced by a mid-budget porn movie with unbelievable wood performances that you actually think: when will you undress and get on with the traffic? Surprisingly, not much sex in the movie, even though the introduction of the seductress demon Angelique (a totally redundant character that unnecessarily messes up with what we know from the world of Hellraiser) offers plenty of opportunity to love oneself A movie of three abruptly assembled separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that are not focused and carried away in an amateurish way. The end result is extremely poor, which is essentially underlined by the fact that you have no interest in what happens to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some decent gore in the movie, but otherwise a total failure.
