OK, I've already seen Hershall Gordon Lewis movies, but this one really takes the cake, really bloody and disgusting, not to mention disgusting with the strippers because the only saving grace is the late big Henny Youngman as the owner of the strip club , yes, take my wife ... please. striped 1987. I've enjoyed the previous HGLewis movie 100 Maniacs, a mini-masterpiece, but bad acting, no awards here, but note that this is a splatter movie that's Friday the 13th and in one disturbing scene, a half-naked stripper has beaten her butt with a meat tenderizer Lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.
