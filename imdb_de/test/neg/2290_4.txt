Not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of "Thunderball" by Kevin McClory (co-producer in "Thunderball"). Well, the cast is very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great Bond boss, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the "original" Bond girl plus Rowan Atkinson and a really great Edward Fox who really refreshes the "M" role in the US. In fact, the entire movie is refreshing and gives new impetus. Sean Connery makes it confident and charming again, only that he looks a bit too old. But alright, he's the original Bond and it was great to see him again in this role. The locations are also typical for Bahamas, France etc. The only thing that really fails is the music score. The song "Never say never again" is OK, but the title song is missing. All in all a good try to make a difference to the weird and stupid Roger Moore movies like "Moonraker". Only if there was another story, "Thunderball" was an excellent movie and really did not need a remake
