My Take: Another lunatic PG-13 horror movie with predictable horror tactics and a derivative depiction. <br /> <br /> The spirits are moving. The walls creak. Something is wrong in the basement. Along with several other horror film clich√©s, the walls of another country home in Sam Samis Samis Samis produced THE MESSENGERS, a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown on a plot, of better (or sometimes worse) horror movies of the past , <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves into an old farmhouse in South Dakota, Dad (Dylan McDermott) tries to contact the family again, in particular with the previously drunk daughter Jessica (the undervalued Kristen Stewart), in one rather subtle landscape than in Chicago. The horror begins when Jessica receives small surprise visits from the poltergeists of the house. She thinks she's a young girl who called Wolf, her parents do not believe her. How could you? The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting to see which horror movie will rage next. Will it be an angry herd of crows that want more than the harvest of the family (a direct rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece THE BIRDS)? Will it be the haunted house with a history that goes back to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will it be the grotesque phantoms known from the well-known horrors of recent times like THE RING and THE GRUDGE? Heck, the movie even manages to rub one or two scenes off really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe the Pang brothers really wanted a B-level horror movie, but did it have to be that bad? Could not you tear yourself away from the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * from 5.
