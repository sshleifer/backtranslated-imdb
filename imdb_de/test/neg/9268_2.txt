This is perhaps the most ridiculous crap I have ever seen. Three incoherent stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships of a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people took part in it. Highlights: A green refrigerator man reads Jean-Paul Sartre, the Slob Mans dinner guest and his horse dung hair products, a RIDICULOUSLY unreasonable woman in the third shorts, who suspected a man of stupidity was only following her generic activities interested was blower. <br /> <br /> I seem to have used up a few lines more, so I can mention some stupid things about the movie as well. The first film involves a man driving around a talking car following his unreasonable demands for absolutely no obvious reason. The only way you would watch this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. It's kind of funny in an ironic way, but also extremely tiring, like chewing on a stained carpet for a long time.
