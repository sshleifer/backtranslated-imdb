Mount Godwin-Austin (also known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world, and if you believe the evidence in this film is hard to describe, it's the hardest mountain to successfully climb without killing yourself allow. "K2" is basically a buddy movie in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography has a truly stunning scenery, the characters in front of all these beautiful landscapes are a boring hole - and that's the flaw in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Taylor Brooks (Cocksure) Taylor Biehn) and his quiet, married boyfriend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time climbing. On one of their trips, they meet with another climber funded by wealthy mountain lover Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is currently training for an upcoming shot at the notorious K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold both would like to attack, but could never afford. However, during the training run, two of Claibourne's team are killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold introduced themselves as possible substitutes. Despite initial reluctance, Claibourne nods her approval and the couple meets with his team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul) is desperate that her husband has suffered such a dangerous rise, especially as he has recently become a father. The tensions in the climbing team are on the rise as Taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group, the equally sassy and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne itself is increasingly ill, as the altitude sickness burdened his body. Will the boys reach the pinnacle of K2 or will their quest end in disappointment or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends an excessive amount of time introducing his somewhat disagreeable characters. Biehn as a disgusting, intrusive, adventurous guy is particularly hard to like, as well as Barry as hard-nosed mountaineer millionaire. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it's hard to believe that his wife could do it damn well if he climbs on K2 - hell, she'd be better off if he never came back !! The main characters are rounded off by Bercovici, whose characterization as Dallas Woolf is as effortless and exaggerated as any other role he has ever played. The story itself is completely tame and disposable? Just a simple yarn over guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. There is a bit of male attachment, but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife is close to zero, and the clashes between Taylor and Dallas are completely wrong. "K2" has its few merits solely from the stunning camera of Gabriel Berastain? During the Himalayan sequences, the extent and awe of the mountains are beautifully captured. I'm totally in with critic Kim Newman, who hilariously said in the magazine Empire: "In that sense, climbing K2 can not be more difficult than getting through!" That's right, Kim, that's right!
