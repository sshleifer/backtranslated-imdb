Okay, it was very good ... but best picture? Please do not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck were much better ... Brokeback Mountain - that would have won! Academy voters seem to behave like today's Democrats - just a little bit of them all, but do not dare to take specific positions. That's why we have an idiot in the US. <br /> <br /> This was the worst AA presentation ... and forgot 1987 ... always. Hollywood is so afraid of the end result that it can not be "straight". Apparently, many voters have not seen Brokeback Mountain. Become real and join in. <br /> <br /> This was the most miserable year since I saw it in the mid 60's and I was only two years old. <br /> <br /> Wake up whoever you are. Hollywood is mainstream, and that's exactly what happened with the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the last Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a remake or whatever of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and much more will come in 2006. <br /> At least, there were originally best pictures, so Munich, but you have heard before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, even though we know that Reese can sing like Cash / Carter and so on, Syriana was a much better picture than Crash. This movie was filmed since the early 1960s and we have to make the best movie? What a terrible Oscar night and a terrible year to the end of 2005 and another boring year of 2006. At least the BAFTA for the best picture went to Brokeback, and what about the terrible song that has won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years left as America or the US before anyone comes in and makes a difference. Maybe it will be China, because they have so much of this country ... or India, because they all have high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the world. America has become the land of fat, merciful and stupid. Garbage can be found in more places than Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Drive through a McDonald's or Burger King, for God's sake. Order everything you want until you have a heart attack. Get out of your misery.
