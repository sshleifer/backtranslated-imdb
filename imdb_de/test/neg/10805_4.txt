The movie Soultaker is essentially an older Form Final Destination, in which several car-savvy teens separate their souls from their bodies and have to cheat the death that chases them ...

If this film were redesigned with a few good actors and fantastic special effects, this could turn out to be very impressive ... As far as the actual movie is concerned, I recommend the movie Bei den MST3K Version, the pure version may be too boring to prevail, unless you love bad movies staring at Martin Sheen's brother ...
