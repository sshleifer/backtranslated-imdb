This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. What did they think? Stop preaching with me! That's why we look at all Walker Texas Rangers and do not admit it to our friends. Terrible spectacle and an extremely wrong action. As the film unfolds, the story ends and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The director somehow believed that the two worked well together. It looked like crap! When I saw the title on my local blockbusters, it looked interesting. It should have been a warning stating that it was religious instead of the false promotion of an action / adventure. For the first time in a long time, I stopped a movie and could not bear to finish it.
