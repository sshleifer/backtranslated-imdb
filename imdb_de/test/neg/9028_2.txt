This movie is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films during his long career, some of which were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA he also relies on a gifted actress, the newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala. However, this is hardly the only positive element in an otherwise horrible mess of a movie. While Lopez de Ayala strives to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed by her loving husband, it seems she can not develop her character beyond this one-dimensional feature. Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and politics of that time was indispensable to her story ... but here she was portrayed as the romantic leading actress of a soap opera; This is a pity, and the film is a missing opportunity to show how personal life can influence history and vice versa. Worst of all, Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri appear in really bad performances, which is a real problem in the case of Liotti, as he plays a key role in this story for Felipe el Hermoso. It seems to be a clear decision to attract a young audience as both look like top models of the time. On the other hand, talented actors like Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles that are clearly underdeveloped. Although it's a budget-heavy movie, little attention has been paid to putting a good screenplay or "period pieces" on screen. In some group scenes, costumes are especially grotesque, as if they were taken from inventory without paying any real attention to it. All in all, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and this is what makes the difference to far superior historical films like LA PURE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is that there is no director's point of view. This is a peculiar twist in Aranda's career as he has been able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES come to mind) and create very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA is really just a routine scientific historical piece. and not a very good one!
