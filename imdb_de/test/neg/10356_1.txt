I'm a fan of this generally excellent, if sometimes boring show, but Season 3 has taken some terrible instructions. The episode HERO is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story that eventually turns out is that the Cylons intentionally allow Bulldog - a pilot who was captured a few years earlier during a Black Ops mission - to escape to escape Cylon ship and back to Galactica. The plan is, when Bulldog returns, he'll find out that Adama has left him to his fate, and he's so mad that he'll kill Adama, which he almost does. Now the problem is - the Cylons have arranged it so Bulldog thinks he escaped alone. This means that Bulldog disembarks without support from the Cylon ship. So he kills a Cylon and goes out of his cell - that's how much we see. Then we have to assume that he's going to the airport hangar, manages to board a Cylon battleship and learn to operate, then takes off and flies back to Galactica. Just because. <br /> <br /> Now Starbuck managed to get one of them up and running in the first season, which was hard to believe, but she only had to visually fly him out of orbit before he got in touch with Galactica , Bulldog has to program his ship to make several jumps through hyperspace, catching Galactica somewhere a thousand light-years away, in an unknown direction. How can he program a ship that contains completely extraterrestrial technology? Cylons connect to their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And after doing this miraculous feat, how does he know where Galactica is, considering Galactica left three years ago and since then trying to escape the Cylons - it leaves no beacons? Even allowing for the suspension of unbelief that must apply to any sci-fi show, this episode is absolutely pointless.
