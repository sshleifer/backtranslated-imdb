I've seen "LOST" with my family since the first episode, it was great. It was very disappointing in the last season. It seems that the authors do not know what to do with the series. So they always try to balance it with a story in an entire episode. Incidentally, the current season, which, by the way, I decided to look on, just to see Rodrigo Santoro, and also with a little hope that things will get better. was a disappointment after another; My husband and my son even stopped to look. At first he (Santoro) only appears 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with the story, because nothing really happens, every episode could be shown in 15 minutes. We see each episode waiting for something that never happens. I do not want every secret to be revealed at once, but how about a variation in the storylines? In the first and second season we had different storylines, we saw the story of the characters, a little bit of action, a bit of romance, now it's like a big event that needs the whole episode to be revealed. It's almost exhausting to see it. When it's done, you feel like you've lost your time. Well, it's important to know that the actors are still great. I can not believe they killed Mr. Eko (Adelawale ...). He was great, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind and generous, courageous. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad boy", is somehow mellowing because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but that's cool. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), all of them are (or should be) an important part of the plot, but we barely see them. I hope Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will have a big role in the show. If not, why did you make as much out of him as he was on the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? I'm sorry if I've been rumbling for too long, but I feel cheated on this show. It was great when I started to look at it, I got used to it, and now it's very disappointing to see how it works. I am here and hope for improvements !!! Katia
