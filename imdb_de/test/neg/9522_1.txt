I'm a bit scared of some of these reviews that A.K.A. advertised. Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, they contain all sorts of inside information that you can only find by reading the press-book from start to finish. Please do not tell me that the director is writing his own reviews, as that would be too sad to think about. Fear, I'm one of those who hated the movie and were surprised by its unapologetic sense of amateurism. Great idea, too bad about the execution. And it was extremely disturbing to see so many good actors (and also some very bad ones, including the leaden lead role), who all thought they appeared in a series of very different films. I wish the AKA was brave, innovative or simply interesting. Unfortunately, it was like seeing an unintentionally hysterical home video with artistic aspirations. A missed opportunity.
