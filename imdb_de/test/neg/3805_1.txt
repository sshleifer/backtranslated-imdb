When I was in bed with the flu and felt too rough to find the remote control, I watched this horror from start to finish (how many people can say that?) And who can - what's your excuse?). My God, was it ever such a mess that was published by a big studio? In a supposed "thriller" there is no real tension for a second; the script is incapable and ridiculous; The sets look like they are the remnants of a low-budget television movie. and the cast ... WHAT WOULD YOU THINK? !!! Undoubtedly, Sally Field offers the worst and most embarrassing performance of an Oscar winner in history. Her irritating nasal seepage and her stupid, restrained behavior in a life-threatening situation are truly. It's a wonder she did not use all her future earnings to buy and destroy every push of this turkey. Michael Caine, who now engages in endless screen art - even master classes for aspiring thespians - should be taken out and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas' henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actress I usually like (and whose name is not even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years old for her role, and her terrible matronly yellow prom dress still has to haunt her nightmares. It is Karl Malden and Shirley Knight who have hopefully collected a large pay package to reassure their participation. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but one of the ones I remember most is the explosion that causes the "ceiling" (if an upturned ship deck can be called that) to collapse and a load of empty boxes Fall through! Ooh, how scary! Really, really awful.
