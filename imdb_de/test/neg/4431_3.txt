When I think of Bollywood. I think I find good musical dance numbers with great outfits for men and women. And catchy tunes. Horror, Thriller, Mystery and Suspense do not come to mind. And that's an abstract comedy for my western eyes. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been a better movie, even shorter, if the author and the director had made a final decision. Either for thriller horror, comedy mystery, supernatural suspense or musical romance, instead of a clumsy mix of everything. <br /> <br /> I have to say more than once that I thought the director saw "I know what you did last summer" and tries to give it a Bollywood twist. My first movie was Bride & Prejudice. What I thought was well handled. <br /> <br /> This seemed like what a Western audience would call direct to the Video Cheese Festival. <br /> <br /> The acting was exaggerated, sometimes it felt like they were deliberately trying to parody Western thrillers, but when you felt them weeping dramatically, crying, screaming or feeling scared, it felt wrong at the place. <br /> <br /> The viewer wondered when one of the actors would blink at the camera. More than a few times, when the audience was shocked, we could only giggle the absurdity. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of foreign films, and although I do not know any Hindi, I have to say that they subtly subtitled the film. Sometimes it was difficult to read the white writing against the light background. <br /> <br /> The villain was especially amusing, at least for me, because he came with his own mood music. The supposedly surprising turn actually felt like a police officer. <br /> <br /> The main couples were pretty / pretty enough and the musical numbers made my rental worth. I would recommend it to someone as a musical comedy, but I would tell them to simply rewind the rest of the movie because it's not worth reading. If you want to read a full subtitle Hindi film, then check out the superior Romantic Drama 'Namasteay, London'. <br /> <br /> But I was not scared ... unless that's really what they think is horrible in India. 1 out of 10 for what is touted as. 6 out of 10, as there is unintentional speed and the possibility to ban many laughs and it is music / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
