The successor to writer / director Michael Hurst's Wri-Fi channel of Stan Winston's classic horror story, in which revenge went awry, has its moments and a decent crush, but ultimately it lags behind the original. <br /> <br /> I'm Pretty Sure, the filmmakers did not try to make a comedy, but I started to laugh. A family feud that started because of a car accident is the basis for joining the franchise. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a hinterland town with dirt roads, drive with pickup trucks, drink moonlight and kick each other out. Just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love, causing the attack to hit the Shan. One night, the two Lovebirds decide to head into the forest for a good time while Ricky's sister is on the lookout, but just this night, some of the Hatfields accidentally kill Ricky's sister and capture him and Jodie. You know what happens next. Ricky finds the body of his sisters and decides to visit Haggis so he can take revenge on the mighty Pumpkinhead. Your Haw! Harley (Lance Henriksen) warns back to warn potential damned souls not to use Pumpkinhead to ease their pain. Which really caused a kink in the story, because Harley Pumpkinhead should have called years before this story happened, but the scenes and characters seem like dirty pilgrims who somehow went through time to bring the pickup truck back to Plymouth , Then there's the sheriff (Rob Freeman), who has his own ties to the demon and looks like he belonged to a 70's revenge movie instead of a horror movie made for cable. <br /> <br /> Some of the nerves and special effects were cool, but instead of following a man's mindset, Hurst used some awesome-looking 3D footage for specific scenes. One particularly embarrassing shot shows Pumpkinhead jumping off of branches like a poorly rendered 3D monkey. The cinematography was exceptional and greatly enhanced the quality of the film. The acting was also pretty decent, except for some poorly executed accents. <br /> <br /> Family feuds never end well, especially when the families involved in the feud are struggling with Pumpkinhead. I did not enjoy every minute of this strip, but it was far better than most movies the sci-fi channel spits out. Perhaps it is a sign that the channel is trying to match the quality of its films to the quality of its original series. I would not waste coins on a rental loan, but if you get the chance to catch a chub repeat, I would say you should try it. It's not such a killer movie, but it easily climbs over the garbage that appears on DVD today.
