The net is a movie that I've never seen before. I remember going through it after the mediocre reviews and maybe seeing a snippet here and there since when he was on TV. I see it now, fourteen years after its original release, and am a little taken aback by how time flies. I was in my mid 20s and my childhood felt ancient. I felt like I should probably do a few exercises before my body begins to stack fat in the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. Anyway, that was the best part of this movie experience for me. I'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really got me involved with retro skies. Look at those big cans they call computers. Look, they chat in chat rooms! I remember those tank tops! You look ... stupid. And hey, Sandra Bullock even plays a role. Only settled Look at this. <br /> <br /> As a movie, The Net is just an uninspired, simple and completely routine Hitchockian cat and mouse thriller. Nothing archaic about it, they made it as much as they do now. Bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd whose job it is to fix software for people who do not get "the whole computer thing". By chance she comes across sensitive information and after her vacation trip she is almost killed by a sexy layman who proves herself to be a murderer (played by Jeremy Northam) and she should have been suspicious because of her fact in an American movie and the guy smokes and has a British accent!) She gets her "identity wiped out". Her house is empty for sale, and when she checks through, it turns out she has a new identity now. A condemned prostitute and cheater, not less. <br /> <br /> Now you could say that this is unlikely. How could you do that to her? Even in 1995 it is impossible! That's true, but in 1995, many did not even know what the Internet is. I can see how it is a plot hole that you could have accepted at that time. Far more catastrophic, however, are the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The film is obviously due to the Hitchcock movies (this is one of the thrillers that show a merry-go-round at night), but Hitchcock has always made sure his films are plausible. The characters did not behave like confused maniacs as they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not lend itself to a structure in which one inevitable obstacle leads to the other. The characters also tried a bit before embarking on the whole chase. Does Bullock's character really have no friends at all? Could not an old high school teacher confirm her identity? Or how ... her next pizza guy? Oh yes, she orders pizza from the internet. Never mind. You can find out the movie pretty fast. There seems to be hope for an ex-boyfriend. Do you really believe? You should always expect at least one surprise. The internet does not offer. <br /> <br /> The Internet carries great risks, this movie seems to predict. If the film had turned today, imagine the problems that the bad guys would have to go through to ensure identity elimination. Not only do you have to do all those boring literal things, you still have her Facebook membership with at least 100 friends and picture tags. Not to mention that she is on YouTube or Linked-In and what happens to your video blog with 150 daily hits or the webcams in her house and the recorded video of her in phones, webcams, other people's web downloads ... your IMDb membership?
