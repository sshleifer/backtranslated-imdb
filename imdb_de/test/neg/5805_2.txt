Positive ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in such films, they can submit their retirement papers and redeem full-time social security. <br /> <br /> While the idea of ​​a 35-year-old swinger working on video games losing his apartment and being forced to move in with Grandma Roberts, and bordering on Jones and Knight, this is foolishly addressed. Imagine the 3 bags would be happy about things the grandson Alex left in their house, and Jones is going to bed with someone who might qualify as their grandson! Movie. Selecting the characters Alex works with is incredible, as he enjoys his weed habit with the others. <br /> <br /> Terrible describes this miserable movie best.
