Apart from the DA (James Eckhouse) and a short-appearing woman who sympathizes Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger) plight convincing, Ellen is the only convincing figure - and a sympathetic character in the film. She is one, not her dying mother, who should be and is - the only true thing. It is not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself ... Until the plot turns against itself - and makes the mother in the eyes of her weak, willing, flat husband the "only one" who can do nothing for his wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the flat feeling of the husband who does not know the realities of his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> Finally, the imaginative scene in this full movie, in which Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, ends up lying. Ellen is just another young, strong woman who needs to be matched by a crybaby father. A very flawed movie - so flawed that you call it boring and time is not worth it.
