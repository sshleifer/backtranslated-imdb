Oh, the horror! I've seen a lot of gore movies in my time, but that only makes me laugh, not push. This is definitely a crazy movie and is very cheap, I can add, but if you are able to find out about the cheap audio, the terrible dialogues, the ugly girls, the obviously fake scenes and the general gaiety of the movie you might find something entertaining from this movie. The story is about a copter killer making an assassination attempt on every "5th day of the 5th month" of the 5th year (wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of them bravely tried) trying to make up the crapy dialogue) to stop the killer's bloody killing spree. The killing scenes (performed with a plastic toy knife) are pretty brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded screaming (which is very deafening). There are a lot of them, but it looks very phony; especially the blood spirit, come on, purple blood? But if you're a fan of gore videos like me, then in this video you'll find something that I like the way I did it (the shitty detective ... he's the best for this movie). Otherwise you will only find a lot of pointless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad the girls are OOOGLY) and a very idiotic hippie necrophiliac serial killer. Sorry, that's a shit.
