First, I read the director's comments below and would like to thank him for giving his opinion. I've always wondered what the creators of the movies praised on MST3K feel about their work being shredded (not to mention how Best Brains got the rights). However, Rissi's comments make me wonder how much sci-fi the movie could have cut to make it look different (now I think I could borrow it from NetFlix). Of course, I have never seen the uncut, non-MST3K version of this movie, but even if I saw it on MST3K, I never saw it as a bad movie or something unsurpassed (though I thought it was a pretty funny MST3K movie). Consequence was.)); certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "skin-shattering terrible"; Not after seeing "Future War" and "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> As far as the cutting of the film is concerned, this has been done at least once on MST3K. A typical example: the Joe Don Baker strip Mitchell, which cuts the subplot with John Saxon's character in the MST3K version, but Joel and the Bots comment on the absence of Saxon after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I'm allowed to submit a review to MST3K, if you need to cut the movie for time reasons, it's fine, but be fair to the movie being cut (even if it's a movie as bad as Mitchell). Of course, such a review is pretty pointless when the show is over, but I think that aspect of the show was somehow unfair. But when it comes to Soultaker, he gets my sympathies. <br /> <br /> Still, I maintain that it's a gratifying MST3K episode, though the movie itself, even the version that was "hacked" in MST3K, is not nearly dreadful. <br /> <br /> As a final comment, in a strange coincidence or maybe in a case of synchronicity, I saw The Hudsucker Proxy the day Soultaker was broadcast, and you would not know the man, Vivian Schelling's father played a small role in this film; actually one of his three other roles. I thought that was funny.
