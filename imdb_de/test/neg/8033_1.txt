Even Mel Gibson could not save this movie. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would Mel Gibson make a movie that I'm sure he can not sit and watch? What was that? A total fool on some heavy drugs pursuing a schizophrenic lady who also had some serious illegal street drugs. For all moviegoers taking heavy drugs; you will love this movie.
