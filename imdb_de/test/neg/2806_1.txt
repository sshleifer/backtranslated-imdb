If you were in the East of Europe (or even in your armed forces), this movie might be interesting. I do not know why this is a comedy (sure, there are a few funny moments), but it's not a good movie when one of the ordinary officers talks for 15 minutes about the achievements of socialism at a Christmas dinner. Officers generally behave like funny fools, the soldiers run from the base to meet their girls in the night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the daughter of the commander. The East German army was known for their abusive and humiliating service of their conscripts, and the comedy was basically not filmed in facilities or equipment to make a good film about the East German army and its time. Nevertheless, some of the actors and actresses tried to behave well, but only in the roles for which they are known from the GDR television and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheap.
