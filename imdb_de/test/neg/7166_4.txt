I once saw parts of it on TV, and when a friend recommended it, I started looking for it, even if it looked like there was nothing nearby. I finally got it in an antique shop and could not wait to see ... Oh, I had seen it a few years ago and really enjoyed it. I was surprised that this movie lasted only about 80 minutes, and I think that missed the plot and the story so much. The plot sounds really good, both on the trailer and on the movie commentary: A teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his newly discovered stray lab Yellow are on a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison) during a storm. Together, they manage to survive the wilderness, waiting to be found and rescued. What is never mentioned, however, is that everything is shortened and the events of the conspiracy are very hectic. There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown together for more than a single moment. Yellow is a mischievous dog that parents are reluctant to keep, but in a matter of days he seems to appreciate being on a boat trip. The scene in which the mother (Mimi Rogers) vaguely mentions the death of the younger boy (Joel Palmer) goes nowhere. In no time we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island, then suddenly it is 14, then 19. Of all the animals that could be exposed to an outlier in the wild, attacks only one species - a wolf - on. Why could not anything else have been a problem than beating the same animal twice, maybe even the same? There are few views on how Angus prepares food, unless he discovers fruits and roots and fries a trapped rat. If he knows so much about survivability, why have not more scenes been shown? The only thing that emptied me was why the dog did not have much alone. If he is rescued and the dog is left behind on the island, there is no scene that shows how he survives without the help of a human. I wish I was more open when I look at it, but I enjoyed some of it. The acting was good and the score was enjoyable. However, I wondered why the father looked so much older than his family and why he and the rescue and rescue chief shared names. This is a good movie for kids, but even though the protagonist is 14, nobody would care about 10.
