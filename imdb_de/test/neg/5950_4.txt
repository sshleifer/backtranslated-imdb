I have just watched this movie. I could not imagine seeing it on VHS because there were scenes where I needed subtitles to hear an accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is pretty appealing. The few CG effects were very obvious insertions, but the prosthetic / creature effects were not bad. Not perfect, but taking photos and editing (which was pretty good) made up for a lot. Acting was generally bad, though I could not say how much of that could be accused to the director, as I had never seen any of the actors. I think the exception was Mr. Gomez (Uxia). She stole every scene in which she played a role, not just for a very pretty face, but there was something that resembled an urgency of her performance that none of the others had. The writing could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and many details of Lovecraft were written, but I could have foregone most of the dialogue.
