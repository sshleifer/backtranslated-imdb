This movie was terrible. Clich√©s, crazy dialogue and acting make him almost unsurpassed. <br /> <br /> The feel-good finale is ridiculously lame. <br /> <br /> There's a reason why Judge Reinhold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York and are not Jewish, some of the jokes will be unfathomable. <br /> <br /> I also felt the need to make the unrecognized lesbian daughter insulting in the end. <br /> <br /> I just can not imagine how much this movie was so popular at film festivals. <br /> <br /> It's without doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
