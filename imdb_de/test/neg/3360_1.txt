Jack Frost returns with an army of polystyrene balls that can only be thwarted by shots from margarita-laden supergars. How is that for a conspiracy? The movie depends on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with grilling tongs and impaled by carrots. You could even say the whole movie is on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic one-liners, including a remark about the Murderous Coconut Shark. <br /> <br /> Fair times are tough, but that does not excuse the actors' willingness to participate in such a threesome. <br /> <br /> For those fans who hope to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept him as merely a phallic carrot crawling up the beach with a nasty comment.
