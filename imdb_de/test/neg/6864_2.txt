This film was a waste of the celluloid on which it was printed. It is a catastrophic scene, much like a particularly cruel train crash. <br /> <br /> If you observe this, try to explain the meaning of life. The main point of action is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal that should not play because it would hurt his parole. The children he is friends with refuse to play with him as a coach because he plays. BUT ... a few minutes later, having won the championship, a large sum of money saves their accommodation. And where did they get the money from? PLAY !!! Add this to the scary scenes in the funeral home (why is there a BEDROOM in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
