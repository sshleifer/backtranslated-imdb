You know these films, which are so incredibly bad that you have to laugh? Semi-caste was not one of them. What sounds good, right? No it is not. It's not a bad attempt to watch a horror movie that's fun because it's lame or does not play well or has bad special effects or the like. No, half the caste is just boring. They do not even try to be scary until the last 20 minutes. It's just kids walking around in the African bushland, getting the first 75% off the elephant droppings, and it's not even funny. However, the last 20 minutes are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was really funny to see the CGI leopard tear down all the white guys I could not tell anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, you can not rent it because you're going to sleep before you get into the fun stuff. If you borrow this film by mistake, I would recommend going forward to the end and skipping any scene that happens in daylight. You will miss nothing. You have no idea which character is which or what exactly happens, even if you look at the entire background story.
