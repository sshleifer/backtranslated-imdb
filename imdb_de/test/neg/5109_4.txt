From the brilliant spirit that brought us "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruising". "Rampage" is unfortunately more like the latter. It's an overall messy movie that offers a great TV atmosphere. The whole movie pretends to focus on the question, "What if the boy next door was a serial killer?" Instead, it becomes an uninspired drama in the courtroom and a meditation on the lunacy and the death penalty, which makes little sense. The film is loosely based on the case of Richard Trenton Chase. Here and there, some facts are singled out to get a false character and a different result. One of the main points of the movie seems to be that the end of an endless Braindead child and the ending of a murderer are somehow analagous. "Sometimes you just have to vote," says the main character. Yes, sometimes you have to pull the plug ... on your TV!
