(HR is, as Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too). It's amazing how smart people, talents, even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he did. No one has returned from the wild in recent years and left an impression on himself. <br /> <br /> And I really expected a great movie (What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress). As intense as Reshamiya is, I thought he would be distinguished by a soulful and emotional role. Ironically, he is portrayed the same way, but for what concern? Mere incompetence, carelessness, terrible acting, banal background music and an insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> Blunders rule. (How can the German police loudspeaker give public instructions in English loudspeakers? They communicate with each other in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become standard in Bollywood's main line. There are some excellent directors, but also many bad ones. The worst thing is that the majority just does not care. <br /> <br /> songs are the only saving grace ... <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat this HR and find yourself a good director (low budget ... no problem). <br /> <br /> The villain would have had to shave his head instead of the wig, you know ... after all it's a 50Cr movie.
