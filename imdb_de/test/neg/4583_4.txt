But just like the Disney movie two generations ago, this film fails in the accuracy department. But at least Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the true story too banal for film producers? I do not believe there is a comprehensive documentation to accurately portray the true story rather than the fictional accounts we suffered. <br /> <br /> In a movie, Bobby's owner, John Gray, is somehow correctly portrayed as the cop of Edinburgh that he was and the license of Bobby, which was paid for by Lord Provost. If that happens, I'm in the cinemas.
