Danny De Vito shows us here that he definitely, in fact, is infinitely better than on the screen. He plays the role of Owen, a lousy wannabe writer with a crazy old mother (sexually played by Anne Ramsey), whom he would like to see dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has a strange woman he feels the same way. After watching Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train", Owen suggests they exchange murders. As a director, however, De Vito's control is volatile, as he wastes this clever idea while his film is very funny. He and Crystal are okay in the lead roles, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as the cheerful Mrs. Lift. Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
