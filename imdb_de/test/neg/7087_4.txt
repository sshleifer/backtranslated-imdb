I really wanted to watch this movie because it's a fifties science fiction movie - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, while looking forward to evil-eyed aliens or rugged conquerors, the aliens in this movie were a big disappointment! At first you only see very briefly at the beginning (and he looked pretty ordinary) and you only have a glimpse of a spaceship! Second, the alien was neither the evil conqueror nor the benevolent friend of humanity - but a real nerd. And finally, the plot itself seemed so stupid, preaching, and cumbersome that it caused more yawning than thrill. <br /> Russia, China and the USA) are kidnapped by a foreigner. The alien gives each of them a means by which he can destroy all life on the planet, if he so wishes - for the alien admits that HIS people would like to inhabit the earth, but they do not kill themselves to them to get. Then he gives them all back. While it is 100% obvious that nobody wants to use these devices, the alien announces the identities of the five on TV, without saying that the weapons are so powerful! All militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to uncover the functioning of the weapons. The rest of the movie consists mostly of some of the five who are hiding, and one who is tortured to make him show how the device works - because the Soviets want to use it !!! This part of the movie was pretty stupid. Sure, the USSR was a bad and corrupt nation (sorry, but it's a fact - especially under Stalin) - they never thought to use them like in the movie! Later, one of the five (the German scientist) states that the devices can also be used to kill only the bad people who hate freedom. So he uses it to wipe out all the evil commies and presumably others who oppose freedom, and the world becomes paradise !! Preaching, stupid, and full of storylines - this movie is simply not worth the time, though it's an interesting relic just because it addresses communism - especially the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
