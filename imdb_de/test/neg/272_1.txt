Like most people, I could not wait to see the continuation of this ocean, but it really stinks, I must say. It stinks because there just is not a good script, it was just cheap. I hope the producers are donating (or will be making) all the money this movie has (or is going to) make to the tsunami victims in Asia, so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist. It's so bad that I can not even write a decent comment on it, but .... I still advise the creators of this thing to do "Ocean's 13". Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves trying to steal a screenplay hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign (possibly Russian) scriptwriter who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this well-hidden screenplay so that they can replace the original they need to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself, but all the other star members of Ocean's films. 13 people because it's the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character.
