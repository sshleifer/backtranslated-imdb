OK, I saw Wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> It's not something I would recommend to people who are not serious about Japanese combat films. This is a kind of Japanese Ninja combat movie with a complex storyline. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "swords of sorcery". I've seen the subtitle version (which, by the way, is NOT recommended, it's easy to miss something) and I did not really hear it all. It had some good scenes, but in general I was not feeling well.
