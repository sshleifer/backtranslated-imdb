"Caligula" has many of the same characteristics as 1970's "Fellini Satyricon", with bizarre notions, freaks and depictions of sexual excesses, all anchored in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini is not ... First, it's not that entertaining. Much too much time for the screening accounts for the fact that McDowell plays in the titular role with the massive, rubbery faces. His appearance is far too cowardly and too striking to convince. The portrayals of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more convincing and credible, with the latter being the most nuanced. Relief would have been possible by more fully developing the surrounding characters. As they are, they are little more than numbers. An example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari, who has an enormous screen presence in an important role, but usually remains in the background. The only positive qualities for recognition are the skilful use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in music and the inclusion of some unpleasant, yet precise acts of the despot. However, these two factors are far less than what is needed to alleviate the prevailing boredom.
