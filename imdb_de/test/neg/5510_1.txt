Really terrible. Obviously, an attempt to capitalize on the Star Wars craze, but there's no excuse for that bland piece of garbage. The action is lost in front of the middle, the characters are forgotten and the child is such a non-talent that he poses only for the camera. An alien planet they land on is actually the Marine Reservoir in Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie actually made me sick when I saw it. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman has made some good, bad movies in his career, but there is no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb does not let you get zero.
