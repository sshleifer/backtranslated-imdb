This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive, a very good movie in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good as well, but I was wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive, except that both take place on submarines. Second, the plot can be slow, boring, and in some cases totally absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie will not catch the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes that have dramatic effects that make the viewer laugh. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. After overcoming my initial shock that anyone would slip into it and not knowing that people would not only disbelieve it, but laugh at the sheer stupidity of it, I could find humor. I want MD in a good submarine movie Watch Crash Dive and let this lame movie on the shelf.
