Nothing about this movie is good. It's a predictable "romantic comedy" designed to force women to watch their significant others watch. In other words, it is a predictable chic that is neither comedic nor romantic and is extraordinarily memorable. If you want to see the same thing over and over again, this movie just fits perfectly. I was also forced to see this with my G / F at the time, and it's no surprise that we're not together anymore. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while just watching the same thing with different actors over and over again. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (1 b / c) I can not specify zero.
