I just saw this movie because of Sarah and forgave these 4 stars just for her, on the other side. This movie was by far one of the worst films I have ever seen. The topic was terrible. The script was not inspired. This film contradicted itself again and again. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. It's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. That did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, the more I think about the whole plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we find. Really a shame, because I'm pretty sure there was a good idea somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I may be a bit hard to give the movie a 4/10, but the actors get involved and again once SARA obvious writing talent, this film should have really brought much more.
