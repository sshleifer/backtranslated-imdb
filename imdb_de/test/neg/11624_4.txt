I was disappointed with the continuation of the swan princess. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how the married life of Odette and Derek went, but the story was not interesting enough to catch my attention, and it seemed to cover the same foundations as the original. <Br /> <br /> It's not funny. The only thing I found funny was when Jean-Bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and nobody saw that it happened, and he tried to convince them that this was really the case. <br /> <br /> The villain is rubbish and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The queen is a very irritating figure, and instead of cheering Derek to rescue his mother, it is hoped that the villain will set a spell in her box to stop her from speaking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because I really liked the first movie, but it did not live up to my expectations.
