I have seen this movie so you do not have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking of? He did that for the scale? <br /> <br /> At the very least, the title of the film is the truth in advertising, as people and objects disappear and cause confusion over the course of the film. Kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he was not sure if Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. This is not a good sign for the viewer who can follow the story. <br /> <br /> The "making of" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. It explores the difficulty of assembling an indie's financing, even if the film is filmed. <br /> <br /> This movie is visually appealing and does not look like a movie that was just made with just over 1M. Too bad that the money was not spent on a better project.
