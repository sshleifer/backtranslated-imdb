I was not so impressed with this movie, he found it rather tiring and easy. The plot was interesting, a kid started his own college and enrolled hundreds of children, but the laughter was low. The jokes were not really funny and I was wrong in any of the scenes. The characters were not intriguing and I did not feel for any of them, even for the fat, fat boy with glasses trying to get into the group of brothers. It was a good first o'clock, but it did not blow me away, and I would not recommend it. If you compare it to other films of the same genre, American Pie is just cruel because there is a movie that was a lot of fun. This ACCEPTED could not raise a smile!
