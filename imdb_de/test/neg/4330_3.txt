This movie has an amazing cast. MGM took some of his best character actors and played them in a movie starring the most adorable Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone play three greedy old bachelors living in the same house. While they have amassed a fortune over the years, they were also selfish idiots. One of them has the idea of ​​making a donation to earn a good name (like Carnegie), but it turns out that the property they want to give away actually belongs to O'Brien. And since she's an orphan, they volunteer as guardians to give up their property and look like great philanthropists. There is also a silly subplot of fairies - led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And since O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little people make up a large part of the conspiracy. Honestly, I absolutely hated that part of the movie and wish it had just dropped it. Instead, the story could have been STILL that sweet Margaret would melt the middle hearts of the old men - that would have worked. But ... the "little people"?!? Sheesh! Overall, the actors are very, very, but the stupidity of the conspiracy and the deadly, serious way they tried to make me cringe. I noticed that many people liked this movie - I think I'm just an old complainer! I found the movie terribly hard to watch.
