"Dolemite" is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta Love Blaxploitation movie title), an ex-con that was probably still in jail. He has problems with police officers, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. He just is not that nice. It's not the movie either, though it's still hilarious and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The shaky premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as the star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is imprisoned for a crime he alleges did not commit when using a drug or a drug Drug abuse or drug use is imminent, the guard lets him go to stop it, to help him or just to watch. Not very clear. All I know is that I did not know that the justice system is freeing the convicts so they can prove their own innocence. My ignorance, I think. <br /> <br /> The plot is kinky and unimportant, basically Dolemite walks around killing people (usually with poorly choreographed karate), sex and cursing, sometimes rhyming. The joys of the film are its total incompetence and utter indifference in the matter. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting how many times I saw the boom microphone after it was in a scene for a full two minutes of filming). I stopped wondering why the keeper saw Dolemite's eyes, even after he had gotten up and walked around, as the hiring shot returned and Dolemite inexplicably sat down again. I no longer wondered why Dolemite was dressed as he took off in the street to change, because he did not want to get into his car with the ugly (meaning normal) clothes the prison gave him. And I no longer wondered where he had learned karate when he wiggled his hand on the belly of a man and somehow cut him open. I was only nervous and tense from afar as the disgusting, limp white mayor walked around completely naked with nothing but a towel around his neck that barely covered him. You keep saying "Cut away ... Cut Away ... Cut Away", but if you do, you're already emotionally frightened. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous in every way. Moore as Dolemite is either funny, cool or both. If you are looking for a bad movie, you have found it with "Dolemite".
