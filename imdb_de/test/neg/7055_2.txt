The title of the film makes it sound like a porn, but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, Hot Summer in Barefoot County is an officer who was sent from a southern state to a small town to find and arrest moonshoes. However, the moonlight comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. Almost anyone can guess what's going to happen next, but strangely, the movie is very tame. It hardly qualifies for a PG rating. Also, the low budget is obvious in almost every shot and the acting is so amateurish. This movie was probably meant for the drive-in fans, but it's unlikely that it would satisfy them in 1974 as well.
