The Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch hits The Cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask at all film schools. Could you please teach future directors how to keep a camera steady? Turning the camera around like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks causes a headache. <br /> <br /> Also, film is primarily a visual medium that directors may want their camera to point in the general direction of the action. Film also requires light to work. Maybe a light source should be used to see the action on screen. I know it's a cave movie, but it's absolutely nothing disturbing to watch the pitch black for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> If you turn the film upside down, this does not indicate confusion on the screen. <br /> <br /> One Final Note to the Director I'm sure there was a good reason to have a terribly wrong CGI campfire. I really can not think of one for my life. <br /> <br /> Now for the scriptwriter. Try to make at least one character sympathetic. I would prefer two or more, but a decent person whom I can admire or care for could help. Even if you have flashbacks that make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you're going to have a surprising ending, it's probably best if it does not contradict every single thing that comes before it. And try to add some fancy expressions to a cave movie. You might want to start with spelunking. <br /> <br /> The Cavern is a pretty bad movie, filmed badly with a confusing, unlikely and anticlimactic ending.
