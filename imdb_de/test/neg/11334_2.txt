!!! Warning of the spoiler !!! <br /> <br /> The point, though, is that I did not think this movie would end to pamper him ... I just started to look at him after Matt got into Sarah's role but then I was intrigued by the plot's quirkiness, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and could not possibly see how happy Matt would be. What about his fianc√©? On one level it looked like he was going to get with his best friend, certainly icky and wrong ... and then the whole 'oggi oggi oggi' thing does NOT work as a touching buddy-mate slogan, it was just ridiculous. .. so was that going to be sure he could not just return to life? and how can he live as a woman? 'and then the movie just survived by finishing something and not explaining anything !!!!! What is it about??? I was so crazy, wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason !!! :) but was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so swings and carousels
