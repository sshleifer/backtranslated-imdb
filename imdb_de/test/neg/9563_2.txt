It goes without saying that a certain amount of privilege must be set when adapting a true story to the big screen. But if you're making a fairy tale that has next to nothing to do with what actually happened - why bugsy you and make the audience believe this is a halfway true story? The godfather trilogy also handles many real characters and events once upon a time in America, but they do not claim to tell true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br In the movie Benny has this great vision of a Eldorado of a player; In real life, Lansky had to get him to go to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​a Monte Carlo counterpart idiotic and preferred to continue his playboy life in LA. It was not until much later that Benny came up with the idea. But of course he's the hero of the movie, so the idea had to be natural. <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny Count diFrasso wants to use to approach Mussolini to assassinate him because he was. After all, Hitler's partner and Hitler killed Jews in gas chambers. Obviously we should like Benny, so the scriptwriters invented this nonsense. In real life, nobody knew anything about the gas chambers at the time, least of all Benny, who was completely uninterested in politics. In fact, he used the Countess's compound and visited Mussolini, not to kill him, but to sell explosives to him. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> The whole Greenberg deal was nonsense. Greenberg did not pigeonhole, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (that was Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they had the right name. <br /> <br /> I think it should be very romantic to return Virginia to Benny and offer him the money she had stolen. The movie goes so far as to tell us in text fields that she returned the money to Lansky after Benny's assassination. Let me just say that revisionism just does not become more outrageous than this. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive - there is the problem that Benny's family does not live in LA, such as Benny with Dragna and Adonis, the costello (an unpleasant business type), Lansky (a lovable teddy bear ), Benny himself (an aging windbag that would not have reached the age of 12 if he had regularly become "daredevil" in situations like the movie's and also who has neither the good looks nor the radiance of Benny Siegel and many others Apart from a few hard facts, there's nothing wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the one mafia movie that makes it even more ridiculous bad as Harlem, NY But honor where credit is due: this is an achievement in itself.
