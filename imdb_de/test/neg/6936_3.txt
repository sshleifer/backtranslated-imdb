Eugene O'Neill's 4 and a half hours of 1927 were brought to the screen in less than two hours. The combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama has not aged very well and the cast has some difficulties with it, especially Nina and Ralph Morgans of Norma Shearer. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes off better, but above all because he is a rugged character who is not given the philosophical reflections of others who better fit Gable's range. As soon as the plot has settled in the love square and the audience adapts to the voiceover, the movie becomes more fun. The technique used for the side notes is another problem. On stage, the action froze as the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. Here they are done as Voiceovers. You'd think that would work better, but with the action no longer freezing, the actors are forced to stop talking and grimacing in front of the camera to match the emotions in their minds. It's also hard for any movie fan to watch this movie and not think about Groucho Marx's hilarious parody version in Animal Crackers. These drawbacks are compounded by some cuts made on grounds of censorship (Nina's promiscuity is soft and does not mention she's getting the abortion, which is more central in the game), and a pathetic score (uncredited) like background music sounds turn of the century. O'Neill called this film "a horrible hash of attempted compaction and idiotic censorship," and although "Strange Interlude" is nowhere near as big as his later film "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night." certainly deserves more than that.
