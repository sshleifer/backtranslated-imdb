Tru Calling was good, but it could have been great. The concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening storylines that may have been explored in the future. Unfortunately, writing and an actor have failed the show. <br /> <br /> The writing was not that bad, but there were holes. Episode 13 "Drop Dead Gorgeous" allegedly used an incredibly toxic poison to kill the victim. It was so poisonous and so quickly killed that the victim did not have time to walk or even scream for help. However, there was no plausible explanation of how the killer got such a powerful poison. In Episode 15, "The Getaway," the policeman responded unrealistically outside the service. In the second diner scene, he (humbly) challenges the robber to drop the gun, and if she does not follow the order, and actually turns the gun in his direction, he turns into a stalemate and then into a hostage will situation ?? the situation he was warned about. His answer would have (or should have) been to shoot the robber if she disobeyed him and after pointing the gun at him. There are other mistakes in the stories, but I will leave it with these two examples. Despite the mistakes in writing, I liked the series. <br /> <br /> The other problem I had was that I just could not accept Eliza Dushku in that role. In my opinion she is too inexperienced and too easy to carry this part. She went nowhere, she marched; and all too often she stopped. <br /> <br /> She did not really have a facial expression or intonation either. She has either a thoughtful look or a sweet smile; rarely are other emotions visible. When she tries to be dramatic, she begins to look away, and "then" directs her gaze to her actor. Or, alternatively, she starts looking at her opposite and then looks away. Both are annoying when used to replace real emotions. An example of their lack of intonation is in Episode 20 "Two Weddings and a Funeral." During her second wedding, the speech is without emotions (eg hearts in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. With improved writing and lead change, Tru Calling may have done it.
