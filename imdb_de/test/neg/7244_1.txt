Right on the Colmyster. I fully agree with all your feelings and add them. I came to my PC to post a comment on this horrible (minus) Bgrade movie. I wanted to say that today I do not know how anyone could make such a sad movie - but you beat me. Everyone who reads this and Colmysters comment, trust me ---- Do not waste your time and money. It is an absolute shocker. The drama is totally pathetic, the script is much worse and the (so-called) special effects are a joke. Surely nobody has invested money to make this movie? I can not really say anything else about this so-called horror science fiction product, but I have to comment on this comment with 10 lines so that it will be accepted as a template.
