Yes, in this movie you will be treated to several little snowmen attacking in seemingly very warm climates, so this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. It is indeed a much worse movie than the original, as at least the entire production looked like it would cost more than a few dollars and a video camera. It has its funny moments, but it is a kind of weak filmmaking, considering the cheapness of the movie. You can not come up with a good story, your effects will be really bad, hey, let's make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible deposits, and we have our movie. The first had at least a somewhat credible story, as the snowman attacked the winter in winter and not what a resort equals. It also had better effects, this is just a step or two ahead of "hobgoblins" in terms of monsters, and you really want to be more than a step two above a pile of hand puppets. Still, it makes up for it all with a super-ending showing a big ocean ship struck by the mighty frost. Actually, I just kidding, but it was the funniest part of the movie.
