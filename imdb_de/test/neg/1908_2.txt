I just have to say one word ... SUCKS !!!! The only reason I've awarded this 2 is because Josh Hartnett was there and he's cool. Should have defeated that little guy's ass ... stupid and stupid and brainless. At the end of this movie you can not stand Klein and you really do not care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.
