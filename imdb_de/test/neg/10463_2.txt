Bad, bad and did I mention bad? Apart from the weird monster that terrorizes the workers, the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors were in the desert and a commentary that they have one hour of daylight left, but you can see through their shadows and the clear sky is clear probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT Director! <br /> <br /> The only cool part of this movie, apart from Clara Bryant, is of course the phantom skeleton on which the Bone Eater rides. The thing was pretty cool when the surveyors chased it on their bikes.
