As in so many films of the past, one would think that Hollywood would now experience this, resulting in a very disappointing movie, not to mention that the kidnapped victim is first alive before the ransom is paid. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie would like to remind you of these basic facts, if it ever happened to any of us. Why the long forest walk and can a city man really go through the forest without getting lost? Only an opportunity for a sentimental dialogue that was meaningless in the end. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to some of the director's comments in the feature section, about the big steps Redford has taken in the past. (Sneakers for one) surprised that he has agreed to play in such a movie. The comments and reasons of the director were weak. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the setting, I can not wait for spring to come.
