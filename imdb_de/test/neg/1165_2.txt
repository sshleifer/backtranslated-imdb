I've just watched this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame, as mentioned in other user reviews. What bothered me the most was the southern accent that some of the characters had. It took place in Wisconsin, not in the south. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big guy. Why did the guy who plays Jason and Leatherface portray him? , <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will do their homework on Ed Geine and the city and make a more accurate movie
