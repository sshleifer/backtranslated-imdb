I was waiting for this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to go half way (or was it quarterly?) Because of the bad script and the directing. Not to mention the poor cast! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and he's far more suited to be the hero of the story. Well, basically, it's just a laid-back girl from the country who cheated on her for a long time-decent friend just to have pointless sex with a spoiled rich brat. This film could not draw my sympathy, even if the author intended it. I wonder where the moral values ​​lie? <br /> <br /> The actors are so stiff that when I resume the movie (a few weeks after it was interrupted because of its boring nature), I still have not drawn my attention to it. The spoiled couple can only disgust me! What a movie! <br /> <br /> I think all the people involved in this production have to sit down and check it together so they do not make the same mistakes next time. And next time they might consider Josh Hartnett as the protagonist ...
