This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the first written review of a movie I did on my own initiative - not for a class assignment. I think that fact alone is saying something about this movie ... not a good thing! I'm not a seasoned journalist or critic (though I've seen my fair number of films), but I found this movie so painfully painful that it was necessary for my own peace of mind to rant about the experience. Where is it better than IMDb? When I forced myself to sit through the film and physically writhe from the inability to connect the dots, I was sure that there would be some "light at the end of the tunnel" was going on The movie ended and me was as enlightened as a dog ****. After several rewinds to check certain scenes, I still could not close anything sensible. I wanted to scream "Is this useful to anyone?" I would advise you not to waste your time, but if I were you, I would probably want to experience it myself. If this is the case, bring a crossword puzzle or something with you so you do not get bored.
