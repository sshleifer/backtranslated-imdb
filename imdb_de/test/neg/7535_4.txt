Very strange. But it should be. This director is his own man. Even if there are tensions, if Polanski, Bergman and Kafka at least in episode No. 6, the Peeping Tom is one. What made everything so strange and reminiscent of the three artists mentioned above was that it went everywhere, you never knew where it should go, and it could have ended somewhere, and eventually, when it ended, could have gone on. The end is hardly a finality, no one could tell you what those two characters would do in the next frame. Something else should be said about the director: No wonder Kubrick found him fascinating. In this episode there is a lot of Eyes Wide Shut, in the direct approach to the character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick placement of the camera without strong effects, much more leaching and hurry, not so awkward. That is, back to the beginning, this guy still has his own things to say and says them well. For some reason, there is not a single scene I would ever want to see again. But in any case, I did not feel cheated in the least. But I have always had the feeling that three or four other ghosts of the directors are moving through the parade and blurring everything. The caveat was that it was only the sixth episode: the other nine could give me completely different attitudes. But since this episode is about watching, watching, filming the absolute domain of the film, I will say that he did not follow the usual path, definitely went his own way while carrying the luggage of many good directors.
