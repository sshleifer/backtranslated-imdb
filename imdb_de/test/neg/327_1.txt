If you see horror films on a low budget as well as I do, you'll see who was involved in making the film, because every filmmaker gives the cheese its own taste. This is the case with Jack-O. When I saw this really horrible movie, I had the incontrovertible feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as a director, but somehow, and as I researched, I realized that I was right. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something so amazing, and this movie only stank of Fred Olen Ray. If you do not like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why someone would do this) avoid this movie. If you're renting an Olen Ray photo or renting Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, this is the only bright star in Olen Ray's dark cheesy universe of horrific movies.
