Steven Seagal's recent films have not been good, but this is by far the worst since The Patriot. The action makes no sense at all; It is never clear in which relationship the characters stand, who works for whom or who crosses twice. The film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story rather than carry it on. Even the action sequences are uninspired and difficult to follow. Most of the blame must lie at the feet of the director, because he has not even understood the basics of filmmaking, but Seagal does not come away lightly. As one of the producers of this film, he also has to share the blame. Oh, and I did not even mention how awful the drama is, even by Seagal standards. Even for video feed, it is not worth watching even for Seagal fans. Make a big turn!
