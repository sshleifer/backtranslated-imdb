It's a shame that they did not trust the original enough to build on it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" picks up on the great ideas, fancy and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that continuations have to offer. <br /> <br /> The initial commercial was cute And so was the scene that follows (reminiscent of the beginning of "Guys and Dolls!"), but aside from a flash of thought here and there, this is a movie that one Slow, dirty Slog in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Ideas are introduced, interesting characters from the original are barely displayed here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they would not stick, no matter what movie, and then is there still the sound. <br /> <br /> In the blessed original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to entertain even the most repulsive violence with the kind of attitude that stirred up the attitude and sensitivity of a good pulp comic. Kershner (although he had made a sequel to "Star Wars") not. Scene by scene makes you either wince, look away or just switch off completely. <br /> <br /> And what about RoboCop? He should be the main thing here, right? But there are whole scenes in which he does not even appear, and in which scenes he is in, they are only half as elaborate and shaky written that you do not know if he is partial or partial-cyborg - since he is all boring , <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a quick decline in grace. Why is Hollywood doing so bad sequels? Intentionally? Why; Did the filmmakers have a bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; The FX are good, but the story does not even try to agree with them.
