This is one of the worst movies ever shown on the sci-fi channel. The movie begins as follows: Women are the only people on this planet, as in the not too distant future chemical warfare is OK, as long as it targets only soldiers (if you ask men), however, the virus will return fire (large Shock) and all humans on the earth are slowly dying. Then all male sex are sentenced to death when the woman president is shot by a man. Now it takes about 60 to 70 years, two scientists are working to clone a female baby, and one of them says, "Hey, why do not we bring back men?" The other says, no, the world is not ready for it, but ignores it immediately and so a man goes back to the Eath. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie assumes that all men who are not genetically modified, are blood thirsty monsters. Secondly, the author forgot to mention that today's soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers. So there is no reason to have such a virus. This is the biggest waist of time you can find. This movie has managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story, but also by the lifetime style. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give this a 1 in 10, but only because I could not be less.
