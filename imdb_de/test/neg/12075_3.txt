Wow, this episode started on a STOOOOOPID premise! The Enterprise chugs when suddenly Abraham Lincoln floats in space and welcomes the Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is that a really lame idea ?! Lincoln comes aboard and they greet her. Abe suggests that they shine on a barren planet where they meet other famous dead people, both good and bad. It seems that a really cheesy-looking Rock Monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to fight for supremacy. The whole thing looks really dark and unfair by nature, as the GOOD side is saddled with Surak - a Vulcan who makes Gandhi appear like Rambo !! Despite an absolutely AWFUL premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it in this reluctant fight. Do not confuse this with high art or deep sci-fi. The bottom line was that the series was the first series on the last legs and this really looked like they would dust this turkey and film him, regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
