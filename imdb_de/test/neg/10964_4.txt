The plot of the movie is pretty simple: A virus outbreak turned the population into carnivorous zombies. Those who left became hunters. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is NOT the worst zombie movie out there. Among the worst are "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the idea for "Quick and the Undead" was very good, just bad. Given the budget they had to work with, this film looks very good. I was not bored when I saw it. The special effects were solid, even though they once used CGI (fat zombie shot in the head), but everything else (Gore, Courage) was pretty good. Acting is terrible though. Our captain looks like the young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. As for the plot, they have not worked enough on the history of the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: Acting, Low Budget. Good: special effects, idea for the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie deserves 4/10 of me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a ZOMBIE WESTERN and watch this movie.
