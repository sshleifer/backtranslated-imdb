In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should reveal the truth. This means, in particular, that among the interviewees there are experts on this topic and representatives of all sides. This movie is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film are "Men of the Road", who deal with the issue of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed theme of the film, is not treated seriously at all. For most interviews, the interviewer simply waits for a speech and asks general questions like "What do you think about the wall?" - She does not randomly approach selected people near the wall and asks them how they are directly affected. Apart from one interviewee, the Israeli general responsible for the construction of the wall, we have no "experts" on the subject to tell us the context of the wall (eg how and when the project began, if it was successful and for which Groups and what's against the project, etc.) Outside of the interviews, a large part of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes, such as frontal shots of the wall, wall construction and people climbing from a bus. These recordings take far too much time, in my opinion. It's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the wall's (and only the wall's) head turning 20-30 minutes is over the top. Of course, these recordings (accompanied by Arabic music conveying feelings of sadness) are only for the purpose of arousing a sense of aversion to the wall in the audience.
