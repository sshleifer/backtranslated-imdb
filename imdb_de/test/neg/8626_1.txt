I can not believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and was not a sequel to Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I could not care for one of the characters. The dialogue is cheesy. Some moments in the movie actually made me moan (including the crazy neighbor of Kiefer Southerland and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is stupid - I can not say which country to come from. It must be one of the least exciting thrillers I've ever seen. After Sandra Bullock's character has disappeared, absolutely nothing happens, which drives the story for a good 45 minutes. I would give this movie a negative number of stars if I could.
