I actually went into this movie with a few expectations, not because I thought the movie sounded great, but because I'm a fan of Italian exploitation and with a cast in which Franco Nero and Telly Savalas star alongside Oliver Twist I thought it had to be interesting at least. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things, but for the most part; It's a boring, lifeless movie that's as ridiculous as it is pointless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) kidnapping a young child (Oliver). The twist in the story is that the child realizes that it would be more fun if it were included in the "gang". Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have proven that they can wear a movie on numerous occasions alone, and they have some memorable moments in this film - albeit for all the wrong reasons. Especially Savalas describes the "bad" criminal stupid. The plot does not go bad, but since nothing interesting happens, that's not really a positive point and does not save the movie from being mediocre. Overall, I can not recommend this movie. It may appeal to some for their cult value, but it has not done anything for me.
