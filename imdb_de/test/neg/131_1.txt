Breaking Dawn begins at a California college when Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they need to conduct an intensive six-week study with a psychiatric patient at Cape State Hospital as a critical part of their education, failing and never failing qualified physicians become. An intelligent, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) receives a particularly difficult patient. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and is a convicted murderer. He was found covered with blood next to the body of a woman (Diane Verona) and her little daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first, Don does not even look at Eve, but speaks much less with her, but like the soldier she is, Eve remains trying to find him out. Eventually, Don starts talking, but what he says scares Eve. He says someone watches her and mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark, shadowy figure as Don performs the conspiracy theories and bizarre statements. Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy and reality blurs more and more. Is there anything more to the alleged nonsense Don is talking about except that he is the insane craving of a psychiatric patient ... Posted by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn , Well, we all like a good shoot, a kind of ending that surprises us, surprises, works well with the rest of the movie and remains in our memory like the cool twists of The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) just two good examples, and to a lesser extent the end of films like Scream (1996), where the identity of the murderer is a nice surprise and not so obvious. Then there are movies, of course, whose ends spoil everything that has gone before, and take as an example, oh, I can not say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a horrible end of a movie, never. Breaking Dawn begins with a decent psychological horror thriller, where ghostly things happen with Eve. It's not the most action-packed movie ever strangled by imagination, but it does spark interest, it's not the most exciting movie, but it's also more than just a show, and it's not so bad a movie to the very end. I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to this point (which was OK to be fair) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I'm sure there are people who think they've found out this confused mess of an end down to the smallest detail. All I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing to me satisfactorily. As far as I'm concerned, it does not make any sense, and it will not. Breaking Dawn is crap and it's a waste of time to reward him with the lame end of film history. It's as simple and uncomplicated as that. <br /> <br /> Director Robinson does not mess up a bit What could have been a decent thriller? Maybe he thought what he had shot would turn out to be OK or maybe it was ruined in the editorial room, but I imagine it was more of a garbage script than trying to tie up all the absurdities in a matter of minutes and give us all a happier than happy ending shot. He builds up the tension fairly well in the first 80 minutes, but it's all in vain at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> Technically, Breaking Dawn is fine and generally well done. Acting is pretty good, Overton is nice and good to the eyes and delivers a decent performance. Was it just me or saw the guy who played Don, like John Morghen's star of Italian Sleaze classics like Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1980) 1981), Stagefright (1987) and The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... Breaking Dawn is garbage, I hated everything because of the last few minutes. Do not get me wrong, it did not upset me, but it was fine. In any case, one that I should avoid in my view, although it seems to have positive comments on the IMDb ...
