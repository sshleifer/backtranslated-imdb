<br /> <br /> Never take a movie just for its handsome appearance. <br /> <br /> Although it all starts out well, the film suffers the same shortcomings as in B movies. It's as if the author at some point does not know how to end the movie. He ends it as no one knows, when he thinks he is awesome. <br /> <br /> the garbage list. <br /> <br />
