I've seen a lot of Asian horror movies lately, but this one was the worst so far. It started interesting enough, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The extra "drama" scenes, flashback sequences and serious storylines left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Only "something terrible" ??? Who started killing if it was not the ghost? What did she want to return to her ????? No answers! All in all not very scary and the filmmakers have to come up with much better ideas than these ... <br /> <br /> A positive effect was the cute actress, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
