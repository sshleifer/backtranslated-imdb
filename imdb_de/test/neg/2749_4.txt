As powerful as the true story of Phoolan is, this book that underpinned this film appeared before she was released from prison herself and had the opportunity to tell it. <br /> <br /> It's supposedly based on her diaries, but she's illiterate. How does this work? <br /> <br /> That is, some areas of the movie are accurate and the acting is not bad, it shows some sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Actually, this story must be old in a television series. Far too much jams in a few hours. <br /> <br /> Read her autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a fantastic story.
