This movie has a few good lines, but when I saw Dillon's inconspicuous Rourke impersonator, I just wanted to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she is not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> Also, in my opinion, the main rule is to turn the main character into someone you care about. You may not love the character, but it should be important to you what happens to him. This is achieved in Barfly with the funny gag about the bouts with Eddie, the bartender. The main battle in Factotum, as he struts unprovoked on the Lily Taylor figure in a bar, knocking her down and calling her a whore. <br /> <br /> The whole thing just did not work. Again some great lines - some funny to laugh - but as a movie it is a failure. Mediocre attempt to reinvent something brilliant, and you can not get past it. Next? Let's make the breakfast at Tiffany with Kate Hudson new.
