This is another movie I missed as a kid on Italian television: notable for its quintet of aging stars, most of whom have never made a horror movie in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks, John Houseman and Patricia) Neal), is the long-hidden crime of the men returning to persecute them. The girl they all loved (Alice Krige) was awakened by a ghostly, dead alarm that she had to remove after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated her ego! Fairbanks, who was responsible for the deed, has twin sons (Craig Wasson), and Krige also directs her revenge on her. Soon, one of them, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman, was all dead. So the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene, where they are also struggling with a few weird tramps that somehow make Kriges's bid! I looked forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (Douglas died even before the movie premiered at the time, by which time he had completed another role, while Astaire's own unkempt swan song proved to be) - many mood swings they are always lazy and are trading - anything but a failed curiosity. Dollops of sex (including Wasson's frontal nudity!) And gruesome make-up effects shook the water more and more and disrupted the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's (another long-known movie).
