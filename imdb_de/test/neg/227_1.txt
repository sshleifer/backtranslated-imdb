I only saw it because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friend hated it, but of course they liked being in the cinema. This is the first time I have disagreed with Ebert for many years. There is nothing that can recommend this movie. Willis is good as always. But the story stinks is unbelievable, there's no real story, no action, no interesting movie clips, no surprises, and worst of all, the kid star is a thoroughly repulsive slug that is guaranteed to shut down all parents who do not have dweeby fat slob for a child. Be sure to stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish it. There is no excuse for such bad government or writing and it is hoped that these filmmakers will suffer accordingly.
