This show was performed live across the country with a variety of line-ups. I saw it for the first time in Provincetown production when it was the first summer in P-town (2001) - before it was strangely banned in this overwhelmingly gay resort (the codes that led to its closure have changed since then ). I saw it later in the Off Broadway series, which has been in New York for a long time. Oddly enough, the P-Town production was far better than New York's - fresher, cuter, more spirited and funnier - but that was only seen in 2001; The subsequent attempts to clone the production ("Bare Naked Lads" 2007) were definitely third-rate. This film production is a casting production by Los Angelos, which, as other comments suggest, is not the best. I would rate it somewhere between the first-class P-Town production of 2001 and the third-rate P-Town show "Bare Naked Lads" last summer.
