NBC should be ashamed. I would not allow my children to see that. I would definitely tell my church to stay away. This film is a testament to why NBC has always been a third-rate network. The producers, actors and writers should kneel and ask forgiveness from God to create this fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not walk around on the deck of the ark. The ark had no deck. Lot was not even born when this event took place. Has anyone in this project tried to read the Bible? More than two animals of each type were taken. Read the story in Genesis. How can someone bring this to any screen, big or small!
