My mother and I watched this movie because my brother serves in the Peace Corps US in the same region he plays. Halfway through the movie, I decided that the title is presumptuous because it does not manage to achieve what it wants to pretend. The subject it dealt with might have been considered an excellent documentary, but due to its lack of execution I was much less familiar with the subject than I had hoped. I agree with Laura-Jane from Canada ("Powerful message, but lacking in focus."). I also agree with the user who commented that the narrator-free style of this filmmaker is the opposite of Michael Moore, but I do not agree that he presents different perspectives and invites the viewer to decide for himself. I agree with a user's comment that "a lesson is better learned if we draw the conclusions ourselves"; However, our conclusions can be poorly substantiated if we have little relevant information to draw from. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary seemed to be: 1) The African people Living near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer a lot from it. 2) The introduction of perch in Lake Victoria, caused by Europeans, ruined its ecosystem. 3) The communities around Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about the film is that it has tried to relate the perspectives of the average population in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, this is an anomaly among the films, and attempts have been made to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, unavoidable phenomenon. I liked the irony trapped in the huge amount of fish that left the country in the face of famine. I appreciated the depiction of how uncontacted the UN-assigned team was with the people. Like most documentary films that do not have the word "women" in the title, this film fails to represent women's voices - the majority of interviews conducted in interviews are those of men. <br /> <br Maybe I have to look at the film a second time to find out some important points that I might have missed, but I have Sauper's theory about the relationship between the introduction of perch on Lake Victoria and the unfair living conditions for the Africans not found near the lake. In addition, I could be wrong, but I noticed that Sauper could improve his interview skills. The questions he asked, and the answers he put in, not only seemed arbitrary, he also seemed to have a real sense that the interviewees were awkward and uncomfortable that the export of perch now serves as a weapon import to disguise, and that the real economy piercing Tanzanians is war, not fishing. Sadly, Sauper does not shy away from thoroughly explaining the idea (or at least prolonging the interview with the reporter, who seemed to know what he was talking about in terms of gun imports). <br /> <br /> When Darwin's Nightmare To dispel the myth that Third World exploitation of the Third World "gives a chance for a better life" has not done a good job. It did not do any good to portray how the arms industry in the US and Europe is responsible for many armed conflicts around the world. If it should be portrayed, what drives people to prostitution, it has done no good. If it was intended to provide information that the UN.N. is unable to carry out her mission, she has not done a good job. If you say that a meager income that Tanzanians derive from perch is not worth the human cost of tinkering with Mother Nature to create a profitable product, then it has not done a good job. If it meant that Tanzania would be much better if the Europeans had not come, that would not have been good.
