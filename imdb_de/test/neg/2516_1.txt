Luchino Visconti was and still is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this affair) has the stronger voice than Helmut Berger! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We come out of this ordeal and know less about what made Teacher great and more about things that are not at all interesting. The beautiful pictures belong to Visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews with Berger and Zeffirelli about Adam Low's little world. A must to avoid!
