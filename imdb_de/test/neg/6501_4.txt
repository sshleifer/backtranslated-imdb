Avida is a pun that mixes life and zeal, but I personally believe that this film has been exaggerated by its ambitions and does not live up to its title. It collects clumsy characters connected by incredible links. Besides, the way in which everything is connected at the end is a bit pathetic in my opinion. What was left of it was a series of pictures ... interesting, but not enough to make this movie a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should be a comedy, but I certainly did not notice! The film's nonsense and caricature is actually the only good thing about it, but if it goes on and on, it will no longer be tolerable. I have to say, I struggled hard to keep looking until the end, and I'm still not sure if it was worth it ...
