The lousiest of all lousy Jaws rip-offs has been made with regret from one of my very best favorite directors; Lamberto Bava (here under his pseudonym John Old Jr.). You know how these cheap European imitations work, right? They just want their monstrous animal to be bigger, sicker, and more threatening, but more often than not, this has the opposite effect. Bava's creature is a huge monkfish and it's more than just a shark! We seem to be dealing here with a prehistoric monster, with the chin and the appetite of a great white man, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It's up to two dolphin lovers to find out how this monster has survived all these millennia and why it's just now that it started its mordantous thrill. The script of "Monster Shark" makes little or no sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland. The shark itself is an unintentionally ridiculous creation and it was a wise decision by Lamberto Bava to show it only vaguely and lightning fast. The acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well processed. The twists in the storyline are predictable and you'll probably enjoy finding detailed facts about the characters. For example: Count all beer cans that Dr. Hogan has been drinking throughout the movie!
