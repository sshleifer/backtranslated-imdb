At the beginning of Loggerheads, three pairs of seemingly disjointed characters are presented. To make things even more confusing, we are informed (via titles on the screen) that the action takes place in three separate periods (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but eventually we'll see how the three couples relate to each other: Mark Austin, a young man in his twenties, gay and HIV-positive, is estranged from his conservative parents Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a drifter and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town where he meets George (sensitively played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner, and finally gets involved. Meanwhile, Mark's birth mother Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has come to a point in her life where she has decided to find the son she had given up for adoption at the age of 17. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother has decided to track her alienated son when she misses him (despite the concerns of her homophobic pastor husband). <br /> <br /> "Fools" that we know are based on a true story and maybe their Achilles heel. Director / screenwriter Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes of dramatic tension in which there is little to find. Do you take Mark and George? They are both sensitive souls who are little against it. There is a slight tension when Grace faces a director of the Adoption Agency, who is forbidden by law to give her information about her lost son, and a slight conflict with her mother, who denies having disapproved her when she was a teenager became pregnant. There are also no sparks between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend has insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son. <br /> <br /> "Loggerheads" is similar to "Brokeback Mountain" in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight guys (for example, the Kure Beach Cop and the Reverend) are the bad guys. The biggest disappointment of the film is that there is no interaction (and thus no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers". Mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him. <br /> <br /> The theme of Kirkman is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their deep feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's feelings are for the most part well intentioned, but they are not good drama. The fools are moving at a snail's pace, without delivering new revelations (or tension) on issues such as AIDS, adoption, and homophobia. Ultimately, "Loggerheads" fails due to lack of originality.
