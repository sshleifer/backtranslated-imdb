* The ELITE sniper team, which deployed about 24 hours earlier, has decided to hide behind a large rock in one of the first scenes instead of interfering and invisibility. * When the hero "runs" to save his wife, he actually jogs. * If the hero is in a building and is aiming for a target at a distance of only 20 to 30 meters, HIS AREA IS USING. Apart from the fact that most non-elite soldiers make the shot from the hip and still hit, there is also the fact that the riflescope would probably not be able to focus so close. There is a satellite that can look horizontally into buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest bunch of crap I've ever put into my DVD player.
