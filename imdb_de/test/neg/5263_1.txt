Kate is a young woman who has trouble meeting people and going out. Throughout the film you will meet some of your loser friends. Throughout the film, you are exposed to Kate's cynical negative attitude towards love and relationships. This negative view is consistently presented as the ultimate truth. I had a real problem with that. Why would someone want to be taught about love, life and dating by someone who is obviously so confused? It would work if that was the joke, but that's not it. For the jokes in the movie (which are neither funny nor original) to work at all, one has to believe what Kate says: all relationships inevitably end in bad or no sex, and the highest level a relationship can develop is, if you are able to root in front of your partner ... you have the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no recent movie that is as close to the stomach as Love & Sex. Why did the filmmakers waste their time with so much garbage? I have experienced every joke in Love & Sex in another film or in my own life. There is NOTHING original or creative about the story, the production or the style. It is cynical, stupid and meaningless. Be careful!
