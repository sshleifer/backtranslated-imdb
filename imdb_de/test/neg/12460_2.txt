SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I've given this movie 2 out of 10 scenes for 2 scenes I'll never forget ... By the way, my husband rented this amazing non-blow 'em movie that looks almost like a girl ... but I guessed why, when I saw the cover ... girls in school uniforms .... duh .... lol .... well, men, if you can not beat them. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Bijou Philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen ... too cute ...... not only in bestiality (her toy dog ​​is the best lesbian. ) in the city after her bubbly, vile character) .. that would be the first worthwhile scene. Then she enters a toilet in a pretty dress and goes into a stable .... after a while she gets up, goes to the party where she & the sad sad character "Cat" stands, and gives one to the host of the party shiny silver ice bucket ... The host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says, "Oh my God, it's Poo." <br /> <br /> I love Bijou Phillips herself for her creativity and unusual film selection. This would definitely be one of them .... and um, I would hire it for the poo scene if I were you ..... I'm not a big poo joke fan, but it definitely brings the "party people "in their place (they did not look like they still had a good time ... lol) ... you'll never forget those two scenes ... hmm, but do we want that in our databases? ... Maybe you should not follow my advice at all .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is somehow scary and sad in her confusing, nonsensical role in 'Tart'. I do not know, I can not decide if I like her because she likes indie movies like that? Indie films are great and all, but could not they pick a few good ones? I'll watch a few more movies and keep the verdict .... but this one was a dog (forgive the beasts)
