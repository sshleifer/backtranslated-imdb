Right, I can not see Comedy Central anymore, just because I can not stand watching the repeated commercials for this show. I tell you the truth, this is a terrible show, not because I'm offended, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I tend to watch Carrot Top make a George Bush impression than this no-skill hack. And to believe that he calls himself the greatest. Even if he did not steal the jokes, he's still bad at telling them he's too late and unoriginal. I recall with a joke that he said, "Why do white people go camping to be poor for a week?" Well, what does that mean? That all whites are rich? Another thing I did not understand was when he did a sketch by Price is Right and he told a fat guy, "You should know how much a fridge costs, you are fat" and the fat guy had the saddest face on his face. But what does that mean? That "fat people" are always looking for refrigerators? These are just the two I've seen in his commercials, God knows what his show looks like. <br /> <br /> This show falls in the sizes of Epic Movie and Date Movie ..
