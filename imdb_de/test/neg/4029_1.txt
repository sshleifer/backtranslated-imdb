This is such a crappy movie. I have no idea how he got on the shelves. You must have paid the movie store to make them take it seriously! History makes absolutely no sense, unless you take serious drugs. You absolutely have to get involved in something to see this entire piece of rubbish, so much so that you do not care what was on TV because you are almost in a coma. The writing sounds as if it was made by a 5-year-old, and acting is worse than in elementary school. The vile special effects they sought look so stupid. What did they spend $ 5 to make the whole movie? It looks like that! Oh my, this scene with the old woman who has a hairstyle from the 80s and the ugly girl in the rubber suits, me and my friends laughed so much. Did anyone think that making a movie out of it would be a good idea? I find that hard to believe!
