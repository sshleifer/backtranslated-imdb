This movie is boring, boring, boring, boring and boring !!! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, on the contrary, but ... how can I say that ... it's boring! There are some very beautiful landscapes and a smart, dry joke, but that's about it. If it were advertised as a travelogue, I would rate it as 7, but it should be a movie with a plot, some drama, and for heaven's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion. I read some of the comments on this film about this movie and I wondered if they saw the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie (yawning) at your own risk ... one thing for sure - it really is rated correctly = G RATING! (Which means most to GOD'S BEAUTY!)
