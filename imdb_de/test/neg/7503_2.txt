In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) founded an agency for male models and published a muscle magazine called "Physique Pictorial" and a men's movie. Many of these models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. <br /> <br /> Changing tracks from the '50s, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer in the present day, director Thom Fitzgerald used this strike action to show naked men and a lot of penis with a running time of 93 minutes, in a completely bad taste and very stupid crap. I have never heard of this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I do not know what AMG is. In my opinion, only gay and very specific viewers like the theme of this boring and overbearing movie. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("fresh meat")
