Although Charlie Chaplin made some great comedies in the late 1910s, others can not. Examples like "His New Job" and "Shanghaied" come to my mind and I would also consider The Floorwalker in this category. Charlie is considered a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager is trying to steal money from the cash register and run for it, and Charlie is just an honest customer who is accused of missing some items that were stolen by other customers, laughs in there, except for the last few minutes great scenes on the escalator. Quite disappointing for the rest. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
