*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last night at a show. I've started to like Tim Robbins and love sci-fi. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the future vision of the filmmaker was realistic, but still extremely interesting. I remember thinking of myself, "This is the most intelligent sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time." Then they just could not hold it together. <br /> <br /> Although there were a number of "rough corners" from the beginning, problems with this movie (editing and later on some of the lyrics) / plot development became more forgivable. They became unforgivable as the film gradually passed the threshold, and then the film became boring when it became apparent that he was not going anywhere at all. Robbins could not breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. His female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the film's turn seemed to be that the filmmakers could not decide whether they wanted to do a sci or not-fi movie or a futuristic love story. They did not end with anyone. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Some of the cinematographs: grainy, it sometimes felt like "21 days later" on. <br /> <br /> Great for a futuristic movie like this. <br /> <br /> I dug up some film locations. <br /> <br /> The music was cool. <br /> <br /> The vision of the filmmaker of the future was realistic, but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the writings were interesting (early). , <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (name ?? can not remember), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> A few questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many of the futuristic things in this Movie were handy to fix a patchwork story. Namely VIRUSES. Obviously, the virus they gave her at the end of the movie that she was physically "afraid" of was just there for them to stay in another sex scene, and then she could report him unchecked for the code 46 delete his Reminder and the movie ends. Classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ends if you ask me. binds all loose ends very neatly if you just make it a dream? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally good as an intuition or was it the virus? <br /> <br /> Why not? Do you explore the innumerable topics surrounding the girl as a clone of his mother? That could have resulted in an interesting story. <br /> <br /> First, I like the address from all over the world in addressing everyone. But it was intrusive, especially since their accents did not convince. I understand the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally androgynous, but in the end it felt like an AT & T Global Networking commercial was broken for Code 46? <br /> <br /> 'Cover' was never well defined. Sometimes it was as insignificant as a visa and sometimes it was just as important as life or death. Loose definitions allow them to use it to glue different parts of the plot together. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm starting to get negative, so I stop. There were some cool scenes and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it 4/10
