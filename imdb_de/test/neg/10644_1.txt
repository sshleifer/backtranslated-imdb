Hellraiser: Bloodline is just a movie. I think it's the fourth installment of the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the beginning, and all I remember were some up without women and a box thing on a computer screen. However, with my wit and intelligence (and info button), I quickly realized that the bad guy (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's box, which I believe is a gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box terrorizing the "Toymaker" family. And that's it. Oh, and not to mention the arbitrary tortures of various people crossing his path. Yawning. <br /> <br /> What mainly happens in this film is that Pinhead captures the child and then releases the dog from his wife and then kills a random person. Then the husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why does it fail because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too stupid to be scary. Look at Pinhead's Minion of Creatures: a cheesy dog ​​who looks like he's been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are tied together (Siamese twins in a horror movie?), And a person who to be a princess Sorting. (I have not seen the previous movies.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Is not that the name you call someone when he's stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks from his fingers and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he did not have such a crazy name and a crazy speech. Somewhere in the movie, two policemen approach him and say, "Do not let me hurt you!" Pinhead answers "Pain, how dare you use that word bla bla bla bla bla. It sounds a bit cliché if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the last half of the movie. The characters (and the audience) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks something futuristic asylum, a person we do not know (maybe he was in the previous films, I do not remember him at the beginning of the movie) Basically, a thing that is played over and over again: <br /> <br /> A security guard inspects a mysterious noise. <br /> <br /> Another Guardian: "Oh no! He is down. I'll check it myself! "<br /> <br /> After He dies, the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's what I did not get. In the movie, Pinhead becomes So he ended up in Oblivion, so how does he get back for four more films - are they prequels, why did not he die in the previous ones, my goodness, the creators have to come up with an idea for another series (END OF SPOILER Hellraiser: Bloodline is bloody and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or fear, just forget it, bad special effects with bad things make everything else a slumber party rather than a good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Well , some people like the above without women at the beginning, and Pinhead's voice is pretty cool, so I guess if you like ultra-violence, you might like it too. <br /> <br /> Poor: None of the above reasons make this movie a very good movie Dizziness and repeatability are pretty bad. And who calls her rogue Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message for this comment.
