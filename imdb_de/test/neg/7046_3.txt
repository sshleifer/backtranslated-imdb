It is a pity that there was so much controversy surrounding this picture (in other words, the notorious affair between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), as it led to a very memorable movie. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. To top it off, the movie is brimming with amateur actors who can barely speak English. I would have preferred subtitles - that would have made the experience less exhausting. Back to the lazy. The neorealist movement was big in Italy at the time this film was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (like De Sicas Umberto D., The Children Look Us and Miracle in Milan) because they have gained so much from the non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they behave like normal people trying to be actors and get away very badly - like children in a school play. <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you're hoping the movie will end well (making your time for the movie worth it), do not bother. The plot was just plain uninteresting and stupid - so much so that I really thought I could not care less about the characters. Like the island on which they all live, the film is desolate and without color and life.
