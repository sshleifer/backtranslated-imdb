Pathetic NRI crap ..... appeal to all who are not Indians .... This is the BADEST of Indian cinema produced by the worst NRI garbage ..... The story is boring and clich√©d (like NRIs and Westerners look at India) ..... Assume, if you want to be bored to death. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the plight of widows in India before independence. A lot of it is even true now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent shown (maybe because it's an epoch movie) ..... <br /> <br /> There are many other Indian films that are extremely talented Directors who deserve to be enjoyed. This is definitely a miss ... Instead, look at a documentation or look for information on the Internet if you are really interested in the plight of the oppressed in India. I wasted my time.
