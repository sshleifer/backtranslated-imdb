From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed to have released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie not too long ago. It was by no means well received. <br /> <br /> Not exactly sure where to go next as they thought Anderson was the best director of the show, and they had produced a real sci-fi gem that Fox turned around. It's about a small but knowledgeable group of monkeys looking for answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were by no means veterans of sci-fi film writing, but had seen Burton's Planet the Monkey Remake and House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Your first task: hire an actor. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save the money. Shortly after, they hired fifteen television actors. <br /> <br /> Now the script. The monkeys wanted to save more money, so they wrote the film themselves. The omission of important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. It was harder to think of great new lines that the general public could remember. They poked their heads for a while and developed a truly award-winning screenplay that featured clich√© characters, idiotic decisions, and gaping action holes. <br /> <br /> Fox has been satisfied with the results so far, but he wanted to see what would become of the middle parts of the movie - the aliens and predators. The monkeys wanted to save money again, so they decided to throw away the awesome robotics of the otherwise dreadful AvP original and play with the man-in-the-suit alien seen in the old movies. The actors who played the aliens had difficulty fitting into the suits because they were not the right size of the monkeys. Therefore, they shook the plastic heads through the film. As for the predators, the monkeys decided that this time a predator would be enough (again, to save budget) to fight the flocks of aliens who seemingly come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> But what about the effects? Come on, people. They may be monkeys, but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the movie. Without dipping into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and sparks effects. Placing red and green filters over the camera lens will give you some excellent Predator visions. <br /> <br /> The setting was something the monkeys thought long about. If this was to be on Earth, just in Colorado, of course, they had to make it realistic. Here they admitted that they could have made a mistake. The monkeys were not well trained in this department, so they thought to turn off the lights in the city and run the movie in the middle of the night, and in the rain it was right. They just forgot that people prefer seeing creatures rather than seeing shadows and raining the movie. To make the injury more insulting, the monkeys inadvertently filmed all fighting scenes incredibly close so nobody could see what was fighting or who it was. But again a rookie mistake. <br /> <br /> The rating. Fox ordered the monkey to do the movie with R-Rated. That was easy. Without showing how many injuries or deaths actually occurred, the monkeys made it a habit to show the carnage afterwards. It was easy: the audience got the move and the monkeys did not have to film the majority of the action footage that involved this violence. Some of the actors originally had questions about the script. Why does a blue liquid that the Predator likes infinitely, crumble infinitely and no more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around the movie in a police car? Why did the monkeys forget to show the aliens with a whole body? Why does a watch play a more memorable role than one of the main characters? The list of questions kept getting bigger, but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was excited about her work. So excited that they opened the film nationwide on Christmas day and even spent a few bucks to promote it in the week before the release. The monkeys had successfully made another rate in these esteemed franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask, what happened to the budget that the monkeys forgot to use? They said it to their next movie: Aliens Vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew that the public would be upset with the title, but they have since published this statement: <br /> <br /> "For the people - do not worry about our upcoming movie, it will be rated R and will have violence. "<br /> <br /> And everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
