I saw this movie on the big screen today, and honestly, I can not believe that some of the comments were made by people here. I really hoped to be touched by this movie, but it was not. <br /> <br /> I am a former Australian army and very patriotic about this great country, but I believe that this film does not do justice to us and us the soldiers who fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed badly. I found the acting terrible, they were not believable and they gave me no reason to look after them. People say this movie was graphic, there were some graphic scenes, but I found most of it very weak. The war scenes were very short and lasted only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a weak movie that does not do justice to these soldiers.
