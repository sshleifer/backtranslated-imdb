This is a frequently used line, but it really sums up the movie ... "If this is the current state of gay cinema, then we have real problems". I saw this movie at SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6) and if there was ever a case of voting on IMDb then it does. Just look at how the number drops in the release weeks of the movie. <br /> <br /> Simple Conspiracy ... Boy finds out that his ex-boyfriend (a friend) marries a friend of hers, so he goes back to his old hometown (which still carries a 10-year-old torch ) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all I liked "Latter Days", the director's last film, despite the cookie cutters and plotter aids. With each successive release you want to become a better director. I do not know how you get frightening fringe benefits from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he did it. The writing was of Lifetime Network quality (back when they were really bad) and the situations were incredible and uncomfortably hard to watch. I grabbed a non-existent remote to fast forward, but eventually I had to stay until the end and hope for a decent end. Eh, no. Even the gratuitous male nudity that emerged during the movie was so obvious that it seemed people were sitting on their seats. <br /> <br /> To be fair ... the 2 main scenes, especially in the bare nude scenes, were beautiful. There was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship when they found out how they went their separate ways. And the movie looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent movie. <br /> <br /> How can network TV give great, entertaining weekly episodes week after week (like "Ugly Betty," "Desp. Housewives," etc.), but so many feature releases in similar genres can do so badly his?
