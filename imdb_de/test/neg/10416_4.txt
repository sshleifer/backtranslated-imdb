This is definitely a well made piece of film, but it is completely devoid of any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> If you are already depressed, this movie will push you over the edge. <br /> <br /> If you feel a little depressed, this movie in your life will be just one more thing to make you feel bitter. You will feel that it is only your luck to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time. Otherwise, you can get through this movie unscathed (I did not make it.) By the way, knowing that your life is so much better than Jim's. On the other hand, you might consider that you have deceived yourself and are indeed in a much worse situation than you had previously thought. You may be a little annoyed with Jim for making you aware of it. You might want to beat him with a wet fish a bit. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is, as much as I wanted to like this movie ... I hated it. It took a long, miserable path down the path of oblivion and then, for no reason, he suddenly looked at himself and then stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim has no epiphany, at least none on the screen. Jim has a miserable life and miserable options. He does not discover anything to refer to, and makes no significant progress on his path of self-discovery. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one alive could attribute a happy ending to this film. As others have said, it's not a Hollywood story, it's dark and it's real. It is well done. Life is sometimes quite a struggle. If someone should know "the answer," it's good to scream from the rooftops. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I feel betrayed because this movie pretends to have something to say. You feel that it will say something, that if you suffer just a little, it has something to say. It will make you stop and think. <br /> <br /> It does not. <br /> <br /> Again, I realize that this is a well-made movie. And can therefore for a film student with a taste for z. Lighting techniques of using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it is absolutely incompetent.
