I just finished it after I was tired of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam. I wanted something that was mindless and I could just sit back and say, "What the hell did you think?" I was not disappointed with this company, but if I had seen this in a serious mood, I would have been angry. The company that did this thing put together CGI material from the first Octopus and added a small footage with a fake octopus that makes the material used in "Bride of the Monster" look like a masterpiece of special effects footage. Since when does an octopus have fangs? The plot is that a NYPD diver will investigate some murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the fourth of July. He and his partner (to be transferred soon or soon to be eaten by a fig-bark octopus) investigate this in a rather inappropriate manner (while believing that a large octopus will kill people) and occasionally accompanied by a female lakai the mayor's office. Of course, it is believed that an octopus can become so big until the thing attacks the policeman and the girl from the mayor's office. Surprisingly, hell does not break loose and only a few policemen and a few civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Do not bother with it.
