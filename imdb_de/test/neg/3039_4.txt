When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes with films like Poseidon just above the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) is supporting this updated version with many relatively unknown throws that either (do not show) the mortality rate or that established stars stay away from a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> With a relatively short 87 minutes, it mainly consists of two acts. The first, which lasts a full hour, is the setup. Our heroine Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) spent 800 minutes talking on her mobile phone (expect mathematics), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile phone and grounded her. To settle her debts, she works part-time as a babysitter, and she looks after the children of the wealthy Mandrakis. She is her first step. <br /> <br /> The Mandrakis' huge villa will, however, undergo a full tour treatment. All actions will take place. Many rooms (for a good hiding place), an aquarium the size of an indoor pool (for immersion in the wet T-shirt treatment) and a look at this environment - motion detector lights, which you know that they contribute to the fears with the Manipulation of light and shadow. Of course, there are many approaches to cattle herring that will shorten the duration of this act, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department. <br /> <br /> There is a small trend in which actors are the invisible, offering and instead acting through their voices. Recent experiments include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weavings V for Vendetta. This is where Lance Henriksen honors the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, who, however, barely falls. Why? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most phone calls were of the dumb (mind-blowing) nature that I thought was a waste - they could have been acting on something unknown instead, and the job is done anyway. <br /> <br /> The second act, where the main action takes place, is not too late. And the bogeyman is a pure bogeyman. Those who reckon with blood and blood will be disappointed because, basically, it's a one-woman show to keep your attention in the first hour (eye candy always works), and this action will do it all in duplicate, Rachel McAdams in red eye. Do not expect any form of character development or subplots to engage in. <br /> <br /> The end tried to be wise for itself and came as a cheap way to end the movie. There is not much good to mention in this film - no fear, no thrill, no enigmatic villain, and especially with this door alarm, there are many security holes. The only thing that's good for it is a 4D number.
