This movie was bad on many levels. The writing was horrible, so even the best actors could not watch this movie. It's a shame, because there were some good actors in this movie. I mean, if anyone has seen police academy films, you would know that Steve Guttenberg is good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference to the characters I've seen before. So that was a plus. I found Steve Guttenberg extremely hot in this movie. With or without a shirt you can not deny that he has a BIG body! Sexy face too. Loved the 5 o'clock shadow view, which made him look dangerous. For one part of the movie, he's lying in bed without his shirt, and I have to say that I wanted to jump in and tried to lose sight of his problems! Honestly, I would watch this movie again just to fantasize!
