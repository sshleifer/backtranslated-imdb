There is a time in the career of a great actor in which they become careless and accept projects that they would not have touched in their golden days with a 1000-foot pole. Do you remember "taxi drivers"? That was a nice movie. I can not believe that De Niro from "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I would rather watch Time Chasers twice than watch this movie again. If someone offers to visit you with "Showtime", or gives you free passports or whatever, you run away as fast and as far as possible.
