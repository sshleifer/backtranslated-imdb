Normally I would say that I loved this movie. Not for acting, although that was OK. Not for the script that was like that. The reason why I usually loved this film is for the intense action that starts from the beginning and does not end until the credits. But the problem with this movie, and I felt it was a big problem, was the terrible CGI. It looks like they have no more money and could not complete the effects. Shots Many of the effects are chalky, they are in their crudest form. Since it was obvious that they did not have enough money to finish the film, they should not have published it. I found the effects offensive. I do not mind making a decent end product for the consumer. If that were not, I would give this movie a much higher rating. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
