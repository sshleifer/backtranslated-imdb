[POSSIBLE SPOILER ALARMS] <br /> <br /> Seagal is unlikely to ever scale the amount of fatigue he has done with * On Deadly Ground * (especially because no one ever returns to him) Situation leaves), but he sure is tempted, right? <br /> <br /> This is a typical mindless and poorly written little fantasy about how Indian folk remedies are much more effective than Western medicine. Seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense, though he never explains why life expectancy in America and Europe is so much higher than in 1492. <br /> <br /> It seems he never explains how his supposed " Water powered engines will work in * On Deadly Ground *. <br /> <br /> Even the "action" in this movie is shitty.
