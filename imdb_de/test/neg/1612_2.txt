A malfunction in space deters astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) from the course and plunges into a parallel world called Terra, which orbits the sun exactly opposite the earth. Since a creature from space would pose a threat to the order of this world, Stryker is held until it can be determined what exactly is to do with him. Stryker, however, becomes suspicious of his surroundings and escapes. With the help of a sympathetic nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will try to board a spaceship and return to Earth. A regular weekly show was to be screened from these '70s television movies. In this case it is easy to see why it did not succeed. First of all, there is nothing new in building the show. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know, a stranger who is constantly on the way from one city to the next, taking on any odd jobs while being persecuted by a government agency or a newspaper reporter. It's a formula that has been killed. The second strike against Stranded in Space is Glenn Corbett. Could this guy be less sympathetic? I rooted him to get caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. After all, that's supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three false lunar moons on the horizon, I should conclude that this is a distant planet. So it's just a coincidence that they all speak English, dressing like the people on earth and driving Plymouth Furies? Yeah right. <br /> <br /> The only highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Sure, it's hard to see him in something terrible, but you know the old adage - every Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I've never heard it). <br /> <br /> As with many of these films produced in the '70s, I've seen Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I would not call it a great episode in any way, but there are some good jokes. In the end, as I rate the film at 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
