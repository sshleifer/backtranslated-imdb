Ok, I'm really excited about King's stuff, but that's just awful. Throughout the movie, I'm waiting for the main character to deepen his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst of movies because it's all better than watching a cut movie with ads in it. but that takes the cake. I gave it a 2 and I would never recommend it to anyone.
