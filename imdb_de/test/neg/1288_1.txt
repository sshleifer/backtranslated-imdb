My wife rented this movie and then practically never saw him. If I ever want to torture her, I'll let her watch this movie. I have seen many movies with my 4 year old and can take almost anything. Barney refreshes after a shot of Quigley. <br /> <br /> The plot, the dialogue, the cinematography and the acting were a step above (or equal to) a cheap porno movie. I feel betrayed of $ 3.69 we paid for the rent, and then I will never return for 90 minutes of my life. I'll say that my 4-year-old liked it, luckily it was a rental, which we had to return immediately. I just hope that the career of the younger actor is not ruined in this movie.
