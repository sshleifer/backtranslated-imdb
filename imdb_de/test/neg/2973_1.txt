Why is it that instant noodles are not instant? This was the startling problem I put in the lap of the one-legged angry Sherpa. Angrily he replied that noodles were not his bag, and I also answered, "What bag?" He looked confused. <br /> <br /> Some of you may be wondering why the sherpa has only one lower appendix. <br /> <br /> The Sherpa, whom we call Sherpa 5, for reasons of privacy reasons, injured his toe. "As!?!" I hear you ask, I'll keep going, as we learned from the review of Donkey Punch (2002) Irene about devious nudges and dirty winks, etc., trying in vain to teach all the angry Sherpas the little peculiarities of the controllers. Sherpa 5, known only for his violent tirades against democratic principles in the post-revolutionary years of today's United States of America, and his implications for his population's thought systems in the postmodern empire that now exists, through the invasions of countries smaller than it, was carried away in a flow of violence because he had no understanding of controllers. According to an eyewitness, he jumped around in Mardi Gras like an unyielding banjo string, passing a nail through the nail. After the battle that followed five lamas missed their left testicles, three Sherpas were found under a gooseberry Bush and Sherpa 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe. <br /> <br /> A sherpas lifestyle is as modest as a nun, with only rudimentary health facilities at 15,000 meters above sea level. When the first-aid shelter was opened, only one IOU was opened for spam cans, and a few crotchets were found. Sherpa 5 skipped agony like a darkness in a noose until Irene sprang out of a chicken coop like a cock, suggesting that he dip his illness into lama spit. Sherpa 5 agreed to the procedure to sedate him, produced a bottle of 100-year-old Glenfiditch, some say he was left by an angry Scot, who is considered the ancestor of the angry Sherpas. The toe was bathed under the influence until it clad with the slightly soiled diaphragm of Irene's and a little blue tack. Some of you may feel that this procedure would be of no use to the sherpa, and you would be perfectly justified in representing that view. Only four days later gangrene set him on and a week later the leg was removed with even tighter elastic bands
