What makes this movie so damn bad? Is it the lahle sub-par youthful humor? Could it be the terrible "trendy" junk music? Maybe the uninspired go nowhere? Or perhaps even the fact that Traci Lords performs her worst acting performance ever, and the injury offends the injury, keeps all her clothes down the length of that steaming sandwich. Regardless of why this movie is shitty, the fact remains that it really REALLY does. I never wished that I could see a movie with Dean Cameron, rather than what I've seen in my life, but "ski school" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty. <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes unleash their Tupperware breasts. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
