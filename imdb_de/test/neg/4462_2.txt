If you've seen this movie for the first time with Mary of the Fourth Form, it's possible that the haze of nostalgia will promote your charitable side. If not, it has no chance. The hip-peak of the young people is total nonsense, people may have occasionally needed a word that one hears here, but not large quantities sentence by sentence. It's not so much about Dracula AD 1972 as breaking it up. From the moment someone under the age of thirty opens their mouths, it's impossible to take the movie seriously. The idea of ​​throwing Dracula into modern times is a good idea and deserves a much stronger script than Don Houghton can offer. The Thames and Chelsea Male are not for puppet thugs, model locks and frightened extras, but you can not help but feel better writing would have been so different.
