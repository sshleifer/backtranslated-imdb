Wow, I've just witnessed one of the biggest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the premature death of the big student. This movie was terrible. Absolutely terrible A true tragedy in film history. Maybe I am a bit hard, but if you are not interested in the life of Stu Ungar, you should not come near. Those who have an interest in their lives will find that most of the parts have been trivialized and turned into great novelty scenes. I saw it because of Stu Ungar, but I almost wanted to end myself as he did when I saw this 4-star movie, but it was uncomfortably painful
