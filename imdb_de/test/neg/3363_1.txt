Jack Frost 2. The worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Why? 1) The premise is not just ridiculous 2) The damn thing does not even have legs to go on! 3) It escapes after being completely immersed in anti-freeze (first movie). 4) Get that ... It travels all the way through a sea of ​​SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to avenge the sheriff who first killed him Movie. 5) "Killer snowballs". I have to be drunk enough to see Ginger Dead Man. Jack Frost 2 has the distinction of being the dumbest "horror" movie of all time. Even surpassing the instability of its predecessor (if you can believe that!).
