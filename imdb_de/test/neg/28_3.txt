Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn dancer named Rusty who specializes in Cheesecake Chorus Revues. She manages to put herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her upcoming solo success (with romantic offerings all around) has beaten boss Gene Kelly. A terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy with memorable musical sketches (the two worst are irrelevant flashbacks for the 1890s, with Hayworth representing her own grandmother). Kelly always dances well, but acts with false sincerity. If he is serious, he is unbearable and the rest of the time he is flying with adrenaline. The script is an emphasis that does not even give players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden good lines. * 1/2 of ****
