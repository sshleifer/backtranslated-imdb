"The Snow Queen" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a girl, Gerda, who undertakes a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaptation attempts to capture the adventure game of history and the luridly complex images through elaborate sets and production design, but fails under a number of factors undercut through cumbersome scripting and directing. The two actors who play Gerda and Kai are friendly, but forgotten. Bridget Fonda as Snow Queen looks the role, but is otherwise wrong for the role. There are remarkable tensions in this three-hour miniseries. At least some of the stimulation problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add little to the original story, especially in the first hour when the main characters are introduced. <br /> <br /> That means "The Snow Queen" would be ideal for teenagers with a taste for fantasy and patience. It's a great eye-catcher without being scary, and acting takes place in a kind of pantomime over-the-top level that portrays the plot in very, very bold text. Make sure you also read the story of Andersen.
