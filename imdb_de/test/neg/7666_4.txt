The Concorde ... The '79 airport begins in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon McCalman) contacts the well-known television reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to hand over secret documents to his boss Kevin Harriosn (Robert Wagner), owner and president of Harrison Industries, who develop arms for the military, illegally sell these weapons in other countries, but Maggie sees Carl being murdered and she barely escapes with her life. Maggie will catch the Concorde the next morning via Paris to Moscow. He wants to whistle Harrison, who happens to be his friend, who would ruin him. To save himself, he reprograms his high-tech buzzard target rocket to intercept and destroy the Concorde during a test run that kills all the people aboard & destroys the documented evidence ... <br /> <br /> Renamed Airport '80 - The Concorde for their cinema and first home video releases because it was released here in 1980 instead of 1979 The last entry in the Airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich. The film is known to be bad and was apparently laughed at during press and test demonstrations, prompting Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing I want to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really stupid and downright stupid movie, but purely entertaining, I can imagine much worse movies watching for 108 minutes, I really can , I liked the absurd conspiracy of a wealthy industrialist who wanted to kill his reporter as a reporter before she could expose him as an illegal arms dealer, but this guy does not do anything unusual and decides to blow up Concorde with his own guided missile and then a fench. Fighter pilot trying to shoot him before he finally sabotages them, so there are really three mini-catastrophe movements in here, each time Superpilot Joe Patroni can save the day. You know that Joe Patroni, played by George Kennedy, appears in all four airport movies and goes from the mechanic in the first to the extravagant Concorde pilot. I also think he is a bit crazy because he has been working with four participants within nine years of major aviation disasters. I think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was that Patroni retired and the fall was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are just stupid. Patroni makes wheels, flies upside down and is a guided missile in a huge Concorde. Aside from crashing, it lands and shoots out of its window to destroy the rocket, keeping a calm head. This guy is good, very good. Then there's the character, there's a saxophone playing a black guy smoking weeds in the toilets, an old woman with bladder problems and a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. Although the passengers of Concorde were almost shot down with a rocket and then attacked by a jet fighter, they do not seem to be so disturbed and come back happy the next day. I do not know you, but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel and why do not the police or authorities question anyone? Why is the Concorde Captain Patroni allowed to go to sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... Airport '79 is certainly not boring and is full of unforgettable moments and I was entertained in a way, though it's far from a good movie and the modern crowd might not have the patience, hell, I liked it for what it was in a stupid way, but it's not a classic. <br /> <br /> Although Concorde is no longer flying, it's still a pretty cool plane, and there's plenty of material here at The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh to be built. This Concorde was also the same aircraft that crashed after a puncture after a fuel tank was broken and the spilled fuel caught fire on July 25, 2000. In Paris, he started sadly and killed 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. When this program aired on television in the US in 1982, nearly twenty minutes of new material was recorded, and most, if not all, were re-shot over two years after the original production was over. I know that the effects are being hit by most of them, but I do not think they are too bad. Considering that this was done in the late '70s, I think they are doing quite well. The camera moves during the effect shots, real-world footage from real aircraft is used instead of toy models that I think would have looked much worse. I could certainly see what manufacturers wanted to try with limited resources and limited technology. Strangely, they are pretty impressive, without ever looking so good, if you know what I mean. Probably the most action-packed of all airport movies, there are rockets, exploding planes, daring crash landings, assassinations, and a man named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer), who gives the head a woman in a hot tub. <br /> <br /> The IMDb says it had a budget of about $ 14,000,000, which is actually more than I thought, maybe these special effects are not that impressive. Filmed in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles & France. Acting is not great here, people do not look so worried that they're going to die. Goerge Kennedy gets bad one-liners, while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... Airport '79 is fun for bad movie lovers everywhere and to be honest, I'm more into watching this entertaining mess from a movie than being Oscar nominated for about two hours.
