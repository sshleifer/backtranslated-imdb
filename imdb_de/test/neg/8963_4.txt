**** MILD SPOILER _ BUT YOU CAN KNOW THE GROUP WHITE **** <br /> <br /> Woman is raped and decides to utter her anger over all humanity. Oh, did I mention that the victim of the rape was dumb? That's the problem with MS 45. Thana, the rape victim, decides that she will kill men. Is there a logical explanation for anything? Surely the whole movie would be better if we could give Thana a voice about why she rejects every man she encounters? There just is not enough development for this plot. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a movie from Ferrara, this is not a complete waste of time. It's MUCH BETTER THAN I TIPS TO YOUR GRAVE, and pseudo-intellectuals will have a field day pointing to the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis, while Thana makes a murder rage in the end. But the script is a little stupid and underdeveloped, hindering any serious comment the movie could have made
