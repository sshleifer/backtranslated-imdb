Okay, do not make a mistake - this is a pretty horrible movie, but I actually thought he had some scary scenes and overcame his pathetic budget over and over again. At least it is unintentionally humorous in places and has a certain touch of horror and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). <br /> <br /> For me, this baby falls into the category "so bad it's entertaining," and for that I would put a star on it. The effects are terrible, the spectacle is miserable and the whole thing looks like it was shot in one day. You also have to love this toy ship in the beginning! It brought with it childhood memories when it was seen many years ago on Late Night TV. While Alpha DVD printing looks faint and as if it were taken directly from an old television program or something, I really liked it in this case!
