I actually own this movie, the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers". This is really the only way to really watch a movie like this. If there were not Joel, Crow and Tom Servo, who were always joking, it would not be possible to get through this crap. They have a hero called Ator, who looks very much like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and just seems a little smarter, just without being stoned. He takes invisible men, the cavemen (the cavemen?), A giant snake (with a bunch of anal, restrained snakes pointing all the skulls pointing in the same direction), inventing a dragon that looks suspiciously like a modern aluminum He looks like some cheap tendrils wrapped around him, and then he fights with the evil John Saxon-looking guy. Then he rides his horse over the tire tracks where someone with four wheels was traveling. Yes, I got most of it from MST3K, which, as I said, is the only way to watch this turkey movie. If that were not, it would get zero stars.
