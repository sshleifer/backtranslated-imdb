UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE ! I hated grandma. First, she's way too big - of course it's Tom, whoever the brother is who plays her - and I hate what she does when she repaints her fake silver hair. For example, the fact that every single actor V.G. (very German), and also that they think that even if left alone, they should pretend that this guy (Tom) is their real "grandma" or something. I especially liked it - not - the moment when Charlotte leaves and goes to the nearest gas station to ask for help. She suddenly finds herself in the middle of a forest (where were they before, nobody dares to explain) and turns around, turning around like a ballerina, staring at the stars ... and ... ignoring the fact Grandma is behind her , ready to strike !!! But anyway the music was not so bad, the haircuts were okay and the end terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... wish I had the german version.
