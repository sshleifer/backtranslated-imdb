I found this DVD in the store and wondered why not support some Indy movie and watch a cool horror movie. Please save time and money and pass it on. The acting, the script, practically everything with this film is sub par. There is really no big story and there is no character development. I did not care what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened. Everyone's supposed to be college-age, but they all look like they're in their mid-thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who looks like she's 40 years old. In fact, the worst part of the movie is that every single scene is shown in a master shot. There is no editing, no cuts or close-ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
