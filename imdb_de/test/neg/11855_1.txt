The only reason a question mark is in brackets is NOT because I have not seen every movie released in 2001 yet. It's because this movie was first filmed in 2001 PARTLY. The rest was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur films Carnosaur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have to confess. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It's so borrowed from James Cameron's "Aliens" that it's not even funny. But I love it. I can not explain exactly why. It just works for me. I liked the sets, I liked the cinematography, I liked how they were lent by "aliens". It's all a bit ironic that Cameron was a cast of Corman at some point, with films like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980) For the first part, we say it has moments. For the third, I can say at the most, that I needed five years to find it as transferable. <br /> <br /> Now we have "Raptor" who will NOT continue this series. Instead, it lends ALL scenes from the Carnosaur trilogy and CREATES a movie. And somehow Roger Corman managed to persuade Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen. Well, I'm not saying that either Roberts or Bernsen are at any career level. But both were RESPECTABLE actors at a certain time. Not here. Sure, actors react to effects they do not even see during filming. Here, however, they are responding to mismatched footage of movies that are between five and eight years old. There is even a sheriff whose costume was modeled after a figure in "Carnosaur 1". Apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a bit excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said that they would use the old dinosaur models of "Carnosaur". Apparently Corman decided after this interview that he would not even do that. And it's not like he could not find an FX crew for it. The script was written clearly, taking into account that the story had to be created with existing footage. <br /> <br /> Do not compare this to Ed Wood. Ed did a better job. At least he used Bela's footage only once in a movie. There are ways to incorporate stock footage into a movie, and "Raptor" takes that banal technique to a new level. Even if you like "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species", stay away from "Raptor".
