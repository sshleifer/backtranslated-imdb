Ewww! A Disney sequel that is garbage! Who would have thought that? Actually pretty much judging by the comments here, and they are not wrong. I was actually looking forward to seeing this horrible movie based on my preference for the original. And that's the whole "cash-in" mentality of Disney. Shovel any old garbage on the back of a success, and people will try. Do not you think they are so cynical? Then ask yourself ... How many Disney movies have sequels? And then ... How many of these extensions result in a follow-up? A much smaller number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove is just another example. The plot is ridiculously simple and broad. Even more annoying was the growing number of "out of place" objects and scenes - an old home for example and, God forbade an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Even worse, the opposing Chippamunk leader of Kronk has a completely confusing English accent for no reason whatsoever. An accent that got on my nerves after a short while. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things. The animation is very nice and the vocal talent can communicate well with the dialogue they give - especially Warburton in the lead role. Otherwise, there is really nothing to recommend. Sure, little kids like it, but there's little to enjoy mom and dad as they slog through this tortuous mutilation of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you would use in avoiding a pack of raven-eating, man-eating lions.
