Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have patched up two different scripts before coming on this little excursion: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. It results in a shaky film. Christine Lahti plays a crass, cynical television reporter who befriends the aerobics teacher Mary Tyler Moore and soon dines with Moore and her family - just to discover Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret affair! Burns has a strange stop-and-start rhythm in his dialogue that is neither realistic nor effective (more and more annoying because nothing important has ever been said). The gauzy Moore, who looks terribly frail in his jersey, has a beaming smile, but does not convince as Danson's wife, and Danson sticks with a barren, ungrateful role (he's only there to be a Kad). The film tries to cover all the basics in a classic case of overreaching (the role of women in the workplace, the TV news business, the deceitful family man, the working wife and mother who wants more, a female need for female friendships, etc.)) but nothing comes out of these ideas, as Burns only half-heartedly examines the questions. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of punch lines, but has no purpose, and the heavy conspiracy is just dirty. * 1/2 of ****
