This is an excellent example of an unbelievably bad B-movie. There are worse movies than this (Titanic for example), but this definitely divides the bunch of steaming crap movies. <br /> <br /> OK, it was apparently filmed in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so lame. The captain looks like Steve Guttenberg and is even more lame than he! I did not think that was possible! In fact, he and the main girl of the movie are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER! It was not just that the show waaaaaaaaay was overly dramatic, in fact it was, of course, that the script was awful, resulting in a deadly double-seater in a terrible, totally unsurpassable drama. The Scarecrow, Let's talk about him. The whistling you hear every time you're around is dumb and obviously synchronized. Now I can not overcome his costume anymore - it's a guy who wears linen sacks and a stupid mask! I'm just baffled, maybe if you're 3 years old and have a brain damage, you're scared of him. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, actually the black token, used the line: "This could be a chance to make my red wings" when it comes to scoring points with a girl in her period. Wow, uh, that's the kind of dialogue you can look forward to. Oh, in the beginning, when the lightly dressed girl is walking through the corn, why did she leave? I'm pretty sure it should not be obvious, just one of the many obvious mistakes made in this 'movie'. Another is the bad synchronization of the music number (yup, that's right), everything on the beach and the one Dorkaziod gets the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and it's obviously so called that it's funny. Fortunately, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear through the guy's chest when he finishes singing. All in all, the Gore is pretty good, this is one of those movies when you betting on those people who are supposed to be killed by the killer. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a scene where the 2 boys bury one of their friends in the sand, then get up, take off the peni and urinate the guy in the sand. Who does that? Imagine, "Hey, get Joe in the sand, then get up and take out our genitals, as it's not a big deal, and pee on him." In fact, this brings out the homosexual eroticism in this movie, what the hell ? A good part of the beginning of this film is the jocks that stand in the underwear in the locker room and in the cornfield while they are dull. What the hell with it? Traditionally, in film and in real life, jocks do not get girls and nerds. This really does not make sense, as all nerds think of girls and sex and apparently all athletes think about sports and each other in their underwear, I do not understand that. <br /> <br /> Lets come to sex Someone who saw this movie with me put it this way: "I've never been so into heterosexual sex in my life" and it's true. If you like hot A-cup action or ugly breasts of old women, this movie is for you. I swear, they found a girl with the smallest breasts, and that's who they can do the nude scene? Then the ugly old nurse shows her funky ones a few times, and man, I just did not want to see that. <br /> <br /> Now I have to talk about the temporal continuity of this movie. that's what's really bizarre. It starts in the daytime, then they all go to the cornfield and within two minutes it is immediately dark at night when they start from there and say that they are going to the beach - it is immediately day again and apparently they are staying the beach again until the night and the next day until the day. So basically these events cover 4 days in the movie, without any of the characters needing sleep or anything, it's really weird. <br /> <br /> After the main murders have taken place, it flashes to "3 weeks later". and apparently nobody cares that their friends were brutally murdered! The surviving humans literally make a champion! And that was when I realized that the budget was not scripted, directed or acted, everything went to that crazy bottle of champagne. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now, if you do not want the ending spoiled for you, it's really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> OK, so the end is in a church, and the scarecrow puts his soul into the diabetic child's body, then he fights with the Steve Guttenberg-like guy, and he struggles with a B-movie Version of the power the Emperor had in Star Wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! Somehow, in the midst of battle, the soul of the scarecrow's body jumps into Guttenberg jr. Man, and then with the last will he has, he spits himself in the church on the cross! It is great! Some blood, but what's even better, the cross is obviously cardboard! You can see the ground movement from the ground! Wow, enjoy watching.
