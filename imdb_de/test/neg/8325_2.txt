This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that this was focused on women who engage socially - with jobs and lasting friendships - but are in situations in which they can not afford housing, but there was little focus or progress in it history. The direction and the editing could not keep my attention. There were, of course, differences in the stories of these women, but the message was essentially the same and could have been narrated when I focused on one of them. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end of the movie, but it was a pretty boring trip.
