So many people loved this movie, but there are some of us who found IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask to be terribly uncomfortable watching, and it gets boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps, and I'll try to explain what made my toenails so uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> First of all, to set the record - I like Neil Gaiman's books. Sometimes I find his knowing, sarcastic, witty humor a bit geeky, and I actually prefer his work when he's playing and leaving the jokes alone - but even with his occasional failures in crap-dad gags, I've found something of his creativity and imagination very special. Interestingly, one of Gaiman Coraline's strongest works is a gothic fairy tale for kids that has little jokes and a lot of excitement and horror. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) exaggerates the sparks and sometimes reads like Terry Pratchett the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns, but the band). Mirrormask inhabits a similar area as Coraline, and when I saw the impressive images in the trailer, I was a little bit excited that someone had managed to bring Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen movie, some sequences look stunning. However, the visual effects are occasionally destroyed by CGI animations that look like a media science student project. Backgrounds and landscapes are often incredible, but some character animations look awkward, amateurish and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the spider is beautifully animated, but the book-eating cat animal looks poorly rendered and very "computer-generated". Compared to the animation standard found in productions like "The Corpse Bride", Mirrormask is sometimes very amateurish. However, in the defense of Mirrormask, the budget for such a great vision was small, and a few cries of impact can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What can not be forgiven is the stolid, dizzying, creepy and overbearing dialogue. The actors are desperately fighting the dialogue - and there are so many of them that they are constantly being hampered and trip over. The conversation is made completely unnatural, the jokes drop over and over, and the loud speeches seem to be the only method of action in which the author performs the action. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which is always an element of "Phantom Menace" adds), the film is almost unsurpassable. In such an unreal environment, the actors have to work twice as hard to be believed, and in essence they are terribly failing. The girl starring leads a brave fight against the impossible dialogue between stage and school and occasionally shows real promises, but it's never enough. The terrible cod "Oirish" of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend excessive time on screen) gives the chance of this young actress rising above the material a chance. It seems to be Valentine's job to explain the plot to the younger audience and to add some light freedom. Personally, I would not want him near my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What else is in this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What's annoying (for us British anyway) is that we know Rob Brydon can act! We saw him holding the screen alone for half an hour (he made those 'Marion & Geoff' monologues), and he's fine in the first part of the movie's real world. But put him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and becomes the worst Am-Dram-Ham I've seen in years. A real shame. <br /> <br /> What else is going on? Answer ... the crazy slap-bassing, the sub-Courtney Pine-sound and the inaudible, too high mix-soundtrack that never silences. God, the music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant, and if that's not enough, she wanked Wanky Slap Bass. It makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but that could be a blessing. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with that? Answer .... The whistling pantomime artist. In modern society, there should be no room for pantomime, except for certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera lingers on the giggling, whistling, moss-juggling and yoghurt-awakening idiot. I understand why the locals from Edinburgh are a bit worried and frustrated when the festival time comes again. My last criticism is that the movie is pretty boring. Surrealism is often boring? it either requires the audience to slip into a dream-like, Zen-accepting state, or else the audience is constantly excited by bigger and bigger surprises. A story with a bit of tempo at which characters we could believe in and that are important to us would have given the film the emotional focus it unfortunately lacked while not letting the eyelids hang. <br /> <br /> I apologize to everyone who has found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. You've managed to dispel your disbelief, you have left the creaking CGI behind, ignored the crappy dialogue and the horrendous performances that came with it, and understood the great, inventive vision of the manufacturer. I wanted, but I could not see the real mistakes that pulled it down. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman gets it right the next time he gets the opportunity (or even wants to).
