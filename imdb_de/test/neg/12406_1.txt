The direction of Wong is perhaps the worst of all film history history I've ever seen. This movie makes my worst movie of the year 2000, Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Soloman looked like an Oscar winner. The shortcomings in this film can not be explained. The biggest one is the lack of depth. Each scene does not develop completely, as if the editing room does not know how to do its job properly. It's a shame that, with such an all-star cast of talent and a famed popular traditional story, this lack of vision can destroy Ang Lee, make up your sleeve to redeem this movie and do some justice. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0/10?
