"Once again, we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment - much of it with sometimes funny lyrics from the band - in a 90-minute package." For anyone old enough to remember, this is along the first "Bill and Ted" story WITHOUT history. If that does not say enough about how mindless this movie is, think of Jack Black, who sings for about 20 minutes and that's his selling point. If you really enjoy listening to Tenacious D because of their musical skills, then beat yourself out and buy the soundtrack. Do not waste your time with it. If your stoner is looking for a good, bad movie full of laughter, you still bark the wrong tree. Regardless of the potency of your buds, you will still want to be back in grandma boy's instead.
