This video contains audio to convey to someone in their sleep. The same goes for the video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife pretending to act roughly on minimum wage jobs? With a camera that rolls? And his little wife complaining? Give me a break. They are both rich. They sit in their fake $ 350 apartment per month and film this with their $ 1,000 video teams each. Anyway, I've respected Morgan, but now his "30-day experience" is nothing but an attempt to fool all the volunteers who are fooled. <br/> <br /> Come on, Morgan, you get filmed if you make $ 6.00 an hour, and you get paid by naive employers who do not like it big cameras film the whole thing? And we do not think they will not pay you under the table?
