iCarly is everything that is wrong with the world. All the main characters except Carly's brother and Freddy are morally bankrupt. Sam harms other people on a whim. She breaks a children's locker, and he's forced to pay $ 100 for the repair, and all she says is "Tough Gluck" and goes on to smash Freddy's cell phone. She has just done $ 300 damage and is more focused on getting something to eat. What the hell?. She only feels guilty when she made fun of Freddy in the show. And that's just why Carly got the crap out of her. <br /> <br/> Carly is the "I'm perfect, everything I do is nice." Kind of girl. Everything she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown only remorse for herself. What's worse, she encourages Sam's crap. Sam ruins Freddy's clothes? She laughs. Sam is ruining a child's touch? She shrugs. <br /> <br /> Do not even let me start with the humor. The laugh track is played at all times. <br /> <br /> Sam: He is not that hot. Carly: Yeah, he's Sam: Yeah, you're right. * Amazing amount of laughter * <br /> <br /> The Shows Humor is to demote others and say obscure words and occasionally ranting about unimportant things with similar sentences. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the 'super cool special techno effects' that they do in Windows Movie Maker.
