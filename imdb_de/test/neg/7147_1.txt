Throughout the movie, I've always thought about why this was made "documentary" around the world, but did not contain real material from those interviewed? Sure, it would have been just like any other documentary, but it would have been up to the filmmakers to find the meaning that the film can deliver. <br /> <br /> Using a number of well-known movie stars (Many of those who appear to have been asked to show "real" people made me feel that a pre-determined message had to be delivered, and the director was like that very careful that real actors could not be trusted, and well-rehearsed scenes were used (yes, I know, that was also a play, but a documentary should be a documentary). I was really scared off by the various stars and always expected that one of them drops the character for a moment and "I'm a good person because I'm in it." <br /> <br /> This film could have had a much stronger social commentary if it had been more objective or Matthew Shepard and his killers would be seen as humans rather than symbols. (The much superior "Boys Do not Cry" had a relentless view of those involved - good and bad.) Stattdesse n the Laramie project gives an almost merciless lecture that the sexuality of a person should be accepted independently, and little else.
