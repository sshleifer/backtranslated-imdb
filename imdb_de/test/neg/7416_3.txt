Hey everyone, I just wanted to give you some crazy facts about this movie. Actually, I was one of the make-up FX artists who help create the "beast" for this movie, and I have to tell you that the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got back the first set of photos, we all talked about how sad it was that this creature was in a movie that was likely to be quite poor. <br /> <br /> What actually happened Jason Palmer had done the original make-up for the Sasquatch, but for some reason, they had to go back and shoot most of the creature again. The sad part was that Jason had died a few weeks earlier, so the newly created creature was not nearly as great as the original creature. <br /> <br /> It was pretty sad for me because this was Jason's finale movie, and somehow he was cheated out of his last glory because of his bad re-shoot. Anyway, I thought you might find this a bit interesting, and if you want, you can go to mmmyeah.com and watch some "behind the scenes" photos. Later, Jeff
