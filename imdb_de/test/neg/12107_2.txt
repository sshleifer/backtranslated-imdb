One can only be amazed at this confusion of a movie and be happy about some of the raves people have given it. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to decide whether it's black comedy, farce, or a combination of both. It winds its way in search of direction through the area and offers some extremely embarrassing performances that are better suited for bad sitcoms. What a shame to see that the talented Dianne Wiest comic talents were gambled away, and the ever-annoying Jane Birkin is so exaggerated that she is more annoying than usual French "nature of the film" - hence it is considered "intelligent" or "genius". It is neither. Instead, it's a bad smell that leaves a rancid aftertaste. Merchant ivory should stick to the serious stuff, as they certainly have no understanding of comedy.
