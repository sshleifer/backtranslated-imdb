I have to admit, I love horror movies ... especially 80s Slasher movies. I love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But I did not think much of this movie. The death scenes were not very well done, the CGI was terrible and the acting was bumbling. Worst of all, the story made no sense at all. I would say save your money, but chances are, if you want to see this movie ... you will do it anyway. I did not hate it ... it just is not very good. All in all, it's just another dull, lifeless horror movie that lacks life (it's no surprise that this movie was on shelf for over a year after its completion).
