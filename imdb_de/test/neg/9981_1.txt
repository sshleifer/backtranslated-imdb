Who really wants to see this? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex for so long. I do not want it, but I have always stayed true to my philosophy of seeing every movie as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (right after "Next Friday"). <br /> <br /> It's basically just crap. How can you maybe call it something else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for Gore and T & A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, that's the way they were." Well, why bother us? I do not care if it was like this (and there are many scenes that I really doubt). The point is, why would anyone want to see it? The problem is, there is only one reason why you might like the movie, and that would be that you like violence. It's nothing special, just cruelty. You can say "cool"! as you would say in splatter-slasher-movie. But horror movies by force can at least cause you anxiety and tension, maybe characters that are important to you. But here everything is dark, boring and boring. Every character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who can not handle his power". What? In the very first scene he runs naked with his sister through the forest! I have no problem with saying that we saw a madman for 2 1/2 hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you get excited when you see Helen Mirren, you're pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie. Or castration, yes, that was fun! Real birth scenes, how funny! People, animals that are interested, we just treat them as toys. <br /> <br /> I do not care what anyone says, this is not a movie, that's only 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex that humiliate and disgusting. Watch a porn movie if you want sex, or watch a horror movie if you want violence. At the very least, these films do not pretend to be an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
