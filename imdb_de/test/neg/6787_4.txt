As a true Canadian I always avoid Canadian movies. From time to time, however, I am caught looking at you. This is better than most others, that is mediocre. It has many of the common weaknesses of Canadian films ... self-confident action ... an excess of cinematic gimmicks and, above all, the confident Canadian habit of using Canadian cities as a substitute for American ones. I mean, using the historic metropolis of Montreal as a location for Harrisburg Pennsylvania is little obscene. I was in a generous mood. I gave him a 4th. <br /> <br />
