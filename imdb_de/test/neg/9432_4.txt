A wonderful half-humorous homage to expressionist black-and-white films by people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character who is trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare. At first he thinks he's part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer, and slowly realizes that he may be a suspect. The writing is a little forced (this is after all Woody Allen, who tries to be a shy Kafka), but the point is made and no damage is done. The cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but make sure you see in a very dark room with a good screen, otherwise details will be swallowed up in the fog. This is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually screaming for "uh-huh". The spectacle is fine considering the strange vehicle, and it's worth watching if you're a big fan of Woody Allen. Also interesting for connoisseurs of expressionist films. I would rate this with 6.5 out of 10.
