Terrible, confusing little crap from the south of the border. I've looked at it twice now and still do not know what's going on. It had something to do with a stupid-looking Aztec mummy, a "human robot," the stupid robot I've ever seen, and a woman who is the reincarnation of an ancient Aztec chick. Most of the story is narrated by an incredibly boring scientist in a painful, slow, and booming manner. This guy is a wonderful sleep aid. His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, a pretty unimaginative name for a bad scientist. I think the boring scientist and his worm assistant have dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist WIFE just happened to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend. For some reason, they keep the mummy constantly in a mausoleum, so the overweening villain can steal it. It takes him five years to do that, because he invents a "human robot" to steal the mummy or attack it or whatever. He is looking for a treasure, which the mummy has, so that he can become rich. But excuse me, if the guy had such a great intellect and a strong appetite for success, why did not he just patent some of his ideas and get rich? <br /> <br /> Well, I think that would make too much sense. Instead, there's a ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell who looks faker or corny. To be honest, I looked at it because I thought of a movie called The Robot Vs. The Aztec Mummy has just fabulous cheesy. Instead, it was just terribly horrible and the head was confusing.
