This show drives me crazy. It contradicts everything a family should be, even if it is supposed to be a comedy. The show will follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good stage for a comedy yes, but it does not mean that it will be a good show. I do not think I have ever heard that parents have become coarser spoken by parents and vice versa. The only speech that appears on the show is the control of children by parents and gender. I know that sexual intercourse is usually an issue that is often addressed by teenagers, but it is educated in almost every episode for no reason. The one episode I just saw involved the parents giving a car to their daughter, Hilary. They do not think they are somehow related to each other because they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how Hilary "is like her slave." <br /> <br /> The show fails the most at the comedy level. I never laughed about this show more than once, and I'm someone who has given very good grades to movies like Animal House and Dumb and Dumber. Michael Rapaport is a very good actor. Why he chooses to ruin his career with this dirt show is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Parents, make sure your kids never and I mean, never see that. Teenager, you'll probably only get a laugh from it because of the gross sexual references, but nothing comes of it and afterwards you feel rather empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 stars.
