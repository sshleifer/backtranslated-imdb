(This review contains some obvious spoilers, so beware.) <br /> <br /> A friend bridged this, and we went through it 45 minutes before we decided that Fast Forward 8x Speed ​​was the only one Way is that this movie should be seen. There were points when we saw the film at normal speed, where I went, prepared a portion of lunch, and returned to find that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogues were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no important facial gestures were made, nothing but the uncomfortable, stubborn silence. <br /> <br /> This is NOT how to make a thoughtful movie, especially if the plot of the movie is all following the same Hollywood movie tropes If I told you that Disney made a movie about 4 girls, who form a band, and the singer is a French exchange student, what would you expect as "conflicts" that arise? <br /> <br /> The singer has to overcome stage fright? Someone has an unspoken swarm? The band is too late for their performance, and a secondary character has to buy them? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All these things happen in this movie. <Br /> <br /> In this movie you never have the slightest concern that these girls can not reach their destination. <br /> <br /> * THAT ENDS THE SECTION OF THE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know all the bands referenced in the record collections and MDs they are going through, and I sang along with friends on karaoke the title song. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie from Japan I've ever seen. Do not be confused. Although the characters in the film have typical points where they do typical Japanese high school stuff, this is not a "typical day in the life" of the movie. This is "a day in the life of 4 extremely random, fiercely competitive, awkward Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also noticeable problems with the DVD. Viz decided that a great extra would be a producer who reads the Wikipedia entry about the Blue Hearts. What a value! In addition, they care so little about the subtitles that the band name in the subtitles "Paran Maum" is different than in the chapter selection menu "Paran Marum". In the last auditorium scene, there is a VERY visible reflection / ghost effect on everything, but this seems to be the fault of the original movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DO NOT see if you do not necessarily love awkward silence.
