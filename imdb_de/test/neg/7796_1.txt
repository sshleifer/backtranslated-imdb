Think of the most unfussy motive you can, ten times worse. A woman has to do as many crossword puzzles as she can on one day. We do not even see the questions and think about the words ourselves, we just watch their fight. The woman seems so worried and in a hurry to do the crossword puzzles, but for some reason she spends her time running around the city when she can concentrate at home. The acting is awful, the actress snorts and blows as she tries to think the words, and we stay completely in the dark. The scenery in New York is beautiful, but the movie relies too much on it and it ages quickly. The film is like a rejected NYU student film. This movie has no redeeming qualities and I can never recommend it to anyone.
