Two side boys working on a wireless network go from trying to kill killers to black faces between work shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller play the lead role in this 1945 Whodunnit. Many talk quickly, everyone is shouting at everyone, and the two side boys call the policeman "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It's a real "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it feels like you're adjusting from a piece, as it usually takes place in the soundstage of a radio station. We do not really care about the characters, which is why they are almost never shown. No big deal. This was Phil Karlson's second film as a director. We do not get any clues as to who shoots people, so let's just follow the police officer and the boy boys who first try to solve the puzzle. I'm not saying more to give away spoilers.
