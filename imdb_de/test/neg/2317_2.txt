This little minion is notable just because it's the worst movie Abbott and Costello ever made. It's terrible in every way: sullen music, terrible choreography (look at the awkward main dancer), cheesy special effects and sets, wood actors (the leads are barely high schoolers and later unknown) and a script without a single laugh , For the comedy duo were better times. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is very much to be preferred, as is the television series, which was at times inspired. But skip this.
