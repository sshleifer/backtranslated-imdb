The first 20 minutes were a bit fun because I do not think I saw such a bad movie before (drama, screenplay, effects (!) Etc.). The rest of the term seemed to dwindle forever. Any clich√© in dialogue had no effect. These people did not really seem to like horror movies or how to do them or any other movie. There is no language for adults, a bit of brief nudity and no bleeding except molten blood, no open wounds, etc. It would have been classified as a PG in the early 1980's and PG-13 nowadays. I'm not sure how it got an R rating or if it really was. I saw the publication of American International entitled Hospital of Terror. I've watched 100 horror movies in the last 12 months. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here is an example of how bad it is: There is a scene where something green is coming through the door. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be, but what's on the canvas is some kid's green crayon doodles put over the film Sister Sherri, to own her, I suppose. I could not believe that they had the pride to show this embarrassment.
