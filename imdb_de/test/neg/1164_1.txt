This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I believe that I have seen many bad movies. I love shit, but that was just awful. There was not a single scene in this movie that scared me. All actors must have been found at a bus stop 20 minutes before the shoot. I wish Blockbutser had given me back my 99 cents. The acting was terrible. The writing was unbelievably bad. Someone had to show this movie before the release and had to know that it was awful. I would be embarrassed to associate my name with this monstrosity. Do not rent this movie If you do, do not give it back so that no other poor souls will make the mistake of renting it.
