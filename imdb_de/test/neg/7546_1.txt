Wow, this movie was awful. It's that simple. It's actually the first time I've walked out of the house early, as far as I can remember. However, this turned out to be okay: I had a very nice conversation with two charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up the crap they called a "movie". <br /> <br /> Where should I start? , Bad show, bad jokes. Stuhlkot that I just can not stand. I'm sorry, but snot, piss and caviar are * not * funny. You saw the cover picture? This scene actually takes off for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and maiming each other, which is supposed to be humorous by itself. It is not. Apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, I do not remember much about it. At least not much good. I was really disappointed in this garbage. Or let's be honest here: Given the fact that I'm actually a big fan of "British" (ie black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So you want my advice? Three words: do not pay attention.
