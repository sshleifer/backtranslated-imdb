This is probably the most unwavering movie I have ever seen. I saw it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson did, in my opinion, was just awful, with the exception of the wasabi script) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to how bad this movie is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly decent actors (admittedly just starting), can not see this movie or the moments he's on the screen. It's all very cinematic: black and white, no dialogue, people do things for no apparent reason, people hunt each other while being tracked by a rickety camera. And predictably, none of it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's not "French Mad Max," as some people have claimed (actually, they mean "Mad Max 2") - that's a cursory comparison based solely on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic attitude and is exactly the kind of commentary you would expect from someone who does not know what he's talking about. Mad Max 2 was vibrant, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is not one of them. <br /> <br /> I know it's cool to like Arty Black-and-. white French movies and just as cool to say that you've seen something in it that others have not seen (or you've done without feeling sleepy) so I would not trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat because I see nothing valuable in it; it demands so much and gives nothing back. After about five minutes, I strayed and never did anything to regain my full attention. Who can assert himself undisturbed, is not human or not at all psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to be "cool").
