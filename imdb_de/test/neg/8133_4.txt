Julien Hernandez is certainly an attractive and likeable person on the silver screen. In fact, his character wears the whole movie or what pays off. The problem is, with the exception of his girlfriend (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / friend for some of the characters) nobody comes close. Hernandez is a director of the Cuban heritage of 30 and unknown sexuality who comes to L.A. and gets a job for a gay documentary. When he meets a group of gay people while he finds topics, he comes out ... but that's all. Even after 88 minutes, the film was obviously stretched out and padded with various devices of the film school, most of which only pointlessly interrupt the narrative at the end (which is not much at first) or the entire amateurishness of showing the filmmaking. <br /> <br /> What a pity, because somewhere here there is a love story and the last three minutes when Hernandez 'Sebastien finally shares with a wealthy West Hollywood party pitcher (nicely underlined by Lonnie Henderson) and they clicks few sexy soulful kisses, it works in spite of everything that came before. But the other characters or their situation do not really interest us: why would handsome Dante have a Eurotrash priss for a friend? He would not And do not even let me start with Sebastien's friend Paulie's "rules" for dating - no gay man I know, the hell no sensible person, point, would impose such restrictions on himself or others. And please tell me how Sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is usually pretty mushy, right?), Gets his butt stuck and has to go to a doctor to remove her? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won a prize for this movie as a "short film" - he probably should have stayed that way. All in all, I'm looking forward to seeing Hernandez again in a better scripted comedy with a secure direction.
