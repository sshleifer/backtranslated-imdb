Do not waste your time. The plot is drawn, the characters are made of wood and uninteresting, the motives of their actions are completely incomprehensible. Waiting for the "romance" or "comedy" to occur and nothing has happened. Worse, the love letter is not even romantic, but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to set a deadline. Did I mention that the "conspiracy of action" that we saw in the movie from 15 minutes ago was "Hollywood clever," which means that it should shock, but given the Hollywood mentality - nothing like that does, and instead, vague is offensive. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth the $ 2 to rent. Do not bother to see it.
