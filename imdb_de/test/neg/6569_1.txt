Leonard Nimoy was the director of Star Trek III, which was not bad. Maybe William Shatner seemed to be what Nimoy did what he could. After seeing this movie, he should have reversed this decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The last limit is the worst in the series. The acting of everyone involved, including Shatner and Nimoy, is bad and washed out, making them look as old as they look in real life. The special effects are sticky, as if Spock Kirk has to save from a downhill crash in a jetpack. <br /> <br /> The attempts of humor were pathetic and the story is so terrible that she does not need to think about it, which means that a Vulcan steals the Enterprise to find God (seriously), which I simply do not took care of any movie and oh, not to mention that Uhura is doing a belly dance to distract male guards. She looked like she was attending a grandma contest. If she wanted her to look sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How it came to the production or was even written ... well, there's no reason to think about it. The only good place for this movie is the garbage. The worst of the series.
