Yesterday I was watching TV Guide and saw a movie with Heather Grahm, whom I liked in movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers. It started okay, but you could say the story was missing, and about half of it had gotten worse. I can not remember that this movie was in theaters, and I'm sure he did not stay there for long. The acting was outdated and unconvincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I like movies like the one compared to Fight Club, but it does not come close !! Heather Grahm has done much better things ever since. I gave him a 2 out of 10, but that's because I clicked on the wrong number, I wanted to give a 1.
