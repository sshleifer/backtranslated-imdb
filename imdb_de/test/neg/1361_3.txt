This film states through its protagonist that the world is essentially grief and pain, and those who ignore it have blinders. It is arguable that this is true or not. But even if you accept that as true, the film either denies A) by saying that it can do something good in tragic situations, or B) forgets it and uses a clich√© montage to make the audience feel refreshed. <br /> <br /> That the film metaphorically affirms its protagonist by portraying it as a sympathetic figure despite all the evidence of this compassion shows contempt for the supportive characters who were most convincing in the film a script that is inconsistent in theme and direction and does not reconcile the end with the rest of the movie. All members of the cast, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson, offer outstanding performances. It's a shame that they were not supported by a better writer / director.
