The other reviewers with the lowest rating have summarized this wastewater so it seems perfect to add little. I must emphasize that when visiting my children, only Cockney Filth, who insists on seeing the Sunday bus, was imposed on me. My God, it is depressing! Like all soaps it consists of completely unlikely characters that are uncomfortable to each other, but it is ten times as bad as the next worst. The reviewer, who mocked the bilge spewed by his defenders, was just right. If someone lived in such a social environment, they would cut their wrists within days. And I can assure anyone who is not familiar with the real East End that it's more "ethnically enriched" than you'll ever see here. Take my advice - avoid this low point in the British television industry. It is evil
