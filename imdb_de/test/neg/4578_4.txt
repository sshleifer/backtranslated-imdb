This movie defines the word "confused". All actors remain true to the script. More is a pity, because the drama is alright, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psychoanalytic coincidences. The tempo is surprisingly slow, and the camera with the soft focus lenses gets on the nerves quickly. I give 4 out of 10 points.
