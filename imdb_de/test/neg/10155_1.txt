Oh boy, that was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this on videotape. <br /> <br /> In scenes with soundtrack music, it was difficult to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It turned out that at least two different types of movies or video footage were used, as the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were many blurry shots that did not happen intentionally. <br /> <br /> One indicator of the budget (one of many) was that a news program was broadcast on television. There is only one "News Flash" title card that is badly displayed on a TV screen with a video effect, and a voice-over from a newsreader. You could not record footage from a newscaster and then show it on TV? <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a murderer wearing surgical scrubs and masks and a scalpel. Presumably, it is a paranoid schizophrenic who flees the hospital to avoid a lobotomy. The students are released from school for a break, and three young women opt for a slumber party. Three boys decide to crash the party, and a geek named Science decides to crash them as well. The pajama party is pretty boring and the boys just indiscriminately show up, wear masks, take off the masks and then disappear. Even the mother and father (the surgeon who was supposed to perform the lobotomy) of one of the girls keep popping up. The killer hits people in the neck without anyone really noticing. The apparent projection of the film runs more or less through the film. Maybe it was the bad drama or it was intended because much of the movie is a nightmare and part a nightmare within a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The end is really awful too. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the cheesy United Home Video VHS box, which was revived for the DVD release (a double feature featuring Terror at Tenkiller). I honestly can not say whether it is a photo, a painting or a combination of both. The women on the cover are not in the movie, and the clothes they wear are far more enlightening than anything the women have worn in the movie. Cutting the throat on the cover is scarier than the one in the movie - where people tend to influence a silly pop-eyed look. In this case, the killer has most of the time most of the time: tilted his head, and his eyes roared, the camera attacked. Often, the scalpel was focused near the camera, while the masked face of the killer was in close-up, blurred in the background.
