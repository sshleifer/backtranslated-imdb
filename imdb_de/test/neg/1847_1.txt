This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection that hits Earth with an EM interference is justified, but where did they come up with the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155 ° F? The acting was so horrible that I felt that the casting agents just grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. To be honest, I played less wood from my ironing board. Sorry, but this movie was poor, poor, poor.
