First of all, I want to make it clear that I have to voluntarily undergo horrible films. I saw what I thought was the worst. In my eyes, movies could not be worse than those of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The pirate movie is without exaggeration the BAD FILM IN THE WORLD. I was informed before I saw that the movie was indeed terrible, but I did not believe the allegations. Believe me, when I tell you that this movie is just an abomination to film. <br /> <br /> It begins with a 3-minute clip of a pirate's boat, apparently in the midst of a battle with itself. "The End" splashes across the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the actual end of the movie. The film is about an unpopular, awkward, nerdy girl named Mabel, carrying a ghetto blaster and being drawn to ambiguous homosexual pirate boys. She drowns and has an overly prolonged hallucination in which she plays as a lightly dressed prostitute who falls in love with Frederic, who has just crawled out of the sea. He could actually be gay. The pirate king has a ruby ​​and diamond studded codpiece. It honks and squeals when he presses it. <br /> <br /> This movie is sung. You may have the impression that this is a hilarious musical. It is not trust me. These are the worst songs you've ever heard, and at the end of the first original, you're looking for objects to pierce your eardrums. <br /> <br /> There are "references" to other movies in here. With references, of course, I mean "obvious rip-off". The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau, and the lightsaber were indeed anti-funny. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is painful to hear in its better moments. The direction is awful, and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene, which is not very well hidden at all. <br /> <br /> In summary one can say, if only the curiosity is there. Leave the movie in thoughts, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you appreciate your mental abilities, I ask you NEVER to watch this movie.
