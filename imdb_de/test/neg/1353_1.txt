First, I should say that I have seen the 39er version at least 100 times; I know all the dialogues and have read the 36 piece, which is different from the 39 and contains its own gold nuggets. This version is as shallow as a lifetime movie about adultery. There's a reason you have not seen an expensive advertising campaign for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the jarring tone of the original and how the women spent the entire time going to war each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intention. It was a smooth, theatrical approach to gossip, adultery and biting between a number of wealthy Manhattan celebrities. The crowd that created this new version did not intend to honor the original source material. They attack us strangely, putting here half a scene and half a scene from the first version. Bette Midler (who plays in a few scenes and portrays the old Countess part in a broad, grinning style) has no context in this version. She mentions "Buck," a key element of the original - and is never mentioned again. This movie is so boring that I will not over-analyze it, but here are a few things that I thought were incredible:> Mary Haines boasts with her housekeeping staff, "I can suck my nails off a board," right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could have read a line and got an Oscar nom, right? > A compassionate Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted and the movie somehow withered away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine playing through the game. Immortalized by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off small, ridiculous, irresistible dialogues that are still classic and quotable. She was not biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The filmmakers of 2008 decided that this character must die. They killed the movie.
