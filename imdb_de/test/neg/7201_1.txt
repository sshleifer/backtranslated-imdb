If it were possible, I would have given this excuse for a movie a ZERO star. It was by far the worst I've ever seen. It was as if it were a home movie that some bored high school kids wanted to joke about. The "acting" was terrible. The "actors" did not even react to the fact that they were murdered. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I bought this movie by mistake. The Spanish title was Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought, hmm, maybe it's okay. Not correct. It was the worst, frankly. After 20 minutes of this stupid movie I did not come. I went through the chapters, and nothing interesting happened. <br /> <br /> The cameramen were terrible too. It was like a home theater. I would NEVER recommend to anyone to see this. Terrible terrible moronic movie.
