I am sure that I am a minority (I know that I am among my friends), but I found this movie to be long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role DENIS LEARY played is the most likable character (the only time I ever liked him in "A Bug's Life!") Speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was unimaginable and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotyped. To say that he was two-dimensional may be something generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two wonderful scenes (both with the museum caper and NOT with Rene Russo), this movie made me want to were at home watching golf on TV.
