This asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. Soulless, technically good and the usual jokes for adults. Maybe it's because this is the first cartoon I saw after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is fictional and forgotten, but Asterix and Obelix go into the Viking area to rescue a spoiled teenager who then learns humility and also finds love. Oh, and at first they do not get on, but after they have encountered adversity, they all share a deep friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The best thing is to pay attention to the little jokes. The Vikings get the best. Like Vikea (the wife of the Viking chief), who gives a list of furniture and skulls to be brought by the next raid. Or the Vikings, who do not know the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf, the dumbest Viking, is actually funny (as is the voice that plays the dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example on board the Viking ship: (After a speech by Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this New? Captain: This is my daughter, cod! Olaf: Your ... daughter ... a man?
