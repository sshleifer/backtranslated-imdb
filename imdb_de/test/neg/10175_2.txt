This movie is nothing but Christian propaganda. It started like a good science fiction movie and then adds a syrupy, sweet Christian theme to the story that is completely independent. I had to turn it off halfway because I felt like renting it. The Catholic Church has officially announced that extraterrestrials DO NOT contradict the belief in God. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is a bit entertaining, but the dialogue is incredible, writing and acting are mostly garbage and, all in all, this film is mostly a stinker to avoid. <br /> <br /> Obviously some research was done by the filmmakers on the phenomenon, but then one quickly realizes that it is only for the purpose of exposing and introducing their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject. If you're an avid religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you'll love this movie.
