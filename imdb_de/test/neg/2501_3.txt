As a serious horror fan, I get the impression that certain marketing tricks are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. I would not call it naive that I assumed that this is softcore horror that breaks down cannibal / zombie / jungle holocaust. Unfortunately I was totally wrong, because this is very hardcore. I should have realized that the warning when I saw the strange warning that no actual or identifiable minors were used. Notice the identifiable part as if he dares to catch him? A group of scientists, half of whom are pretty women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain who prefers the beach, in search of a mutated aboriginal who kills the villagers. Due to an atomic bomb that was detonated on a supposedly evacuated island, the radiation made this last man a rapist / killer. George Eastman, the writer / actor, is the only one here trying to put on his clothes. The sex scenes are flogged. Women walk around naked and radiate a strange arrogance. A woman even asks for rape if her husband refuses her. Well, two chicks beating each other, of course, turn into a lesbian scene because women are dogs. I saw the chick throwing another chick salad and fingering himself. <br /> <br /> If you know something about this movie, that's it. Because the rest of this crazy movie is exactly the same. Oh, who am I kidding? There is a lot more to tell here. Like the white "Duchess" who pays for two black boys to meet her in a salon. Or the "Duchess" takes off her top to use it as a bandage when the captain cuts herself. When he refuses, she begins to cry. Since he is the good gentleman, he does not like to please him in front of the other crewmembers. I honestly waited for the pizza delivery guy to show up and asked the "Duchess" if there was another way to pay him. <br /> <br /> And all that happens before they go to the island to carry out their research. Wait, I thought that was a zombie strip? But the zombie does not enter until after 73 minutes, but by then all the others have "come in" copiously. I found myself fast-forwarding some scenes. This is my first splatter porn and I do not think this subgenre is subject to justice. I think it's the woman in me who talks when I say that I want more conspiracy and less sweaty, lanky, hairy sex. The funny part is that this could have worked as a decent horror movie, because the idea that nuclear bombs mutate a bitter man and kill his family was a good idea. Even the character of Eastman shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating. I wonder if the character or the writer himself was disgusted. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go into sound or movie quality because you should have thought it was bad. This production was filmed in a row with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which show most of the same cast. Eastman said this had been done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck. Nevertheless, I suddenly want to talk about the sound. The sound was strange during the sex scenes as the cast speaks Italian, but it seems they are recording English voice overs and playing over their dialogue. So while two people are boned, I can clearly hear someone in the background saying, "No, yes, wonderful! Wait!" There was a somewhat amusing Italian score that could not save this movie. The SFX were minimal at best and consisted of only a few scenes of some blood. And I'd like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes, as the bright warning sign on the DVD cover said (er, another marketing ploy), so do not be afraid. Just afraid of the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in the widescreen aspect ratio 1.85: 1. I've seen the 113-minute Version 1 Not Rated version of Exploitation Digital released. There's obviously a XXX version of Alfa Digital that has the same runtime, so I doubt it's all different. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or as I would recommend paying nothing and pretending that it does not exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: Shipmate: "Civilians are bad luck, women are bad luck, they're scientists too, they really have to be monsters." DVD Extras: An original trailer with hardcore shots and kills to make it more interesting looks like he is a trailer for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle & ENOTLD and a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: lame porn, but even weaker than a horror movie. Either get real porn or see real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
