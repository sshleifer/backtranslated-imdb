I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> It's a visually rich movie, but with slow direction, poor plotline, and two-dimensional characterization. <br/> <br But I knew it when I went inside. I was willing to trust the two gentlemen I went with (knowledgeable comic freaks) that the pictures were unusual and so they were. Unfortunately, the inexperience of the direction meant that scene after scene left little dramatic tensions or conflicts behind. However, this is a comment that could be made by many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and directed. The tempo of the story is lost as the camera lovingly lingers on the pretty pictures. <br /> <br /> Without the certainty that the style of the film would be worth seeing, I would not have left. I tried Neil Gaiman's work, but I always have the feeling of the "Emperor's New Clothes". I live in hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can further analyze Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all his mistakes are eloquently described. However, I can not understand how he imagined that he had an understanding of the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl, and that what he had to say added nothing to the sum of human knowledge when one grew up and the responsibility of an adult took over the changed relationship a girl could have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and they are treated inappropriately, stereotypically and without imagination. All the beautiful pictures of the world can not make up for a core erroneous work.
