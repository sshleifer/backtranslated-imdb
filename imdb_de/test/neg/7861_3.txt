In the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in the form of a ridiculously bad "Yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after only two episodes. Captain Harlock was suffering from a confusing and meaningless "Harlock Saga" while Galaxy Express 999 had suffered from a movie hack. <br /> <br /> If you have seen "Queen Millennia", you will remember that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a continuation of this already completed chapter and also to find a way to suck it. <br /> <br /> This film takes in all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie and mixes it badly with melodrama, and in order to offend an injury, throw in some of the most famous characters in Matsumoto's universe. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork, but the rest is so amazingly bad that it can not save this movie from total loss. <br /> <br /> If you like Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie. You will thank me.
