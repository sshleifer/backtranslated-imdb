The lavish production values ​​that you normally find in a Merchant / Ivory movie are all here, but this is a very boring idea of ​​a possibly very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense that the story unfolds through the eyes of an African-American family, and that their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has little role in the proceedings. There is not much clarity in bringing the motivations of these historical personalities closer to the audience. And the accents of some characters really bothered me. Nancy Marchand sounded very British, assuming it was a French nun. Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to be trying different accents in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as the daughter of Thomas Jefferson, Martha, is written in such a way that we will never get a handle on who she really is. In a moment she slaps a slave and in another moment she laments the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte plays the role well enough, but never gets us really interested in Jefferson or his achievements. All in all, very disappointing.
