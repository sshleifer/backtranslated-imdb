How unhappy, but happy, that two films about pot-holing - The Cave and The Descent - should arrive at the same time. Unfortunately, on July 7, The Descent crashed in the UK with the release of the Metro / Metro terrorist attack in London, which killed nearly 60 people and injured hundreds. This is not a particularly good night / weekend, especially to go to the movies to see a scary movie about likable women trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic subterranean cave system. The two films have virtually the same elements - about half a dozen characters lost in a previously unexplored cave system, without anybody outside realizing that they are trapped there. Lots of water, caves, dangers ... then, eventually, some vicious human-like or human-born creatures determined to plunder it. Where the two are so different is that The Cave is unreal, absolutely unbelievable, more alien-squeezing sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama. The comparatively tiny budget British movie (filmed in the South of England, though played in the Appalachians) is five-door-ripping, a heart-stopping shocker that's so twisted that people are shocked early. It kills the girls in some old order - you really have no idea what to expect next - certainly not them! The Descent is also lit in a naturalistic way, which makes it all the more scary, in contrast to the ridiculously lit cave, reminiscent of a huge magical Christmas grotto, with one cathedral-sized room after another blinded in blinding blue light ... who knows where, while the Cavers' torches are used exclusively to artistically illuminate the granite pine heroes (each more doll-like than any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation). It also carries fantastic gear, but the unbelievably deep-voiced actors clearly forgot to pack the feeling of imminent danger, drama, or something worthy of a horror movie - it's strictly PG rated. In that case, the actors get stuck in exactly the order everyone expects them - I quickly wrote a list after familiarizing them with each character just to put Piper Perabo out of line. The cave script is complete with numbers, unlike Shakespeare, a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in less than a week ... Take a typical exchange between the "good friends" white and black leads that are going; "How many times have we been in this situation before budding?" - "too many" (replies Morris Chesnut). I swear, you could hear my suburban London audience gasping for obviousness. The scariest thing about The Cave is that in the end there's a clear opening for "the sequel" - "The Cave 2: Overground" or whatever. Fear, be very scared ... Or get The Descent instead and be really scared, very very very scared. RR
