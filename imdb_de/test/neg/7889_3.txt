As a light entertainment, this movie is actually successful as such in the first half, but then succumbs to a quickly decaying script that drops it. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, are hired as living mannequins in a department store, where they are delayed one evening and locked up. from her less than protective glass observation point, an apparent murder on the street. The alleged killer Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the next day to watch the mannequins, recognizing that they are the only possible witnesses of the violent event of the previous night and when one of the posing couples " jerks ". The fun begins. Daphne and Harry report their observations to a local police station, but when the detective, who creates a crime report, remembers Harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. There are many ways a movie can be moved, and it manages to use most of them, including a compulsory slow motion bedroom scene with passion. A low-budget affair that was filmed in Vancouver reveals itself to police procedural aspects. The ever-capable Gershon is trying to make something of his role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarre, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein. Although the film sinks into nonsense, the cinematographer Glen MacPherson prefers not to imitate, because with the camera and the lighting, he creates some magnificently realized compositions that a viewer can focus on while ignoring the action holes and the dialogue. A well-prepared score, according to the plot, is provided by Hal Beckett. The mentioned dialogue is initially fresh and is delivered in a joking manner by Nelson and Gershon, but in a later context of erroneous continuity and logic, predictability takes over. The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or perspectives, and mistakes in post production put the work back further than would be expected for a basic thriller.
