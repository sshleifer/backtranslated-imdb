Sure, it's hard to be gay, especially in the South. We understand it. Over and over again. <br /> <br /> What stood out was that the filmmakers focused almost exclusively on the "more extreme" characters in these gay little town bars; the drag queens, the run-down pub of a long-closed bar, and a man who was brutally murdered for being gay, had nothing to do with any of the bars at the center of the movie /> There were interview clippings from other people with whom the audience may be better able to identify. But they were exaggerated, practically skipped and perhaps presented in the background. <br /> <br /> It would have been more interesting for me, at least, to hear the experiences of the more gay men and women who were enriched either by the experiences of a gay bar in a small town and / or by the lack of that community.
