Well, I did not expect anything good for this horror of a movie. I find Steve Carell annoying and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there is absolutely no reason for a sequel. Somehow this movie was even below my expectations, even if I had none. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty has demolished it in far too many ways for the film to be defensible. Actually, Evan Almighty had exactly the same story as Noah, except for a few technical details, it was nothing more than a copy of a far superior movie that was actually FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Has it become another case that Wanda Sykes was fed up with stupid, unappetizing, superfluous one liners that were literal in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and has pulled down the film more and more. <br /> <br /> Although I had actually seen the movie ten years ago (Noah), Evan Almighty must be the most predictable movie I've ever seen. I found the entire movie from the beginning to the end within the first five minutes, and finally realized that he was tearing Noah left and right. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty, and Jonah Hill is already tired of playing the same role in every movie he's in, Bruce Almighty likes it and I do not want to see a predictable, dry, funny movie in which Steve Carell tries to behave like Jim Carrey. Then please do not see this garbage.
