If you enjoy watching movies with plots and compelling actors, Alien V's Predator Requiem is probably not the way to go. In summary: alien lands in a typical American city, Predator in an American city, both have a bit of a quarrel, the US government is busting the city, some people escaping ... I'm sorry, I think I might have ruined that end , It's easy to criticize someone who is critical. People scream, I bet you could not do it better! I bet I could! Filmed this movie, seen and then filmed to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a good job; there must have been the specter of madness in the room.
