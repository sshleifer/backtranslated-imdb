This movie was weird, mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a devilish wind that makes the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable on impact, but this did not seem to have anything to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely bad rip-off of Bladerunner, ie rogue Android being chased by bounty hunters (or a ruthless policeman). Luke Skywalker shows a surprisingly good performance as the aforementioned rogue policeman. Nothing seems to be solved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything about the Android or its intentions. There is a confusing scene in which Bill Paxton (who has kidnapped the Android) plays a particular song in his paper airplane for no good reason (the song is called "Shape of Things" by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene in which the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have relevance to the movie? Do not think so
