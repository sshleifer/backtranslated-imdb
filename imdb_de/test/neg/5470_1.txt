Low budget on bloodthirsty cultists in Greece under the direction of Peter Cushing. It's up to Father Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International published this crap in 1978, and it was "Dog of the Week" in one of the episodes of sneak previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forgot who of the two is "dogged", but I understand the point. Crappy Movie has the worst Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance performances I've ever seen. There is a monster on the video box. There is no such animal in the movie. Instead, you get a statue that is at least atonomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> The cultists look like the Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group could exist. Skip it.
