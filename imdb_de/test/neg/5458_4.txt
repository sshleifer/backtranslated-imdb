I'm shocked that all "hased it" ratings are six and seven, still above average. For me, this seems a case of "The Emperor has no clothes". I understand that this movie was produced on a very small budget in the early 1970s ... Still, it was difficult to spin and watch. The DVD I saw had some subtitles, but about 75% of the language is not subtitles. Some of these are difficult to understand. The Jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you struggle to "make out" after a while. Some shots were nice and the realism was there, although some of the performances were not great (Jimmy Cliff did a good job). The plot is not bad, but quite predictable. In the 1:43 film are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan), who sings for a scene, and a few shootings and a fight. Probably about 15 minutes. The rest is pretty boring. By the way, at the beginning of the film, there are some strange cuts with the Ivan character, which seem like a processing error, which made me laugh a little. One critic said that this movie was cut so many times that there are only a few copies of the original 1972 version. The ending was somehow interesting and showed how the media of a young age affect people, it could also be a general comment on the influence of white / colonialism in Jamaica. Other main topics are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... Finally, the soundtrack is definitely worth it, the movie much less.
