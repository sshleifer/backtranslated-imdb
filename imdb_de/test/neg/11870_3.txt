I'm from Romania ... and I apologize if my English is not so good. I've always liked the films of Wesley Snipes, but this one is terrible. I'm sorry I spent over 3 hours downloading this movie. There are many mistakes in the movie. For example, the stadium in the movie is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the football team is Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium's scoreboard can not display graphic images: video, live images, etc. It's a simple scoreboard that can display only letters and numbers. The opponents of the Uli (Seaua) teams are shown on the scoreboard as Din (probably by Dinamo Bucuresti - the main rival of Steaua in the Romanian football championship). The images of the football match come from a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - check the internet and you'll see why). The police cars in the movie are not done right. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The "bug list" can go on and on ... but I'll stop here! In short, this movie is awful. It's not worth renting, it's not worth buying a movie ticket, it's not worth downloading it! I'm really sorry that Wesley-Snipes played in this movie. A previous film by him ... 7 seconds ... was also shot in Romania ... was fine, but that's terrible!
