I just finished The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles of the year so far) and it felt like a chore. As I watched Keira Knightly's disgusting, skeletal-looking character, I became more and more frightened throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to see that this was so boring. The only good thing was Cillian Murphy. He is always good / believable and is severely underwritten in many films. However, that was just not good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unusual characters and the boring plot, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt like I was spending my time watching for nothing (which I did). I should have done the smart thing and turned it off, but I kept it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography.
