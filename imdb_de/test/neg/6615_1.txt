It's obvious that ESPN is drooling whenever Knight is on the news. But did they have to make a crazy movie about him? This was the worst attempt in a serious dramatic movie I've ever seen. It had everything: horrible drama, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc., etc. It looked as if it had been shot on a budget of $ 10. Cummon, what's up with the game scenes? Were you in a middle school gym? And the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a break. Denehey looked like ... Denehy in a red sweater, that's all. ESPN has lost much credibility with this flop attempt. They spent millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premiere was a big disappointment. Bob Knight is not an issue that can be treated in a 2-hour movie. ESPN messed it up. Even Knight himself thought it was stupider than anything else.
