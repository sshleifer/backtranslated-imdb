This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's face it, Zoey is perfect. She is pretty, she gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she is popular, she visits an amazing school with amazing rooms. Reasons why I gave this show a 3: 1. The spectacle is terrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses (especially Victoria Justice) on TV. 2. The characters are incredible and do not match. You have a typical beloved girl. A smart, flat, stupid, stereotypical girl portrayed by a terrible actress. Then you have a typical jock type that is a bit normal and really nice. Then the stereotypical smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends. Then a rich, handsome boy who would look happier in the mirror all day. Then the actress wants to be played by another stinking actress. And finally a normal nerd man. 3. The plot is boring and lame. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. Can not you just be normal? 5. Everything ends perfectly for them and we all are reminded how much our life stinks.
