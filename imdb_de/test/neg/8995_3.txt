For the most part, Naach is a dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali) who sees herself as a kind of author who goes beyond the small commercial compromises that people make in her life Include environment, including her actor (Abhishek Bachchan). Nice idea, only it turns out that she has the unbelievably bad concepts about costumes and dance moves, stuff that is so spoiled that even the forces behind these ultra-cheap South Indian potboilers are in serious embarrassment. The story follows a gazelike, predictable Pattern ... Dancer and boyfriend meet and have an affair (yes, sex included) ... Success gets hit, but she spurns his attempts to help her ... Kindness raises attitude and they meet ... Dancer meet a most unlikely director who wants her to "do whatever she wants" ... inappropriate effort, inappropriate popularity ... Bea's attempts to reach Gout are dismissed to a climax when he bursts over it, how he can not live without her ... um. <br /> <br /> Actually, I did not expect this movie to be very good. Why did I see it? Because I have a fetish from Antara Mali. She is an actress with enough talent to reach great heights, provided she has the opportunity. Unfortunately, her role in the film looks much better on paper than in actual performance, ironic of a film that should have an uncompromising character. To honor her, she puts a playful effort to good effect in the few scenes in which she is actually asked as an actress. I just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws some good punches, the last scene was saved by a simmering turn that reminds you of his father. <br /> <br /> Only to be recommended if you are looking for the return of giant dog donuts put a few grains of good moments are heard by the main actors.
