Joe D'Amato could have made some other notable films in his long and prolific career, of course, by taking turns making VERY cheap Z-grade films in Italy's big exploitation boom of the late 70s of the early 1970s, but there is no porno holocaust or at least not. Granted, I should not expect much from a movie with such a title, but I thought, given the description on the back of the box, there could be some funny horror scenes with the "horny, mutant, cannibal zombie". It turns out that the zombie only appears after more than half of the movie, and at each corner we get an unremarkable sex scene that's as hardcore as you can imagine. Which is good. But it's not very pleasing, except in the way, "what the hell is this BS". There is a ridiculous dialogue in which lobsters cost more for mail order in Japan than for Paris. Hot, slender women play biologists and zoologists who have special sexual problems (when you unlock the door for a rape and a bipolar indulgence.) It all goes to the island, where the "main attraction" is a guy who has an early age Spending absolutely miserable (forgotten ridiculous) time staring at each other The newcomers to the island's radioactive wastelands shot down in the Caribbean have a face like one of the guards in Jabba's palace and a sweet potato for a major genital. Much more stupid than anything else, however, is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned woman who has too much time to escape, but she sits there with blank faces as the monster brings gifts and what it does must be a racially motivated exploitation action by the filmmakers who only rapes the monster and kills white women, not them. And of course it ends with a "happy" ending. Of course, I use quotes, in a kind of shock, that this could have a legitimate end. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is NOT what you might expect, as it may be a bloody horror movie with many sticky but cool-looking Italian monster zombies engulfing human flesh. When something that is violence in the film is made on a shoelace; A bruised cut in the face is immediately tailored to the bloody consequences, which resembles the after effects of a tomato beating someone. The last part of the title is meant for the market. But even as a pornographic film, it has little to do, except as a reason for the cast and the crew to get a paid vacation to the Caribbean (as an interview with George Eastman suggests, this was just one of a few quickies that happened during the Films were made island). It has penny-bought flamboyant camerawork and similar actors that are filled with genitals three-quarters of the time and with pitiful lip-syncs and music like Nino Rota, who was forced in front of a gun to make something snappy in a bordello, and that's STILL a piece of celluloid dung anyway; All of this could be an immense guilty pleasure, but it is not.
