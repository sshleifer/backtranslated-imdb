While not a terrible film, it is still a waste of time and is an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist image of the history of Beach Boys. Basically you would think in this movie that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters evolved beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a television movie. So what do you expect? Mike Love's irresistible stench is omnipresent in this turkey as he tries to make history with himself in the role of the band character and genius of the inhabitants. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the music is excellent. In contrast to the previously produced for the TV bio images "Summer Dreams" by Beach Boys, this film contains more true Beach Boys music than anemic cover versions. It also contains a surprising number of rare Beach Boys-related rarities -here tracks - The Sunrays "I Live for the Sun" is just one example. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally shown in two parts on American TV. Part one is the supervisor of the two and documents the beginnings of the boys and the rise to the top. By the time the second part was around, the Brian Wilson character became a mere cartoon and the actor seemed to be playing laughs - but how can anyone take that crap seriously? If you're not a Beach Boys fan, you probably will not get much out of this movie except for an extremely distorted and one-sided look at the band's history. But why would you look at it if you were not a fan?
