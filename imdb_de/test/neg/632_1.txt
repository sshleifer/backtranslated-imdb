I did my best to see this two-hour fiasco. It combined the awesome special effects and action of the original "Blob" with a stunning boost of the (in the original outstanding) screenplay of "Runaway Train". The only explanation for this film is that someone had to accept a substantial tax deduction and thought he would combine it with a shot for casting a casting couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips wants to show us why he does any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typography crawler, a Texas Senator from Texas, and plays well. Next, he was to star in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this film seem to have all received their roles as consolation prizes in the screaming contest Fay Wray Memorial. Special effects are unbelievably bad. H. S. Children in film lessons in North Dakota could have done a better job. The authors must have pulled a raid on the clich√© bank to collect so many. I could not watch without sitting on the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except obviously 119 minutes late. Pooh! Oppressors.
