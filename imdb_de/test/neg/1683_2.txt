I was really happy that this show ended. The characters of this show were extremely irritating. None of them had a singing, redeeming quality. Damon Wayans is probably the sturdiest. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She is just as annoying as she was in Martin. <br /> <br /> The kids are all very annoying. The eldest is an idiot, the eldest girl is a stuck brat, and the youngest is frustrating listening to it. <br /> <br /> I think I liked the smart little boy. But that's it. <br /> <br /> It did the world a favor by ending it. <br /> <br /> Let's pray that a Wayan never plays in another show ... EVER.
