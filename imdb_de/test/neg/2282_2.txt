I was extremely disappointed with this. Having just read the wonderful Oscar Wilde story, I had hoped that at least some magic would be transferred to the screen. Well, there was none. This version ran like a twisted Reader's Digest movie. Not only did it feel hurry, it was cheaper and unnecessarily rewritten. Main characters and plot points have either been changed or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulty of putting a novel on screen, especially in terms of a possibly limited (television) budget, but there is no excuse for changing a great story that way. I highly recommend you to read Wild's story about the depravity that exists even among the most beautiful outsides. But I can not advise anyone to rent this travesty.
