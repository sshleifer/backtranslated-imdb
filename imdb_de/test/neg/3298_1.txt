What fascination does Fox have for dysfunctional families made up of mean, vile, spoiled children and parents who are determined to be cool, unlike their parents? I'm sorry, I do not understand it. The one episode I barely saw was one of the kids demanding a bar Mitzvah, with the intention of receiving thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course, the idiotic mother decides that her precious little junior must have the biggest and most obsessed party of all, and has no problem throwing 20 giants at the big event. The filthy, brain-dead, young crazy teenage daughter bounces between Jewish and Catholic desires when she sees the "cute" religious tutors. <br /> <br /> The only borderline experience "heartwarming" in The whole episode was when the trim of a father who was convinced all along that Bar Mitzvah is just a money-making program, the son who took his Hebrew lessons learns, and is temporarily deceived, that perhaps his offspring will be sincere about the right of transition into humanity. This warm, fuzzy feeling is immediately torn from his chest when he tells the junior that a certain "procedure" has to be carried out, since he did not yet have Bris. The bar Mitzvah is canceled, and the mother has several thousand dollars out when the boy refuses to do so. <br /> <br /> This show is garbage and I'm sad that I will not get the 23 minutes back. I wasted my life looking at this piece of crap because nothing else was on TV ...
