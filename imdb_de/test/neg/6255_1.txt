This movie was just bad. I can forgive low budget movies for low budget movies, but it was not funny, it was not smart, it had no redeeming qualities at all, unless you really like fake boobs. I do not know how to classify this genre, possibly erotic horror, but if so, it's neither sexy nor scary. The inclusion in the slumber party massacre films was useless; I had never seen the previous films myself, and apart from a scene trying to tie them together, I could not tell who the escaped psycho killer was in 'Cheerleader' or why they included him, especially because (and I do not think so It was really obvious that the cheerleading killer in this movie was not him, as for the actual murderer, I can only say, lame, really lame, when you figure out why the killer is the cheerleading Crew (and the team's coach and two stoners who were just on the bus trip, and the bus driver just for fun), will you sit there and go-- WTF? Worst apology for a murder frenzy ever.? The "actors" (two Guessing why I added the quotes) generally looked like cheap pornography they were most likely to do, those poor people who tried to get into a "legitimate" fi To dive. One of my friends had said the following about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like the guy who really gets involved, and his face turns red and so on." We had a good role here. Half of the other actors had all the skills and subtlety of actors in the sixth grade of "Annie" I've just seen. The other half seemed pretty bored to death (especially in the deleted scene, this one redhead ...), and after ten minutes I was in that movie as well. <br /> <br /> One note: The DVD contains a deleted scene that would have put the film from R-Rated to NC-17 if left over. It was completely free and as entertainment for adults without any quality. The only reason to deal with it is a lot to laugh about.
