I'm sorry, you know why. I feel like I can watch this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to see this movie, but still did not give the satisfaction of looking at it in its entirety (I only left about 20 minutes ... hoping that it would at least be me for a moment well.) most movies now, even those bad ones ... if I look at them, maybe there's a small part of the movie that I sometimes enjoy, maybe because of a quirky joke or a good line ... On the other hand, all the time I felt uncomfortable and angry with myself, especially as I was wasting money on it. It was badly written, badly directed, badly filmed and definitely badly traded ... Please, for the good of humanity, you do not see this movie, even if you're a guy who wants to say it as every movie has ever seen ... just not ...
