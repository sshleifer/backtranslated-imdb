This is a very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would be unbearable! And the low budget shows big time! Some of the battles were good, but the story is ridiculous and there are no threatening villains at all. The dialogue was ridiculous. I had trouble finishing this movie, but Chuck Norris made it a bit bearable. I really have nothing more to say because I was only half watching because it is so incredibly boring, but it has increased a bit towards the end. The direction is terrible. Don Hulette does a terrible job here, with lousy photographs, a terrible tempo, and overall the movie looked boring! There is no wound. The spectacle was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he steps in that ass and made the movie almost bearable (Chuck rules!). George Murdock is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor is decent and had good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein is decent as Chuck's brother. All in all, it's VERY easy to AVOID! * From 5 (Chuck saves it before the BOMB rating).
