More frightening than any horror movie ever made, because of being controlled by this blood festival, which makes it more frightening than watching other people on the big screen or on your TV screen. This game has two CDs that make the game much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Each CD contains a different character with a completely different story that makes the game much more fun. I recommend you to buy this game and also the first game (not as good as this game, but still fun) <br /> <br /> **** <br /> <br />
