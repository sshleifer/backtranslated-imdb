For my better judgment, I saw this movie today, and I wish I had not. Dreadful. The first AvP movie looks compared to a classic, it's so bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a storyteller. In fact, I would expect an alien and / or predator movie to be made by Uwe Boll! This movie really offended me, and Lord only knows what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to look at that piece of crap. I can not understand how every fan of one of these franchises could like this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. I mean, the first AvP was pooping, but it was at least a semi-interesting story and attitude and occasionally a real tension. It was not overly serious and it could at least be enjoyed halfway. But this one gave me the feeling that people would believe that they were going to do the next horror masterpiece. One after the other was an invented "exciting" scene in a dark room or hallway where scary music was played. She was essentially beaten over the head and said, "Get scared now." As James Cameron once said, you can not say that you have to be afraid, you can only amplify your own senses. The guys who made this movie obviously did not pay attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared instead of letting yourself get to that level. It's a clich√© for internet nerds to say, "God, I was so bored with this movie and I wanted to go," well, that's how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this movie absolutely seriously, eliminating any enjoyment. Even the gag that governments do not lie to their people was played without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters are concerned, I knew that the human characters would be completely pointless movie, but seriously, when they appear on the screen, they must at least do something relevant to the story. I do not mind this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend, I'm not interested in the mother who "does not even know her own daughter, Boo-Hoo!" Give me a break!) or the laid-off criminal who's just trying to earn a decent living, and give his brother an example of what a guy is. Damn, even the obligatory hot-chick-in-slip moment was more than usual. I feel like they expected the audience to be so shocked in the end. It also showed that children burst out of burst bursters, expectant mothers were raped, and so that would make up for it. I do not believe that. <br /> <br /> Then we go over to the stars of the film and again very little, about which one can write home. Were the aliens well designed? I have no idea because you can never see the damn things. All you see is a mouth, a head, a tail, or a really dodgy contour climbing the wall, barely enough to really handle that it's actually an alien, before Mr. "I cut music videos from Marilyn Manson and NIN, think I'm doing the same thing here "The editor does it with the Slice tool. Also note how hack-action directors always set their films at night and in the rain. Hmmmm. The Predator would have fought everything we knew against giant sea monkeys! Yes, the Predator was this time more impressive and I thought some of the new weapons would be cool, but that's about it. Since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a few things that I liked somehow. One of them was the use of sound effects and music from the original movies (I also chuckled a bit at "Get to the chopper!"), Although other references were stupid (the name of the main character is Dallas, give me a break). I also liked the visual effects for the Predator vision and what the hybrid alien looked like (certainly that of Resurrection). But really, those are the only positive things. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie unsightly, pointless, offensive, and most of all offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. That they left the door open for another door makes me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had decency, they would remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this movie. They did not do anything to earn it.
