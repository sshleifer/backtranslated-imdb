I love comedy and I love independent movies, but that was far too slow and the humor was extremely regional. I think it would have been better if the main characters were sympathetic, but they were just typical Gen-X slacker types, just like the people who have been making trouble in high school for forty years ... young indie filmmaker, if it deserves, but this is an extremely average movie.
