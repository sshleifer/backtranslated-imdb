Compared to other Star Treks, even Enterprise, I did not like watching DS9, but I did not like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I've just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea of ​​the creator of Babylon 5, but they did not choose to sue for a reason I do not know or care about, but seeing a Star Trek series is another, even nerdere show Too much to bare, now I will condemn anyone who even mentions the DS9 when he talks about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in this order. Before, I did not understand why everyone thinks the DS9 is great and I do not, but I know it. It's also because the captain has a real trouble with trouble and I hate people who are cool but freaky and move out of no other area. and he shines to every episode.
