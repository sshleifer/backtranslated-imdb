Overall, that's a pretty bad movie. However, for $ 5 at PathMark, this was not a total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario has to do with a man who is infected with snakes in this lady, allegedly from a magical curse. The actors / actresses are not big names (though some look like TV shows), so I do not do my usual "Troy McClure" thing. <br /> <br /> For a while, the movie is of interest to you as the couple hops a train and heads to LA to see a shaman picking up the curse. There are also a few other actions; Like two women who smuggle drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes are a total disappointment. As violent and bloody as the entire movie may be, the grand finale is simply totally computer-animated. <br /> <br /> I saw the unrated version, which had tons of language, blood, violence, everything! The bonus features were fine. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: D-
