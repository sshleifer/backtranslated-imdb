Like many people in my general age, I remember that I saw this movie as a kid in 1998 and came out of the theater in tears. It seemed to be one of the most important, impressive cinematic experiences of our generation at the time. Armegeddeon was captivating, action-packed, witty, heart-wrenching, and truly inspiring, and had everything to offer, including the catchy Aerosmith theme song and the juicy sucker of the end. Sweet Jebus What did we smoke? I saw it yesterday in one of the movie channels for the first time in years, and ... I can not even describe it. This is really one of the worst movies ever made. Where should I start? Aside from the abundance of LAUGHING scientific errors ("Personnel tracker" in astronauts, yes, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I would say the worst was the remarkable - I even dare to find an incomparable way in which there is grumpy writing grumpy action combined. There are too many examples to be listed here at all, but one thing that comes to mind especially is the scene in which Bruce Willis tells the Feds exactly where to go to find each of his charming-mischievous members -Bohr Team ("Check All Bars in New Orleans", "The Craps Tables in Vegas", "The Only Black on a Motorcycle in Sturgis") ... all to "Come Together" ... that reminded me little bit of the "NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!" - Scene of Anchorman (except serious). Ben Affleck proves once again that he is by far the most overpaid actor in Hollywood and has less talent, reach and talent than anyone else in the industry. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or anyone else was in that god-fearing piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> (I have to say, though, that I got a kick when I saw Owen Wilson's predecessor being killed halfway ... is this the only movie in which his character dies?) <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect for the STEREOTYPIC UNSHAVEN Russian COSMONAUT you've ever had. (Then Peter Stormare also seems to have a knack for playing exaggerated Eurotypes.) It was really quite amusing, as almost immediately after the Americans docked at the Russian space station (which is actually called in the movie). Ben Affleck manages to explode the entire joint in spectacular Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that in the end Paris is the only place on earth that gets destroyed, and that it does not seem to interest anyone at all. In addition, at points it will literally become simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin AND Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be an American. <br /> <br /> There are many other things to talk about, but I will not ... suffice to say that this is a really, really, really horrible movie that I am ashamed to have ever really liked. <br /> <br /> I give him two stars, just for the mocking factor.
