I'm always interested in seeing neglected films that seem to have good credentials, but in that case, neglecting the movie seems justified. Obviously, the film is based on some actual incidents during the Second World War. For some reason the film does not connect with the viewer, from which he is not very clear to me. One likely reason is that in the paper I've seen on TCM, none of the scenes in which the Germans spoke with each other received titles. This interesting concept of direction - to let non-German viewers guess only from the "context", what Germans say to each other, is an absolute flop in my book and helps to exclude the viewer. The way the movie starts - just to get us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputation of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" is not questioned by this movie.
