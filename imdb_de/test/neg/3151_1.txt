Barney and Friends is probably the worst kids show I've ever seen. It does not teach children, the songs are stupid, it's not educational and the characters are just excited. I'm not one who disagrees with those who hate the show. Honestly, I have seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are very mature people. This show contains no educational value or age-appropriate teaching material. Other reasons I dislike this show are the crappy plots, cheesy dialogues, terrible special effects and the abysmal storylines. It also states that you should eat junk food when you are sad and that strangers are your friends. To say that this is a "model of what pre-school television should be," as the Yale researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer, is a lot of crap. They do not know what they are talking about. I would never recommend Barney. The reason why some children are constantly crying or becoming addicted is because of this show, which poisoned the minds of children everywhere. For people (parents / children) who are looking for real pre-school material, switch to Nick Jr. and see "Super Why!" instead. It is far better than this crap and Five TV once had the nerve to put it on "milkshake", but gratefully dismissed it. I recommend everyone to get away from this show as far as possible. Parents, I urge you to keep your children as far away from the show as possible. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM: Do not waste time wasting your precious time on this stupid show. It's a lot of garbage. -10000000000000/10. Note: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
