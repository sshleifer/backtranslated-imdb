I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the trailer looked so cool. However, the fact is that this movie is boring and totally messed up. There is no plot, and half of the movie consists of lightning fast footage of football matches. In recordings enlarged, there is no overview of the games. I was constantly watching the timer to see when the movie was over! The sound!! The soundtrack is great! ............. Do not expect anything from this movie.
