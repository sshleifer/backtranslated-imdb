This movie was nothing but exploitative gay cheesecake. It was not an "art film"; Just an excuse to showcase several free, exploitative over-the-top scenes with extended male genital nudity. There was a locker room scene involving more than a dozen naked men. The camera zooms on the asses and penises of the men while they are shown for a few minutes with their cocks in full screen view. There are several scenes in this movie that show penis for penis. It quickly becomes REAL and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I was wondering if I accidentally watched a playgirl video. If these scenes were filmed with women (eg completely naked and her vagina repeatedly shown), this would quickly be dismissed as softcore porn and as an excuse to show a lot of eye candy. Every artistic merit was purged from the ghost mentality of the gay ghetto. The issues of class differentiation, homosexuality, longing etc. were simple and superficial. not developed further than one would expect from a philosophy student in the first year. Just go hunting and rent a gay porn instead.
