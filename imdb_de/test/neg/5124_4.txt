This film was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell records. No, it really was not. The idea behind this is that if you make a movie full of pop songs, you could put the tracks on an LP, sell them, and earn even more money for the studio. You can also release a few tracks as singles and edit the promo video with clips from the movie so that MTV tracking a track will actually show free commercials for the movie. This is a good deal, but an artistic catastrophe, because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the eighties, and I rate the mid-eighties as the artistically worst time for American movie production a 90-minute pop Video instead of making a film <br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet, and the logic disappears with this career choice. Welding is a pretty sophisticated craft, it's nothing to go for in five minutes. There are other logical gaps, such as ballet dancing and "flash dancing," which are somehow similar. If you apply as a ballet dancer and perform a hot, dirty flash dance, the male judges may want to meet you after the audition, but you will not get the job. It's almost as if you would say that script writing, novel writing and play writing are the same if they are not <br /> <br /> But I think Jerry did not mind when he asked director Adrian Lyne to shoot the movie. Actually, Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie, Jennifer Beals looks very sweet and innocent. Fortunately, I've found out why her face is brightly lit in close-up while its silhouette is dimly lit, long shots, except when the camera is zooming in on her celestial body. That's because mostly a body double is used and the body double is often a man! I'll bet there are some naughty guys who feel guilty about being disgusted to know that
