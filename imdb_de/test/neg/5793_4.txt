If you thought that Herbie had tried to kill himself from a bridge in 'The Love Bug', it would be stupid 'wait' until you see him playing cool in this confusing second episode. Dean Jones is back as a rider who rides at the Paris-Monte Carlo Rally. This time, his sensitive VW falls in love with another car in the race, a Lancia driven by Julie Sommars. At this point in the series, the energy and charm are even more lacking than in 'Herbie Rides Again'; The film is too long and worn, though it is recalled thanks to the return of Jones' typically sympathetic performance, a few humorous passages and the frantic occupation of the cast.
