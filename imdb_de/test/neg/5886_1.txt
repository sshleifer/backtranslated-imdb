The baby boom was bad enough, basically it's worse to make a series out of every nightmare of every man. Yes, I have seen that some felt better and better after a bad day. It reminded me that it could be worse. Guy was rich in success, single (smart man) and dating celebrities from singers to actresses. Then his cousin breaks off a cousin who misses his biggest mistake. In reality, it would have been easy to promote care. I'm sure this was definitely a fancy series. Oh, and what's the madness about the baby? Most of the time it is probably a doll, except at this age it is nothing more than a prop than a year.
