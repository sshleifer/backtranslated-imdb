Saw this used DVD cheap and got her for a giggle. I also recently found "The Octagon" on DVD and bought it to remember after seeing it as a kid in the theater and loving it back then. The problem with going back to these American Karate movies is that I have since seen so many Hong Kong and Thai action films where the fight scenes are long, fast and breathtaking. I think of bouts like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever" or Tony Jaa's spiral staircase "The Protector". The Hollywood kung fu offerings are simply not "properly filmed" and sometimes even make someone with certified skills like Chuck look awkward. And what's worse than a fight in slow motion? Then you know that it looked crappy at normal speed, so they slowed it down to make an impact. It really makes clear how ridiculous an opponent looks when he is standing and waiting to be kicked in the chest. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck, he just has no intensity in this movie and does not project a righteous threat. Contrast that with his former co-star Bruce Lee, who had to burn charm and attitude. If Bruce could compete with some opponents, you could almost see the air crackling around him, which was about to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker," Chuck accidentally kicked people with complete nonchalance. When the judge comes to jail him and sentenced him to death, Chuck looks sad and I thought, "OK ... he's doing this with the third eye and will pull the judge's throat and out of here" but he does nothing but look with a look of the eyes. Awful. The DVD case gives you hope, with a running time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, but in fact it is 1 hour and 25 minutes. So there is still 20 minutes of visual pain. <br /> <br /> For great combat, look at Jackie Chan in the first "Police Story" ... the fight at the mall is pure gold ......
