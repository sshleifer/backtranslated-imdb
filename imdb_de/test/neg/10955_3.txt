The production company for this film is called "Nott Entertainment," and that's a surprisingly fitting name. This is very 'Nott' which is entertaining from beginning to end, which is a pity as a mix of zombie movie and western might be interesting. Every time a zombie movie is released on a low budget, it will tend to be "for fans of the fans". Actually I consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but too many more like this and I will re-evaluate my opinion! The film seems to be a rip-off of the half-decent Aussie zombie strip 'Undead' instead of just being in the lead of a cowboy hat; everyone wears one; But that does not make much sense, since the film apparently plays in modern times. The credits sequence at the beginning of the film makes us believe that we will have an atmospheric film, but when the movie starts right; It quickly becomes clear what we are really getting into. Of course there's a lot of Gore and it's actually pretty well done, although the good things I have to say about the movie are pretty much ending there. Halfway there is a twist that could be interesting if the rest of the movie had been like that. Overall, this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies. I can not recommend it.
