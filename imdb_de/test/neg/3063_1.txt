Some people may remember Ms. Russell from films like "Black Widow," which had some appeal and critical acclaim. Boy, she must have needed a hire check when she signed up to make this dog. Yes, there will be those who like the unnecessary violence and nakedness. But you have to sit back and ask yourself in retrospect, what someone who had money and time to do this at all. I just saw this movie on one of the HBOs and I can not believe they picked it up. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Ms. Russell did not have the physical attractiveness she had done earlier in her career. But come on! Did you play Ma Barker ??? Their "sons" all look like they could be their brothers. It is also scary because you believe that there will be incestuousness (thank God there is none, hope that is not considered a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano, who were included in the cast, this is a B-movie that goes straight to the video. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, either in person or on the phone, are a primitive in horrible, horrible spectacles. Oh, wait, I forgot terrible, terrible writing too. Chalk this until experience. A bad experience.
