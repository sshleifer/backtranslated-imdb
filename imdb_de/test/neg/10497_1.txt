Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is far worse than such atrocities as "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and these movies are terrible. The writer / director / star Ron Hall lacks charisma and acting skills, and he is clearly incapable of even the most basic directorial concepts. Maybe the worst camera work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I've ever seen in a movie. In rare cases, two shots cut together, and you can not see much in the dim lighting. The dreadful dialogue is being talked about extremely slowly by an extremely infallible cast that extends the movie to an almost deadly 87 minutes. This is a really ridiculous embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, connoisseurs of horrible filmmaking want to see that, but it's very hard to assert, no matter how seasoned observers you are. The fact that Ron Hall considered it solvable is amazing. If you're a movie director and actually think it's fine if the opening credits of your movie contains a few frames of the words SLUG before the title appears, which is left over from your rough cut - and you can not seem to muster the energy if you do Obviously, your standards are so low that they are offensive. I am amazed that Lions Gate / Maple has agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite Rudy Ray Moore's very short cameo essay, this film is a work of Ron Hall that excels himself - he clearly believes he is an impressive actor, and he also believes he has excellent writing and directing skills It's so unbelievably incredible that it's hard to believe he really wants people to see it out of fear of brutal condemnation as I am doing right now. A breathtaking, terribly awful film. I'm not joking.
