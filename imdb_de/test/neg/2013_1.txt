Imagine the worst that the human intellect could ever imagine. Now imagine something infinitely darker - I mean, worse than that. Then multiply that by the amount of suction the Star Wars Holiday Special has. This movie is far worse than that. <br /> <br /> "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness," with such famous and respected actors as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as the "cruel antagonist," Count ORLOCK) It's synonymous with that Eating your own chair exclusively for your entire life condenses to about an hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy - riddled with communist propaganda, promoting drug use, futuristic anachronisms and possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "War of the Worlds". <br /> The hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union are proud to see in the grubby sets they call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen throughout the movie on several posters. And, of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries. So they do not know who this "god" is, though they have no qualms about using His name in vain. But in the socialist republic of space (chaired by interstellar President Baker), deaths such as drugs are legalized and quite common. The mobility of handicaps, however, seems to be even worse than today (they do not even have a wheelchair ramp). <br /> <br /> Racial tension is still bubbling across the galaxy in a familiar / predictable way. We get great comments on the ethnic division through lines like "Is Dracula a Brotha?", "We Brothas Must Stick Together," and "Once you go black, do not go back." Speaking of black characters, one is played by Coolio. Coolio plays a stereotypical stoner and may be the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. Oh, wait, second most ridiculous vampire of all time. This award-winning title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK by PLANET TRANSYLVANIA in the CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two make up a fair pair, between Coolio's attempts to cripple a paraplegic, strange attempts to make animal noises, a hairstyle that is 1004 years old, and Giantantic stretches of utterly worthless dialogue; and Count Orlock's twenty-dollar generic Halloween-style vampire costume, the exploding of coffins, or a confusing, crazy backstory. <br /> <br /> One wonders if they simply gave Coolio the opportunity to "rise like a dragon in space" without gravity ", let him interact with the other" actors ", and just go away And there's some questioning of the motives of Count Orlock, does he want "infinite darkness," as the subtitle of the film suggests, does he want to eat the crew, or does he want * Coolio * kills them all, or wants to give disabled people a chance in such an inhospitable future? It does not matter because none of the plot in this movie makes any sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie must be its end More about the fact that the movie is over than any merit of the abrupt draw of a climax they call before the credits Instead of facing Count Orlock in some kind of duel (the next thing we get is a shot, in the Orlock with breakneck speed before our protagonist dies shortly thereafter), our heroes beat him by cutting his arm in the usual way door. Orlock begins to collapse and screams in pain, a completely worldly but understandably painful injury. This is by far the biggest fun you get from this movie. If you see a distorted face of a vampire crying in pain, you will sit on the edge of your seat - laughing. Worth the four dollars alone. Right after that we will of course be treated to one of the film's worst one-liners, the obligatory allusion to sex and perhaps the most-cited EXCUSE FOR AN ENDING * EVER *. They ride in the sun and their ship literally jumps in the air before approaching the impact. I think they just beat the Wachowski brothers. for the worst finale ever. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible. Surely in this fact, we can safely say that this is the BAD movie ever created that will never be exceeded for poor quality, low budget, and less theatrical talent.
