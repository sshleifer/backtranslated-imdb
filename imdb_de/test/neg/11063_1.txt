This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At eye level with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The blinking helmet lights made it hard to see things, and I think that epileptics should pay attention, as there are times when the strobe makes the movie even more annoying. I think if they had been calmer, they might have found a way out. Then, if you think the geek can make trumps, he will even resort to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when, the guy who has sex will realize that when the girl says she can hear something. She really can hear something. One of those guys must have at least seen Scream (where he alerts you to such things). It's also a big letdown when a premise promises so much and then someone writes the script. I'm sorry, the people I got in the video shop on a weekly basis and I'd still like to get my money back.
