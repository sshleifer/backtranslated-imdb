AALCC informs us that 14-year-olds can be quite vile and vicious. For those who do not know, the film does a public service. Otherwise, it's a lot of eye-catching videography with little or no reason. I'll admit that the camera work is sometimes striking, but also that at other times she can be relentless. The performers occupy screen space and screen time, but do not calculate as compulsive people. I suppose the email that flashes all the way through the screen means you need to find out which character has a nickname, but I simply could not find enough differences to do so.
