Carole Lombard and James Stewart playfully try to give some life and meaning to this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes run as if they were distributed among different directors, each with different goals. Some are Capra-sweet, some screwball, some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir. There is even an extended adventure sequence when the plot is suddenly aimed at a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are the worst when the movie as a whole is so unpredictable and the plot is not really credible. Worth watching only for movie students or fans of the actors - some smaller parts like Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot are also very well played.
