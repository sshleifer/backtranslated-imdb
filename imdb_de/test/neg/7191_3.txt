If you read the commentary on this film, it's a smart and witty political comedy based on true events - the only true word here is that it's a comedy. If you're told it's an insider movie about Russian politics, it's not. There is probably only 2% in the film of what really happened during the election campaign in Russia. In the reality of 1996, it was a thousand times more interesting to follow the situation, and that was a really funny election campaign. Well, there were US PR consultants working in Yeltsin's staff, but their role was minimal. The entire campaign was completely different than shown in the movie. It would be much funnier to ride the president's people through the country with paper boxes full of cash and the celebrities who support Yeltsin everywhere with their shows - at least that would be true. I only give three because of the respect for Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about the machine guns on the streets of Moscow. I lived in a place that had the highest levels of crime in Russia in the mid-1990s and never saw a man with a gun in the street.
