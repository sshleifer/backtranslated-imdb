The word "boring" is thrown around far too often when it comes to how bad a low budget horror movie may or may not be. I have seen many B movies. Many terrible, terribly incompetent B-movies. Some with a production value of a few hundred dollars. Do inefficiency, lousy drama, inferior continuity and embarrassing budgets make a movie truly unsurpassable? Some would undoubtedly yes. Most of them are probably big fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate movies on a big budget, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes awesome (Troll 2), but Boring will always be unsurpassed ... Hey, sort of like Bloodthirsty Butcher's trash ... Um, yeah, anyway. This is one of the many alternatives of the late British director Andy Milligan to sleeping pills. This is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan tells a boring story and still manages to "slaughter" her. Hey, that's pretty funny, I said ... Sorry, I'm getting distracted again and again. That's not easy. The second thought makes it easy. No Gore, no fear, no conversation, just unlikely, annoying people with incoherent conversations. they are bloodthirsty butchers. Oh, and anything about a barber killing people, and anything about meat pies. I do not know, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> For something more rewarding by Andy Milligan, the only thing I've ever seen is the rats come, the werewolves are here. Yes, you heard me. But how do we all want to forget about this Milligan guy and pick up something cute like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp? Whatever you decide, you know, bloodthirsty butchers are shit, maybe more than any other version of this already lackluster story. And that, B-movie fans, really says something. 2.10
