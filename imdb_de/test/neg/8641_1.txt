This film is an absolute garbage and gets worse at the very slow end! <br /> <br /> The plot is confused and tedious, the performers have a careless attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - a bad move, or they knew they would not get paid) and the sets were meaningless, boring and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and actually decided not to spend the last 5 minutes thinking that the actors would have fallen asleep by then. Wasting untold lifetime! <br /> <br /> If you need to see it, take it to the bedroom and forget about the sleeping pills. But maybe you need an antidepressant instead! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's good when celluloid breaks down.
