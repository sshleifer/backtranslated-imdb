My roommate and I foolishly bought the video for "The Roller Blade Seven" at our local second-hand video store to make a bad movie laugh. This movie is not even ridiculous, it is pathetic, even worse than Jack Frost 2 - and that says something. The script, drama, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts, the actors have not even learned their lines and are obviously ad libbing or, in one case, have the lines read out irregularly and just repeat them. The film is in the post-apocalyptic "Radzone". Obviously, the film consists of about 45 minutes of film, many of which are poorly edited or repeated from different camera angles to lengthen the film. This gets boring very quickly. The plot makes no sense whatsoever (it seems to be an amalgamation of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven, most of them have no blades, they carry wheeled boots and it seems like I thought that The movie was largely sold out because about three minutes of half-naked women are in it. Writer and star Scott Shaw has obviously been a bit of a samurai, performing some very bad stunts throughout the movie and inventing swordfighting moves that are massively amateurish. Nonetheless, his website says that the movie should never be compared to a traditional movie because it truly transcends the boundaries of modern filmmaking. My roommate and I were speechless from the whole ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, she has decided that it may be some kind of ring-bruise that needs to be passed on. If you see the video in stores, take it from me! Leave it alone!
