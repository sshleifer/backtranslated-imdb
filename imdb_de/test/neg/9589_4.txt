Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real 1950s dilemma: what to do with a screen idol secretly homosexual? Marry him to an unsuspecting woman to quell the gossip (and keep him working). Wispy-thin idea getting some energy through the good cast and retro production design, which amusingly resembles a Shag greeting card. The dialogue is not very smart and there are some slapsticks that run around at the beginning and do not work (spitting out food, etc.). However, when a serious tone comes over the final act, it is handled with good taste - and is greeted by the viewer far more than all the clever stupidity. Matt Letscher does a great job as a movie hero / whore Guy Stone, but is his experience enough to strengthen his character, or is he back at the bar the next night? The movie does not seem to know or interest. Day wants to express a few one-liners and a carefully written pro-gay speech - a plea for tolerance - but he has no other agenda. For spectators who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow of this affair may look like a joke. * 1/2 of ****
