I saw the * star * of this movie on the Daily Show and thought I could join in (the movie premiered on Comedy Central and then went to theaters). Oh Vey! <br /> <br /> This makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a single laugh, not even a grin. This movie makes your face appear in pimples and your eyes burst like the last remnants of "Raiders". I can not imagine a worse movie, be it "Manos" or "Ishtar". When the pythons lure, run away, run away! Why does anyone have the green light if he does not use his own money? The horror is that there is not a good line, not a good joke, and just a bad thing ... the making of this movie hilarious I need a new pancreas to choke so loud. Damn, who is involved in this travesty.
