I saw this one in a sneak preview yesterday and I have to say it was awful. After the closing credits, I thought, "Hey, with this cast it will probably be pretty good." It did not become that way at all. <br /> <br /> Lame predictable groaning, terribly simple drawn characters (maybe except a Lara's wife) and an end could be foreseen 10 minutes. Worst of all, a delicate subject (disabled person) has been abused for weak and mostly tasteless jokes, without ever touching anything but the surface of the problem. The disabled person with whom the film most sympathizes is the one who pretends to be the only one. What kind of message is this? And the film has no thoughtful ending, it basically comes down to it: "I love you, it does not matter that you acted like an ass." <br /> Great cast that must have felt terribly boring to sign up for a horrible movie.
