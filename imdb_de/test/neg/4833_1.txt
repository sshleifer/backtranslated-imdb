Actually, I do not tell the main story in this comment, but with only 2-3 sentences I can turn it into a spoiler. OK, here are these - <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is just an 85% conversion of the Hollywood movie Cellular in Bollywood using the software Vikram Bhatt. The title has no match with the story, only in the direction of thriller. Only that !! It does not even deserve a single star for its imitation, incomplete casting, poor standard and predictable history. Undoubtedly, I can now say that Viram Bhatt is slowly disappearing from his directing status as no mature audience will appreciate his recent works, including this one. Next to him, Aftab Shivdasani makes his attitude as a comic comic type. Who knows, how long will he be in the film industry? Sometimes standards in performance and cinematography are lower than in a class C movie. However, the most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan, who was somewhat similar to Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. With innocent face Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the film, because he has nothing to impress. Therefore, those who have already looked at Cellular advise not to waste time with this imitation bag.
