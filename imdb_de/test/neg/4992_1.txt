This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Boring, illogical, terrible. Do not waste a minute in your life to see this crap! I hope the directors will not make another movie because this movie will bankrupt them. The movie seems to have come out in a day or two with a few friends of the directors (if we can use that word for these two guys). You only use one camera in your hand. Many scenes are in the dark and there is nothing to see. Many scenes (80% of the movie) only relate to conversation. ! There are movies like Vampires Vs. Zombies that you can laugh about, but this movie is just bad and makes no sense to make such films. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Do not make movies anymore!
