A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) are the targets of a troubled serial killer after having taken a 'comfort break' at a remote roadside rest stop. <br /> <<p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> who might have been a really scary cooler in the most competent hands turn out to be a confusing, ill-considered mess under the sloppy guidance of John Shiban (who also wrote the screenplay) There's plenty of hefty violence, a noodling sense of nudity, and self-assured performances of the cast, but the stupid script leaves so many unanswered questions to the viewer that you can not help but be disappointed. <br /> <br /> On On the surface, the movie plays out like a usual clich√©-hounded "killer-on-the-lose" movie, but Shiban (a former X-Files author) casts some subtle supernatural elements suggesting that his goal was something else altogether: a ghost story in which the rest area serves as a home to a vengeful ghost to punish the sinners. By reading the movie, watching the theories of viewers here on IMDb and watching the movie With some extras on the DVD, certain elements of the plot become a little more meaningful (although there are still many questions left despite additional information). In my opinion, a film that requires so much research to (partially) understand itself is not very good.
