Why was not this chosen for the best picture of 1998? This must be the best movie ever. Something like Citzen Kane looks like crap, come on, Citzen Kane was not even in color! I love this movie, it must be the best movie I've ever invested in. I'm still shocked that it was not nominated for EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest you can give, I'll give 20!
