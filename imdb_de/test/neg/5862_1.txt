This may be the worst movie I've ever seen - it does not have good qualities at all. <br /> <br /> It looked as if it had been done in about 20 minutes, while the other time it was filled with title graphics. <Br /> <br /> The senior man who has been transformed from the death cell into a superman - if you are anything other than the most predictable and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I left the cinema feeling cheated. <br /> <br /> Of course I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
