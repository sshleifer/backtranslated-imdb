This episode was boring and was not even in the horror realm. So far, Masters of Horror has produced a really good episode this season ... The Damned Thing ... it's still early, I think the episodes are getting better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay, but a solid plot was missing. The episode about the couple who got the serial killer started boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. Still, I'm just disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that first season episodes had. Please save this season John Carpenter! I am convinced that Pro-Life will redeem the entire lackluster season so far. <br /> <br /> "You're a mad little elf!"
