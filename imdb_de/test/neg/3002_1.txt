Sophisticated storytelling like this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque, unstructured threads around to confuse the audience. 2) Treat only big issues like life, death and God. 3) Make it profound with scenes of life, death, heaven, etc. 4) Rely on an intellectually weak audience to take advantage of the doubt. 5) And finally laugh all the way to critical acclaim. <br /> <br /> This movie is overbearing faux-intellectualism in its wildest form. Not only do these filmmakers answer questions, they are also afraid to ask the questions first. The film is held together by slings. Instructions are raised and dropped awkward. Pop cultural references are jerky and arbitrary. There is so little to say that critical stitches will be missing. <br /> <br /> Critics who have found an intellectual basis for this film are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this film is about. Good news: the filmmakers too. Answering answers to profound questions about human existence requires wit, intellect, poetry and genius. Unfortunately, this movie does not show any of these features.
