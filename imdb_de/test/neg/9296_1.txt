This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are terrible people. I saw this movie with three friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley's character is just stupid, but not funny at all. It's a wonder why an actor's talent is involved in such a trip. Tea Leoni makes a good Hillary Clinton impression to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead, which has all the lovable characteristics of a broomstick. Throw in a meaningless and inexplicable negotiation and a horribly frightening assembly, and you have a waste of 93 minutes (in my case 60). Avoid this movie at all costs!
