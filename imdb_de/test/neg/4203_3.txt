I bought this Chuck Norris DVD and knew it was one of his earliest movies. We all know that he will never win an Oscar for his acting, but we do not pay attention to him. Although there were a few earthquakes in California since this movie was filmed, there was no desert or hill between Hwy.99 and I5. Billy was allegedly crossed from 120 to 120, a distance of less than 15 miles. I wish the authors, producers and directors of these films would at least look at a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I've been able to tell right from the start that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. Grab your Doritos and a drink for adults and enjoy a journey into the past.
