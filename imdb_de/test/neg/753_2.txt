Poor Jane Austen should be glad she did not see this horrible wreck of an adaptation. So many great Jane Austen films have come out lately that this film was permanently buried along with two other films I despised, the man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main component of the film is that it completely misses the point of the book. Jane Austen has made fun of the Gothic mania in her company, and much of the novel is tongue in cheek. The film, however, is serious and gives a terribly melodramatic impression. The carefree, funny taste of Austen's writing is completely unobtrusive in this lumbering raid in which horror meets. The scenes of Catherine's Imagination are both unfounded and uninteresting. Even Henry Tilney is terribly unsightly. Why, I ask, would someone fall for him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen evening, check out Emma instead!
