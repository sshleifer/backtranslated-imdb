This is by far the worst adaptation of Greek mythology that I have ever seen. It absolutely failed as an adaptation to the original myth by inventing stupid plot twists and reducing the 12 works to ... 3 or 4, I think. It makes completely unnecessary things to try to integrate other myths in a clumsy way, which challenges the authors who have ever read these myths, such as birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the oracle of Delphi for Tiresias and bulls for a pedantic version of Proteus that incorporates aspects that were never seen outside of Sam Raimi's entertaining series relating to his first marriage, with a woman co-opted for one of the Furies, so it was for the epoch sounds suitable. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of it, but it also fails because of pure film standards. Most painful is the dialogue, leaded, meaningless pseudo-Shakespearean. It is a poor reinterpretation of the myths that undertakes a sad attempt at postmodern revisionism, which Crichton's "The 13th Warrior" attempted with respect to the Beowulf legend, while still incorporating the strictly mythological elements, such as the gods and magical superiority. A sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience that many of the participating quality actors certainly regret.
