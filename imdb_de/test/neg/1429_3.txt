Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (twisted sister), Amal Rhoe. Disturbing torture scenes highlight this dark, disgusting film about a sadistic psychopath who lures teens into his torture chamber via the internet. Snider (from the ex-80s rock band Twisted Sister) plays the lazy psychopath who on Hannibal Lecter is a dirty "twist" (no pun). Pena is one of the mothers of the victims. Harrelson (brother of Woody) delivers one of the worst cop performances I've ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe proves why this is their only screen credit with equally pathetic performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is finally stunned, the torture scenes are very graphic and crude and the end is just crap. EVALUATION: 3 out of 10 points. R rated for violence, torture, strong language and sexual situations.
