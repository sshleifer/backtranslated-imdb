An elite American military team, which of course includes two good-looking women and a guy who can not handle teamwork, lots of bats, some terrorists, and a Spetznaz team that looks like a gang that can not shoot straight. all together in a cluttered plot with mediocre impact. This one does not have much to offer. The characters are not mandatory. Even the surrounding area, which offers great opportunities, looks like something out of the middle of rural Pennsylvania, not an exotic boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The bats undoubtedly look wild. You can even take a man with you and fly a few meters (harpies?) Or chop off one arm. You see Delta forces surrounded by hundreds of bats. A guy shoots with assault rifles and pistols and bats down with bats. It would be like trying to shoot Skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. Extremely unaware. The dialogue is rancidly unrealistic, with boy / girl jokes, flirting in the middle of tense parts of the mission. One of the team is blown up by a mine and the first in the scene stares sadly, stunned at his body, without worrying about protecting the area. After the rest of the group has appeared, he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield - thanks for the heads-up boy. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a contrast in a horror movie A small military group can be checked well with a low budget outpost. Harvest is not the movie you want to see. In fact, I think I'll give two instead of three, if I can do it through the second half. Seems unlikely at this point.
