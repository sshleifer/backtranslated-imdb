This movie is really bad. I like turning on the TV while I take a nap, and this movie looked like it was a good thing to sleep through, and the kid got me wrong. My body literally woke me up and said "Hey ... this movie is horrible ... you have to watch it". I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. Something about an unintentional comedy gets me moving. This movie is impressively crappy. I really do not know how to put it right, except for the recommendation that you just look at it to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should look at it with people. I made the best jokes during this movie, and nobody was there to hear them. Worse than a swim fan. It is so bad.
