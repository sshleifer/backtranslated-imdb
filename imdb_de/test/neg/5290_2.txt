Twenty years ago Dr. Chopper (yes, he drives a helicopter and hacks people) when the police found bodies in his clinic. Since then, people around Tanoka Lake (or so) have disappeared, and bodies / body parts have been found everywhere. It turned out that Dr. Chopper needs body parts to stay alive, and has taken them from strangers, like two lesbians and 5 students who travel through Lake Tanoka at their initiation (they get the picture). If a few teenagers decide to camp, they will inevitably collide with the doctor. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste time, this is the right choice. Acting varies from really bad to mediocre when girls stumble and fall for no apparent reason. Every chance to show skin is used without showing anything at all. The same goes for the special effects that are pretty pitiful with any slash filmed at an angle so you can not see it, but there are many body parts in the movie that are all in the blood (probably to hide how sorry they really look). The plot is pretty flawed and the dialogue rather sad. I just laughed when Dr. Chopper said, "Howdy!" if you try to be scary. Do not look at it unless you're a hack'n'slash freak. Even then, I would recommend you to look at something better.
