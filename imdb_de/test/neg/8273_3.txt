I could not help but laugh when I saw that in 1996 the public could think that e-mail was an e-mail. It seems that email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) in which lame speech synthesis reads each comment aloud. And some of the other "technical" aspects are also weird. I would swear that the "high tech" communication center that actually has it contains a few Commodore 64 monitors. Almost as if watching the movie Hackers today, I think. <br /> <br /> Although the lead actor brings the illusion of disability to most of the film, the last part of the film has an inexplicable use of her legs that I somehow can not ignore. I mean, why something so stupid about it? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The plot is pretty predictable, acting bad, the killer pretty much guessing. But it can be amusing in a way, I think, a kind of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
