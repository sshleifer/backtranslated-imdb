If you want to see the worst movie of all time, look no further. Some pathetic movies can be viewed because they are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, American Movie has no joke at all, no unintentional humor, only obscenities that its director finds ridiculous in tone. In Clerks you will find creativity, wit and enjoyment - all on a tight budget. It should make you forget that vile effort.
