Now you can really call that a movie. I knew that some movies that Japanese people do do nothing other than this bad one? I mean, I fell asleep three times in this movie. No horror, a few tiny percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. Action, let's just admit that there are some, but the scenes are filmed badly, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in his own role. That did not convince. The script is awful too. I mean, this movie can be really great, REALLY, but for the 60s (not 100% sure). I do NOT recommend seeing him unless you want to be as boring as me. I can not imagine that this movie got its rating. It's over, over, overrated !!!. This is of course a personal opinion. I do not want to offend anyone, but who could like this crap? So I hope this does NOT help someone "enjoy" this movie. Nevertheless, you have the choice!
