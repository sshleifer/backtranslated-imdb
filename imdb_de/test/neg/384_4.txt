Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of bloody horror movies and feels he has filmed too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he loses his marbles. This is a bad idea, as the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a series of gruesome murders. On the occasion of making Fulci his case man, the crazy nut doctor mesmerizes the horror hacker in the thought that he is responsible for the recent series of murders, a fantastically bloody treat from spaghetti splatter god Lucio Fulci. The movie is full of chainsaws, ax attacks and various other bloody kills. The film certainly spills enough wine for even the most stubborn Gore dogs. If you take a closer look, however, it turns out that many of the cruel scenes come from earlier films (mostly Fulci's own "masterpieces"). Remove these from the equation, and you get a simple basic idea that is completely wasted, a welcome nudity and horrible accomplishments by Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as a psycho-psychiatrist. The film evolves into an incomprehensible jumble, with the "borrowed "Film footage is randomly inserted and no attempt is made to convincingly incorporate it into the story. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom or Mario Bianchi's murder mystery, you've already seen the best parts of Cat In The Brain. After a lot of bloodshed the film contracts pretty quickly, and the viewer feels confused and a bit cheated. If you're a Fulci executor, check out the movie, but I'd suggest looking for the films from which the "good parts" were taken.
