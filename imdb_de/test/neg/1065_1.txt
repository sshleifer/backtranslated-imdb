This film is so copied, clichéd, awkward and laborious, I find it amazing that no one could feel betrayed by the experience of setting. <br /> <br /> Here's the spectrum of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologizations and simply unsolvable storytelling in this "hard-hitting" high school presentation: The tough guy Jock is really gay. The A student is unhappy because his father urges him and somehow causes him to incest. A teacher is meant for a student who wets his pants in the classroom. A girl who goes out with the above-mentioned Jock is really in love with him and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only salvation is the student counselor scenes, but they are vaguely interesting. Most of the devices in this film are so leaded that they do not believe the faith. <br /> <br /> This movie does not give me any insights into teenagers and I will not be surprised if bombs explode, especially among teenagers. The people who like this movie seem to be parents worried about their teens and boy, they are barking at the wrong tree, if they believe that this movie will help to "understand" teenage issues. I mean, what is the moral of this movie? "Hey guys, let's all look out one after another and hug each other" GIVE ME A PAUSE. Anyone who thinks they could get away with this kind of message to a 14-year-old child needs to think back. In the eighties we watched Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator and so on. This movie will fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is at the top with another Australian "Independent" movie, "One Perfect Day," which was as bad as this turkey in a movie. Thankfully, no taxpayer was spent on this money. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
