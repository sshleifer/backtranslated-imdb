This film is far and wide and, beyond any doubt, the only worst and most contemptible movie in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> It is really so bad. <br /> <I personally have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a horrible movie and rented it because I thought it was one of those. It was not to my immense disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in a way that sounds like reading the lines directly from posters. The story makes absolutely no sense and the actual movie looks like it was taken with a home video camera. I could not even finish it. It's even worse than "Witch Academy," and that's pretty much a performance in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not even think about how a director could make this movie, but I still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to publish. <br /> <br /> Painful, terrible, terrible.
