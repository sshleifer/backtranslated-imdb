As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as a production manager in this movie ... my very first! It was actually the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Take a close look and even see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum guard named ... "Cely" (my last name). <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Hostages," this image was changed from "Producer Director" to "Another Son of Sam," who wanted to take advantage of the serial killer's news at the time. Nothing could have helped. I do not think this picture was good enough to "MST 3K!" To be shown. <br /> <br /> The film was mainly filmed with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and previous Arriflex handheld cameras. The fact is, the shot of the helicopter during the hostage-taking was filmed with my own epoch of World War II, Arri. The picture was completely taken in the mid-seventies in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina. Most of the "stars" were local TV stations, and the rest of the crew was simply inexperienced or gullible enough to believe former stuntman and producer-director Dave A, Adam's delusions of reasonableness, if you like these kinds of pictures, You may love the work of another North Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
