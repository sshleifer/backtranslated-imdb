A college professor is working on creating zombies, and if you do not know, things are going terribly wrong. Next, you know, the entire campus is overrun. Luckily, there are a few Uber commands that have been trained for such a situation. Too bad that they have to be accompanied by a group of idiot commandos led by a rapper (he does not even bother to play a military man, he only responds to his superiors as if he were in 'Homies' hood). The highlight of this part of the movie is the changing room scene. The male and female suicidal units share the same locker room, and apparently military laws require that all women wear black bras and briefs. Hey, if you can not make a good movie, you can at least have women in their underwear. My hat is reserved for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> After the discussion about how well these idiot commands are prepared for the job (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they all get killed in a short time. Their biggest downfall seems to be that they can never turn on the lights. In a typical encounter, they go into a room and see someone at the other end. Human or zombie? Can not say turn on the light? No, the Idiots Command Protocol requires them to approach the person, making sure their weapon is held so it can be easily knocked out of hand. Well, you know the drill. The downfall of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene, where a rapper is involved in every movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and again the filmmaker has a hat), the hottest baby among the idiots manages to survive. She and the female over-command end up in tight T-shirts for the rest of the movie. So now a military operation should be carried out! There's a lot going on, and my funny stuff like the Uber commands, which are unable to penetrate a simple ventilation grille (this is obviously a thin piece of aluminum that could easily penetrate your fist). This requires a plan to rub zombie guts on themselves, and although we have not seen anything in the movie, suggesting that zombies locate their prey for smell, they are good enough to sniff the zombie guts immediately and to let our heroes go <br /> <br /> A few other funny things - the Paris Hilton gag that "Can you hear me now?" gag and the fact that while the zombies immediately bite minor characters, the main characters can fight through dozens of them without nibbling on them. Another snicker is provided by Mr. Fingaz, who does not seem to pronounce the word "tourniquet" (Toe-No-Kit?). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a bit amusing. Could have used a few more interesting characters, but for a sci-fi channel original, I was slightly impressed.
