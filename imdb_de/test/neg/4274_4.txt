This movie is about a young girl who lives with his rich cousins, falls in love with one of her cousins ​​and rejects the push of an amoral worshiper who causes trouble to the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to see the older version. I found it to be true to the Fanny character in the book, but it was also a boring character. The Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; she often seemed to faint. I did not like Robert Bourbage, who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine that he was interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crawford, was okay, but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interest in her acting and stared at her wig. I always expected it to fall off her head. I also saw a hair loss under the wig.
