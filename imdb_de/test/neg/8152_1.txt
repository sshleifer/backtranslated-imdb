As a (somewhat) independent filmmaker, I really understand what those guys were up to, and it sounds like a good idea. On paper. On 16mm film, however, it is terrible. I did not know that the thing was made in the mid '90s because the film was so gritty and bad I could have sworn it was one of those 30 year old movies where a porn producer tries to become mainstream. And the sound! I do not know what kind of microphone they used to record, but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves during the whole thing. I guess I should not judge too hard because how many feature films has MY society released? None, but I would like to believe that we have at least a good picture and sound quality for our bad acting, writing and directing. A + for idea, F-- for execution.
