Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team that proved the balance between a bad movie and a bad movie bad. Until then, there was a lot of bad movie baggage, but the seals? They wear black painted bicycle helmets. They know those with air holes through which every adult who wears them looks like a complete tool. Of course, the bass fishing boat with which they had greeted the cruise ship was another clue (it would not come through Tampa Bay, let alone a sea)? and their tactics would not pass a 3rd rate XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Does director John Shepphird have photos of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with a hobbit? Because I can not think of any other reason why he would be in this movie. The other actors have a good excuse. There are talentless unattractive hacks that could not be adjusted for an infomercial. The plot states that two men are trying to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (love called that name) aboard a cruise ship and it will loosen a small flat), the monster murders are the bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity, and many really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes. Particularly annoying is a gigolo character from a 60s Doris Day movie. <br /> <br /> The cast bleeds ketchup while the chupacabra is bleeding in the dark blood. (Why a goat eating a Mexican mammal bleeding anything but red is a mystery to me.) <br /> <br /> Every B-movie has a turning point that makes it a fun time (Hey, it is a lesbian shower scene, OMG, this guy ate are their own eyeballs) or not so much fun (Did they just have those forty men wearing overalls and bicycle helmets as navy seals?). Chupacabra falls into the not-so-funny B-movie side with a thump.
