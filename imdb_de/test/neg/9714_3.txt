The only reason for me to watch this little-known Irish movie was to ask if Mike Myers could have played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good, but that was probably the only good thing I can say about this movie. In the beginning, the film follows the life of twelve-year-old orphan Mickey, who lives with his brother and sister with his somewhat eccentric grandmother. Despite a strong language, it looks like a family movie, but after a while, it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is hardly suitable for a young public drama. And the worst part is that it's a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible action. An absurd action turns into another, and the events on the screen are never meaningful. I suspect that if a life drama needs a meteor or something more, which looks like an even more ridiculous spiritual content, that's a really bad sign. The characters are not much better than a story. Despite all his difficulties, the young Mickey is by no means a sympathetic character, but it was obvious that we should somehow take care of him and even feel strong sympathy for him. It does not work The same is true for other characters. They are usually as ridiculous as the story even with the title character (although he was not the main character) as the only bright spot. Towards the end of the film, I still had the hope that there was something behind all this improbability and absurdity. Even if the writer of the story in the film had such intentions (and I'm sure he did), they are hidden under such a strange script and are virtually unnoticeable. <br /> <br /> Note: 3 out of 10. Those who want to see Mike Myers as a drama actor can see Pete's Meteor for that reason, but the rest of the audience will most likely be bitterly disappointed.
