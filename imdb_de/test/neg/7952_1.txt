Or is that another way under the masterpiece? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972 there were a number of terrible horror movies, almost all of them lost again. Nothing needs to be explained, asked or shouted out loud. If you've looked carefully at my writings on CARNIVAL OF BLOOD or GURU THE MAD MONK, you know what's going on with SCREAM BABY SCREAM. The title sounds cool. It's just the faint script that should have gone elsewhere! This is undoubtedly the most frightfully written piece of cinematic mastery that has ever worked on the film! <br /> <br /> If you thought this was an early Slasher (which would benefit the average IMDb user to write another comment), good luck next time! The real truth behind the script is NOTHING with the film, which allegedly tells of a blue-faced psychopath who is supposed to "kill" and make some ugly face sculptures on his victims. It feels like you're seeing another early "SCOOBY DOO" episode. My favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teens play. And Hurray for an actress named "Eugenie Wingate" who has given us the worst make-up ever! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30 year old rarity in a bargain basement for five dollars. It's the perfect novelty to return to the psychedelic days of flower power, bad fashion and trashy music! Interesting Note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also listed in the Troma Film Archive on the company's website. Only time will tell when this is at the top of the bottom 100 list, along with a few more early 70's. God knows they need it !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
