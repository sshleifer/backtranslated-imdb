I have a friend who works at Blockbuster, and he gets five free rentals a week. One day, as we searched the corridors for something interesting, I stumbled over 18 weapons of Kung Fu and judging this movie alone seemed to be rather shaky, but we still tempted ourselves and rented it - after all it was free ..... and Thank God it was the ... the by far worst movie I've ever seen The budget must have been a cucumber and a piece of string ... the plot was ridiculous, the "18 guns" just mention it there is a book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons a villain seeks - and that's it! There is not even every gun that fights in this movie ... this and the action sequences are just BAD .... 9 out of 10 times the other guy's punches and kicks come just one foot from landing on the other. and there are MANY times when the movie skips frames (a result of a ridiculously bad cut) .... dubbing is also laughable, and it's hardly understandable .... and we will not get into acting either. ... the end will definitely cause you to "wtf ??" say, but to be fair, I have to mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent, and the old guy is a crazy bastard ... but that's it ... luckily I did not have to pay for this movie but at least I know exactly how bad a movie can actually be.
