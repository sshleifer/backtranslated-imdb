Yes that's right. If I asked my friends this question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" You could say something like "Armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "Scream," "Plan Nine from Space," "The Medallion," "Scooby Doo", etc. ... No - you can not Offended if you think you've seen something in the same section of naturally made human manure that this movie is in. If the worst movie you can imagine is the case, we say so bad that you are really angry; then you know nothing, my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day I and a buddy went to the local video store to rent a movie. We've both had the most films and the New Movies field shows us staring at us. "Wow, there are some good actors, man, say something about Mafia, just let's get it and get out of here." This was undoubtedly the worst film mistake in my film-loving life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: movie lovers or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as much fun as a glass of ice cold water (or iced tea ...) until it reaches room temperature. If you watch this movie, you will dream an eternal dream of death, when death is just blackout and nothing, and then you realize that you are just staring at your TV screen. Do not stare You actually pay as much attention as humans can. This is not a joke. <br /> <br /> This film is the perfection to make a bad movie. It's not the kind of bad thing you can see, show, and laugh at, it's the kind of movie that is so bad that you actually have no chance of ever remembering it. Unless you may use a shock therapy to cleanse the brain. .... ... (Hey, this could be similar to how I remember my buddy after I saw it ....) <br /> <br /> Best regards from me, Albert Pyun , <br /> -Joergen
