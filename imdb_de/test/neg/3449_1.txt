I am glad that I never saw this show when it came out. <br /> <br /> I was just wondering why she took 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80's with wrong people, wrong clothes and wrong music. How did I ever survive growing up during this time? <br /> <br /> The acting in most of the episodes I've seen is enforced. That makes very boring shows. The plotlines are not very interesting, as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and let expect a look at the next show. <br /> <br /> Stay with the old Twilight Zone shows and save the trouble of garbage watching.
