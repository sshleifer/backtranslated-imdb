I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast? Walter Pidgeon in a role reminiscent of his legendary "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a man on a submarine a sailor?), Even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a preference for sharks. Maybe it's a good children's movie, but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was badly abused. I think he was a red herring, like Pidgeon? They expect him to go crazy and try to throw the hero or his girl into Haitank. No such luck. By the way, why is there a Haitank on a submarine? It is typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre is shaking the shark (because we see him), but just expect that for some reason we accept the fact that there is a shark in this submarine. "Research?" Yes, scientists are always researching, who can understand them? If there were no shark, who would kill the evil psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even children's movies in the '50s can be less predictable and frankly idiotic (not to mention exploitation). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes raised my hopes. Great title song by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon leads Floyd the Barber (actually Howard McNear, sorry, Howie loved you in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour. Carefully skip the room with the huge "WARNING" sign on the door, past Peter Lorre with the sharks mentioned above and then we see a full-frame shot of Eden shaking her moneymaker to Avalon's passionate horn-play! The movie goes down quickly from there. There is no real explanation for the firestorm that threatens the earth. Therefore, there is a lack of dramatic tensions and no villains. Instead, Pidgeon's character is turned into an unconvincing red herring from the Ahab variety (I think "The Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly turns into evil for no reason at all. I think the reason is that it is a surprise to the audience. And it's kind of surprising, because the only negative thing she has done is to talk badly about the captain's mental health, and there's still no reason why she made the sabotage after she turned out to be a villain. Very bad and unconvincing. The guy who was the pessimistic Bible nut was better? At least his character made sense. What else could go wrong? Endless, endless dive shots. I never understand the attraction of such things. A giant octopus attacks the ship for a minute, only there is a monster for the movie trailer. Maybe this has got some people to think it would be a fantasy adventure movie instead of a half-baked suspension movie about military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? Perhaps the worst, it's hardly a fantasy movie, less a science fiction movie. It never did anything for my imagination, because the whole premise was nothing but another catastrophe / apocalypse and these characters never experience a sense of wonder or discovery. I'm done with Irwin Allen. I've never liked his later movies anyway, but this has led me to be Jules Verne, if it's really just another formula practice in disaster. The whole movie is just waiting to see which character is unlikely to become evil and die. He's always hired an actor / actress with a charming and personal screen persona to play those roles, and that's the only element of "surprise" you can find, since those characters have no logic anyway. What a miserable waste of time for these actors. George Pal's films are 100 times better (the only one who was paralyzed was "Atlantis", who was not accidentally the main Allerrequire), full of wonder and excitement and? Remember! ?? Ideas! Apart from some effect scenes and Barbara Eden there is nothing to see here in my opinion. I think it's great fun for those who are interested in disaster films, but I think they are a hollow and boring genre of films.
