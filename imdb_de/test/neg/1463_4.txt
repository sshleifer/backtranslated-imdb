It opens - and lasts for half an hour - like an Old Testament training program, if not without humor. The movie is finally starting to get wings when the biblical bias is dropped. In a scene of mixed success, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to tackle the Apocalypse, and the last quarter of an hour is a kind of humanist: "What's it all about?" Play-out, gilded with an optimistic assumption against a (ironically ironic) attitude of the WTC twin towers. <br /> <br /> Apart from Donovan's authority, action is split. There's the rest of the cast's thespian melodrama: although formally intended for biblical presentation, it fits in with the modern, paranoid comedy Hartley seeks. But I was also pleasantly surprised by PJ Harvey's contribution (credited and in danger of being a popstar entity only within the movie), not least in a standard scene in a record shop and a dangerously incomplete soundtrack which adds to that). It stayed cool - a kind of unobtrusive lack of focus - in the style of many pop icons that served to film (I think the Jagger of Performance here), but still maintained a compelling integration with cast and project. > <br /> Finally, in the affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too similar and depends more on perseverance than on the imagination of the audience. 4.10
