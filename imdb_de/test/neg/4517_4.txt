I found my band of this long forgotten "show". Next to the theme song 'DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE'. This show is barely visible. They'll be scrolling through the channels, just like the couple flicking through the TV channels. This is a parody of television. <br /> <br /> The Beaver is cool. The homosexual Dracula, the chick who talks about her experiences with Peria, and the woman with the big lips talking about homosexuality shows us everything that is wrong with television. It's all bad. Like the beaver from outer space, who seems lost in this new world, so will you. *** out *****
