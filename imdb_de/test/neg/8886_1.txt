We rented the movie and it was perhaps the worst movie ever. The box in the video library had a cool monster on the cover, but in fact the monster was a creature from the black lagoon mask. Terrible, terrible, terrible ... you would have to rent it, it's so bad. It feels like you're watching a bizzare-o-home movie.
