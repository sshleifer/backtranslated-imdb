Let me first say that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. The book may have been great, but the movie is not. <br /> <br /> I lived my whole life in the Peidmont area of ​​NC. I have never heard such ridiculous southern accents as in this movie. I lived in two small towns in NC and Charlotte and Raleigh. Occasionally you'll meet people with a strong southern accent, but I've never met a city where everyone talks like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community. Her comments reveal more about her distorted psyche than about the movie. If we were to broaden our ideas and pretend that there is something realistic in this film - which does not exist - then the truth is that bad people like Tory's dad will always find a justification for their actions. The author chose religion as a contradiction to Tory's supernatural abilities. Her conjecture that "the true character of the Gospels" leads a man to beat his daughter is the most perverse and misinformed interpretation I've ever heard. Before you begin to talk about the gospels, you should read them first. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and mostly unbelievable. In particular, many of the things that Kade has said about Tory are misplaced and are not consistent with the mood, context, or manner in which they are said. <br /> <br /> The "exciting twist" at the end of the film is lame predictable and lacks any credibility. Some have also said that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this film, but the truth is that the bitter mother figure is also an outdated, predictable, one-dimensional figure. Is that Bissets fault? I dont know. <br /> <br /> If you have the choice to choose between this movie and a twenty-year repeat of the Muppet Show, I recommend the Muppet Show.
