Celebrity singers have always had a hard time getting into the movies (the cinema is littered with failed attempts), and one can speculate why John Mellencamp never grew up as an actor. Instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects, Mellencamp dives straight into the lead role in "Falling From Grace," which he also conducted, and the results are as uncomfortable and inappropriate as this title. The story of a famous singer who returned to his hometown with his sticks and uncovered old family wounds has a script by Larry McMurtry, but the snaking film is nowhere to go. The minor cast is decent, including Kay Lenz (who always looks beautiful), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the really strong scene in the picture). As far as John's acting is concerned, he does not look very comfortable, though he obviously tries to make him look at home; he seems to cheat the camera most of the time, and he never connects directly to the audience. * 1/2 of ****
