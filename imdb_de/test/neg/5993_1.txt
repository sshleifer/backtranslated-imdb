The creature? Yes, it and the movie in which he plays. Hell would be infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to see it for all eternity. Six college students are being held in a convicted hospital to save money and become the victim of an old monster that must claim five casualties before returning to the "shadowy world from which it came!" Apart from major logical and coherence problems (plus the fact that it seems to be incomplete), this disaster is terribly handled, written, edited (by J. R. Bookwalter) and directed, and the makeup effects are almost nonexistent. It is also much shorter than claimed (only 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. It's the worst movie I ever saw of Full Moon productions by executive producer Charles Band. My boy is that it's BAD! <br /> <br /> I almost did not do a review, but that inexplicably got good reviews here and I thought a dissent was fine. Continue with caution!
