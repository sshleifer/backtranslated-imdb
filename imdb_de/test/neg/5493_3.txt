Best in the middle, when most characters get horny and follow someone they have not had before. Around this point, we can see Susan Sarandon's majestic breasts (though through a veil). Strangely enough, Beverly D'Angelo, who has no fear of nudity, does not show any at all while Aida Turturro ?? of all people ?? does. At the other end of the spectrum, the less people say that walking is a homosexual, the better. The film itself has little action; The dialogues from the play and the "normal" dialogues often intersect and that's not what I would think is a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Occasionally, the dialogue has something to offer, but the film is dragging on.
