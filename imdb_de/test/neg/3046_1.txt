This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad that I wanted to shoot myself in the forehead. I hated this movie. First of all, the plot was absolutely nowhere and everything that was shocking about this movie was seen in the 30 second long teaser trailer. Second, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was also a bad movie and totally unworthy of a remake. The best part of the movie is the house in which it plays. Which does not say much for the actual film. There were parts in the movie where the music gets very exciting and you're sure someone is around the corner and it turns out to be a girl or a cat, but if anyone is actually around the corner, it's impossible to be frightened yourself You've been expecting everything with film. So save yourself the money, save yourself time, save yourself the headache and watch the trailer. There's no point in watching this movie, not in the theater, not on DVD, not on TV, never.
