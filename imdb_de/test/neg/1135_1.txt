This movie was awful. It was all about Eddie, the brother-in-law of Clark Griswald. Eddie works much better when he changes good jokes like "Christmas Vacation" and "Vacation". <br /> <br /> I really do not understand how a movie like this gives a thumbs up. Do not get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I just felt that this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. This film leaves much to be desired and really needed bigger names of actors.
