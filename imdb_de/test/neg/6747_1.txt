Only in Hollywood audiovisual fiction could anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to pick up anything they care about, answer phones, climb stairs, all in search of a demolition expert who wants to kill everyone. Oh yes, and then we get the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he wears a vest, then fall down a long staircase and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. Any clich√© that can be thought of in suspense movies was used. I only saw it because Yuki Amami is so hot. Oh, but it's great to see how morally superior this FBI agent is when she's pretty sure there's a bomb in an opera house and she does not raise an alarm. Who writes these scripts ?????????????
