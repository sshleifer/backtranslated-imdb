Imagine being trapped in a museum of the Dark Ages and a resurrected vampire and his crazy buddy chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I would say, in the sinister torture apparatus of the Virgin of Nuremberg, because the danger is great that you will be brutally put to death. And yet, the older woman in this movie is running stupidly in her spiky casket. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez does not re-create the gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original, but focuses on comic situations and dialogues. No more ominous locks with weird cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and awkward wizards, causing laughter instead of terror. The story begins in the final resting place of Count de Lavud, where a famous doctor and a clerk steal the coffin to examine the body in a private clinic. Of course, the wooden stake is taken from his heart, and the vampire count becomes alive again, and the little thief is immediately enslaved for his dirty work. The vampire is looking at a beautiful patient in the clinic, and Dr. Enrique Saldívar's job is to save her soul and destroy the bloodsucker. "The Vampire's Coffin" uses a limited number of locations and there is very little action. The whole movie would be pretty boring if there were not a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting. However, photography is amazing with the sublime use of shadow and darkness. This is especially true during the scene when Count de Lavud follows a young woman through the deserted streets of a small town at night. It's the only really rewarding scene in the whole movie, the rest is rather mediocre and déjà-vu.
