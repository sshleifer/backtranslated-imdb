Ben (Rupert Grint) is a deeply unhappy youth, the son of his unfortunate married parents. His father (Nicholas Farrell) is Vicar and his mother (Laura Linney) is ... well, let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in the army of Jesus. Only when he takes on a summer job as an assistant to a malevolent, eccentric, once famous and now forgotten actor Evie Walton (Julie Walters), he finally finds himself in the manner of "Harold and Maude" again. Of course, Evie is deeply unhappy and only when these two sad sacks find each other, they can put their mutual misery aside and go on the road to happiness. <br /> <br /> Of course it's stupid and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a difficult side, and Walters, who could sleep through these kinds of things if she wanted, is excellent. It is when she puts the craziness aside and finds the pathos in the figure (like hitting the bottle and throwing in the sink) that it is best. The problem is that she's the only interesting character in the movie (and not because of the script that does not do anyone any favor). Grint, on the other hand, is not only unhappy; He's also a bit boring, while Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Nevertheless, she has the English accent.) The best thing to say is that it enjoys mild - with a focus on mild.
