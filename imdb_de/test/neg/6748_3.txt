Well, here's the thing - For this movie to work, you have to accept the following: a murdered woman lives at the end of the movie, a detective stops interrogating the dead woman's fianc√©e because a newspaper reporter has asked him to, and The same reporter, who was dragged into the night court for suspicious behavior by a good-looking blonde, marries her in exchange for the judge who lets her off the hook. Are you following me? I can not tell you how many times I've paused and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that just do not make sense. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) are married, but I have no idea how they came to this decision. In fact, I can not figure out how the filmmaker made the decision to make this film. I suppose there is entertainment here for mere nonsense, but it would have been nice if only a few pieces would fit. However, I'm not ready to add this list to my top ten worst list yet. I think this nightclub scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it. But why was it in the movie? I just do not know.
