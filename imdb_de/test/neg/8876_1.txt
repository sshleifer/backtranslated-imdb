This movie is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced a US drama. The characters were all very weak, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who in his classical interpretation was only alright if he acted as a French ally in a good movie. I think it was not a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director should think a bit about whether the film makes sense or not before he wastes money. Maybe they do not bother, because they have profits before they go to the movies. <br /> <br /> No more hope in the cinema ...
