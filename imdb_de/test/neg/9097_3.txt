This movie has some pretty Gorey parts, like a cock being bitten off and other big bites. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be scared if he came to me. However, the movie had some stupid parts. <br /> <br /> A husband goes drunk and kills his 3-year-old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suspect that death is more of a harm than blindness, but you would never know that the parents really feel bad because their daughter is blind. All she cares about is that "J. J. is dead!" While her teenage daughter walks around, stumbles over things and talks about how she can never drive a car. Parents are like - honey, stop walking around without leader, you know better - and then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. Sounds like favortism for me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue lines are not very realistic or well done. For example, when there is a huge accident in the castle, everyone goes down to see what it was. It was a huge mirror that fell to the ground and shattered. The man runs to the broken mirror and says simply: "The mirror is broken." I do not know, I would say a little more than that, when a huge mirror in my castle mysteriously crashed to the ground. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife have some big relationship problems and it's funny to watch them being stupid. Nobody ever believes the blind girl. Tip: If a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and do not tell her to shut up. I think that's the moral of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things, or you could end up killing yourself to prove your point. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought the best character was the Chief Policeman. He was the best actor and character. Everyone else (except Castle Freak) had run well from the mill. 3.10
