The Comebacks is a comedy that distorts the inspirational sports movies. It tells the story of an unlucky coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a plethora of college outsiders and drives them to the football championships. In the process, the lifelong loser discovers that he is finally a winner by rescuing himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding out that there really is no "me" in the "team"! <br /> <br /> I chose the unrated version of this movie. It was thirty minutes longer and I think it might be better than the theatrical release when I heard that people hated this movie. After all, 30 minutes of additional material can add a lot to a movie. Well, I was certainly wrong. It was as bad as the last "Meet the Spartans", but it still took thirty minutes of torture! A parody movie is short, because if it runs longer, it would be exaggerated! Honestly, I love silly comedies. Heck, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I think when it comes to spoof movies, it's either a hit or a miss and it's definitely missing. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, I'll say about the many jokes in this movie about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But that does not say much. The jokes were followed by other scenes of torture and mischief. <br /> <br /> I can not see how people would say that this is not a horrible parody movie. In fact, there are as many product placements here as Meet the Spartans, as many dance sequences and listless jokes. I'll say something else, what I like about this movie are the songs. There are some very good songs here. Take a look at it if you like spoof movies. Skip it if you like funny movies.
