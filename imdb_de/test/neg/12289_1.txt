If you and your friends find just as much humor and pleasure from terrible plays, jokes, props, and all the filmmaking as I and my friends, you'll have to borrow this See how funny it is, assuming it's not weird , bad quality, great, hilarious content. It is a story of some children who resist every law of physics and reality and fly back through a modern big-screen television to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends. Not to mention an incredibly serious scene where T-Rex becomes a father figure to one of the children. Yeah ... <br /> <br /> It should be in the comedy section, but you'll find it with children's movies if you find it at all. Call your friends, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You will quote the ridiculously horrible deposits in this movie for weeks. "What about all the hustle and bustle ?!"
