Within the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I was interested in such a "pick at the fault" feature film. The drama was terrible, the script was even worse. Whoever has these people write to write such crap for a movie has to feed the komodos themselves. With russian mig jets posing as US air force jets and pistols miraculously firing 50-60 rounds without reloading, this is just a faint detail for every story. In one scene, Komodo's special forces kill at night, while in another, they explain how Komodo and Kobra are cold-blooded and can not come out at night !!!! Even with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry, even for this low-budget movie, they were just average. Apart from that, I've curiously seen what other wondrous movies actually could make. Shame Shame Shame, to produce such a rot !!! <br /> <br /> This film should have stayed on the floor of the cutting room !!!
