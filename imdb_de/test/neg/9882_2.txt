The only reason why I did not delete this movie after 20 minutes is that we already wasted 20 minutes for India?) Jump on half a meter wall / bin, I mean, effects do not make a movie, but .. Shit ... my boyfriend and I hoped that the whole movie had a real effect (a huge wolf?!! Something!?!?!!) But noooooooooooooooo ... we only have one jump! on a 0.5 m high wall + they used pharmacies ..... and found weapons?! in the pharmacy ?! I mean, what the hell? Oh, I forgot, there was another effect - contact lances than green eyes! Every 10 minutes, we shouted, "The only thing that can save the movie from the shame is a huge wolf killing them all !!! Also, the script was so horrible that you do not know who you want to die first Pray actually (and I mean PRAY!) that the "good guy" guy will hopefully die in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and send letters to delete the movie from all the archives in the world ,
