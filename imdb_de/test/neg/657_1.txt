By the standards of Hollywood, this film was filmed and edited like Hollywood movies, and therefore looked like a movie you would get from a major Hollywood production studio. Everything that is close to Hollywood standards ends here. This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! I am not joking. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I could not suppress my laughter in the movies during the movie. I know what you say: "It's a horror movie, it's not supposed to have a good story, it's supposed to scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the movie is not scary at all. It's too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little tension that existed. The acting was as terrible as the murderer's weirdness, constantly seen through flashbacks locked in a cage. Throughout the film, I have always felt that I was watching something developed, written, produced, and directed by a high school that watches too much pornography. Please do not watch this movie, spend your $ 8.50 on other things like a snow cone, which is more worthwhile.
