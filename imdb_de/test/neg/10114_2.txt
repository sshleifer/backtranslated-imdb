It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it's completely lost when Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad storytelling get mixed up. The plot, as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It was supposed to be a fairly straightforward story of hunters / hunters, but the director and / or the writer seem to have forgotten what the movie was supposed to be when they shot for about three days. The fact that the main villain looks like he wears a cheap Darth Maul mask that she tries to disguise with flowing CG colors does not help. Not much to recommend, even the title seems to drive him into the dark.
