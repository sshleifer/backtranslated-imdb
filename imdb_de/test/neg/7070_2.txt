I was invited to see this movie in a small art museum. I had no idea what to expect. At first I was optimistic when I saw Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle listed. After a few very disturbing run-down scenes (which did not help much in the story's progress), the movie quickly became a weapon of torture. The gimmick of the indestructible growing arm shop is never really developed. I waited patiently for this movie to come true. In the end, there was a small payback, but investing and tasting the endless crude, sexually perverted, screaming, screaming, inglorious, inglorious Gore cost me too much (even for a free visit). What did these established actors do in this horrible movie? The art direction was very convincing and scary. At least it should only be a 75-minute movie. This is a movie that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would hug.
