Beats me how people can describe this youthful exercise as a film noir. True, there's a gun and a bottle and a lady and the main role is a private eye, but that does not matter the genre, folks. This thing plays like rehashed TV cops - lots of bloody beating and lousy continuity - with a dash of Chinatown memories. You want a contemporary feel, look at everything from John Dahl.
