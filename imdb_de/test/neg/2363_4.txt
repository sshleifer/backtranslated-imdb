Every blaxploiation fan will now recognize the ingredients: big afros, topless babes, unreal bad fashion and a bit of "jive" discussion. In this case, add a lead that can not act, an action that makes little sense. It is edited by someone without hands, who has blindfolded, and the most terrible fight scenes, and you have 'TNT Jackson'. Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad. This is a wonderful mess from start to finish. I especially loved the endless continuity mistakes and the white stunt double the lead. <br /> <br /> This is how the Far Eastern martial arts of the 70s hit black power, that it hurts, but boy hurts so much! I'm ashamed to admit that I almost enjoyed it.
