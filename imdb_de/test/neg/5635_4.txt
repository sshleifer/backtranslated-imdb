The fact that this film was distributed free of charge to a particular national newspaper that I do not like has, to some extent, kept me from looking at it, but since I came across a copy that a local charity shop gave away for free I had the feeling that I could see it with a clear conscience. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, the evocation of the situation at Thameside is well done, but it suffers from a few too many mistakes. First, Vinnie Jones simply does not convince as a journalist. While Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he just does not have the acting skills to play such a role. Second, who would carry around a lost manuscript? You were informed, is "priceless"? It seemed that Mr. Jones was taking this manuscript everywhere! Third, the whole Dickens aspect of the story, though considered important, stands in the way of what might have been an interesting movie about higher-level corruption. Maybe I'm just a bit fat, but I really could not see the meaning of the story-in-a-story Dickens style. This did not add anything to the film and only confused things as things became interesting within modern history. <br /> <br /> The only praise I give to the filmmakers is that they are at least trying something different. I'm all for British independent films trying to be "out of left field" but this is not a "red road" or "this is England". What it is is a bit chaotic and too long. Yes, it is sometimes entertaining, but in the end it felt like two films merging into one, both failing. (Besides, I can not help but think I saw something similar recently made by Ian Banks on TV with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
