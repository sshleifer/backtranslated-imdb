I've mainly given this movie a 2 because it actually has an ok cast, but the movie itself is just like that (insert an unusually rude word that starts with the sixth letter of the alphabet) It was the lowest vote of a three , <br /> <br /> Very predictable storyline. Two nare-do-well musicians have no money and many money problems. However, when a friend leaves a bag full of money (which belongs to drug dealers) in his care, he of course gives it out and then the "fun" begins. <br /> <br /> No original idea in this whole movie.
