I kept asking myself that when I saw this movie. I mean, the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the film that gave the adult industry its genre was the lack of plot. Actually, I just wanted to get up and walk throughout the movie, but I insisted. I insisted on hoping that the action might improve and that in the end it could be a good turn. But I could not have been wrong. In the end I persisted because I thought I could write a bad review after watching. <br /> <br /> I do not get it wrong, there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director only shows that, along with a crappy story, he thinks that's what the viewer sees wants, then it is offending us all. To think that we are all so shallow to want to see only burlesque of representatives, big players of the film industry are absurd. My advice: rent another movie.
