The attraction of this film must be the artistic Eurostyle, because there is absolutely no substance. There are a lot of things happening that seem to go somewhere ... but it will never get there. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to make a whole ten lines of comment because this movie is a completely empty experience. There are many beautiful photos of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, a few flashes that could be considered surrealistic humor, and a weak, existential ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you enjoy the scary mood, there is a bit of stupidity with bouncing heads or zombie sex. In order not to scream from boredom, one engages in the minimal action - and it breaks down into ridiculous illogic. It's like someone took several half-frozen B-movies and dumped them in a blender. <br /> <br /> What comes out is mostly a movie * about * insignificance - and * not * a good one. It will clearly impress this category of arthouse fans who consider emptiness as indistinguishable from the depths. Everyone else should stay away from this bleak mess.
