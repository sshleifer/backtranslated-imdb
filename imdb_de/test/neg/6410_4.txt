** from **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 23 is equal to my deceased grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 Minutes after the 23rd hour. Assign the number in any way and be very scared. Be extremely anxious when throwing a brain dead mutt at 23, and you have Schumacher's recent attempt at a dark suspense party with The Number 23. Oh yeah, 23 is also my record in Cuervo recordings on my favorite dive 23rd Street on the 23rd . Federal State of the Union. <br /> <br /> Carrey halfway through the movie, then we lose sight of him without caring. Do not look for crazy expressions coming from Comedian Carrey, as you saw in The Mask and Me, Myself, and Irene. And do not expect any personification of a character like Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar development for Jimbo. Where is the Riddler when you need him! I know, we do not need him. As usual, Virginia Madsen is rarely used as a supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. Her talent is suppressed like that of Carreys, and it's almost painful to see her trying to save her underdeveloped character from near anonymity. <br /> <br /> To borrow credit when due, there are some interesting scenes in The Number 23 showing some very sophisticated cinematography. They arrest enough alone without getting confused in the incoherent narrative of this stupid story. I do not know about you (and I realize that this is a work of absolute fiction), but I do not know anybody who often reads his novel in a damp, dark basement or spends his time regularly in cemeteries like this Carrey is doing in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood red and dark and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and humid and over and over and over again from start to finish. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a bit more light, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and vampires in their teens! <br /> <br /> If you feel like watching this movie, even if it's out of sheer curiosity ... make sure you do so while you enjoy about 23 naps, so you have 23 flies with you can hit a flap.
