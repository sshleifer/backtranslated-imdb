To identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Quite simply, because it robs you of life. <br /> <br /> Vampire effect is an insult to movie lovers. The plot is almost non-existent. The make-up is just awful. And acting is just not there. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owes someone a big favor to be convinced to appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> Film in the rental business, because it featured a picture of Jackie Chan on the front (as if starring in it) and thought a good JC movie would be fun. This movie was interesting in the same way that you can not help driving when you drive by. You quickly realize that the movie will not get better, but you keep wondering how bad it will be.
