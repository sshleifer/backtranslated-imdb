This feels very stilted and highly patronizing. The whole conspiracy is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" efforts to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially from the main actress) tolerate a few moments that help alleviate boredom and dancing is fun (especially for supposed amateurs - ha, ha!). <br /> <br /> The shopkeeper and the young man who makes spectacular tap dances were special highlights. I also liked the impressions of Peter Hayes by Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
