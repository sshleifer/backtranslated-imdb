This show can best be described as a TV Bubble Gum: it chews, has a good taste and lasts a long time. But like bubble gum, it can leave a bad taste in the mouth after a few too many chewing. <br /> <br /> This show asks very simple questions that take the form of simple games, such as: Hangman simple phrase or guess items on a short list. Callers are the participants, and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> But the questions are very simple. There is some techno music that is pumped into the background and formed into an infinite loop. It never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show anyway. However, the hostess, regardless of the subject, is extremely personal, pleasant enough to look at her and can make some very amusing facial expressions. I prefer the Briton. <br /> <br /> But there is nothing in this show. It is simple and unobtrusive, although it can be entertaining when absolutely nothing else is going on.
