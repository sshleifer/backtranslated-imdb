At least for the past ten years, I can not remember a movie I liked less than Mama Mia. From non-existent acting to disgusting vocals, I cringed at least once a minute. I do not think I could remember a short section I tolerated. I know that I will never see this disaster again. I can not believe that a movie with such high expectations - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan - could be a flop. But to see how little acting skills are shown, the seemingly drugged dancing and then the horror of horror, to hear the singing of Pierce Brosnan (!), I can not see how this film does not go to the Hall of the Shame will come. Definitely a movie that should never have been made, and in case you missed it the first time, one that I'll never see again.
