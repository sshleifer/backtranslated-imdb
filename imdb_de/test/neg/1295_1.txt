Avoid this movie. If you count on "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you may experience nothing but a case of "curves". This movie offers no more than two extremely long and tedious hours of boredom. <br /> <br /> The performers behave as if they were insignificant over the irritation of a flooded bathtub in a bed upset by petunias. The script is totally unrealistic and the movie does not even feel like a catastrophe movie. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, except for Tom Courtenay. It is unfortunate that such a good actor was swept along by a flood of false representation to appear in such a washout. When this movie was filmed, the Poseidon must have turned in his water grave in a sea of ​​shame. And Shelley Winters will be resurrected from the dead (direct from the Poseidon) and persecute anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie. I rate this movie 1 in 10, but it really deserves a zero. This film will make you avoid water or turn completely against water. And it will leave a bad taste in the mouth. You may even want to see "Jaws" (1975) and make friends with a big white guy.
