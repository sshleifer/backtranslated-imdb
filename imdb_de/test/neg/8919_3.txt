Today You begins as Honorable Criminal Harlan Banks (Producer Steven Seagal) hired by sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a $ 20,000,000 cash vehicle in the back 'sounds simple, or ? Well, Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money was being stolen and that he had just become an escapee to an armed robbery. Crap. Harlan gets even worse when the local cops catch him and put him in jail for a long time, but Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught. With $ 20 million in use Harlan is his back as inattentive towards the crooks want it as well as government agents. Harlan collaborates with Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in jail and both manage to escape. Harlan seeks revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photographed and directed by Don E FauntLeRoy, one must say that the shots that Steven Seagal has filmed on Eastern Europe these days are not getting any better and Today You Die is a good one Example is. This is a horrible movie, really that easy. The screenplay by producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagal a new kind of character to convey his non-existent acting skills, that of a criminal rather than a government agent / cops / soldiers / one-man clich√© he normally plays. If you were charitable, you might say that Today You Die is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's outstanding thriller Payback (1998), in which he also played a really ugly piece with such good impact. While Payback was a great, uncompromising action-thriller with hard edges, Today You Die misses nothing and is compared to insignificance. Unfortunately Seagal is terrible here, he has no presence or threat on screen and the audience is never quite sure if he should be a bad guy we hate or not. For example, his character is initially built up like a modern Robin Hood as he steals from the rich drug traffickers and bastards to give them to the poor (as well as making a decent profit for themselves), which is ridiculous in itself but then he Seagal turns around and murders a lot of people, which contradicts the sympathetic criminal with the morality that the film has done so much that it was even staged. The story is full of holes, for example, Agent Knowles is contacted by Harlan on the run and then reprimanded by her satisfied supervisor for having met him. It turns out he found out he touched her phone. Why did not her boss use the information he needed to catch Harlan? The story is the usual boring, predictable, boring fight for a lot of money with surprise. The investigating government agent is actually a villain! Wow, I did not hear that, I have to say ... <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snail's pace & Today You feels like it's going on forever, the action scenes & set -Pieces also lack the entertainment value strong. The rare fight scenes are not great, most are either shot in the shadows, cut and edited very quickly, or played with the camera behind Seagal's character to try to ignore the fact that most of the stunt work done here is a double , Again Seagal sees fat and out of shape and uses long, baggy coats to try it out, but not. At the beginning there is a pretty cool chase through the streets of Las Vegas. I thought Today You Die might be fine, but it seems like the whole sequence was stolen from another action movie titled Top of the World (1997) A Las Vegas casino robbery as well as the use of footage from this movie Today You also features scenes from the Charlie Sheen action film No Code of Conduct (1998), the Jean Claude Van Damme action film The Order (2001) & Wesley Snipe's prison-based action film Undisputed (2002), pretty much like Much of Today You The original material, anyone can suspect. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fine, considering it's been cut from four separate films. Their own material is just about competent and consistent enough. The entire footage of the US locations is obviously removed from the already mentioned films with all the cheap original footage in Bulgaria. The music in rap style, the Today You Die falls, is the way terrible. Acting is bad and Seagal murmurs as usual through his lines. <br /> <br /> Today You Die is a really bad movie from other bad action movies. Seagal looks old and fat, the action scenes are old On average at best & most of the story is rather random and does not come off so well in the end. One to avoid, unless you are a die-hard Seagal fan if such an animal even exists ...
