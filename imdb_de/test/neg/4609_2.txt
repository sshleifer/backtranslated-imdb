Be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story with "over sexed jocks". There is nothing redeeming about Carrie 2. The plot is absurd, the spectacle terrible and the end all too predictable. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a masterpiece, but I expected to be entertained. I was not able to rationalize the film that way because I was with a relative while I waited for my car to be repaired. If not in the same emergency, stay away from this movie.
