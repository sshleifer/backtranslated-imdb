I think this is one of my ten worst movies I have ever seen! It is hidden like every two minutes. If this was on TV, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But there is a sight that I personally enjoyed: When the blonde takes a bath with a man in a boiling water pit, they see their whole body for about 10 seconds without a towel! That was the best scene in the whole movie because you see Sasquatch staring at her, but the last 10 minutes are when we see his whole body. Also, most deaths are not on the screen and just the scream or the roar. And I expected the Sasquatch to die. But he did not shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole movie, which I expected to kill 8-10 people. Do not look at this movie. I give an F-. Do not waste your time.
