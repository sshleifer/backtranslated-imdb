There was a time when Joel Schumacher was on top of my list of favorite directors. In the late '80s and early' 90s, when his name belonged to some of the big movies like The Lost Boys, Flatliners and Falling Down, he was truly one of Hollywood's most talented directors. Then, unfortunately, came the stupid "Batman" continuations, and then it seemed as if every potentially sublime script turned into a huge mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have provided much better movies, and even the incredibly idiotic concept of "The Number 23" was supposed to become a more compelling and entertaining film. Literally from beginning to end, "The Number 23" desperately tries to be a mysterious and sinister thriller, and therefore uses all the awful clich√©s of the great book of cinematic history, including heavy-voiced stories, flashbacks, disorderly structure, characters with multiple personalities, numerous conspiracies that are becoming more and more absurd and sinister. But nothing helps only because of the sheer stupidity of the basic recipe and the apparently uninspired commitment of Cast & Crew. Even if you try to connect with the main character and be open-minded about the crazy theories, this still remains a film about a two-digit number and double-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare, not-so-funny role) is a bored animal rapper whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. The book tells of all sorts of diabolical theories and strange coincidences, which are linked with the number 23. Walter identifies almost immediately with the protagonist of the book (a sloppy detective who investigates a serious case of suicide) and begins to discover abundant examples of the 23-puzzle in his private life. I've done some research on Google and Wikipedia, and apparently all this nonsense in numerology really exists, and some people honestly believe that most disasters and accidents are directly related to this nasty number. Well, that's just ?? insane! But hey, I'm not here to judge the beliefs and fears of people, no matter how crazy they are, and I can only share my modest opinion on a movie based on a thoroughly puzzling puzzle. "The Number 23" is not exciting, despite some gritty set pieces and disgusting make-up effects, and you never ever get to worry about the role of numbers in your own life. All performers are below their normal abilities, but it was still a pleasure to see the beautiful Mrs. Virginia Madsen in a relatively large production. Definitely not recommended if you are looking for a solid and scary evening with thrill fun, but bearable and not without merit.
