You are watching a movie titled "battlespace". What will you think? Space battles with cool explosions and all shoot each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get some space battle, but for most of the time it's just stupid people walking around doing almost nothing. NO TALKS !!!! What's that nonsense ?! We get narrators and a lot of British computers, but that's about it. The lead actress must be the worst I've ever seen, because she does not even have a dialogue and saunter through scenes (literary!). Some of the things that happen are just stupid, as if they were using a rocket (such as space) for transport on the planet side. Why not just use one of these chic spaceships? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with a few boring, boring, lifeless samples, but the main thing you'll notice is the Atari sound effects the ships use ... you have to kidnap me. I can also say that the budget was low, because everything looks wrong, what you do not expect from a movie, especially what a super cool space combat movie should be. I seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits, it's so bad you make more laughs than you should if it's that easy. I start to believe that they paid the actors after their dialogue because they are very little here (if you can not say that, that's my main problem here, as I've probably said that three times before).
