Elfriede Jelinek, not yet a well-known name, is a laureate of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her novel produced a film that won Cannes second prize and top prizes for male and female lead roles. Am I a dinosaur in terms of aesthetic appreciation or is art so depressed that anything is possible? <br /> <br /> "Gobble up, gobble up" is the preferred orthographic representation of the seething sound of a turkey in the UK. In the film world, a turkey is a monumental flop, measured by the cash receipts or the critical receipt. 'Gobble, Gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing fear of this much-lauded movie can not be overstated. It starts very badly, as if it annoyed the viewer. Credits interrupt unimportant scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the excellent author, a stony piano professor. She lives with her hoarse and domineering mother. Daddy is an institutionalized madman who dies unseen during what goes through the action. <br/> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult to register beyond its inconvenience. What we see in the movie (and read in the book, what I know) is a shabby, exploitative, nonsensical story of an emotional pendulum that swings back and forth without moving. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is used minimally, is first shown as a person of intense musical sensitivity, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not quite, because there is a handbag in two steps, in which your Scottish-minded Maman is at an early stage, which ends with plentiful apologies. If a reviewer needs to yawn (why not use a presumptuous word, if a simpler word would do so), Elrikas would have a fiercely alternating mood. <br /> <br /> A young guy, Walter, who studies to become a "low voltage engineer", whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few recreational moments is also a talented pianist. He meets Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in Paris. In the smooth fashion of so much art, he instantly falls in love and begins 'cherchez la femme'. <br /> <br /> Repressed Erika has a penchant for hardcore pornography, which she briefly but graphically shows for a few seconds sniffs a handkerchief from the trash in the private booth in which she is watching. Walter performs a brilliant audition and is reluctantly accepted by Erika as a private student whose teaching style is characterized by seclusion and hostility. Discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declares his love and soon follows Erika into the ladies, where they are dealing with light, hanky voluptuous and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control of her lovesickness. She promises to send him a briefing letter for more pleasant conversations. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, because of the kindness of Walter's on a nervous student who literally has the shit of a rehearsal for a future concert, Jealous Erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing the sensitive piano-playing hands to fierce get injured. The next big scene (circumvention of genital self-mutilation, etc.) shows Walter The apartment that shares Erika with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied up, beaten, etc. The sensible Walter is beaten back at the moment and marches into the night. <br /> <br /> There is almost an hour left at this point. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika goes to the ice rink Walter, where he does his ice hockey training. They retreat to a back room. Lusty Wally can not resist the hands pulling on his pants. His "baby sauce" will soon be sold with other stomach contents. Ho hum. Repulsed, but addicted to revenge for the insult that had recently fallen to the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you imagine what happens now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a thug while Erika becomes a victim. In one moment he locks Maman in her room and beats Erika, the next he kicks her in the face, has sex with her and renews his declarations of love. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you like, but I would advise you not to. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand when in the right mood. I could explain the ambitious portrayal of interpersonal relationships that this film conveys if I wanted. But I prefer not to do it, because this is a cheap and bad movie that addresses instincts and says nothing. I should say that the paralyzed Erika longs for love and seeks her unsuccessfully. In pornography, it disapproves inappropriately when it literally appears pink and throbbing in front of her nose and later realizes that she does not like being hurt, blah , blah, blah. The world has not explained it for reasons stunted them. She seems to make a monster out of somebody who seemed superficially affectionate - but we all know that every man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature as much as he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br /> If you end up having the patience to be there, there is a small twist. Before she goes into the final scene, in which she is to appear with her torn hands as a substitute for the underwear-stained student, Erika grabs a knife into her handbag. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. She stabs herself in a non-life-threatening area and leaves. Credits. <br /> <br /> If this had earned the second prize in Cannes, how bad were the remaining contributions?
