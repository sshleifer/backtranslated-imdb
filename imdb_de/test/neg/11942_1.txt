I remember that Michael Douglas wanted to have his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, in a romantic movie because he thought his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does that, but NOT in this movie. A colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. This was not the vehicle we all hoped would make this movie boring and a huge disappointment. I have not even seen the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was evidently trained to work on a kitchen, to move, to present a dish, but this was not a food network, nothing was learned here, and when her counterpart emerged, it was able to brew a romantic interest. The poor bitch on the second floor of her building tried to combine all the tricks and not develop. The loss of her sister was played badly, because who knew that there was a closeness. The sister's daughter was just dumped here and there with something to wear, NOT. Just a waste of movie time. The organizers have certainly done their job to present this dull glow in all networks that seduce you with all sorts of teasers. I'm sorry to say, do not spend a dime.
