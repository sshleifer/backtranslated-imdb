This movie is one of the worst adjustments of pride and prejudice ever made. If Jane Austen was alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is superficially a story about the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story and thus disappoint the audience, who hoped that the novel would do justice to the novel. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance in which Darcy Elizabeth smiles is not the refined dance that the gentry, which includes the families Bennet, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy, performs, but rather the dance of the lower classes. The gentry would not have danced like he was in a farmhouse dance. There are also costume and hair problems. The custom of that time required married women to wear white headgear to cover their hair and women who wore caps outdoors. Women of the Regency era were not so free that they could do without the bonnet requirements in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (no tie and waistcoat) admitting each other's love. This is an unforgivable freedom with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman ventured out of the house in such a state of undress or tried to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. <br /> <br /> But the worst part of this movie is the maiming of Austen's dialogue and the gruesome modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no support from a writer who believes he / she can write like Austen. The author of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent, he also has no sense of Austen's style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is staggering. <br /> <br /> As far as the drama is concerned, the best of Judi Dench is made, who clearly understands the superiority of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties to make Mrs. Bennet less terrible than Austen's portrayal. Your presentation is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is miscast. His British accent is terrible, and he portrays Mr. Bennet as the father of the twentieth century, not father of the late eighteenth century. Matthew MacFadeyn's Darcy representation is flat. I can not imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a pretty Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is way too modern. Knightly focuses on the openness of Elisabeth, but her portrayal lacks an understanding of the social customs and conventions of the time. She would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and investigating the behavior of women at the time. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a period film, you have to be loyal to that period. This film needed a historical adviser who actually knows about the Regency era. It also needed a writer who understands and understands Austen's text better. I can only hope that Emma Thompson decides to shoot a movie about pride and prejudice in the near future to remove this atrocity from our thoughts. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can say about this movie is that it contains many beautiful scenes of the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as in the BBC adaptation of 1995). But beautiful landscapes and actors can not save this movie. Real Austen fans will hurry home to watch their DVDs of 1995's far superior BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, or read Austen's text to erase that version from their minds.
