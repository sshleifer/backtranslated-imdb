That's awful. No, really, that's absolutely not the worst thing ... the worst ... I even hesitate to call it @ @movie_ as @ & $%. It's a ninety-minute visual root canal. The plot is virtually nonexistent: a mad scientist who looks like the frontman of 'The Cars' impregnates a woman in his secret lab, a lawn chair into what I believe was a garage, by an injection of Palmolive. Within hours, she brings forth a full-grown monster, which is then on the run. That's the whole movie. The death scenes: these are poorly decorated, take _forever_ and acting ... how can you mess _screaming_? The victims stand there while the growling, gasping, stuffy freak imagines them and strangles them for about three days. The sets are kitschy, the lighting for most of the movie consists of a single Maglite (yes, a big honkin flashlight), the sound quality is poor, there are only about 40 dialogue words for the entire movie and the drama is generously described as wooden. The footage is shamelessly recycled to fill the film. And the special effects made every BBC sci-fi production shake its head and announce, "They have not even tried it." The 'Monster' is nameless in a $ 3 Halloween rubber mask with some bandages being struck. In his encounter with the only cop in the film, the cop shoots flashless, smokeless, invisible bullets that seemingly fly so slowly that the monster can dodge them in five steps. Do not see this movie No, this is not a risk. Do not see this movie The director should be shot. The writer should be chained to a huge rock where Ed Wood will eat his liver every morning. Enough rented and there could be a sequel, do not let it happen!
