What would not I do to rewrite this movie? Disappointing due to the great beginning, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates to a superstitious bull halfway through the game and ends up with a message that is so ridiculous, spirited and melodramatic. The film had many advantages, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so tangible that I thought the screen was sparking, a great soundtrack, and beautiful locations. Instead of ending up with the hardened religious hocus-pocus, the film should have focused on being a frothy road movie that may contain a few undertones about fate and superstition compared to logic. I understand the director's whole intention with the movie was to do it with religion, but the fact is that it just did not work and he threw away so much great stuff right from the start.
