A stupid teen who's supposed to be a comedy that causes a serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) a hooker having a foreign exchange student, a girlfriend who loves a woman who loves a gay guy, and a straight guy, she loves, and bitchy gossips. None of the following is funny or even amusing. Nation Lampoon used to be funny earlier in the day. Now the name is unfortunately synonymous for crap. And that is NOT an exception. I always think that Topenga was kind of cute when she was on "Boy Meets World", but it seems like she's going to let herself go (and yes, I know she has a name, but anything that pays off) she stays topenga.) <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann becomes topless; Boti Bliss bets on a body double (BOOOOO !!!)
