The TV show was moving slowly and the 'offbeat' characters sometimes irritated. Only through the miracle of fast forward could I get through the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The letter shows that it is a kind of comedy / puzzle, but I have not seen much of it. <br /> <br /> If it really works after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt if I'll see the rest without a recommendation. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler way. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. I wondered, 'would a normal adult do that?' The man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetic. Would a normal adult endure someone as irritating as he?
