"El Chupacabra," one of York Entertainment's newest (disastrous) films, is characterized by the viewer's desire to die after spending two hours on it. This film was apparently filmed with a replacement camcorder, which is usually used for birthday parties. The only reason I found that this was not the case was because of certain scenes in which the shadow of the cameraman is in the picture. <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of cinema is plagued by this movie, and I'm sure it put the film industry back for another ten years. The performers are left behind at the border and often pause while waiting for the cue card to change off-screen. The actor, who plays Navarro, not only lurks in his dialogues, but stumbles through the line of Swiss cheese dairy with a narrowed look and a confused expression. Other actors break the fourth wall and show the overall acting abilities of a twelve-year-old child doing a science project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I purposely seek out the worst possible movies gave us more than we expected. The humorous parts are not funny and the rest is riddled with horrible stereotypes and potholes. As a friend humbly puts it, this movie is the broken fetus of the industry. I would highly recommend this movie for people like me who are intentionally looking for these movies, but be careful for everyone else!
