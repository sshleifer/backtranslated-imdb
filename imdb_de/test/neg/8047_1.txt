... a film that is absolutely terrible from the first title to the studio logo at the end of the credits. This was such a movie - the guy you can not stop looking out of fear of missing a moment of its ever-decreasing quality. <br /> <br /> Forget about the low budget that results from a slow, monotonous opening sequence of secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcade, without crowds, traffic or location. Forget about the confused logic required to make the plot even remotely plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider delivers some of the most vicious dialogues without hiding his shame. <br /> <br /> This clunker is terribly fast-paced, bombarded by a score that is just ridiculous and seems to be being edited by a third student. All the while, the scenarios twisted to cover up the hardest thing about filming presidential history cheaply: he made him appear as presidency. <br /> <br /> I slept genuinely short in the last roll, and when I woke up, I ran away from it, not to miss a single agonizing frame. Try this drinking game: Take a shot each time you see another, much better movie. You will also nod. <br /> <br /> I have not seen such a wonderfully unsolvable project since 'The Man' starring Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy. I can issue copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars Thousands of laughs.
