Apparently in early 2005, SciFi Channel threatened to publish the offensive photos of John Rhys-Davies, saying, "We need you to play in another SciFi original." The scary thing is that he's damn good in this movie. That really says something, because this is a silly sci-fi creator; You have to have a feeling for being played well. Unfortunately nobody else does that. It's your stereotypical rampage on a cruise ship. The Crypto-Zoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the Navy SEALs believe they are in control, but they do not know what they're dealing with and they're all dead. A girl jumps as Rhys Davies' daughter and the creature about 100 shipmates. What this movie promises is very fast and lively; They never get bored or wait for another kill. Otherwise, it does not differ by itself, and it's stupid that this thing crawls over the ceiling and can not be wounded by Navy SEAL machine guns but is kicked by Kara's Rhys-Davies' daughter. For a while I went back and forth to give this bad boy a 5, but for the above stupidity I give him a 4.
