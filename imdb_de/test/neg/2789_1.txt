According to the budget information on this website, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where this money was spent, I do not know exactly. Let me see .... costumes ... no ... place and sets ... hmmm, do not think ... special f / x ... NOT ... acting classes ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend persuades him to take her friends to check the place. Once there, our intrepid hero learns that his great-grandfather used a unique method to grow his crop, and now it's time for revenge. Killer scarecrows for revenge !!! Ewww scary. No not true. We all know there were some great movies made with very little money, but this is not one of them. This movie contains pretty much the worst drama and dialogues I've ever seen. Terrible stereotypes with terrible delivery. All in all, do not be fooled by the reasonably decent coverage and avoid at all costs. I'd like to give the filmmakers at least a D to try, but I'm afraid they did not even do a good job with it. GRADE: F
