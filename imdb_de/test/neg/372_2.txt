I managed to get into "Steel Frontier" for about 8 minutes before turning it off. Then, a lot of time for the punishment that I am, I looked a little bit more the next day. Today I had to iron a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the film and that was his own punishment. I do not understand the following: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $ 7,000 on their debut features and developed two notable films. But here we have two directors with significantly more money, and they throw up a huge, steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: "It's 'Road Warrior', but it's like a future Western. We'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we'll get that from our mentally challenged cousin Write a script and we spend the budget on a series of explosions, we can not lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I do not think even the MST3K guys could improve that. But if you insist on seeing it, I recommend getting very drunk first.
