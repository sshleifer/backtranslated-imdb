After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), who works in the Middle East, is instructed by his superior in Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to oversee a "safe house" in Amman, and he works with the security chief in Jordan together, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not announce the entire operation to Hani and fails Ed. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and he approaches her family. When Roger plans another program to catch Al-Saleem as the decoy with the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as a decoy to lure Al-Saleem, he threatens not only the safety of Sadiki, but also the kidnapped Aisha. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and suggests saving himself to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnic tour of Europe and the Middle East despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb user review shows that there are many viewers who like this kind of fast-paced espionage film with cutting-edge technology, satellites and any respect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil, which leaves no time for reflection. but that is not my case. It's boring and ridiculous to see the fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone like a family man, while his partner in a dangerous operation risks his life. The rich character of Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed, and I think this great actor is a failure due to his biotype in the Middle East. But the movie never explains its ties to the Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris is also very stupid and hackneyed. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of lies")
