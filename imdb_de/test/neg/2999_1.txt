Usually, I'm the one who criticizes the Twenty Something Neanderthals because they can not appreciate a movie unless it has plastic hits, shootouts, and car chases. In this case, however, the film could actually have been improved by some of these additives. At least I would not get bored after an hour and have changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I do not mind being surreal, and of course I do not mind paying attention to finding subtlety or hidden meaning, but the whole thing should have a point. I did not feel that even the author or director really did have a far-reaching vision of anything, but instead was so absorbed in themselves that they had their own presumptuous visions that they were purposely dispelled. Or maybe they just confused themselves. Either way, I do not care. It bored the crap for a good hour without saving grace. <br /> <br /> Although a whole host of other viewers have filled this site with excited enthusiasm about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, I respectfully disagree. Maybe I did not take enough film lessons to appreciate some inspired techniques that are invisible to mortals ... <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie was just crap. <br /> <br /> I give a "1" and place it next to "Ishtar".
