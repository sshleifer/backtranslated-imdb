I am very diplomatic in my critiques, and as an academic writer I try to give a creative license to television writers trying to explain a true story. This story about Karen Carpenter could have helped so many, but not because of the direction and editing. <br /> <br /> History is not fully addressed in this case unless you are reading psychological magazines. While Cynthia Gibb is a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been worked on ... Louise Fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I acknowledge the actors for having survived this project. <br /> <br /> Why should the audience not see causality factors? ... The American audience is quite adept, and if there are usually cables formed. <br /> <br /> I have the honest feeling that I could have written a better story, had not cut out the truth and allowed the actors to project the reality. Richard Carpenter as a director has seriously underestimated and offended the American public. Karen's story is important and it is sad that we will never hear her.
