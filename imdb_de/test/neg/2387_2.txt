If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, BEWARE !! The cover has Tori Wells and three other "80s" pornstars and has a 1986 copyright. If you're like me (and I hope you are not), you'll think "80s Porn? Tori Wells? Okay!" Trickery !! It was made in 1974 and was called German stars. Nothing is inherently wrong with 70s German porn, but it's not my thing and it's not what the cover makes you believe. After overcoming my anger at the obviously misleading jacket, I looked at her anyway. It's a bad, bad movie. Sorry, I guess I did not really get angry.
