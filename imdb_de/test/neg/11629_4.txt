Let's clarify things. I was a Catholic and grew up in a very religious family, spending just as much time in the church and talking to priests like at home. It was useful for two purposes: making me a convinced atheist and giving me a deep, insightful knowledge of the church and its dogmas. And I say: If a Catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the murderer's face, he CAN report it to the police, even if the killer has confessed him. He can not disclose what he said in a confession, but he can talk about everything he sees outside, and a confession is useless to shut up. So here we have a movie based entirely on a lie. And another lie is that there is no murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is absolution for every sin as long as there is sincere repentance. So far, the biggest plotting holes in this weak thriller. <br /> <br /> As people often say, this film would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had changed roles. Hoskins is a natural gangster (I'll never complain enough about losing Al Capone to one of De Niro's weakest appearances in "The Untouchables") and Bates's qualities would have been perfect as a priest with a gray past. In addition, I believe the film would have been much better if the real Ulster native Liam Neeson (then largely unknown to a larger audience) would have played the role of Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing tortured characters, but he would make us believe the character is real, something Rourke just can not. In the 80's Rourke was not a bad actor (later he seemed to lose his talent and his looks), but he was one of those performers, like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director he works with. As a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's acting seems more like a pimp. Sad to think that this film was filmed only three to six years later (when Neeson achieved a moderate celebrity status with Sam Raimi's delightful "Darkman" in 1990 and was a superstar in 1993 with "Schindler's List" while Rourke became quite a bit Liam and Mickey would have been able to change the parts with greater benefit (Rourke would have been cast in the supporting role of Docherty, but can not take this film as a lead role) .Another missed opportunity and another movie with the potential to become a classic became instant Ironically, the often-criticized score (by the underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me, and I did not find it overly melodramatic, but appropriately grainy and beautiful, reminding me of howard shores Score for "The Silence of the Lambs." Here's Mike Hodges' talent, who has done "Get Carter," yes, but do not forget that he Also the thought leader behind "Flash Gordon" is ... <br /> <br /> It seems like the movie was massacred in the movie cutting room (it shows how some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just do not stick ) and a Director's Cut waits to see the light. OK, but I seriously doubt it will turn out to be a great movie as we will still have the bad casting and the wrong premise. 10.4.
