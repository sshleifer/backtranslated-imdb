This may sound funny, but I was only able to watch the first movie (The Emperor's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago, just for an episode of the TV series. I just love Kuzco's character, but Kronk is not that bad either. Anyway, I finally decided to watch the second movie just to see it. I hope it's as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say that, but the more the humor became American, the more I yawned. I agreed with Kuzco when he started to cry, to see all the cheesy footage. <br /> <br /> Even so, younger kids and probably veterans will love this movie a bit (if they like the old school that praises Disney) I just had expectations that were a weird little bit higher than they were actually should have been. Kronk is a lovely character, kind and dumb at the same time, but it was Pacha and Kuzco on the train who woke me up at the end of the movie. (I'll ignore Rudy ... as far as possible.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie, just not my style, and as you say, you have to stay true to your groove forever.
