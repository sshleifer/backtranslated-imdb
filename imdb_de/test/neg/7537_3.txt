Two teens in northeast England are determined to raise money and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "weird mishaps," but in the end they smile. <br /> <br /> The trailer for this film sells him as a comedy and contains most of his carefree moments. However, the sound becomes increasingly gloomy and the end result is a depressing story populated with familiar stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problems with lies, fraud and theft. Their adversaries are a callous teacher, a dumb slayer of a father, a psychotic skinhead, and a well-meaning but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are a drug addicted teenager, a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered woman who apparently smokes to death. There are no sympathetic characters, and the audience can only feel pity or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley both play as villains against the guy, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have nothing more than a novelty value. Chris Beattie and Greg McLane perform well in the two young leads. But they are wrong because they have the wrong accent. For anyone from the Northeast, it is obvious that both are from the Sunderland / Durham area. Nevertheless, they are expected to come from Newcastle. As Geordie I can assure you that the accents are by no means the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor fellow speak." We say "let the pooa boy speek" while saying "piwer lad spyk" with two distinctly different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous twofold irony in a scene in Sunderland, where the two boys try to disguise the Newcastle accents they do not have and * pretend to come from Sunderland - which they clearly do. In a gentle comedy, this kind of criticism can be considered nicks-picking. The dark tone of the film makes it clear, however, that writer / director Mark Herman strives for realistic realism: "Close enough" is actually far away. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that the movie would have humor and optimism and instead found tired old stereotypes. Tyneside is not a gray wasteland populated only by losers. If you tell us it is, Herman should have known he would offend. It's interesting to compare the film to the same director's "Little Voice" - also largely downbeat and populated with one-dimensional characters - at least, "Little Voice" has a talented heroine and does not revel in misery to the same degree. I heard that "Belter" was ranked next to this year's "Billy Elliot", but this movie is a far more enjoyable and life-affirming experience. <br /> <br /> By the way, maybe I'm just too old, but I've lived. For 42 years on Tyneside, I have not heard anyone outside this movie use the phrase "Purely Belter".
