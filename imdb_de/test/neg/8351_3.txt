'Volcano' is, at best, a B-movie and, at worst, a catastrophe rather than what it's supposed to portray. To be fair, you have to be prepared in every film to expose the unbelief to an important concept. "Volcano" asks you to lift the belief in science, the interaction with people and common sense. Tommy Lee Jones becomes the head of the Office of Emergency Management until the 1990s. He's fine if he does not stick to the stupid dialogue the script offers. However, Anne Heche does a terribly poor job as a clever donkey geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (as the city burns down, Natch). Gaby Hoffman changes from Field of Dreams and the American president to a turnaround as a whimpering, needy and lifelong daughter of Jones. Don Cheadle is allowed to sit in a really cool office and answer Jones' phone calls. He does the work that Roark would and should do in reality. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie really starts to go downhill when Heches geology partner gets sucked into a lava view while they break into the subway lines. It picks up speed as Jones suggests they use buses to quench the flow of lava flowing down the street. Heches geologist (who loves to teach everyone about The Science Of Geology) does not seem to realize that lava is hot, metal and rock melt, and a great bus will probably not do much. It's starting to suck when the movie introduces Rodney King-like racial tension between two bad actors dressed up as cops and an angry black man who can not understand why the fire department is busy with this great river of flowing lava , But in the end, the three of them will work together to build a K-rail dam to prevent the lava in its neighborhood from being eaten, even if the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used does not stop lava anyway. Also, the K-rails are barely waterproof, but I do not think Lava would believe they'd stick their heads through the gaps, not when Tommy Lee Jones is staring at them. Do not even let me start with the stranded subway car, where a tunnel of hot lava comes down, but strangely, it's not too hot to try salvation, it's not too smoky to see, and it's not does not give any toxic gases so everyone can breathe. This must be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, it eats cars, but it's environmentally friendly. <br /> <br /> There are moments of pure camp that almost makes you wonder if this should be a comedy. For example, the two security guards who pack up Hieronymus Bosch's pictures have a completely meaningless and absurd talk about the weight, and in the end, barely has the little boy saved Roark / Jones, noticing that they all look the same when they're ashed when a rainstorm breaks out and clears up all - and then the sun comes out and Heche says something in the direction of "aw, shucks, Roark". <br /> <br /> "Volcano" has almost reached the status of Battlefield Earth, but with the exception of Heche, nobody approaches Travolta-like wickedness, and the technical aspects are pretty well handled. If you're from the LA area like me, it's kind of weird to think of a lava flow erasing Wilshire Boulevard. I gave him three for the effects and the low tension that you draw from it.
