First disconnect the story from the movie. The story of a second ongoing war in heaven is good, very good. Religious theme films are not the first choice for many people, but angels in war are. I really loved the story, and some of the pictures make sure they're supported like a field of angels on spikes ... great pictures. The actual movie was bad, I can not find a reason for the main character - the priest-policeman is even there. The main actress too ... no reason to be there, the dialogue of the main characters was simply empty, she had no substance, the story could have been told well without them. Now there were some great performances, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen spawned some wingers, though their scenes with mostly lifeless leads were Indian rituals to cleanse the dark soul. The child who wears it is clearly of American descent, but apart from the end scenario, there is nothing here in common with this legacy. The plot about the dark soul itself has barely told it, strange considering that the dark soul is the driver for the entire premise of the movie. The background story of the original owner (the Colonel) is briefly torn, but not enough to understand why his soul is the special one. <br /> <br /> I can not find any justification for the landscape shots In this film also some of the levels around 'chimney rocks'. I feel like they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it, since none of the settings has any relevance or mood -> horror. The movie falls more into the category sci-fi than horror. There were no real shock or horror scenes, a little blood and blood, but no fear element. <br /> <br /> Apart from three damn well played roles, this movie is a big old dude. Unfortunately, the dud factor outweighs the good acting factor, just too many weekend actors.
