The box for this film is completely wrong. The cover shows a view of legs and panties in a short skirt. The title is "Tart". The summary on the back of the box made it appear that Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the most popular students. However, this popularity led to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape. Everything that the box has built this movie was a terrible lie. I was expecting some kind of crappy, direct-to-video version of 'Heathers' aimed at today's teens. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what Tart really is about. Yes, that's really the story; So if you do not want to know what's going on, stop reading. We have an incredibly boring rich girl. The best friend of this unusual girl is a prostitute. The prostitute is expelled from school, making the unlikely girl befriend a British girl. The result is that the unlikely girl is from this boring guy whom the box calls "the most popular boy in the school." If this guy was the most popular guy in her school, I would have wished that I'd gone to high school because I could kick that crap out of him. As can be seen in every movie, the most popular type at school is invariably a murderer or drug addict or thief or, in this case, all of the above. Anyway, everyone disapproves of the unusual main character, because she is Jewish. Then the most popular guy in school beats his best friend, the prostitute, to death with a stone because the prostitute has caught the most famous boy in a homosexual act. The stoic mother of the unlikely girl and the hypochondriac younger brother are there for her in the end. Oh, and the whole movie is about tatty rich kids and their terrible parents. Gee, what's wrong with that? That sounds like a fantastic movie! I thought so. But you see, there are NO sympathetic characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers averaged their performance while talking about what a freak she is during the movie. The prostitute is not skanky enough and has little screen time. The popular guy is nothing to write about. The popular girls are just your usual rich girls. There are no moral teachings. Cat, the boring protagonist, is not a freak, never becomes one of the most beloved women and (at worst) after all the crap he's going through, she finds she's still too good to befriend the only cute girl crazy girls To be honest, I have no idea why the movie is called Tart. I always asked, who is the cake? Is she the cake? Are these all pies? At 94 minutes this is theoretically not a long movie. But after watching this terrible VHS cassette and not knowing who the cake was, I was surprised that the movie lasted only an hour and a half. The movie felt like it was two hours and some changes. After a while, I hoped that the movie would be about Pop Tarts. At least if you look at a box of pop-tarts, you know what to expect.
