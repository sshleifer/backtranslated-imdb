This happens when a franchise becomes lazy and nobody can imagine a new turn. Do you remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were played as horror films, with real (though predictable) horrors that remained true to the theme of the film. Then they had no more people for the doll and they decided to make them laugh, the next two being black comedies. Well, that happened here, but I think it should not be that way. A bit like saying, "I wanted to make pancakes for dessert, I did that on purpose!" If your soufflé flickers accidentally flat. But the milk had been spilled and had a certain value in the theaters. As the floor tore under the passenger seats, I somehow expected the passengers to stretch their legs through the hole. Start Flintstones style to land the plane safely in the Alps. I did. It would have been included in the stupid fight theme of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of pointing out the film's obvious physical impossibilities, what about social implausibilities? As if George Kennedy's character had reacted calmly to the news that his date was a whore? Even in 1979, a man would not simply accept the idea that he had just poured his heart out to a paid companion. He felt he had made contact with a kindred spirit who later turned out to be a mercenary sex worker with a come-on-line. Who would not feel betrayed by the experience? And yet he giggles and wrapped his arms around the waist of his friend as they run away happily. What a cheap end to a dark scene. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for soufflé and was served with bland crepe pancakes. And no, you have NOT done it on purpose!
