I know most of the other reviews say this movie was great, but I do not have to agree. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was very small. But it's just not for theater. Maybe for a short half hour, but I do not see how they can make a whole movie out of a little children's book. <br /> <br /> It's a cute movie, but I would only recommend it really small kids. Older children are not interested. Adults may be more interested in watching their boys. But everyone at the age of 7 years will have a snore party. Sorry, if you disagree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
