Usually I do not consider a move as boring. I'm not particularly interested in action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact, I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and a good story. Unfortunately, this movie has none of these features. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this film and even her beauty can not save it. Terrible, presumptuous music corresponds to the feeble-minded dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connect and therefore the film does not connect with the audience. I suspect that the scenes in which the townspeople march somewhere should be added to the story, but it seems they were just inserted to make room. The scenes were choppy and incoherent. There were some nice pictures of the sea and the beach, which were beautiful.
