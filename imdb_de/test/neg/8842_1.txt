I look at all the good reviews on this movie and start thinking about me ... Am I crazy ..? Can not I see the beauty of a movie like this? Am I just stupid enough not to understand the message that this movie shows? I do not know ... maybe one of those lizards came into my head and ate all my brains as well. The movie idea went nowhere ... I was sure it would have a foggy ending, and of course ... it did! Nothing extraordinary ... Not even the landscapes (I hopped that the location in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice ... but no). Just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students ... now all grown up, each one of them ... with his own set ideas. And boy, some of those ideas were stupid. Like the lizard story. Immediately I thought, I look at x files ... with the lizard in the ear and everything. No. In my view, this movie is a waste of time (not to say money when you pay the ticket). The only thing I liked was the acting of the young blue eye "German" played very well and convinced for his age ... the rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the scriptwriter and the director both got drugs when they had these ideas. Well, considering that there are a lot of people who enjoyed this movie ... I think again. Maybe I'm the crazy one. Advice .. Do not waste your time with it!
