(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Unredeemable, merciless and, above all, dreary garbage. You know that a movie will be bad if Lance Henriksen is the only star power. The French title for this film says it all: "Inexplicable". How can you make a movie that is unbelievably bad at this time? Whatever Jonas Quastel's trick is, it worked. This is rubbish, I speak crap on Manos level, meaningless, unsurpassed, not so bad, it's good, cinematic bile of the highest order. Lance Henriksen IS Harlan Knowles, a character who would have been interesting if he had not been so completely devoid of personality or personality. Along with a lot of idiots, he goes on an excursion to look for a nasty Sasquatch who is believed to have attacked a plane that crashed in the forest or something. Otherwise, not much happens. There are some softcore nudity (which means Teletubbie level) and some blatant rip-off of "Predator". After 92 minutes of absolute pain and another demolished scene, this time by "Blair Witch", the film finally stumbles across the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we see the monster itself only for one or two scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this film. All you need to know is that this is a very bad movie and not even worth a look. "The Untold" is an entertainment value, which is Orlando Bloom's character play. Avoid it like arsenic.
