It feels like treating a comedy routine that could have been said in ten minutes. Also technical credits are first class. The film really feels like a film school diploma project. <br /> <br /> The cast is a mix of experienced stage professionals and talented newcomers, but the problem is the superficiality. Their lines feel exactly as if they were TV show material. The director does not take his protagonists seriously, so we are not touched by their problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling proposition, but in the end the movie disappoints at all levels.
