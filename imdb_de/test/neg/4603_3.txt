I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. IFC has finally run it one night. I thought it was something like "Barfly" by Barbet Schroeder. Not correct. In this movie, this underworld of chintzy, filthy, smoke-filled, character-filled bars that you associate with its stories will not be recreated. The attitude of Bukowski, which Mickey Rourke did so well in the aforementioned film, is not captured. This natural wise attitude. Fans of Charles Bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on the screen, but those unfamiliar with his books may get a false sense of his works. This movie looks like another "movie of the week" about a drunk and his relationships. If you want to get a better idea of ​​Charles Bukowski's world clock "Barfly".
