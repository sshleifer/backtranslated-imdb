This movie was taken with a digital camera and shows. There were enough annoying digital tricks to alienate the viewer, even with the help of a terrible score. As if that was not enough, acting was terrible too. Acting is always strange in Hartley's films, but here it was just BAD, especially by Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) can not say much. After all these external problems, it is also very regrettable that the story itself is not that good. The jokes are predictable and unbelievably simple, and events rage from one incident to the next. The so-called Book of Life with Armageddon Inside is little more than an excuse for actors having trouble saying their lines. All in all, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. Thumbs down.
