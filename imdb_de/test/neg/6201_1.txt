I did not know what to expect when I started to watch this movie. In the end, I took off my hair. This was one of the most wretched films of this year ... actually in the last ten years. David Dhawan should just give up his career as a director. I have not come across an original script that David Dhawan worked on. This was a complete hitch and a bit of a hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just so bad that you can even hate the original (which was pretty decent). I can not understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere that this should be Govinda's comeback vehicle. If that's true, only God can save his career. Salman has overreacted to the very end. Govinda, whom I think is a high profile actor, was completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing else to do except dress in designer clothes and smile with no reason and no smile. Please stay away from this!
