My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies & I have and have read almost all the books I can find related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can say with certainty that this film is a stinker. Save your money and do not waste time. If you like insane action, insane gore, no conspiracy, and have nothing to say about Hollywood, watch the movie. Overpaid suits in Hollywood & 20th Century Fox & do not give them a penny. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are so many storylines that you could sift noodles into it. Read the other negative reviews to capture the overall picture. It has to be said exactly so I do not have to repeat it. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are made of cardboard. You want them all dead. And the film does not disappoint, almost all die. Even the hot bubble went blonde. Are you sorry for her? No plot, no character development ... who cares? The Predators are now idiots too. They scan everything but their own dead warrior. You are probably a high-tech company, right? In the Predator movie, they searched the soldiers and the girl to see who was armed. Trophy kills. In AvP they searched Charles Weyland and let him go because he had cancer. Major Plot Hole! <br /> <br /> Rating R is also due to the fact that they have children in the film who get a face, lots of gore and violence and there is a hospital scene where a very large pregnant woman is injected with breast brushes. It is implanted by 4 or 5-egg Hybrid Aliens in a mouth-to-mouth love-scene orgy, all of which hatch within about 30 seconds. Sensational horror, nothing more. These scenes are ridiculous, not serious. It's almost as if the violence happens and the alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumbs up or a nod of some kind. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this movie are all referring to performance enhancing medications. They are evolving rapidly and spreading rapidly throughout the city, by the ton, all in record time. Pathetic, because it does not stick to the series and contributes nothing to the aliens, aliens Predator continuity. <br /> <br /> I've found that the positive reviews are written by people who love the Gore. Ridiculous. As a film, as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs. Predator franchise, this film is at best a cheesecake clich√©. If you have faithfully followed this series, all the rules are broken and the aliens and predators are reduced to comic characters. <br /> <br /> There is no fantastic, memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects to remember. There are no brand actors. The plot is as thin as a bulb paper that ends with an "end": "We have two ways to get out of this mess ... The hospital or the center of the city!". I just got so wet. The center of the city means that everyone is being targeted by Big Brother, who somehow knows that the city is infested because it has an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects red spots. I just fell out of my chair. Alien special effects radar with red spot on an AWAC over Central America. I split my stomach laugh. <br /> <br /> Since I had to go to the helicopter pad, I had to choke my popcorn. Does anyone have a game called ZOMBIES! Played? You must bring your pieces to the Helicopter Pad to win. I almost moistened with laughter. <br /> <br /> The end is enough to shake you in wonderment. Who posted 20th Century Fox to write this script? OH, OH, ask me ... a 5th grade student. There really can not be another answer. Oh, yes, there may be another answer ... Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> The end? "Col. Stevens brings the Predator Pulse Rifle to Ms. Yutani (Francoise Yip), telling him that the Earth is not ready for the technology she represents Col. Stevens knows that Yutani does not want the technology on the earth is used. " You're joking, right? Ms. Yutani? Who is Ms. Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She's exactly two seconds in the movie, yet she says in her unending Far East wisdom that the world is not ready for technology. Serious??!! The brothers Dweebs (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for these bleeding abortions of a movie? They're the directors Doug and Bob McKenzie, and yet Fox has entrusted them with the stunning alien franchise. They are hailed as experts in special effects, and yet the film is a low-budget special effect. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Lachbar. <br /> <br /> This film is only for emptying your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no action. There are no significant main characters. It is not connected. It does not adhere to the character principles established in previous films. It does not matter to push the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low. And there is no end to it. The budget is low and strict enough to earn hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Either see it on TV, where it will end very quickly. Buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding total. There's a reason why Fox does not show the critics this movie as a preview. The critics had eaten this mess alive and nobody went to the theaters to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is currently leaning over a toilet that spills his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie is a stinker. It's just as bad or worse than alien 3. They insult us. <br /> <br /> Rinse now ...
