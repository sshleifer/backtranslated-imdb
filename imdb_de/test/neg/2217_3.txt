Why is it impossible to write in French? Very Kitch! This trip in the middle of the earth is a disdainful technical possibility, which is still current in 1976. This big "Casimir" of monsters is completely ridiculous! However, the film deserves a "remake", as does "KING KONG" (the last one), with a slightly more supplied scenario. The professor is similar to Professor Calculus and is pretty funny. David (the character) is inconsistent enough, but a good message for the people from below ("They unite and will overcome you!"). Overall, we would say, a movie from the 40s. Now that I have said all (or almost) the evil I was thinking of, we can say that when the brain gets tired or something of the other is seen, the thing is even quite entertaining. Hugh! That's my opinion! (Translation from French to English with "Reverso": Sorry for any errors!)
