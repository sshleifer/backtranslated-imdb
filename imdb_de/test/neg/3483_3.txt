This movie is a big stereotype. Acting (except Philbin & Harrison) is awful and the terrible script just makes it worse. I have to agree with another review that the "local" characters actually sound ridiculous, just like the "Caucasian" characters. 3 out of 10 stars for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf scenes. (1/2 * of ****) See "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) done right for Hawaii, especially BP, which I found entertaining and ingenious.
