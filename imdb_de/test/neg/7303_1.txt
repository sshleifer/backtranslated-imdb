Ed Wood's Classic 'Plan 9' has been considered the worst movie ever made for years. Forget it The Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast consists of famous brothers of peoples and almost famous or were actors and actresses. The storyline as well as the budget and the script are not available. The runtime is not set in the classic Ed-Wood style of using footage. Instead, there are endless slow-motions and repeated actions. And at The Roller Blade, seven are not even seven! <br /> <br /> You just have to watch this movie to know how bad filmmaking can really be. To give independent filmmakers everywhere hope.
