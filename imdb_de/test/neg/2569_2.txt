Wow, I have not seen such a bad movie since "Fire Down Below". Wait, that's a Seagal movie, too. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below," Seagal focuses the movie on its message on environmental awareness and on how the military, the FBI, and the CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and rational conspiracy are secondary to the gobbleygook comment that Seagal tries to convey.
