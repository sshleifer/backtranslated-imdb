I've enjoyed watching Lost from the beginning and have seen some bad actors in badly written episodes, because if Lost is good, it's really good! But in this episode where Mr. Echos went down, so many scenes of boring close-ups were filmed by bad acting that I tapped the fast-forward button. This episode was the worst. In fact, the quality variation of Lost was so contradictory that I often wonder how many writers use it. <br /> <br /> I'll keep watching, but I hope things get better and I hope I secretly die for the sub-par actors in the series.
