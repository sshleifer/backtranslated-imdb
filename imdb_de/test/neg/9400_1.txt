Yes, I found this movie really uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I did not like the Sandra Oh character, she really annoyed me. It is unlikely that she would be accepted into rural Italian life as she is not white. that was a bit of PC nonsense. <br /> <br /> the film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, it turns out that the only man she (Diane Lane) has an affair for is a shabby cheater. But you know what: In the end, your typical plasticistic American brickhead emerges, all cheesy white smiles and tans, and finally she finds what she wants all the time: a true American, and now she's settled in another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is pretty racist in its depiction of the Italians and the way he subjects them to being smarmy Lotharios or backward peasants. <br /> <br /> The photography was good, but the movie and its attitude were rubbish.
