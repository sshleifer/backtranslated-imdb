I can only think of one reason why this movie was released. To capitalize on the upcoming glory of Guy Pearce. This movie has no value whatsoever and puts Errol Flynn's memory unnecessarily in the bin. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The contempt that Flynn shows in this film is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Terrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Do not waste your time with this garbage. If you want to know more about this good actor or read his autobiography, look at My Wicked Bad ways. This movie is NOT the way.
