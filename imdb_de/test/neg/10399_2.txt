I was surprised to learn that Michael Moore or Bill Maher were not involved in this "film". An American left laundry list of axes for grinding, with a marked thrift of Democrats in hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Maybe we'll have to wait for these California spy doctors to slaughter Paradiso so that they can show all the political personalities of their pet ideologue. <br /> <br /> Cheap settings for religion, right-wing politicians, businesses and their lobbyists. Fox News, even SUVs. All radical leftist points of conversation were too fully covered - while omitting suspicious clues of misconduct from "the other side of the aisle" to avoid being aware. The only exception I noticed in an hour and a half is that JFK must have eternal eternity with Marilyn Monroe: the symbolic inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt to appear impartial.
