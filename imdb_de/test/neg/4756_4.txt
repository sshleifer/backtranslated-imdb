I love B movies, but I like it right from the start. I can not believe anyone could make a movie about aliens and predators so bad. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predator are fantastic. This movie was great fun. The makers did not take this movie seriously at all. I am deeply disappointed how the Strauss idiots acted this movie. They mocked amazing characters. It's as if they wanted to be serious in the beginning, then their authors got high and gave up. Almost nothing was uninterrupted, the main characters were terrible and were NOT aliens or predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that no one is taking aliens and predators seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this film showed no respect for the original films. You must not redeem the names of the previous films and should be ashamed
