I'm sorry, after looking at the credits, I thought this would be at least a decent homage to retired SF actors. The boy had me wrong POS are awful. I've never been so offended by a production. <br /> <br /> I have great respect for many actors in this "film", but I have to say that they were cheated. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not just two hours you will not get back, but also the respect of some actors you might have enjoyed once.
