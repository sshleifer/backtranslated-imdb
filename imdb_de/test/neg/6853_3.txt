I have never been disappointed with a Kurosawa movie, but this is probably the first one. "Doppelganger" is the worst thing I've seen of this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films recruits this film as "The Most Scary Film Ever Published by Kiyoshi Kurosawa". What? The most frightening movie from Kurosawa is definitely "Cairo". And if you think that this is horror, you will be surprised. This can not be classified as a horror or thriller. This is a drama and a pretty bad one. Many scenes that are shocking have turned out to be weird, and many of the actions are really confusing. And since it's Kurosawa, the pace is slow. But it's so slow that you lose interest after forty minutes and feel like doing something else. The thing that annoyed me most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if done with little care ... it can be a disaster. I think that describes a scene that has only a minimal use of CGI. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give "Dopppelganger" is that it has really good acting. Koji Yakusho, together with the rest of the cast, is a great performer. But that's about all ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and look at "Cairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be scared. This is a bad, bad attempt at an intelligent drama. What it is intelligent, but ... Well, it lacks a lot. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for good acting.
