I am so disappointed. After waiting for 3 years for repeats / the DVD of the original Masterpiece series "Darkplace", I could not wait for this series. The first episode is over and I'm horrified. Everything that was great about Darkplace has been pretty much deleted here. Worst introduction: canned laughter. This takes away the original point and makes it almost unsurpassable. (A joke about Garth's eyes that fertilize the audience was good ... the rest I can barely remember ...) it feels like a bad quality "I know myself, I know you" I hope so that improves over the series, otherwise I'm seriously disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the most compassionate man I have ever known, and I know God ..."
