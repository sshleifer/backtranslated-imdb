This movie is by far one of the worst B movies I've ever seen. There are no plot rotations at all. Although the spectacle is decent, the plot is terrible. There are also many flaws in the movie, and it was annoying to watch. For anyone of you who likes horror movies, slasher movies or even B movies, I do not recommend that to anyone. Most of the film focuses on pointless killing in a way that's not worth discussing. This movie could well be compared to a crappy remake of Jeepers Creepers, which was also not great. For anyone who wants to spend a day at home and watch bad movies, he takes the cake with him.
