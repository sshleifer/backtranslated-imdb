"Jaded" offers a premise with potential as it considers the rape of a woman by two other women and the question, "When is rape not rape?" Unfortunately, the strip seems to suffer from a bad direction as it passes through the legal minutia as it tries to weave a kind of story with a handful of mutilated and poorly written characters that only end abruptly. "Jaded" is lame cloth just for the murky eye-couch potato in the mood for a dark drama.
