I saw this on a screener DVD several months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the overall story, but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets did fit, but some looked like freaks and geeks remnants or reminded me of a commercial ad in a middle-class house. Definitely not what the DVD cover claims, "The next Stoner classic," barely. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and hairstyles are well done and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this movie, always nice to look at a good looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene contained a guitar that was kept threatening. The sound design was a bit bad. I think less would have been best.
