When I sit back after seeing Wong Kar-wo's 1994 film Ashes of Time? More specifically, the 2008 reissue and reissue of the word 'Redux' that went to the end of the title? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie did not work out at all. I wonder why the movie did not score important points in my book. What was it that particularly affected the movie and made it the worst movie of its director? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not too hard to find out. Let me just say that it is really a shame that Kar-wai broke through this hell of a hole in mediocrity and poverty in Moviedom so abruptly, especially considering that he was in the same year Chungking Express, one of his perennial bequests and one his successor, released absolutely sublime film. So ?? what went wrong? It would be appropriate to consider Ashes of Time as an experimental film. Essentially, our director places his own inimitable style of film in a completely different environment, mood and atmosphere. The result is a catastrophic film that is omnipresent and simply does not work. Therefore, it would be even wiser to call Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Bold, bold and innovative, but still a failure. <br /> <br /> Let me explain that in more detail. Those who have seen the films of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born film writer who has influenced the art world since his debut in the late 1980s, will know that there is a superior aesthetic that unites all of his films together ; In essence, and quite frankly, they are all colorful, thought-provoking, gracious, subtly humorous and meaningful to life, love and loss. The same formula is implemented in ashes of time. However, the regular backdrop of Hong Kong is inappropriate, and instead we are in the backdrop of ancient China and the land of legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen. <br /> <br /> Intertwined Quasi-adventure / historical caper is the typical Kar-Wai love story, about an elegiac hit man who has moved into the middle of the desert and carried out contract killings. But I have to stay there. The description of characters is meaningless. Why? Because not a single character in Ashes of Time is worth mentioning or nothing. What a bland cast, and a waste of talent (the case of Ashes of Time contains almost all regular Kar-wai employees). Not only that, but the movie is essentially endlessly perpetually horrendous, almost non-existent narrative structure. One of the main reasons why critics of "Ashes of Time" detest it is that it apparently has no conspiracy, let alone a semblance or a hint of it. You can definitely see what they achieve, even from the first two, three minutes or less of the movie. Maybe it's just the atypical backdrop of old China that is unfamiliar and unfit for Kar-wai's typical film style. I like to think, however unhappy it may be, that Mr. Kar-wai just got really involved here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in Ashes of Time is isolated, another director's trademark? wonderful, colorful and blissful aesthetics. What joyful color is created on the canvas, what glorious textures are painted for us and what breathtaking landscapes and images are captured throughout the film for us. We can at least see this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still in our hearts, and it's just the film that is so atypical and buries its usually laudable nuance. Although the visuals are not enough to fully indemnify Kar-wai for this catastrophic endeavor, they are enough to make the movie worthwhile. and at least we do not leave the film in a completely naughty mood, now that we come up with something we can well imagine. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a Wuxia-Art movie in the style of the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing differentiates Karwai from Kurosawa's best film, and that is that in the films of the Japanese director, everything collapses and simply works. Nothing seems to work in Ashes of Time. Kar-wai's attempt to make a truly profound Wuxia film, not to mention an intellectual and provocative film, is a futile undertaking. Kar-wai claims that creating Ashes of Time has drained him. He needed time to clear his head. It certainly must have been a tiring effort for him as his efforts are embodied in the film and transmitted directly to us? I mean, it's a tedious effort to just watch the movie, and now I need time to free myself from this unpleasant cinematic experience.
