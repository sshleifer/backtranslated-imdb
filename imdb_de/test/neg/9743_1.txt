I vaguely remember this movie. I remember, for one reason, that it's the only movie I've ever gone to !! and since then i have never seen it to rent EVERYWHERE !! I can not ruin it for anyone because I can barely remember it !! Thinking, looking at the cast, it seemed to be a winner, with John Landis as the director, but good god, they must have paid a lot for this jerk !! All I can remember is that the father has disappeared and the family is trying to find him by trying to put a photo in the drive of a computer. I left after about half an hour. I have to admit though, I'd like to see if I can get a copy just to see if it was really that bad list! I mean, Christopher Lee was there? The legend of all the bad guys who had been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings? As I said - black-listed movie, The Stupids!
