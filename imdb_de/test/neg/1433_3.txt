This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen a lot). I personally liked the piercing version of everything that was original, but otherwise it was pretty unsurpassable. I could not stand Dee Snider as an actor or as a singer. I seemed to be trying everything he said to make it a memorable quote, which they were not. I can get movies for free, and I still did not think it was worth the time.
