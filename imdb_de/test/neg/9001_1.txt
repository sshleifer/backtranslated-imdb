As a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr I had to see that. What a triplet is the only good thing are the clips from Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips that do not gel with the new black and white footage. Not even near Steve Martins. Dead men do not wear a plaid, that was great. With all the technology we have now, why was not that done better? If you plan to spend 5 money and change something, be warned, that's really bad. But if you like Lugosi Karloff and Chaney Jr, then watch their films instead. Even Ed Wood was better than this. The new actor Mark Redfield is pretty well suited as a Bela Lugosi imitation. the monkey, Mr. Wong, most dangerous game, lost world, indestructible man. and the devil bat.th notorious Bela Lugosi classic. I believe that this production was a very low budget, and it shows 1 in 10.
