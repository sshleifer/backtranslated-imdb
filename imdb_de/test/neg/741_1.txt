Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production does NO justice to her wonderful tongue novel. Starting at the top ... badly adapted. The scriptwriter deserves particularly low grades because she's been trying to think about it, I do not know WHAT she wanted, but suffice to say she missed the mark by light years !! With all the exaggerated and terrible production values, this is an adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been much better if they had simply given all the money they had flown into this flop and donated it to a charitable charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to survive this excruciating production!
