Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst movie I've seen all year, and I've seen some fools. There is nothing redeeming about this garbage, from the characterization to the direction to the plot. Even the normally brilliant Dominique Swain could not save this movie. None of the characters is sympathetic in any case, with the possible exception of Eloise (wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this dire defeat). <br /> <br /> ******* Possible spoiler ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that it moves on without saying anything. It is drunk, instead of leading us on the path of history. It also introduces numerous, possibly enticing details (the hypochondriac brother, the ever-retired possession of the mother, the anti-Semitic classmates, the murderous father of the other classmate) without exploring a single one of them. And when I finally thought there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end. <br /> <br /> I left the film with the feeling that he wanted to tell me something but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film by an author / director who really needs to spend more time working with established filmmakers before he can blame his work on an unsuspecting audience of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad ones Film.
