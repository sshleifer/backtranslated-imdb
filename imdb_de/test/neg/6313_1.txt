This movie easily falls into the ridiculous, if not offensive, category. I mean, in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios believe that this movie would be playing? From start to finish, we bombarded Quaid's covered and ridiculous countenances. Another important point I had with the film was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you associate with a character. I mean, in a scene where Lewis plays in a bar before he grows up, there's this exaggerated, absolutely absurd bar fight that every citizen in the city seems to be involved in. Then Lewis starts playing his interpretation of "A LOT of Shaking," and everyone immediately forgets their differences and starts dancing wildly, as if this were the most normal thing in the world. These kinds of scenes, of which there are many, and the lack of depth in one of the characters, made me laugh. All in all, this film is not worth watching for anyone who is not interested in mocking the filmmaker and his actors for an hour and a half.
