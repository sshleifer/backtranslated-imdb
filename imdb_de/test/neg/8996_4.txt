Naach A more detailed rating is available elsewhere on the Internet. This is a good illustration, although I do not quite agree. Taran is a commercial guy and therefore has only views from his point of view. Ram Gopal Varma (RGV seems to be a political party) has done wonders in Rangeela, in some parts ... I will not even compare Urmila and Anthara. Both are good! The former has a better acting talent, although the latter can catch up well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like Anthara's character. She is true to her art, unaffected by unnecessary emotions and definitely not too practical. She is a dance scholar, in fact she is so sure of her theories that even a comparison with a scientist would insult her. Hey .. Donald Trump .. Maybe you have to turn off Melania, this is Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal ... is not that easy? Abhishek, on the other hand, is a practical guy who wants money, power, fame, etc. Therefore, these two fought with a slump in the film industry, but did not get along because of their different lifestyles and lifestyle with each other. This is very typical, but I like the movie that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its entire running time, in one scene! What's new? This film takes a different perspective on the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different about the films of RGV, this too is different, it is far too slow for its standards. In some places, you almost go to sleep. <br /> <br /> Remarkable It's hard to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think that this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences :-) Besides, it looks like Anthara is a pro in yoga, she's way too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby improves with every movie as an actor. I'm sure his movie star blood will pay off rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music overall above average.
