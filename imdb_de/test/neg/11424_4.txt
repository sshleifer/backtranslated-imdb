How many of the evening, despite the cold winter and long lines, I've waited to see what I expected to be one of the best films of the year. Unfortunately I had a lot to be desired after the litter in many ways. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (albeit very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: in every way on the point ?? from their frightening physicality to their sheer wildness. The action: sublimly visceral ?? when it happened Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Well, what not (and there is plenty). This was not so much a movie as it was a collage of sequences (and do not expect secondary characters from the other films except Raze and Tannis). Deeply missing was a well-written storyline and some of real substance to bring those movie pieces together. The story seemed to start in the middle? at the top, where Lucian had decided to rebel. Therefore, there was no context; no voltage; no betrayal? The devices had to make everything else work. In addition, it ended where the climax should have begun (which had to happen only after the feud had annealed a little). Oh, and it was way too short. Purist will also find in some freedoms violations of certain facts that were previously revealed in the first two films - but judge for yourself. In the end, the movie hung on the long "short" background scenes (eg, various council scenes), and as a result, we never got to know the main actors or the movie (or even the movie). -D
