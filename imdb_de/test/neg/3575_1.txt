I really enjoyed "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuise and was surprised to see that Suzanne Somers has become the co-star of the show after the years. But that was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio, the intro, the hosts - all that adds new meaning to the word "pompous". Well, that would be fine if the materials were not so crpy - I mean, come on, the best you can do is show some men who are having trouble getting ketchup out of the bottle , Suzanne Somers is going on a Halloween basket in July ... I've seen a few episodes and each time it was awful. They posed like the biggest show ever, filling the time with scenes that were so boring that I felt really embarrassed. Even the people in them looked bored and that just can not be good.
