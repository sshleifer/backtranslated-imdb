Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that a woman was involved in this terrible "image of women", and I mean that in the worst way. The problem was that it would have been so good if they had just omitted the Jane Eyre stuff and stayed in the much more interesting scenes with the Spanish-Portuguese Jews in nineteenth-century London. If the soundtrack music is better than the movie, you know you are in trouble. If you're fast forwarding the video because you do not like the movie just to make sure you do not miss anything, you'll have even bigger problems. This movie will end up in the romantic TV station where he rightfully belongs.
