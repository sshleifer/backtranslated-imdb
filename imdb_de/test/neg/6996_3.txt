You could see the end result from a mile away. All the signs were there ... the prom, the liquor, the fast ride, the distraction of the women ... A good commercial for safety belts and later model vehicles. This means that the passengers sit further back from the windshield. The end is more climatically, as the Ford Econoline van barely creases over the nose after hitting a bridge at high speed (very unlikely) has made it a bit more believable. And why do these films always take place during / after a prom? Is it a case, once you have survived the Prom once, will you be good for life? More than anything else, it shows that the Prom for Alcohol is not monitored and the minors leaving the dance for a fun ride are not watching.
