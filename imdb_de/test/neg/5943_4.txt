"Midnight Clear" has a great condition. A group of overly educated, very intelligent GIs are being sent to a vague mission by incompetent leaders to patrol an isolated farmhouse on the eve of the Battle of the Bulge. The GIs meet a group of tired German regulars, and it becomes clear that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> That's the problem. It's really pretty easy. If the Germans want to surrender they do that and that's the end of the movie. If the Germans want to fight, they do that and that's the end of the movie. Instead of either playing the GIs or the Germans, they play together and even throw snowballs at one point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but it will soon be very annoying. After all, that's GERMANS. The enemy. Nothing in this movie makes me think they should not be captured or shot. The movie does not make her more human. Much of what the German characters did has led me to shoot them, including a scene where the German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or surrender to a mere man! Why should I care about such characters? Just shoot it and go on to the Battle of the Bulge. It's much more interesting anyway. <br /> <br /> A good scene: The GIs return from a reconnaissance of the German position, where they had the Germans in their sights, but did not shoot. As they walk across a clearing, they find that a group of Germans have their moulting on them. The Germans are about 100 meters away. The GIs then do something I've never seen in a Sillywood movie. They throw down their rifles and throw their hands up! As unusual as it may be in films, it is a perfectly sensible reaction when a rifle is aimed at you from this distance. Although it seems wide, it is in reality for these rifles. I'm sure someone working on this movie was a cruffler!
