Eugene O'Neill is hailed by some as America's leading playwright, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into the Night, The Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was an experimental piece in which he assembled the characters on stage, looked to the audience and said what he really thinks, and then resumed the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a lunch break on Broadway, so you can assume that much was sacrificed here. <br /> <br /> For the screen, the voice is used for all characters. It's probably a technique that's better suited for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier has done very well in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare has told Olivier a much better story than O'Neill told his players in this case. Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. are much more animated most of their films are in Strange Interlude. The story takes place over a period of 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose purpose was killed in the First World War. She starts playing quite a bit, though this part is not shown in this version. She meets Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has a long-time admirer, Ralph Morgan, a friend of her father's Henry B. Walthall. She marries Kirkland, but is then warned by his mother, May Robson, and shows that the madness in this family, galloping, cites another literary work. Since Kirkland's kids and Shearer and Robson want Kirkland's train to slip off the track if he does not, Gable is recruited for breeding purposes. Of course, you can see all the complications this can cause, and O'Neill examines them all. <br /> <br /> Gable is so terribly mismanaged in an O'Neill production, but he was an up and coming player at MGM and did what they told him to do. Shearer does what she can to tell a very drab story, but she seems to be defeated in the beginning. The best movie in this movie may be Robson, who misses a real bite in her dialogue. Strange Interlude ran for 426 performances on Broadway (1928-1929) and played Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in the Gable and Shearer parts. Maybe nobody could have saved the movie because Groucho Marx spit out the siege in Animal Crackers two years earlier. After seeing what he did, I do not think the movie that went public took it too seriously. <br /> <br /> And since it's not the best of O'Neill, I could not.
