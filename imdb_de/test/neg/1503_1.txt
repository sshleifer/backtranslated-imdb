I love low budget movies. These include those that are intentionally or unintentionally funny, excessive artificial hemorrhage, violence, etc. <br /> <br /> This is stupid, however. Once you see the end, you'll say what the hell of the death scenes was (except for a couple) to testify to. And how did the end come? Whole story for those who are stupid enough to actually see this) Grandma is like a psychic Jason. First she is with a body in front of the window and 15 seconds later she knits in the living room. The whole thing is a setup for a newcomer. They pull off graphic kill scenes, the knitting needles in their eyes that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could pull. And again the end was preformed. 56 minutes waste of time. I saw one of the directors of other films and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 giants and I could do better. This really deserves a big fat 0.
