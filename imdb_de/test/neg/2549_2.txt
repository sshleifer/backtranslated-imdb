The Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Furlough, where Anna (Erika Fay) lives. Her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes). She has a Mexican friend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez), who is determined to track down a beast that has terrorized the city, killed livestock, and several residents, including some of her friends. Local Mexican legends speak of Chupacabra, a wicked creature of myth and legend. Um, I'm fighting now because not so much else is actually happening ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis. I'm not going to rip around here and just say the Mexican werewolf in Texas is awful, period. The script mentions the word werewolf only once, and while the rest of the time was being talked about by a chupacabra, I suspect that this was not really meant to be a werewolf movie at all. The 'werewolf' creature looks mostly hairless and more like a malicious dog. There is no indication that anyone changes during the full moon. It attacks several times during the day, there is no transformation scene and at the end of the day it is killed, does not change in anybody. To be honest, apart from the title, there is nothing here that indicates a werewolf movie. Even then, the title is just a rip off of the hugely popular An American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the type of homemade crap that I personally think kills the horror genre. How long has it been since there was a real low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978 or Friday the 13th (1980), all made on shoe strings budgets , maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999), but that's been it in the last few years Crap like the Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic The characters are awful and things just happen around them the dialogue is garbage, the tempo is terrible, the story is shitty and it has almost put me to sleep, as a whole this movie is just crap, I'm sorry, but I do not know how else to describe it? < Director Maginnis does not do anything to make this watch workable, there's the annoying, hand-held camera cinematography that could easily miss someone's headaches and quick "blinking" and editing "something." annoys and irritates g leichermaÃŸen. It is not scary, there is no nudity, there is no tension or atmosphere and the special effects are terrible. The monster looks really bad and it's no wonder that Maginnis keeps it in the shade or cuts its scenes so fast that you never really see it. The picture also has virtually no color, it is either almost pitch black or saturated desert sand orange, which also makes the thing sore. The Gore consists of some fake guts (blink and you'll miss them!), A few bloody wounds and a severed arm, big deal. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 300,000, I admit that the budget was low, but I simply refuse to accept that there are many low budget horror films to make such a garbage movie cause their meager budgets to rise far. The whole thing looks like a home movie, it has no style and is thoroughly boring and boring. Acting is shit, too, though you probably already knew that. <br /> <br /> A Mexican werewolf in Texas is likely to trick some people into hiring / buying / looking because they falsely believe it's a continuation of John Landis's classic That's certainly not it and it is not a real werewolf movie. Do not be fooled, that's terrible and I'm sick of wasting time / money on homemade amateur crap like this one.
