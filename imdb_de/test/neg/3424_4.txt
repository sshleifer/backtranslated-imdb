The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeares ever written. This may be due to some characteristics that make the Slasher genre obvious: murder, murder, killing, killing, gallons of blood, a strained sexual relationship between the main characters, etc. More than this, the original game is very appealing. Consider the length (she is only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth, for whom we have to take care, despite his bloody nature. The piece would be perfect for a movie. Not so long, it gives the directors the opportunity to explore their many levels, a good actor can play the role of his life, the film has a deep meaning in every historical period. Unfortunately this was not the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version comes pretty close, but it's too medieval. Welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist on totalitarianism, the about 1990 TV release is too shallow. This 2006 movie is no exception. It's a long way from a Shakespearean film, but it's interesting to see how the director understood the story and where it places it in contemporary life. No knights in shining armor, but gangsters in shiny cars. A lot of drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original. The idea of ​​Macbeth is so simple that you do not need Shakespeare at all if you want to take it in modern life and use it. The worst thing in the movie are the lines. Most poignant scenes of the game, such as the dagger scene, are so cropped that they seem pointless. Replacing the door knocking with doorbells and horses with cars is funny. If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation, they could easily have done it without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a loser with a brain injury, not a brave warrior, brave and ambitious, who wants the power so much that he is ready to kill, and gets into a web of fear and despair. The film does not clear what drives Lady Macbeth crazy, there is no reason why some characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (as there is no hereditary ascension to the throne, what without throne and all) and it brings Macbeth in an embarrassing position, as the leadership of a gang is so far from the kings, as this whole movie is not from any Shakespeare. In summary, we have two superimposed ideas that never really come together, resulting in a movie that is ultimately pointless. Do not stand in the order of your walking, but go!
