I'm ready to tolerate almost anything in a sci-fi movie, but that was almost unbearable. While some of the special effects are very cool (landscapes), this is not a "battleground" but a disjointed, funny mother-daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts. With hand-to-hand combat scenes that are funnier than any Hong Kong Chopsocky movie, this movie is boring. The plot line is intricate, and the elements used to move the plot (narrator), inexplicable jumps, and a lot of Deus ex machina reinforce the idea that Writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your love for sci-fi for something else, instead of losing something here.
