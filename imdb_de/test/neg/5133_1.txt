I loved Heavenly Creatures and made it my mission to catch it again and again. <br /> <br /> So, my joy when I discovered Love & Suicide when searching NetFlix. Echoing Heavenly Creatures, an easy choice, was at the top of my queue. <br /> <br /> I looked at it last, made myself comfortable and waited. What I thought was a crappy preview of a prank movie project by a stoned high school student (I laughed out loud once or twice and thought, "That lowered the bar directly to video") was the movie. Terrible spectacle, amateur tour, weak dialogue. I usually enjoy low budget movies, there is something tangible and real about them, because they can not afford to distract the superficial stuff of "flesh". The acting, the direction, the plot, the story. I would compare it to a student who has not yet studied for an exam. He knows he will fail, just lay his head on the desk and sleep. <br /> <br /> In a strange hand, the plot would have serious potential. <br /> <br /> Do not expect magic or even cult classics like Divine Polyester or Showgirls, at least you'll get to expect bad acting. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide became the worst movie I've ever seen.
