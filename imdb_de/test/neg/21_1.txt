Bloody Birthday is a total garbage Slasher movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I found the acting pretty good, considering the genre of the movie and the obvious low budget. I do not know what was going on with the cinematography, but it looked scary. Too oversaturated. Maybe that's a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There are really no redeeming qualities. There are some deaths but not really bloody. I would not care if I were you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very amusing and honest. He had no good news about director Ed Hunt and admits that the film was a failure, but he would like to do it again because he thinks there is a decent storyline. However, he died in 2004, so I think it will be someone else's job to face up to this challenge. The things that have developed in recent years would not surprise me. Today there is at least once a week a new edition in the cinema. It could not be worse than the original, I think, but I do not care if it was redone or not.
