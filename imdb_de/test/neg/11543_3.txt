Lethal Panther 2 is located in the Philippines and is a bleak action movie of the early 90s. He sees a ruthless policeman chasing the evil criminals who killed his wife. A rather cheap-looking production that has almost no artistic value, this film focuses on the quality and quantity of its action. But there is no shortage of fist fights, firearms and explosions, but the quality simply does not exist. The endless struggles lack originality or excitement, with bad cuts and worldly direction, this film becomes a real duty to sit through. The normally impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, her natural athletic ability is overshadowed by some agonizing bad wire work. The ballistic action scenes are an inconspicuous mix of "slow-motion flying through the air" during shooting, exploits, crazy vehicle stunts, and endless villains ready to fire. There are so many better examples of the genre "Girls and Weapons, "which is now available on DVD, and I suggest you leave it alone (unless, like me, you would endure pretty much any old garbage to be a completeist).
