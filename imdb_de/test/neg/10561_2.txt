Maybe if I just laugh at how my favorite was portrayed by Jane Austen's works. Maybe I'm too strict with this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm biased towards the A & E version. I can hardly imagine that Mr. Darcy is portrayed by another player as Colin Firth. The characters seemed flat and often forced to force the dialogue. Lizzy seemed to be missing the real feeling that is so obvious in the book. Her liking for Wickham was exaggerated, and then her sudden desire for Darcy was untrustworthy. Darcy was pretty well portrayed, I admit. He managed to maintain the necessary restraint, but I felt he was not projecting the emotion and inner struggle that made his character so appealing, especially in the suggestion scene. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were also well played, but in many ways seemed to be missing. The average temper of Mrs. Bennet was not fully captured in her performance. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins was a good portrayer. In keeping with the book. <br /> <br /> I will not comment on Lady Catherine, except that she may be the worst performer in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Other problems I had There were the few freedoms that they took along with the sequence of events, such as Darcy, who was present at the first meeting with Lady C., and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy when they were with the Collins <br /> The choreography was terrible during the dance scenes. The scene in which Lizzy and Darcy dance loses much of their intensity, because you can not overcome the feeling that they are looking down in the ballroom. At least that BBC version left out the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William as he congratulated them on their dance because they were really sick. <br /> <br /> There were occasional moments that I was interested in. But overall I find this version a disappointment. I would not recommend this movie unless you are like me and you are overly distracted by such follies. <br /> <br />
