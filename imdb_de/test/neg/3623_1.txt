This is a children's television series about a Mary-Sue who is mean and vicious at the same time. I could not bring myself to sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can not act to save her life! What message does this show bring to children? If you're not perfect like Zoey, you're unworthy * Rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It is absurd that Zoey's character is just the kind of person who would be despised in real life and yet become so popular. Then there's Chase, who's basically a lovesick puppy worshiping the ground Zoey goes on. In addition, apparently all the other characters have been dumbed down to keep them from outshining Zoey. I'm sorry, but the characterization on this show is extremely unrealistic.
