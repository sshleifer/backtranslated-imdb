"Love Life" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a lesbian-gay convenience marriage. I found the topic convincing, even if the conflict was somewhat forced and solved too easily. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a bit too fast and comfortable in the plot. There are many continuity flaws: Another user commented on several cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... Most of all I got the fact that Joe's facial hair seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end I was more attacked by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty pretty body and shows it all quite often with pornstar skill and cockiness and all too often acting gimmicks. Often the movie seems to be full of porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a good job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was a bit soiled for me as I was in the mood for a good hustle and bustle in the shower at the end of this movie.
