Cuore Sacro combines brilliant film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a screenplay that the scriptwriters for "Touched by a Angel" may have found too reckless, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. Actually, I wanted to focus on the positive, but I found the final act so confusing and terrible that I believe that the couple, who died at the very beginning, might have been the lucky ones. <br /> <br /> This film is in the heart (pun intended) a story built on a big end of the twist style. This kind of weak foundation can lead to tremendous success, such as Una Pura Formalità by Tornatore or godless garbage like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro falls a little closer to the latter. I found the cinematography generally above average. The camera shots of Irene, who dutifully made her half rounds in the pool, were very impressive, as well as the atmosphere that evoked the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo came in from the rain and Irene posed with him was a bit boring. One big theme I made an exception to in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply spinning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions that occur. This has proved very successful with Facing Windows, but here Bubolova does not seem to be a Mezzogiorno. In addition to the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the militant performance of its main character. This made the final mishap scene even worse. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ozpetek continues his crusade against our societies by asking us to be spiritual (not necessarily religious) and altruistic. Although I am one who is very sympathetic to this view, I had the feeling that the audience was hit over the head with a blunt object. Could the characters have been more two-dimensional? I tended to find this movie very impressive and soulless. Was the "bad" Aunt Eleonora more than a caricature? It also applies to the people on the "right" side, such as the "good" aunt Maria Clara and the elderly porter Aurelio. And just in case we missed Ozpetek's point, he decided to dress his opposing forces in their own colors. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point regarding the use of color by the director. He dresses the opening pair, who takes a short black shot, and Irene (when we met her for the first time and after her life), the evil Aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that indicates a certain course, the mind of the wearer is callous and emotionless. It is the color of choice for this indispensable item of modern armor, the business suit. It is also the color of mourning, such as the funeral of the suicidal duo. After all, black is the color of piety, like the simple robes of priests and nuns that Irene imitates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color and a very suitable choice for a movie about the Sacred Heart is red. It is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component. The character who wears red is brave, emotional, receptive to new ideas and forgiving. Red is a risky color today; it challenges our perception of the wearer and at the same time makes him vulnerable. Red, however, has a tremendous amount of history and mysticism as the first members of the Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ocher and, in fact, the first man named in the Torah, Adam, was named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flair and looks back on the past when red (and by association a less self-determined attitude to life) was more accepted. So, when we meet the red-filled room (the mysterious frieze covers walls with a red accent and a red painting of a whirling dervish!) By Irene's mother, "good" characters that Maria Clara and Aurelio wear in gorgeous red outfits Finally, the painting from Irene's mother in a formal red dress, where Ozpetek's sympathies lie. <br /> <br /> A few words about the soundtrack. I thought the original music themes were great for the story. The quasi-baroque theme that Irene meant was great because of his monotony and sense of uneasy nausea (the absolute best use of a perpetually repeating Baroque theme, as in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon would be, with his masterful repetitions of an eight-bar measure) Sarabande attributed by Handel). An absolutely inspired choice was a few seconds from an opera aria we hear while power flickers as Irene drives Benny around the house. It is the famous aria "Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano" from the Catalan opera "La Wally". The aria is sung by the soprano who leaves her home forever. Since Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can assume that this is a recording of her singing and that she takes a moving farewell to her daughter, because in the movie Irene will soon never see Benny alive again. I just have a little question of the soundtrack: why should the famous tango Yo Soy Maria be there? I love the song and could hear it in person, but it did not really fit here.
