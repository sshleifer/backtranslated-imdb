I lived in the East End of London for three months in the second half of 1987, when the show aired for nearly two years. It was considered a running joke. <br /> <br /> Why? Because it had a pure white plaster. For the first few years, every member of the cast was white. <br /> <br /> The street where I lived was long and had over 800 houses. To the best of my knowledge, I was one of only three or four white faces living in this street. We were at the corner of the Indian and Turkish "neighborhoods," and even if you excluded these two races, the Asians and Afro-Caribbeans outweighed the whites twenty to one. And of course, of the few whites who lived * in the area *, most Scots were like me - a cockney accent was never heard. <br /> <br /> That was not a racist cry, just a simple fact. The BBC could not bother looking through London before writing this soap, or they had only white actors available and decided to bluff them. <br/> In the East, we considered it a comedy show. :-)
