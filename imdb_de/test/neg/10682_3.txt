The movie Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title as well as a lead role. Most may not like this movie because the plot was a bit cheap, but that's the appeal of a movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a way, it was a bad movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you watch this movie until the end, you will find that, as I said, it is a cheap vampire movie with some humor. (Besides, it's very interesting how they manipulated the colors in a few scenes.) <br /> <br /> So this movie is a guy you rent with your friends and laugh at and enjoy what it is , Because no film is bad through and through. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says: "People do not smile enough ..."
