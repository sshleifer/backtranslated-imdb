The Hell's Angels were the losers in this movie. Sonny told the director that NOBODY does that to the Angles and gets away with it. His version was that the two boys should be shot to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were a larynx even to emerge, let alone "technical advisers" in a stink bomb of such a movie. Hell's Angles on JAP Bikes? Come on! (though in Sonny's autobiography, "F # # K is called Harley Davidson!", and if they were smart, they would drive Hondas.) (ST1100) Read his car ... he has Harleys. Can you imagine that Angels whispering the city with their sewing machines sounding Jap bikes - not too intimidating - they would be laughed out of town.
