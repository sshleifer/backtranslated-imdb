this movie is what happens when people see in this one blair-witch project and say hell run around with racecameras, the documentary under the theme can not be a problemo bunch of talentless actors and start shooting a movie. Plot is that in Africa there is a half-hearted race of people who hunt like animals and kill people. The locals think it's a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild group is in Africa to get evidence. I do not need words for the plot anymore. This movie gets one out of ten points and I try to say something good about this movie, but after a long time I did not think anything nada zero zero.
