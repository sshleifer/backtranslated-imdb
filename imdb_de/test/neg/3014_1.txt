After seeing this show a few times; As a woman I am thoroughly offended that there are so many stupid women who are interested in this bullshit. I'm a bit more mature than some of the "players" on this show, but I'm still appalled that the whole dating game was boiled down to a game show: where stupid guys on their lame ass attempts to pick up chicks can earn points. When young people watch this and use it as a tutorial: Not !!! Save yourself the trouble and hire a prostitute if you are just looking for an ass. Maybe there are girls out there with the same attitude, but some do not think so.
