I can not believe I tried to see this filth. As an avid B-horror movie fan, the popular horror movie filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis has more than thrilled me. Unfortunately I could not think of a worse movie than this one from the beginning. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A terrible plot that moves incredibly slowly. The film continues without real horror. But I have to admit that there are a few scenes in which Dr. Gore hypnotized his early victim. The camera zooms in on his oversized, bulbous eyes, while all the while this lazy soundtrack is added to the conversation. I laughed for almost 10 minutes. After putting on his "miracle wife," the movie is wasted for nearly 20 minutes, showing him and his "girlfriend" how he teaches her to talk, then talking, romping among marigolds, having picnics, etc. music all through that Fandango plays without any language. This part of the movie lets you wish you had slashed your wrists with the blunt edge of a butter knife. I almost want to puke at the thought of this movie. If you like movies that are bad, look at them.
