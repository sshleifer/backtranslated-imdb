This movie is so bad that they should burn the master. You can not spoil the plot because this movie has none. The graphics are less fake, they are terrible. Then you have the ramble through the land scene of the Stargazer, who leaps between his own insanity and the crazy ghosts of the crazy preacher. & when he finally gets to DC, they do not even have the decency to kill him; The monster (which you do not know at this time) is already dying, but how ... who knows and of course it has the ultimate end ... All the others on the planet are dead or dying except his family and a handful of stragglers to survive. Imagine! This will be the film in which C Thomas Howell regrets his regret that he ever starred in the lead roles. He probably has nightmares.
