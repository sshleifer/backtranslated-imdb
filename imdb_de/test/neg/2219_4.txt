Doug McClure has starred in some of those UK-produced genre adventures, and this was the worst. I know that THE LAND, THE TIME FORGETTS its critics, but please at least watch the film with filming and relatively good production values. That's the problem with this movie - The production values ​​go way beyond "So bad, they're good", loving territory and getting so bad that I think I'll see what's on the other channels "<br /> <br / > "One example is the first scene where intrepid Cushing and McClure encounter a monster. It is painfully obvious that the monster is an average sized man, dressed as a rubber monster, looking over twenty feet tall with oversized rear projection. It gets even more painful that our heroes try to escape the monster by running on the spot. Did I mention that this is one of the more convincing sets? No, that really looks like someone filmed it in the living room with the remainder of this year's DOCTOR WHO budget. Even the former DOCTOR WHO, Peter Cushing, is bland and the actually amusing line "You can not fascinate me - I am British" is delivered in a very flat way (a very similar line is spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS) a script with no characterization , Plotting and memorable dialogue. It is not only the fact that the dialogue is unforgettable, it is also rare and rare, as the monsters do not speak. Would not it have been better to have the bad bad guys like in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so that they could explain the plot. Does anyone know what the plot is here? <br /> <br /> A very boring British movie that even the twin talents of Caroline Munro can not save. The entire mood of the film is summarized by the last sequence with two Keystone cops
