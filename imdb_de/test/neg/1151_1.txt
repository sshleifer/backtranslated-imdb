Let me begin with the obvious: Anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, found in many societies, killing millions of Jews. The problem with this film, however, is that it sees the United States - probably the most inviting society of all Jews outside Israel - as a not-quite-different place than Nazi Germany. The film is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts to wear glasses! After that, some very unpleasant things happen to him (he loses his job and can not find a new one, his neighbors avoid him and end up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self-pitying, patronizing novels, the kind that gave liberalism a bad name.
