The director / screenwriter Diane English of George Cukor's MGM classic (1939) from 2008 unfortunately shows more mothballs than her predecessor. Based on Clare Booth, Luces sharp-witted, attentive observers of 1936 on the relationships that develop between a strictly female group of spoiled Manhattan socialists, the story seems ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, due to the thematic overlap of the English language, the production appears as an extended therapy session with a lack of wit. Moreover, the different lifestyles of women in this film today have been reduced to stereotypes at the sitcom level, and the original concept of eliminating men seems to be in the face of open pansexual development, which is the case for both men and men , many more scary women since the 1930s. The insult to the injury has been improved by the recent adaptation of HBO's "Sex and the City" (HBO) "Sex and the City", which triggered this kind of adoption of men and women much better and with much sharper fangs. <br /> <br /> The Skeleton of the Original Game Remains At the center of the story is the affluent Mary Haines, who gave up her promising career as a design designer to become the dedicated wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like "Sex and the City" she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful editor-in-chief of Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada" (another film of these echoes); the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen, who keeps the wife at home; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent any oppressed group that is generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. A mouth-watering manicurist tells her that Mary's husband has an affair with the ogre Crystal Allen, a perfume girl from Saks who is more than willing to break a marriage while trying to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter much as it becomes a series of scenes that focus on sisterly bondage and quarreling without being very enlightening and without the satirical impulse that triggered the 1939 film. Strange Glances Meg Ryan, a 47-year-old girl, seems to be playing Mary trying to get the good will she had in the 1990s with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in." Seattle "has revived. It's not that she is not age-appropriate here, but her familiar lightheartedness seems to contradict the passive nature of the figure. Annette Bening gets a little better in Sylvie's scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role because she has proven to be capable of imparting harshness and masking vulnerability, but her character undergoes such a banal transformation that she seriously considers the actress's performance undermines. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a flat, transparent shopgirl against the smart, sharp-edged biscuit that Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are marginalized as Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen than Mary's clever, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as a non-nonsense housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The lackluster box office response is probably reflected in the release of the film. The 2008 DVD is not robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night out in contrast to Mary's lavish garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent who advises Mary on a late night yoga - Camp Two featurettes complete the extras "The Women: The Legacy" about the film's story from the 1936 original and "The Women Behind The Women", in which the cast and crew talk endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-determination is that this version of "The Women," directed and directed by a woman, has such a patronizing look on women.
