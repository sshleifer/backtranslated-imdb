It lent scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The humor is so dry, thoughtful and hackneyed that one can not help but occasionally laugh at its insanity and the fact that one observes it. Exactly what to expect from a HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and go with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious gap in this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are bad compared to his Hollywood colleagues. There is an excessive dependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is the end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in "Journey to the West" (JW) that this alternative explanation does not work well with the plot. Despite its many shortcomings, this film has far more entertainment value than the other film in which Nicholas Tse - The Promise - has played.
