Milla is characterized in this film by her personal style and the way the clothes hang on her. I've learned to hate that crumpled little three-year-old face when she pretends to cry. It brings out all the points that she as a serious actress tries to sell quickly. Of course, she still shines in a movie with BALDWIN and Denise as a mature actor. David seemed to make Woody Allen over Howdy Doody. Not a single word or gesture throughout the movie seemed sincere or even sincere. "How Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral", even "Sleepless In Seattle" had screenplays, film locations and actors. The script seemed to be a series of bad and crude jokes that were separated by MUCH SPEAK. The locations seemed to be only a few blocks apart. There are only two actors in this confrontation with an indie band, Milla and the lady who played the chick standing in the stars. I watched most of it the first time with the sound off, only seen Milla. This deep-drawn gag was old when I saw it for the first time, and it's a stupid ordeal of a song in "How to succeed in the business without really trying."
