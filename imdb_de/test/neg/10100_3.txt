When the Legends is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who later becomes Tom Black Bull, a champion broncider. Grown up in the old ways, Tom gets the name of a white man and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in this world. Embittered by the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment by shooting horses in the rodeo, riding them to death. The film features Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who has earned a reputation as a horse slayer in the rodeo arenas. Well, you should read the book, this movie does not come close to the story.
