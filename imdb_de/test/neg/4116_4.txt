Yeah sure, the movie looked pretty awful and was not very promising, but the premise and the cast looked good, so I still expected to be entertained by this movie. Unfortunately this was not the case. The premise is good, but the story is full of improbabilities and logically flawed. <br /> <br /> This movie is potentially flushed the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventurous movie. However, this movie is not entertaining and I think that this is the biggest mistake of this movie. Maybe it takes itself too seriously and a little more humor would certainly have done the film no harm. Instead, it's nothing more than a lame and cheap-looking movie filled with one unlikely event after another that steals a bit too much from other, more successful films. Mainly "Jurassic Park" obviously. <br /> <br /> The characters also do not help to make the movie more interesting or at least more interesting. I still think that Edward Burns has done a pretty decent job as a "heroic" lead. The rest of the characters, however, are really involved in the film and there is little interesting to do. The movie relies more on the visual, which is extremely bad. Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character. Basically, her character complains and talks about how right she was and the rest, so wrong. Her character is just not sympathetic. And the rest of the characters ... well, I've already forgotten their names, I think that says enough about them. It's certainly true that Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth seeing. He is truly outstanding in his kind of villainous business role, but from the moment he disappears from the movie, the movie really goes downhill fast. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is extremely bad. It has some horrible-looking CGI effects and they could not even convince the simpler "blue-screen" effects in the movie. The sets also look awful and cheap, as if they could tip over and collapse at any moment. <br /> <br /> The movie never gets tense, exciting or adventurous as the story is brought in the least interesting and compelling way. It's a very distant movie with distant characters that does not impress. There are many action sequences, but they are all so ridiculous and untrustworthy that they never get tense or good enough. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie lacks anything that is needed for a genre movie like this is a good and successful one. It's sad to see director Peter Hyams drop in recent years after making good films in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
