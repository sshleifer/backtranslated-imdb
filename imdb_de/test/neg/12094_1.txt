I have not reviewed anything here for quite some time, but having had the misfortune to torture myself through this garbage, I had to recite my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Usually, no matter how bad something is, there is a redeeming part, be it an actor who was in order, a passable scene, an attractive actor or a general feel-good moment. Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as the movie starts terribly, with a ridiculous shoot-out that was so bad I thought it was an exercise and two half-timers, also referred to as the boys talking next to a school One of those idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only played in that role, but actually directed that trash and, unlike his brothers, can not trade in toffee. Not that he was alone here, as each of them seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimpanzee. Luckily, certainly for me, I have only seen one hour of this masterpiece, as DVD would not work and was probably made by the same fools who produced it. So if you have nothing to do but pay attention to dry paint, watch it because it is just as boring and ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
