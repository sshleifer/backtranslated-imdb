That is absolutely terrible. It is everywhere and nowhere and has no meaning. I never understood what was good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so over this jerk that she must have been personal friends with the people involved because she had by no means read any part of this so-called "script" and thought, "Yes, I want that!" In most movies, I can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. There are ZERO of this in this. It is extremely stupid. There is really no other word to describe this. This is probably the biggest waste of money in producing films that I have seen in a long time. Skip this at any price, you will not regret it.
