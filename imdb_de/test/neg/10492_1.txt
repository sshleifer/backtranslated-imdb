Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywood's pretty leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds how he makes movies. I remember him in "Tarantula", where he was not bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend. The monster is stupid, uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People are running around. There are events that do not advance the story. There is always dancing and then there is no attack. There is an idiotic love triangle that nobody could care about. It is not even combative or unheard of. It's just not worth anything. Agar might as well have been a sentry. He has nothing to do.
