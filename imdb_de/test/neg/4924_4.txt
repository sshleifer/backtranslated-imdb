Cackiness and atmosphere of this film, but unfortunately also the pressure I have just viewed. Raymond Massey delivers a laid-back Sherlock Holmes, almost funny in early scenes in his robe, which he exchanges for work clothes, to see the sinister mansion of Dr. Catherine. Rylott (Lyn Harding) to investigate. I did not realize why Rylott wanted his stepdaughters dead. If, as in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), he did not want her to run to marry, he would have done the same if he had sent her. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities are also available. After setting an early wedding date with Helen, the fianc√©e is no longer heard for the rest of the picture. The presence of a group of Gypsies at the time of Violet Stoner's death is merely a distraction, and what could have been an interesting killing tool, a venomous snake, is blurred by the fact that it is not a cobra, despite the Indian servant , Athole Stewart competently describes the assistant to Dr. med. Watson, though it takes some getting used to, when Nigel Bruce is more of your cup of tea. As Rylott, Lyn Harding is sufficiently threatening, a trait well-used as Holmes' nemesis professor Moriarty in two later films - 1935 "The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes" and 1937 "Murder in the Baskervilles". <br /> <br /> With repeated interruptions and an unstable camera, it is surprising that the action is not disturbed more than it is. Its integrity is generally maintained, even if it stretches a bit to fill in the gaps. I think that would be my main complaint with the film, as the mental bridging of some of the jump cuts in the picture was a real pain.
