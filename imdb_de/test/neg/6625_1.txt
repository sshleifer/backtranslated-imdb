This is what they developed for the first feature film of Prop Comedian Carrot Top. <br /> <br /> A stupid surfer (carrot-type) inherits an R & D company from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things are less than buoyant, but they get a lot worse when the company is threatened by a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt raiders. The most incredible thing about this movie is that the fussy girl Courtney Thorne-Smith would find this red-haired stepchild intriguing in the slightest cases (but then he's just inherited millions). Among the "classic" moments is the comic Larry Miller, who drinks sweat from a plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try out UN funny toilet humor, and that's exactly what this involves - in the toilet ... rinsing twice.
