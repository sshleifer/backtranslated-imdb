The Bone Collector is based in New York City and begins as one of the world's leading criminologists and crime experts. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that makes him a bedridden quadruped. Four years forward & Alan (Gary Swanson) & his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped shortly after New York policewoman Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) was called to a crime scene and finds Alan's buried and mutilated body. Amelia notices unusual crime scene evidence and notes this, which impressed Rhyme when he was asked to work on the case. He quickly realizes that the evidence is cryptic evidence of Lindsay's whereabouts. After breaking the clues, the cops come too late to save them, but this is only the beginning when a sadistic serial killer continues to leave forensic evidence to Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br / > Director: Phillip Noyce Yesterday I saw The Bone Collector and I have to say it's one of the worst budgets after The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995), which I've seen as a serial killer thriller. Friday is the 13th (1980)) look sophisticated and realistic! The script of Jeremy Iacone is based on the book by Jeffery Deaver and is so poor on so many levels that I hardly know where to start. For starters, it takes deadly serious and that makes all other mistakes seem twice as bad. The characters are really terrible and I did not think any of them were real people. First, we have Lincoln Rhyme paralyzed from the neck down. There's just not much the script can do to him, in fact, literally, he can do nothing but lie in bed for the whole movie. Anelia seems to be impressed because she stopped a train and thought a new footprint near a murdered person might be relevant. I'm not funny here, but would not a cop realize that a footprint near a murder victim could be significant? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney, who is not only unlikely and does not call anyone for any obvious reason, but is so incompetent that he has failed to connect several killers committed in a short time and each victim of meat and meat Skin had been surgically removed from the body. How exactly did this guy become a police captain? Then there is the murderer whose motives are less than plausible. Are you trying to tell me that they have come up with a complicated plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for actually doing something? If they wanted to take revenge on Rhyme, why would they kill all the other people who had no connection to anything, maybe I could buy someone to take revenge on the guy who puts them down, but do not kill several other people who are not connected have to themselves The intended target Rhyme is something else. After devising a complicated plan to kill and get away with these people, they suddenly become the stupidest person in the story, having a quadriplegic despite the big knife and the ability to walk and use their arms defeated and nearly killed Who has no movement in his body under his neck! How did this happen? I should also mention Amelia, who is a terrible figure. She actually buys her own camera to take photos of crime scenes and shoots at rats for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from some of the worst characters ever story and action It's not much better. We never know why the killer uses The Bone Collector as inspiration. We never know why the killer has taken strips of meat from his victims. It has never been explained why a rookie officer like Amelia is allowed to enter even the right forensic teams in crime scenes. There is no reason why the killer selects his victims. The references to the killers are a bit obscure, right? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically, how do you go from a bone & rat hair to the exact location of the next victim & have all New York to choose from? There is some nonsense about a bird sitting on the Rhymes window sill, which is completely random and takes almost two hours. The Bone Collector is really slow. So much is wrong with The Bone Collector. It all boils down to one of the worst scripts ever. It is abominable at all levels and has no credibility. Apparently, Angelina Jolie has stated that she did nude scenes for this film, but they were cut because they were considered too distracting. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of about $ 48 million, The Bone Collector is well-made with good production values ​​& that Hollywood glitz about it. I must also add that I think that Angelina Jolie offers one of the worst performances I have ever seen. I think she is absolutely terrible. Denzel Washington is just there, Queen Latifah is terrible and even Michael Rooker can not do much, since he is stuck with a stereotypical and one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The Bone Collector Must Be One of Them The worst Hollywood movies I've seen in a long time I saw on TV last night for free and I still feel cheated and torn. There are just so many things to put holes in the fools, embarrassingly bad, or is that supposed to be terribly embarrassing? Works either way, to be honest ...
