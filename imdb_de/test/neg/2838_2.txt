Traffic guard cut to death? Should we feel sorry for empty, head-and-money-obsessed owners? Uh ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it is not a very well made movie with bad acting and rough effects. The climate scene is especially stupid. You can almost see the director shouting to the stuntman "Action" as he falls through the glass of the window Nadir from Adrienne Barbeau's career.
