Plants in an ancient Mayan pyramid structure kill all who come near. Yeah, it's weird because the travelers do not figure it out before everything goes crazy. And in a movie like this, I just wish it was absurd and there were marching bands being attacked by machetes. <br /> <br /> A group of people from America are on holiday and go with a few people in the mountains other new German friends who know the place. When they got there, Mayans began yelling at them and hiding on the structure. When the plants decide to take them out, they mimic the sounds of cell phones, humans, and ancient Mayan dead. <br /> <br /> Nothing was really scary in terms of the movie and not even entertaining. Not even the weird end could save that piece of crap. I've always been looking for something really good, but nothing. Well. "F"
