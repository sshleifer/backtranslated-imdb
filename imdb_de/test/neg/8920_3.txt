Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing drug dealers of drugs and giving them to the poor and unfortunate ... hh, Harlan, the Robin Hood. In any case, Harlan wants to go straight for his girl Jada (Mari Morrow), so he takes on a job as a driver of an armored car for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, wasted in a signed role). Max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous employees, with the intention of using his loader Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him the money, but Harlan has other plans. Escaping from the police, hiding the money and dumping Bruno (who had threatened with a loaded weapon on Harlan's head, who would shoot him if he had not driven), after he had rammed a huge dump truck, Harlan falls out. Harlan is accused of murdering the police, among other things because of the damage caused by the rapid chase. Harlan is imprisoned and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins in with an inmate, Ice (Treach), a leader of one of the many gangs in jail, and breaks out with the plans to find Max and eliminate every member of his corrupt allegiance. Soon DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) will be part of this scenario thanks to her boss Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims that it is a drug. Harlan's desire to save a Children's Hospital on the brink of closure is fed into the plot, and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. Seagal and Treach talking to each other while Buxton wants to spend time helping Harlan discover the possibility that her boss is with Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck that leaves Rachel plenty of scope despite the threat to her career. Tighe shows shorts for about five minutes, which is a pity. Seagall's Harlan escapes the jail and finds every wealthy member of Max. He inevitably discovers his whereabouts after he has cracked a few skulls, pierced some wrists, and fractured some bones. Treach speaks in his rapper speech and Seagal tries to answer him in a way and mocks involuntarily. As expected, many people are shot and Seagal does not burn. It's interesting to see Seagal in jail among the convicts who support Treach as a group of "eses" intends to kill him.
