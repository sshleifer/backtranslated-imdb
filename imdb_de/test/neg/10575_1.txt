This was the stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I saw this movie with my friends and when the movie was over there was not a single person in the cinema - not that there were many people watching this horrible movie. Someone actually went out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My girlfriend put her head against the end in my shoulder, because after the scene in which Rick had pissed on the ceiling, she had enough. It was not funny at all. Believe me, I was with 11 other girls and none of my friends liked it. It was ridiculous! I've seen a lot of movies, but that was absolutely the worst! I mean, a scene in the movie is about an old man hanging around a coffin with a dead man. I just can not invent these things.
