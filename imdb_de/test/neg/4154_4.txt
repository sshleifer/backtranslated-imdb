An epic story of hope, limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. As Terrence Malick spawned this, I expected something frightening and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), In which - possibly - good intentions are undermined by a terrible screenplay and in which many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. The English dialogue "Ich-Tarzan-Du-Jane" between the non-English-speaking protagonists is particularly curly? One could speculate whether Nick Nolte and Tim Roth made their own commercials, as they sound almost like real people. The story is full of implausibility: Binh is expected to speak some English after living as a peasant slave all his life (his vocabulary, but unfortunately no grammatical command, impressively enhances the value of night classes in the Malayan refugee camp). Chance is widespread; I wonder if one or two hours from the first third have been worked out: He's almost immediately looking for his mother in Ho Chi Minh City - after meeting his thirty-year-younger half-brother who casually recognizes him! Mama gives him a golden medallion (or something of great value) when they part, but this is never mentioned again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling should convey the obligatory "love interest", but feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs Of New York". <br /> <br /> The journey in the grate of a boat conveys a sense of the appalling conditions that trafficking entails. In fact, the film is only exciting and unpredictable from a distance, the jerky, hand-held footage taken from the bridge in troubled weather conditions. (By the way: a boat trip from Malaysia to New York via the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast without refueling or supplies is certainly an epic journey). The beautiful setting of the New York skyline reflects Malick's magical hour, but I want to know why the Coast Guard did not show up. Maybe they saw the Super Bowl or something. Of course, Binh manages to track down his blind old father on a remote farm in Texas, with the same navigation he showed in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed how Nick Nolte could dig through fields and feed horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or a white cane. To show how a story about the troubles, the refugees can be hit, structured and taken on a small budget, take a look at Michael Winterbottom's far superior "In This World".
