DANGER: Watch for falling spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Boy, that was a bad movie. I know they wanted to "conquer true love," but for this movie, it was about 3 hours (after 9 hours) of my afternoon, which I'll never get back. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta living in a fantasy world in a remote city. Kai is the most maltreated pageboy in a hotel owned by Gerta's father. Gerta ignores Kai's progress at first, but she finally warms up to the point of disgusting (You Guought It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle were not enough to overcome it, a wicked Snow Queen shoots a piece of broken glass in Kai and he becomes a common person who mistreates Gerta. Kai is eventually taken to the Fortress of the Snow Queen (the same sentence as the hotel, which is currently covered in ice, because the good people of Hallmark are eager to do it), and Gerta sets off to bring Kai back. Along the way, she encounters the three other seasons that are evil in her own way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some boring and forgetful characters she encounters along the way. (You'll want to turn it off all the time, but you can not force yourself to do it.) It's probably the most vicious and effective magic of the Snow Queen.) Anyway, I'll save you in the end, because you can do everything. Now think in yours Head is probably better than how they ended it. The Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie that takes the fan out of his imagination.
