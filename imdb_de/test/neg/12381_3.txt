This is as cheesy as they come? The concept of a massive and indestructible alien bird is too boring for words, but wait until you get a load of Goofy creature as it appears on screen! I'm telling you that I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed some exposure dialogues? On the other hand, the latter is often so difficult in the scientific jargon and the laws of physics and those (in which I've never been good, despite my love for science fiction movies) that it was not really important anyway! The bird ?? first presented as a mere blurred form that flits through the sky, but then is shown in all its stupid splendor? is so indescribably stupid that it would not be a pity in a Looney Tunes cartoon (the series of intermittently shot photos that begin with the creature in the distance and end on an extreme close-up of her face)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears had gone much better with his other UFO movie, the fine EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS (1956)? with special effects provided by a master, Ray Harryhausen (of which I have already spoken, I have just given away my copy of it to acquire Columbia's recent SE DVD); In addition, it seems to me that some of the images that illustrate the bird's tantrum in New York were lifted from the destruction of Washington in this earlier science fiction classic! Again, are the leads played by genre regulars? namely Jeff Morrow (by THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (by TARANTULA [1955]); As with the FLYING SAUCERS mentioned above, these titles are very popular with fans. Consequently, they are far superior to this regrettable addition to the alien / monster beast cycle during the sci-fi heyday and beyond (other flying threats included in THE FLYING SERPENT [1946] I did not see, and Larry Cohen's humorous update of them Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, THE GIANT CLAW can not even reach a proper climax, so in a hurry to be a "wash-out" to a jet pilot out of the To cite film itself, whose missile attack on the bird proves to be completely ineffective (that is, before Morrow realizes that he is screened by an invisible barrier and then has a way to penetrate it) Relentless (and honestly boring) technical advice gives you the feeling, "so bad, it's good," if you observe that: after all, it only takes 74 minutes? And in any case, the Vog It's an unforgettable, stupid creation that conjures up a smile on your face every time it appears!
