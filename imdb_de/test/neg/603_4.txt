I found that this movie was mainly a POSIT, but that's not the problem. The problem is that the movie is just lame. It does not really make much sense, but that's not what I mean. There was no reason for everything. The movie also moved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than this. That meant they were too crude, but the killer just seemed to spend too much time slapping his victim or stabbing his victim. Maybe I'm petty, but I just did not like the movie. The whole thing seemed to be a lower version of "When a Stranger Calls" and maybe that was the key point of Strange Kills "is a 4/10 *
