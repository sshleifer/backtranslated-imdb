Mickey Rourke chasing Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It's not that Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. He had a number of appearances before he came back on the scene. He was memorable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. However, in his dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a full-scale depiction of the character, hinted at only in Get Carter. Whenever we meet him, Rourke remains a cool, but lean, muscular, slender ball. <br /> <br /> This is an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such notable films as Western Thriller 3:10 to Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys, some good, some not so good. <br /> <br /> It also means that we make close, realistic plans with characters doing the best for them in every situation, turning complications into violent inferences. Killshot is no different. The rough, slender ball killer Rourke unfortunately marries the witness Lane. You think, history of violence meets no land for old men. It's not as intense, bloody or bloody as these two, but it's almost as good. If you like these two, including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises, you will also like Killshot. Director John Madden has not made many films. His last few were pleasing, if unsuccessful: Proof, Captain Corelli's mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane has not had a powerful film role since she and Richard Gere made incredible appearances in Unfaithful. Lately she has been charming and appealing in romantic stories like Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is on the right track and balances her sexy charm with restrained suspense. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Nevertheless, Dawson does a good job. You see a lot more of Lane, including a underwear scene that can compete with Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. <br /> <br /> Bang, Bang and Gone Baby Gone, and before the devil knows your dead. The last one has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. If you like this genre, it is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rent. 20/06/2009
