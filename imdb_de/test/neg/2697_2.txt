A former ex-policewoman, drummed out of the power of recklessness (and likely to beat Chuck Norris in the fight), hires herself as a private bodyguard; Her first customer is a worthless Playboy guy. It takes half of the movie until it is kicked by the force first. There are many great fighting choreographies, but the storyline strictly depends on the numbers and the drama is as wooden as the dialogue. Miss this one.
