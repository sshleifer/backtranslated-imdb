Well, I look at tons of movies and this one is really shitty ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all tired and tired of the cheap trick of making vampire movies with some "Martial Arts Teacher" characters. I'm also so tired of the guy who knows some form of fighting technique and then can fight through a boring movie. I forced myself to look at it, and one of the main reasons was that the lead actress is pretty pretty (Ha-Ha). Well, I hope that helped a bit. Well, hopefully this kind of movies will not be released one day, but hey, where will all the low budget actors go :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also contains a lot of bloops, which I'll leave to you, because it is a lot of fun watching and even if you are a bit perfectionist, it will bother you ;-) Cheers!
