When I saw the poster in the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story, without a famous cast would be worth a try. But after I went in, I wanted to go after 20 minutes. There were many nonsensical and logical shortcomings. For me, it's a movie that's not worth showing in the cinemas. It is not even worth seeing.
