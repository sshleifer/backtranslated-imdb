Who wrote this strip? A non-inspired 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> Could have been written by one of the kids who graduated from the Columbine shoot br /> <br /> Also: The French do not set flags everywhere. They do not go to a French bank and see the tricolor flag like this. Even on the Bastille day. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bloodbath thing. It's just that none of it is believable or funny. Or parodic or something like that. <br /> <br /> Ok, those who liked this streak will tell you that I have to be a kind of fascist, so forget about my comment.
