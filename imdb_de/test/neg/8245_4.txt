I'm shattering my mind, but I'm not thinking of another movie like the Gwangi Valley. A western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You have to wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> The story? In search of a mythical miniature horse for their circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the characters / characters enter a strange, lost valley. There you will not only find the miniature horse, but also other fearsome creatures. Dinosaurs dominate this place. Would not that be an attraction in TJ's circus? a caged T-Rex? <br /> <br /> It's not that I consider the Gwangi Valley to be a bad movie, I just did not enjoy it so much like many others who posted comments on the movie. There are some parts that I find almost unsurpassable. In the first half of the movie just does not seem to be busy. I was not bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective that I would use. To crown it, the film offers a very invented love story. It feels like the authors have decided that the male and female leads would just have to come together. But the Gwangi Valley is not a total waste. There are moments that I really enjoyed. Who can not get out of the scenes of the cowboys on the back of a horse trying to lasso a T-Rex? You do not see something like that every day. The creatures of Ray Harryhausen are impressive. There are some really cool shots of Harry Hausen's miniatures interacting with humans and horses. It may not be the best of his work, but the effects are very nice. At least in my mind, these good moments are not enough to overcome the negatives. As much as I hate it, I have to rate the Gwangi Valley at 4/10.
