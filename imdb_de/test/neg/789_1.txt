I like movies, but I have not found anything in The Box. I was interested in the "hook" of the plot, but unfortunately it never went anywhere and could not be tracked. Anyone who claims that he understands this movie is likely to falsify the movie so he can feel part of something. Well, I have news for him, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> This film is about making women responsible for the original sin and corruption of humanity. I have heard this story before and makes less and less sense. It is true that this film is different than many films currently shown in theaters, but that's not worth the ticket price.
