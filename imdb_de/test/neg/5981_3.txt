What a waste of a great cast. I thought I'd take a look, because it looked like a good Stoner comedy with a lot of well-known actors. What turned out was a pointless collection of boring, interlocking stories about several characters with minimal connections. Characters who start to look like decent people do not have a single sympathetic or interesting character. I also called it a comedy. The only thing that made me giggle was Jack Black's song, which was basically Tenacious D.
