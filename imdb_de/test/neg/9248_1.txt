... or should I say weirdly unintentionally? In any case, this is one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time. I laughed at the antics of some of the stupidest fictional characters on this site by Homer Simpson. It's just a forehead-slap, painfully stupid scene after another, while the clown-addicted cardboard cutouts, which are replaced by real humanoid characters, push, pull and pull the "conspiracy" to their inevitable and obvious conclusion. > If I had to describe this film to anyone, I would call it a mutated hybrid of Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber and the Three Stooges, with a "climax" that is eerily similar to the episode of Family Guy, in which the whole family gets involved in a dejected fist fight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Note to the Benson family: next time you get a new pet, do a favor to the poor animal and do not call it Fred!
