In this terrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, some people go to Africa to investigate a creature called Half-Caste. It's pretty obvious that there was no script to talk about and that everything was improvised. This can work if you have good actors, which this movie did not do. <br /> <br /> This film seeks to gain points of originality by exploring an obscure myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes in the bush where characters eat "quirky African stuff" like elephant dung. There are also some pretty good pictures of lions (from the point of view of National Geographic), but there is no fear throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will not surprise you, and you can probably see better lion footage on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely half an aste. <br /> <br /> A note to the filmmakers: Guys, do us all a favor and next time save the "How I spent my African holiday" home movie for your family and close friends. Nobody wants to see it.
