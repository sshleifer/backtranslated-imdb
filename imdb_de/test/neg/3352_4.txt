I'd never heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone on a horror message board mentioned it, and as I read that I was interested in Meg Tilly's involvement and the realization that it was an early one Appearance for Friday acts. JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately it is nothing special. The premise has a familiarity: A college girl has to survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning to join a student. This girl is a young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to prove to her loving, caring boyfriend Steve (David Mason Daniels) that she can do his cruel, dispassionate ex-girlfriend, Carol's (Robin Evans) sorority, regardless of tactics She pulls to see how she fails. Along with Carol's gang are Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily), who does not really want to cause Julie any trouble. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while she stays in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torture the poor girl. In the meantime, Steve is looking for her while Julie, Carol and Kitty encounter an evil that they can not imagine. The body of a recently diseased "psychic vampire," whose telekinesis had a dangerously severe degree, will drain her from her own body's vitality. The only one who can help this girl is the dead man's daughter, Olivia (Melissa Newman), who has the same psychic power he has. <br /> <br /> I think what many find exciting is the unusual evil threatens the girl in the mausoleum, it is certainly something other than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at that time. Just as the character of Adam West (... he was the cynical husband of Olivia, who found the idea of ​​her father's power ridiculous), it was really hard for me to adapt to the difficult action, and personally, I never found anything in the movie that got me upset. The mausoleum was never really so scary to me (... it does not really reach the same uncanny quality that captured PHANTASM), and the corpses the girls are attacked with are ridiculously unconvincing (.. there's a great Scene in which one's face melts away). I have a penchant for low-budget movies from that time, but I could never really find a reason to engage myself if you have this unsatisfactory undead corpse shooting electrical bolts out of their eyes, causing others Solve body from its crypts Obey its master It's just too stupid to take it seriously. Carol is your typical blonde slut who wants to punish a pretty girl who has a former flame. Steve is your typical, sparkling, pure American friend, good-looking and tender. He becomes a hero who wants to save his girl from the evil forces. To make up for the small budget director McLoughlin, McLoughlin tries every trick to thrill the audience by using a series of Ooga Booga effects, such as bodies tracking young girls, chairs trembling and trembling, doors The movie has obviously fans, and I'm glad I could see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was not the horror sleeper I was hoping for. Adam West has a very small role, as the worried husband hopes his wife will be torn from their depressed state for a father who has nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is troubled Olivia who realizes that she has to stop her father once and for all, or he will continue to live on the living. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Olivia's dad, who tells her what he was. I was not particularly excited about Tilly's performance (she was scared most of the time), but she would get a chance to prove herself stronger from that point on. This will undoubtedly be of value to those who saw it then. For reasons of nostalgia, it could seduce fans of films from this period.
