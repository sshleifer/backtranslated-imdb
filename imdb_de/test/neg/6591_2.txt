This movie was shot in my hometown and I knew many of the "actors" in smaller parts. Most of them were students of the local karate school, and even at the time the movie was made, we all knew what a stinker that was. However, it was interesting to see how it was done. Most of the places where it was filmed no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizza shop, etc. The "world premiere" took place at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically at how crazy it was. Personally, I think it's the worst movie ever made, but it brings back many nice memories. Watch this movie with some advice ... enjoy it for what it is ... a very low budget, poorly done, karate snippets.
