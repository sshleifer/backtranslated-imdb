Experienced actors in this field know how to behave, and have already proven it, but the director who also wrote and produced this travesty is incompetent on so many levels. OK. It's a low budget, but I know film students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors who can do much, much better. For example, with people involved who needed to know better, some of the shooting ranges were completely inappropriate and never existed back then. The stunts were awkward - the story was old and hokey. If someone gives you a copy of it, use it as a coaster. By the way, I love Western and have met many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors.
