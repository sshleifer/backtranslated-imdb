Honestly, I do not know why this show lasted so long. Well, humor is subjective, how? But yes, this show is unbelievably listless if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. The boys are annoying. Al is annoying. The neighbor is annoying. it's just more annoying than funny. The actions are all the same, Tim makes Jill angry and needs to get things right again. and the last seasons? The less she was told, the better, who the hell would be good for a damn sitcom? yes, great idea twitches. Yes, DIY is not a very good sitcom. I would recommend you to watch News Radio or Seinfeld. If I had to rate this show, I would give it 1/10 because it never made me laugh. ever. yes, it's still better than The Nanny.
