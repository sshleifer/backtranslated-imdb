Since many have been described with a level of sincerity that I find amusing, this is * not *: <br /> <br /> A FILM. (Cue Dramatic Music) <br /> <br /> It's just so bad - it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan is an all-rounder. The fighters are totally crazy and Jackie is definitely in his place. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that you would like to see along with good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by little appetizers, ready to roar with laughter, cheer the good guys, cheer the bad guys and keep screaming , "WHAT?" when something completely bizarre happens. Have fun!!
