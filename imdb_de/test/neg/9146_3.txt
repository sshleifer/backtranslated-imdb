A boring effort by not-so-great director Budd Boetticher and handsome, but not yet unfriendly actress Nina Foch. This film is, as one of the other critics, the quintessence of a particular B-movie. It's just not the kind. A promising premise and an overactive fogger are wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic Act - Nina, a nurse released from the war because of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing guy at the resort, where she gives her nerves a respite, and realizes that he is in a dream, even if she has never met him before. Meanwhile, it turns out that our dashing guy works as a spy, and goes on an extra secret, mysterious mission that must not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course there are Nazis. And plot holes. And smart people who act in such a way that they most likely end up in unnecessary scratches, reducing the runtime by one hour. In the end, the film becomes a competition between which a group of spies can act more foolishly. If the FBI and OSS behaved like this crew, we would have lost the war in '42. <br /> <br /> The film itself (despite the best efforts of the Fog Machine) and the drama is rather flat - as it seems in many of the Columbia B's, TCM has been showing lately - strangely it's not engaged. It's less stylized than what you could find in a similarly budgeted Warner Bros movie, but also less fun to watch. The strength of Boetticher, of course, is more a matter of factual style, which allows for the strong stories and stories allowed in his Randolph Scott Western to come to the fore. The problem may be that such a style will not work if the script is lousy and the actors are tired of their five films a year.
