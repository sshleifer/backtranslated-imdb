Andrew Gurland's "Cheats" is his fictionalized "true story" about four high school friends who manage to cheat tests. The quartet is: the cocky school haters Trevor Fehrman (as Handsome Davis), his equally handsome buddy Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), his chubby schoolmate Elden Henson (as Sammy) and the crooked geekster Martin Starr as Applebee). Adults include strict North Point boss Mary Tyler Moore (as Mrs. Stark) and pornographic daddy Griffin Dunne (as Mr. Davis). The high-freaks start with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence, who are reportedly urinating on a teacher's teacher's book. Put this down here on the stack. and be thankful that it is not on a permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
