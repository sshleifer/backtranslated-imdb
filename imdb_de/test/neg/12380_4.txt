Personally, I have no problems with the drama or the script. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was just WONDER. Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is the laughter when you see it. What did they think? Budget is damned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. <br /> <br /> If the producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, I think they would have the special effect that people can imagine a lot better animal. Well. What is done is done. This will be the case of the eternal joke that was unintentional.
