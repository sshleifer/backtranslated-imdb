I worked in a video library. I saw this title in the horror department and took it home for free as a free night. <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible, there is no redeeming quality, as it actually needs a respected sub-genre of movie and just goes to destroy it. If the first movie was not cheap enough, then this film really takes the biscuit, since it is (mostly) indoors and at night ... and thus avoids the scenic cost of the first film. In the first 5 minutes of this movie, a college lecturer is weirdly overflowing an attractive student. Instead of being humiliated, the lecturer apologizes half-heartedly and the girl mentions that, even though he was thrown over the hood (he quickened as he approached her), there is nothing to fear from which he kills her with a crowbar you! If that's not strange enough, he wants to do an experiment with her to bring her back from the dead ... and therefore feels forced to take off her clothes to do so. <br /> <br /> Soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is prevalent throughout the movie and, frankly, is the only thing that interests the average male viewer ... like the swim scene in the first movie ... but also that this was said The film gets worse and worse with its bad character, the crappy dialogue and the absurd twists of the movie. Why do we introduce a central character who has survived 29 days after a zombie attack just to kill them in 10 minutes ... it's just a very, very bad movie
