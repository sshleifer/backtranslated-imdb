I saw this in my supermarket and knew that Debra was there. So I decided to buy it (without support for this sexy woman!). The plot and acting in this movie was awful (with the exception of Debra Wilson and me) I not only say because I love her, she was really the only actor or actor who had an emotion in her acting and voice!) What I did not get at the beginning is why the woman did not just come back in to run her car instead of being so random. It was so stupid. And it's LA (NEVER saw her being kidnapped on a public residential street - NEVER ... yes, that's realistic!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason), they were totally determined to see him (and someday) to find them when they found him, they had him at gunpoint - about a MOB! In fact, I doubt that the LAPD would go out of their way for a stupid phone! The lady could have run to one of these many cell phone booths and have them replaced! The acting skills of the children were also shit (I think they were reading from a cue card or had someone whispering from the camera) because they were asked questions and they looked around and then answered with a questionable voice (ie "yes") Miss Papa? ") How could it be that all these snipers are in the trees and build roofs in LA without being seen?! I see this being played in the US at 3 o'clock in the morning. <br /> <br / > Debra Wilson fanatics will enjoy their games, she's the only actor with real acting skills (Debra, Darling - stop making that cheap D-class, go straight to videofilms ... maybe that will change with the upcoming movie Whitepaddy .) It brings some jokes in (like when one of her superiors comes in and asks her who she's talking to, she yells at her computer and goes to "Damnit, Charlie!" I gave her only 4/10 ... 4, just because Debra has good acting skills.
