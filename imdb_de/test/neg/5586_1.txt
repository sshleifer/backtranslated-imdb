I borrowed this movie for $ 5 and I was sorry that I did it ... I would not give it a 5c if I knew it. This is the worst film ever to take place ... None of the filming locations was in former Yugoslavia. What did the ... ??? English actors try to speak Serbian, eg. I act as if they were Serbs and they did a terrible job. My first language is Serbian, and I could not understand what they were muttering about. They drove a big jeep to a country where three parties (Croats, Serbs and Muslims) are at war wrote peace 4 Sarajevo ??? Ha, ha, how stupid that was ... Do not know why English makes stupid films about this war ... or even if they blame the Serbs for everything Even though there were two more sides in a war. And we all know that they killed too, not only that they were innocent and held up, so at least they should show the whole truth. This movie also shows Harrison's Flowers, Behind Hostile Lines, The Hunt Party and a few others were total nonsense, and that's been proven. The hunting party was the biggest loser in 2007/08. She spent 20 Mil 4 and they earned 800,000 ha, ha, what a crap ... The truth will come sooner or later. Proud to be Serb!
