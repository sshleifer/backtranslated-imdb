The story is that a troupe of turn-of-the-century actors has very complicated relationships with producers and theater owners. A local playwright has written a psychological drama. He wants to have good production on stage, but only if he persuades a certain reviewer to revise the production and give a positive rating. If its production does not continue, the troupe will invest The Doll House, which was recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships between clients are explored. None of them interesting. The involvement of the characters, however, meant that the piece of the resident player received a second shot. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pardon for the director and his friends. The storylines are incoherent for anyone who is not a celebrity friend. The only reason I did not leave the theater after about half an hour is because a fat woman at the end of my rowing rests resting a full meal on her stomach.
