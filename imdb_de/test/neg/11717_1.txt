After completing this hellish garb, a friend and I swore a solemn vow never to speak of how we had thrown away the last 90 minutes of our lives. This movie is completely pointless, a two-dimensional hero and heroin we can not scream, whether they survive or not, and some of the meanest villains that ever darken the screen of the horror genre (or any other genre). To prove how utterly meaningless this movie was, I would have liked to add a storyline, but I can not write fiction. All in all, the only reason I can think that anyone would ever want to see this movie is if they've just murdered their entire community and are looking for a smug punishment that will haunt them in years to come!
