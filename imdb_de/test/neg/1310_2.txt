I do not really joke, if I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable for ITV4 on Sunday night. The underground scenes are just terrible when London is said to be under 30 feet of water, so Robert Carlyle's character is drab. The outfit of police commissioners reminds me of something Kate Moss left behind and Nigel Planner looks VERY VERY old, in fact, I'm worried that he may have had a stroke while filming. The Father of Robert Carlyle Those who were "right all the time" evidently angered too much ketamine, and although he plays a big role in this unpleasant journey, he deserves to be killed on the way there before being caught as if he were Kate Winslett (Titanic) while he dangled over the door Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, film lovers, but avoid at all costs.
