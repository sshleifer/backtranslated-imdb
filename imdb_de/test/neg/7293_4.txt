Since Disney often ignored the animation quality and the need for a good plot in their sequels, this was actually a nice surprise. I do not know why Disney does not pay more attention to their sequels. The graphics quality is always inferior; No backgrounds that deserve the name Disney, inhuman acts and inferior dialogues, with little or no attention paid to the actual story, and the cartoon drawings are almost always worse than Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality. <br /> <br /> The animation quality is still poor compared to Disney originals, and the dialogue is pretty trite, the plot and the overall execution were really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not that fascinating, it does not fail to capture the charm and / or the mystery from the beginning. There are some hints of it, which are hidden here and there. <br /> <br /> The kids will definitely like it. <br /> <br /> It rates 4.5 / 10 from ... <br /> the Fiend.
