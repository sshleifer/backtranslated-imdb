In addition to all the negative reviews: I was amazed to see that somewhere a CCTV camera was summoned to an extremely unlikely location to show the 'Crisis' team (see '' Maaaaa-aaam '') which was above all near the Thames barrier, where the professor is hit with full (wind) force against a head of a heavy object and then tells the story. Otherwise, I could not shake off the image of some actors shown in other movies / programs: I said to my wife, "Hey, this is Neil, from the Young Ones" (Nigel Planner) and "Do you have Hercule Poirot for help asked? " ? '(David Suchet). To add to the disgrace of this film (recently shown in two parts on ITV UK), after each episode, ITV gave the phone number of the Environmental Protection Agency to concerned viewers living in areas where "flood risk" exists. How deep can you go as a sender to treat your audience like this? What must the environmental authority have thought? ('' Oh no, it's Mrs. Jones from Hull again, she says she was right the whole time, she saw it on ITV '').
