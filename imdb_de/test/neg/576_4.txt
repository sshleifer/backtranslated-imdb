This film is about a mysterious love letter that turned the love life of four people upside down. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is interesting and the movie could have been funny. However, this movie is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. The characters are initially introduced only insufficient, so it is confusing. The minor characters come and go for no reasonable reason, as if they exist only for a certain scene and then disappear in the air. The tempo is awfully slow, so 90 minutes are more like 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and funny, but, significantly enough, this movie did not do anything.
