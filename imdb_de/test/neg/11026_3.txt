Extremely formulaic with cosmic logic holes and an appearance of comedy. Oh, poor lawyer in NYC! He just scrapes over and if he gets pay cuts, he's not looking for any other work, even though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. We see him arguing in court for others to come and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can not stand anyone in his company. At home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to root for is the last maid who seems to be a real human who employs logic and communication to exist on the internet world. How ridiculous that the girl should bring the lawyer and his wife on New Year's Eve chicken and wine, because they are sorry! (The play was not made to laugh.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just too incredible and with a ** SPOILER slap everyone ends up with a 180 degree end. How did you get top stars for this? If I had been in the studio, I would have returned this one for a complete overhaul.
