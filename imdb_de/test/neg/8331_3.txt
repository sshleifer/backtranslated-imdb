The world seems to be in a strange phase of downsizing as objects like DVD and CD players get smaller and smaller. It's obviously a lot cooler to have a smaller iPod than a bigger one. This is not the case with the cinema screens, as is the case with the IMAX, the huge, well-known theater system that has stunned audiences at its release and until today. As long as the material is right. <br /> <br /> The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D' is that the big screen is the main advantage. He is boring, uninformative and relentlessly zealous Please enjoy his wacky special effects and inspirational quotes from famous names like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Another problem with the movie is that it does not even take time to get together with the lucky ones. Such an extraordinary experience as on the moon: instead, the authors simply pressed COPY and PASTE and famous voices like Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton and Matt Damon hired to imitate her famous quotes. This tactic is relentlessly repetitive and boring. <br/> <br/> I would say without a moment's hesitation that I have not learned any information from the film that I did not already know. <br /> <br /> And it always insisted on irritating the crap out of me with his insistent sentimentality. E In three minutes, Tom Hanks seems to have the voice to say something like "Without the contributions of these brave men and women ...". Watching the movie is like watching a bad commercial. For forty agonizing minutes. <br /> <br /> 1/4
