In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are fighting in a Muay Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks a stranger the direction of the hotel, in fact the common vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and is bitten and abducted by his group of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins a clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao) to try to rescue Amanda from the claws of Niran. The places and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive. Unfortunately, the script and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of Meredith Monroe does not help to lose the breasts. The story is very short and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes of motorcycle racing, fighting and boring flashbacks to achieve a minimal movie runtime. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: The Conversion")
