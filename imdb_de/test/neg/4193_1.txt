Anyone can make a movie these days. Budget, production value or experienced crew do not have to stop the self-described "director" from "fulfilling their dream" these days. Respect for the craft of filmmaking or just respect For any film, aesthetics is no longer a prerequisite for the performance of a film. <br /> <br /> Director Bill Cowell must have thought he had struck gold when Lion's Gate decided to market his original movie as a sequel to a movie he had nothing to do with. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Lion's Gate is far more erroneous than Cowell's in relation to Dark Harvest 2, which is made public. Lion's Gate's misleading commercialization of the film should be investigated by the prosecutor, and Lion's Gate officers should be placed in sulfuric acid and kerosene because they ignore film, filmmaking and common sense. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, it's not even worth commenting.
