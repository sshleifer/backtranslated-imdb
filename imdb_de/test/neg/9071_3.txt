The cast of "All That" returns to the "Good Burger", a place that resembles an old fashioned fast food restaurant. The comedy is great, the fun is non-stop and although clich√© is a passerby for children and family comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie for all ages, this movie is meant to be fun, laugh and be pretty a lazy movie for a rainy day because that would save this movie for me, a rainy day. The US aired it today, and since I know the cast of "All That" is in it, I thought it might be a bit of a giggle, but it's fun to see Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the die the best young duos of that time) were great, the pieces came together and everything worked, and together with a lazy work, it made a good family fun to forget the bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
