When I read the summary of the upcoming movie, my first impression was that it would be very, very different from the book. The movie trailer said the film should take place when Vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in America. She meets Aiden, an up-and-coming graphic novel. If she works in a chocolate shop during the day, she has to admit that she will never be normal because she turns every full moon into a loup-garou - a fabulous creature that can be compared to a werewolf. <br /> Most small changes did not sound so bad to me, even though I'm a fan of the book, which was titled by Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support the book. I thought that changing the age, changing attitudes, and making a few small changes in employment would not affect the plot as a whole to tearing me apart. My eyes snapped out of their eye sockets and I bleed on the floor of the cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie has unnecessarily killed many important characters, including Esme, Vivan's mother, directly in the fire in the alleged fire of killing her father. I pushed that aside and ventured into the movie tired and slightly annoyed. The camera settings were pretty decent in Romania, the scenery was beautiful and the music was ... interesting ... but I got the impression: "Why does Vivian look like that and why is she wearing a hoodie?" I have to say for later parts of the movie That I'm Surprised That the Scriptwriters seemed to be supporting Inzest to a certain extent instead of following the relationship of the characters in the book between Vivian and Rafe, the leader of The Five now became their cousin through them (surprise!) Aunt Astrid, who was the bitter and hated rival of Vivan's mother in the novel, and I'd like to add that she's not in touch with any of them. "Out of character distortions, Gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed with Vivian his partner was so that they could fulfill a nonexistent prophecy, and his physical appearance is not just complete taken from the description in the book, he was apparently also the father of Rafe. Yes, that's right, it's a nice little, incestuous knot of wolves, all packed tight. <br /> <br /> Little things that annoyed me were scenes like forest hunting. There was a redhead who stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed" his enemy before his prey was freed to run and be hunted. Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I think my mind is not big enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the film without explaining why it existed, except to kiss pretty victims. <br /> <br /> I loved how the amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. I loved how lawfully Aiden's past was swallowed up, what between the supposedly dramatic scene in which he told Vivian, how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then put his father together in "self-defense" to make him appear that way a tragic character. <br /> <br /> Character 180s are great fun when they are completely unnecessary. At the end of the film, I felt like a person was skimming through the novel, writing half the list of character names, making a few connections here and there, and mentioning that Gabriel is a bit of a jerk that Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he fears her when he finds out she is a legend, and "someone" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is a happy ending, because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent and the casting could have been worse, but as for the director, why are the loup-garous jumps in human form the air, as if they wanted to fly (with the arched back and the tendency to jump from high places), shimmer briefly and then fall as wolves on the ground? The only aspects of this film that had even intruded on me until the very dirty, sad ending were the wolves, the beautiful scenery and the sweet boys. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to In order to enjoy the movie at all, you have to be prepared for misunderstandings, strange events that are not always explained, incestuous allusions that either did not like the book or that Did not read book.
