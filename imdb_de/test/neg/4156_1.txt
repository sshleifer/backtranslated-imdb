Often the description "full of sound and rage that means nothing" is used and is right on target. Unfortunately, "Code 46" lacks both tone and anger. A little bit of anger would have been appreciated. Tim Robbins character (William) is so passionate that the idea that he instantly falls in love with Mary (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so dispassionate that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been treated with thorazine. There is a kind of "Brave New World" in the movie that is supported by any scene that is shot over 2-3 stops. Unfortunately, this technique becomes boring and pretty hard for the eyes. The cute mishmash of languages ​​also gets boring when there is no reason for its existence. Many futuristic scifi movies are criticized for being lightning-fast and without substance. This film has neither lightning nor substance. It's a code 6 all the way.
