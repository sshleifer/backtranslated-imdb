How is it at this time and at all times, are people still stupid enough to think that other stupid things are smart? Maybe stupid people like to look at things that make them feel smart. Like "The war at home". 'Cuss is even stupider than the stupid people who see it. There are no jokes, only half jokes and light jokes that hardly justify a small inner smile. Acting is your typical, unobtrusive, idiotic, standard sitcom style that works by bending limbs. And why, oh why did this crap replace the arrested development? Well, you have to give it to Fox. They know that they have to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid spectators. You see, the reason why Arrested Development was not so popular was that it was so smart. It was so smart that stupid people feel bad because they are so stupid. And when a dumb person meets a smart person, the dumb person will hate the smart person. Mostly anyway. Either that, or try to fend off the clever person. If you like this show and belong to the dumb people, I really can not understand what it must be like to have no open eyes and open mind. I can not understand what it must be like to be mindless, laughing drones that are affected by every little thing. Basically, people who laugh with a laugh are parrots. Trained, obedient, mindless parrots. Maybe I should not insult parrots by comparing them with you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastard in this review, that's because I'm so upset that AD is canceled.)
