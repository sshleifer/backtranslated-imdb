I saw this on a small canal late at night, and I expected to expect a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor, and I thought he might be a good stand-up comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I could not have been wrong. This concert was terrible. It was full of racist comments aimed at white people, Muslims, and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence's narrowness) and the sweeping clich√©d cod philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can not resist the urge to preach when a platform is given Do we really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the fight for civil rights during a stand-up comedy show?). Then there were his scraping comments to ingratiate him with women, and my skin crawled toward him. The worst thing was that the show was just not fun and I thought it was boring. I turned halfway and turned around to see that he was either still preaching or going on and on and on and on about the birth of his child (in the story of his child's birth, there was no humor and he was selfish to bore us with the details, obviously he did not have much to say or he would have cut out this section of the show). <br /> <br /> This show was garbage: Runteldat!
