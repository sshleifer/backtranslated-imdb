I had heard from a friend of this movie that he was supposed to be a thriller, but what I saw was not a "thriller". It was more like a weak attempt. Amber Smith was a bright spot that may give her too much credit. The scenes in which she was in bed with actress Erika Michels were also lame. The two actresses did not seem to click at all. Amber Smith was a long way from the league and that was definitely in front of the camera. She did not seem to dive into these scenes at all. I was disappointed because a friend of mine - of course a guy - had pumped this movie into something "awesome", but it was actually more like watching Dime Store porn.
