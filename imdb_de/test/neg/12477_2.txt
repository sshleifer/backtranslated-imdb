By 1994, the Power Rangers had become a big franchise. USA Network executives hoped to get into the action and came in contact with the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, where the evil emporer Gorganus, who looks like he's wearing a homemade Darth Vader costume, and his talking bird, it looks like a rubber toy, comes to Earth and invades with huge monsters that look like scrap out of a 1970's Godzilla movie. Fortunately, Nimbar is an alien who recruits Jello like a giant piece, and challenges four teenagers to defend Earth. Nimbar gives them each a tattoo of another constellation of stars, from which they can turn into bloated superheroes that look like dancers from the eighties music videos could also combine them into a giant knight. Forty episodes were made. Obviously, the US network did not have the money to adapt a show from Japan like Power Rangers, and did it alone with the budget of a 50s scifi movie. The fight scenes are generic, the special effects are bad and some sets look like they might fall off. The actors became pretty clear on how ridiculous the show was and they pretty much overdone it. I can only imagine her shock when the show was canceled.
