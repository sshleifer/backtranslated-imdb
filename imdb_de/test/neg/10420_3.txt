I'm pretty sure Poe thought this was a travesty. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What on earth was Fellini thinking? It's a sprawling, random, boring piece that's not much to recommend. One should be frustrated that there is no back story or conclusion, but it is only relief that it is over.
