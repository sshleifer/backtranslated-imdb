After watching this movie, I did not want to get my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted that one and a half hours back in my life - it was the most amazing and abominable agony to know that I had spent precious minutes of my life on this filth. I have scars for life, and since that "movie" came into my life, I've had sleep problems. I try to suppress the memories, it's really me. , , but they make me burn. <br /> <br />
