Overall, I would call this a disappointing performance. It tries the old approach of the "horror anthology", but fails miserably. The acting was bad and the stories too. Any skin shown in the film was obviously random just to put on the R rating for sex. Typical, I think, but still bad. Take your $ 5 and rent a REAL movie instead!
