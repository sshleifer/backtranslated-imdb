OK, when I say "wow," I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma received a copy of the title. The film is about an alien crash on Earth to terrorize us with a weapon that makes people forget. WATCH OUT!!! And by that I mean those special effects. There are an astonishing number of mistakes. Acting is awful, but I would say the only one who cares is the sheriff. The film itself is very grainy and poorly lit. In a particular scene, it is daytime outside and then the shot shows the night animal shooting its weapon with the night behind it. Then it shows day again. * Shake your head * I like low-budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to finish the film because I never see a movie without a degree. The only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that was not stereotypical. Well for that and ONLY for it ... I give a 3 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you had a bad day. The failed attempt that this movie makes will make you even more depressed.
