After seeing the first scene, I realized that the acting was so bad that she could not catch up later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professionally for evidence of technology, like a five-year-old trying to make it sound like he knows what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> The second-to-second plot is completely unrealistic and just about every decision the screenwriter made was the kind you expect from a below-average grade school student. The whole plot was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogues sound intelligent were limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. A ten-year-old may like it. However, a five-year-old needed to accept the lack of realism. How advanced cell functions can bypass a code lock by touching it like a magic wand, selecting one of hundreds of voices through a ventilation system (thereby demolishing Superman), and repairing a home computer simply by identifying it incorrectly rather than failing to search? Actually, this scene is a nice example: The mistake was that one of the cooling tubes (aluminum bands) of the CPU was broken, as it would look if an exhaust pipe of a V8 engine is demolished by an explosion. This is something that can not happen, and if it did, it would not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric current flowing through this band, but when he (without doing it himself, his arms work with the autopilot because the cells in his body are extremely efficient) stick a pin in the crack, a desktop with icons screen appears immediately without boats. <br /> <br /> And that's how it goes all the way. For example, when he escaped an interrogation room at the NSA Headquarters by lighting a lighter under a fire sensor, resulting in open doors throughout the building. Of course, the NSA has not predicted this ingenious approach to escape and has not placed guards outside of his room (or elsewhere) to secure the breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So he went out and got a taxi. Examples like these are not only numerous, in fact there is virtually no scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> Also the so-called great effects were terrible. He threw a basketball back to a boy in the park, and the boy was thrown back 20 feet horizontally in a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height like a motorized trolley. I'm sure if I took a break and looked for the cables that hold the child's posture as only cables can, they probably did not know how to erase them completely. If someone was thrown so far into a tree, he would at least obey (or rather be with broken bones in the hospital), but the boy was just confused and astonished. Moronic. That's the word for every creative decision made throughout the production. I will put the name of the director on my personal blacklist. Someone who is as poorly educated as he is can not improve. I want to claim compensation for wasting 45 minutes of my life for seeing it and the time it took me to write this. Although it felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to see how little it took to allow a pilot. The only excuse a slightly intelligent person has to voluntarily observe is imprisonment or lobotomy.
