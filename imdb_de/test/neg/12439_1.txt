Again and again I come across a movie that is so embarrassing bad. I wonder why there are movies. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying comic-sounds and bad dialogues. Eddie Deezen is just annoying as Tony, an annoying guy who takes over the family business at the request of his father Don (William Hickey). Tony is, as I said, an annoying little fool. That makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly dark. It's too cartoony. The main point I try to try is that with so much caricature you can not parody a popular drama like The Godfather. It does not work like that. Believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you do not take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. The thing about a parody is that you are not too much of a parody. You have to give the impression, as if you take the movie at least a bit seriously. It also feels like they are just mocking Woody Allen, and that makes this movie absolutely terrible.
