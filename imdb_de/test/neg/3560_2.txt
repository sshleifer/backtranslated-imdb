I saw this movie because of the only positive review and can only imagine that this guy is a shill. <br /> <br /> The acting of the female lead is actually pretty good, but the whole movie is just so painfully boring I could hardly stand it. This is the definition of fatigue. <br /> <br /> So far this movie has been rated 8 out of 10 votes out of 7 votes. This must mean that the director, the director's girlfriend, the producer, the actress, and the drinking buddies have tagged their own movie with a 10. <br /> <br /> This man on the street should give him 2 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> FDA Note: While this film may be used as a good night's sleep aid, no medical value is implied or offered.
