Guy Pearce looks and behaves like an underwear model by Calvin Klein or one of those bimbo guys wearing Levi's jeans standing in front of a herd of stuffed buffalo, realizing that Buffalo likes Levi's as well. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he's saying, "Look at me, I'm so pretty!" As a hero, his character is a total weakling. In every scene that requires courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: At the end of the movie, this wobbly Book Worm character is played with a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can walk and jump along the walls (like Spiderman). At about the same time, the ZEITMASCHINE seems to trigger a kind of nuclear explosion that wipes out an entire valley. Oddly enough, though Pearce and his mate Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock being killed; Seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe watch as the valley bursts from the safety of their mountain. Well, that's a fast run !!! Jeremy Irons as the king of the Morlocks is awesome. He really makes the movie a lot better than before. Mumba, the model-turned actress, is not very cute and she does not play much in this movie. The scenes that take place in the 1900s have no real atmosphere. Although clothing and vehicles from the era are shown, the characters look like cartoons, as they imagine people from the 1900s, as they would go and talk. The original version of this movie was much better in this regard. The characters of the era were much more realistic and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie made PAST appear as the true basis of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feel. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then can not save them from their fate, are very good. The problem that the Morlocks are cannibals is not very well explained, and it makes no sense that they have a large dark butcher's shop filled with knives and cutlery, but they are never seen with the exception of blasting arrows with weapons. Dumb is also the huge pit full of water and bones. The Morlocks run around the subway chewing on fleshy bones. So how can all these skeletons be in the pit? It seems there are some Morlocks who give Bar-B-Que to their humans and eat them from the grill, and other Morlocks just like filleted meat? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? As I watched the dozens of Morlocks feeding on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet and sanitation system, considering they're throwing in too many bones. All these questions were never addressed. At the end of the film, Pearce holds Mumba's hand, but you can tell he has a crush on her friend Mandingo. Another completely irritating thing in this movie is the uninterrupted LION KING music that stands in the background. As soon as Pearce arrives in the future (802.710 AD); The LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is the African Moaning singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?), Who starts complaining about the LION KING jungle music. I looked at the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically labeled, but I think Elton John should probably go into that matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with good effects. See it once, then forget it.
