Critters 3 begins in the open street when Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) & his young son Johnny (the IMDb list of two actors Christian & Josephh Cousins, identical twins?) Go home on vacation , Suddenly the tire hits her van and they have to stop at a public rest stop to fix it. There, Annie and Johnny meet a child named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes one), who all meet Charlie McFadden (co-producer Don Keith Opper) of the two previous Critter films. Charlie tells them the story of the critters & the town of Grovers Bend, but they do not believe him. In the meantime, a critter lays a few eggs on the bottom, except for everyone. After Clifford repaired the tire, the trio set off for home, a run-down Los Angeles urban block of flats complete with critter eggs for the ride somewhere. On arrival, the eggs and Critters head slip directly into the block of flats, which Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the janitor, quickly removes. Since the night depends on the few remaining residents, a fat woman called Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a phone repairer Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple, Mr. (Bill Zuckert) & Ms. Menges (Frances Bay), need to get together with Clifford and his children to fight the critters. Josh also appears when his stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the group be able to defeat the critters and prevent them from going to dinner? <br /> <br /> Directed by Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an unbelievably different film, but she can at least say that she made a film with Leonardo DiCaprio and not many people can say that! The budget for Critters 3 was probably not exactly a fortune, since the entire production looks consistently cheap. There are very few characters, very few critters, and I think only three appear in the same setting at once and it eliminates the need for any kind of production, so there is no expensive spaceship or remote extraterrestrial planetary effects to pay. The script by David J. Schow is strictly numerical and very predictable. A group of people are in an isolated situation with critters and have no way to ask the outside world for help. The plot scenario sounds very familiar, right? Well, it's just like the previous Critters (1986) & Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) & many other horror movies. Critters 3 does not do anything with the premise, it does not even try to add anything to an old, tired and well-used plot. Critters 3 is also very tame for a horror movie in which only two people are actually killed. The comedy elements are missing as well as the best joke. Critters 3 can manage to be a critter eating a few beans and then farting years old. The characters are mostly standard horror movie clichés and quickly became annoying. In Critters 3, there is virtually no blood or blood, just a few drops of blood and disappointing that Critters 3 actually seems to be avoiding violence. The critters' special effects are fine, but they still look like static, simplistic hand puppets with little movement. Acting is not so good and Critters 3 is a certain first feature film by Leonardo DiCaprio. To be fair to the child, he is fine. I wonder if any of the other actors or crew had any idea what he should become. Why in the world does this Charlie guy have to reappear in these Critter movies? To do Critters 3 well it moves at a good pace and is not boring, it is generally well done with enough production values ​​and it is a bit of a harmless fun to be in the right mood and fortunately only for about Holds 80 odd minutes. All in all, Critters 3 is a waste of time, but do not expect anything deep or meaningful. As a cheap horror movie, nothing is really wrong, but I feel like I've seen it all before. An average time wasting that is not as good as the two previous critter films. Critters 3 ends with a "follow-up ..." since this was shot with Critters 4 (1991), which was not surprisingly straight to the video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a decent way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on TV for free, otherwise you will not bother.
