Oh my God. I really get on my nerves when a pointless horror affair on a low budget attempts to be interesting in the credits, with some good names in the cast just to get everyone into the smallest, most meaningless roles. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in one scene, a recent Martin Kove appearance, a short commercial for Vernon Welles, a little more time for John Philip Law on screen and a little bit for Karen Black. This bunch of random cameos does not really matter much, though Richard Lynch and Karen Black perform some of the few smiles in the movie with their performances, and it's really painful, as none of the main cast is very good. I could not help but think that if more scenes were shot with one of the b movie veterans about the movie, it would be a whole lot better, but there are only a few tantalizing glimpses of good entertainment without the movie ever really doing much would achieve entertainment value. The only charismatic or likeable appearances in my opinion were Steve Wastell, as Axel and his girlfriend, whom I believe was played by Elina Madison (she had never heard of her before, but she has some degree of screen presence and sees good). , The conspiracy in this movie is simple, the evil undead miner goes after those who want to steal his gold, and it should provide good slasher fun, especially as John Carl Buechler, who has done special effects on many of these effects, directs a series of movies, including all three major Slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street, and Friday 13th) as well as little gems like the Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film lacks tension, sympathy and satisfying Gore. There are one or two slightly bloody moments, but nothing that would be worth the effort to watch the movie, I would not say. Apart from the aforementioned cameos, the whole movie is really stale and full of characters that could not turn out fast enough for my taste and an unfortunate absence of any interest. I did not even find it funny in a ridiculously bad movie feeling, which is rare for me because I love a lot of pretty, fucking movies. I would say avoid it.
