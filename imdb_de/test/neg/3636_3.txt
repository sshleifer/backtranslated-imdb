The only time I actually laugh when I watch this show is when I make fun of it. Jamie Lynn Spears got the acting job just because of her big sister, and I do not think anyone could argue with me about it. There is NO facial expression in her face (even if she is smiling) - just look at the show and you will see what I mean. Let's talk about the show now. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I have ever seen! As many people have said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she is a pure student and all the boys think she's "hot". PCA is a boarding school full of rich kids, offering flat-screen TVs and laptops to all students and serving sushi to children in the sushi bar. In one of the latest episodes, Zoey is completely oblivious, believing that Chase does not love her, and pretending she does not want Chase to love her. When she then plunges into Chase's dorm to prove that her friends are wrong, she finds Chase kisses that girl named Rebecca. Zoey naturally freaks out, probably because she likes Chase's attention. Watch this show only if you have nothing else to do, and Zoey 101 is the only thing on TV. You can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
