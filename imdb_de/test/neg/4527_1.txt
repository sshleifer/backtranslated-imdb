This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Much wasted talent. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says that an example has to be made of an atomic bomb, I said, "Please, let it be this theater!" Do not waste your time. Not even worth a free rental! And where did these shills come from to fill in the comments on IMDb? I can not believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series has enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and turned it into a pure action movie, it could happen. What was the purpose of the dance scene? The fat jokes and references were tasteless. This film never missed the chance to find the lowest common denominator, and the scenes ended, it seemed like nobody would think it through. Just awful! Save time, if not money, and give this movie a pass!
