This movie wants to be a kind of shocking, cerebral and intense movie that many others have succeeded in its genre, but it is not. It is confusing and absurd at best. When the twists and turns finally showed, saying "Ah, I understand!" I mumbled something like "Okay ... whatever". In my opinion, if a film shows a major turning point, it should not need to use a flashback sequence to prove that it gives some clues that allow the viewer to see the truth for themselves. But this movie has a flashback; And here's the kicker: It flashes back to scenes that were not even in the movie! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped, unsympathetic and completely ridiculous. I have the feeling that the "steamy" love scenes between the romantic leads are the most humble and outrageous I have ever played in a movie that was not porn. It seems the director is shocked and confused about the love scenes, but they were really stupid. <br /> <br /> And do not mess with the crappy accents and second-grade sentences. I think the movie was filmed in New Orleans, but apart from the above-mentioned accents and a few bland city shots, the movie could have been in Anytown, USA. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Do not worry!
