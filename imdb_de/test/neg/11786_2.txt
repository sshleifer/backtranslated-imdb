Only a very small child could overlook the absurdities of this bomb; The first difficulty faced by the submarine "Seaview" seems to be chunk. Fall through the water and fall into the hull. But it's not rock, they're under the North Pole - that's ICE! All, except possibly already mentioned little children (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS. Then it comes to a disaster - this damned VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around the earth catches fire! Nobody knows how this happened, we are told what is understandable, because radiation is absolutely impossible to "catch fire," and even if it could, there is NO AIR IN THE SPACE in which it can burn. <br /> <There is literally no good reason to ignore basic scientific terminology for second-grade textbooks when creating a movie. Irwin Allen always manages to do it. Maybe we should focus on the "people" instead, which is pretty easy as they are CARDBOARD. <br /> <br /> The cast is trying hard not to be embarrassed in this ridiculous under-the-boxing hustle and bustle, much like later episodes of his TV series "Lost in Space," whose concept was directly swept away by writer Ib Melchior and then crashed into production. <br /> <br /> The submarine, however, looks pretty good, which is why this one gets a "2".
