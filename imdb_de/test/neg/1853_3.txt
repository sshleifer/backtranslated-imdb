We saw this in a bargain basket at the local Asda: £ 1.50 for the DVD. I read all the hype that was plastered on the cover and said how "smart" it is, and it also had a really good, well-established cast, we thought that this would be a great movie at home, put it in the DVD Player, leaned back and waited for the fun to begin ....... and waited ....... and waited ..... and waited a bit more. About 90 minutes later, although it felt like 3 hours, the loans were rolling and that was the end of it. <br /> <br /> What a failure - even paying £ 1.50 seemed a hoax. God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said "yes" to this question. And as for Moran, as much as I enjoyed Black Books, Shaun the Dead, and his comedy tours, I felt he was overwhelmed in this movie. He tried to play too hard to laugh, probably thinking that if he kept the characteristics of his Black Books character, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he has a detonator. The gags fell flat after a while and then he was only irritated. What a pity, because I believe he could be a very good movie / character actor given the right part. <br /> <br /> In summary, the actors in The Actors, Act Acting !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
