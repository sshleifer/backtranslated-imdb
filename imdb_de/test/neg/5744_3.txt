This is about some vampires (who can walk around in the sunlight) that cause some problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent to investigate with his commando team. The movie begins with Van Dien & Co. walking through the jungle, and there is this huge black man who simply and absolutely can not act. He speaks all the lines as if he were reading them from the cue cards for the first time. His voice is also so quiet that it is positively hilarious. Great way to start the movie! In any case, they hit some of our vampires, shoot them (they seem to die for about 20 seconds), and then, of course, they come back to life. Van Dien notices that one of them has been spiked over a branch and calls his friends to kill them with wood. You have to look at the stunt work to be believed - the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees, making them look like they could really easily climb or something. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... Uh, later the huge black guy in South America is hooked up with some guys (Van Dien not included) and they are being attacked by more vampires. It's too bad these guys have never heard of a crossbow, because it seems to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers. Instead, they use large old wooden poles with which they impale the vampires by hand. The big black guy is captured and he eventually becomes a powerful vampire leader. Van Dien fights with him later. It does not help that throughout the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, it will be knocked out for 20 seconds, which would enable a person to bet fairly quickly. They just try to use in the middle of melee. Yes, not exactly an ingenious tactic. <br /> <br /> There's a hot baby (remember Veronica from The Lost World TV show, yeah, it's her!), Who happens to be running around in the middle of Vampire County doing a kind of research mission, and she also happened to be Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what are the chances? It's a shame she's not much more in the movie than she is. Will she and Casper get together again in the end? Will Van Dien defeat the huge black guy who can not act? Will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through the numerous action scenes? Do we hear the three trumpet music when someone does something funny? Has even Lynda Carter forgotten how to behave in her little cameo (she convinces more in her Sleep Number Bed spots)? These questions and more will be answered if you make it to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it could put some points on the bad side that it's a good scale, but that's all. It's a bunch of fools walking around in the jungle. I think it's entertaining somehow.
