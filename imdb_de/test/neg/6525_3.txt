I liked the idea of ​​traveling between the dimensions, and the tension between Wade and Quinn in early episodes. Some of the worlds created by them gave the main characters extremely interesting scenes for their stories. In the course of the show, however, there were more stupid arguments among the friends and less a real bond. There was less wonder and excitement when involved in other worlds and more condescension. And in each world fell in love with one of the characters. The writing became boring and everything was way too exaggerated. Too bad that it would have been nice to have a tight-lipped group of friends (a la Star Wars) who spent several years on television traveling to other dimensions than a tired group of knickers.
