This program was shown in an early window on SPACE, a cable sci-fi station. I am amazed that someone would pay for it or broadcast it. It is incredibly amateurish. <br /> <br /> The entire show is a series of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a cabinet with a series of wall-mounted circuit boards. There is very little continuity between the scenes and no plot. A typical scene revolves around a lame joke or special effect and lasts only a minute. The dialogue makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults, but I have literally seen high school pieces with better writing and set. This program is an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Maybe every scene would work as an interstitial. A filler between shows instead of advertising. By juxtaposing all the scenes, the limitations of the material become very obvious.
