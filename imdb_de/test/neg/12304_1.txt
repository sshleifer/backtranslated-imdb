An absolutely cruel adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Raw and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a disgusting side story about the mother's friend who wants to send the boy to military school to get rid of him, make this totally out of place for the children who probably want to see it (3-8) years. Do not waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
