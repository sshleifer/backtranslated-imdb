This movie does not even earn a 1/10. This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that at least 30 minutes of the film DELIBERETLY were copied from Carnosaur 1, 2 and 3.The whole movie was based on the movie "Raptor" and that was really a pathetic attempt to create a "thriller, Action Packed to be Dinosaur "copy. I loved this movie series and saw how it gets put on a movie that can not afford or wants to do COPY without its own models, that's what America has to offer and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
