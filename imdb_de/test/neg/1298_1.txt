This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I gave him a star just because it's the lowest possible score. Who would have thought Flood would ever be a good movie? The director and cast should be ashamed, and then it dawned on me that this could all be part of a Shambhali scare tactic. Only propaganda could be so bad. <br /> <br /> The redeemer of Flood is that it makes scary and a shameless, formal act that makes it funny. If only the characters had the same depth as they were created by the flood itself, they gallop from sound to sound to sound without any emotional reaction so much better, informative, resourceful and tense. Flood has the amateur story found in many recent British films, where a more targeted use of funds would make for better entertainment. Where was Smithee?
