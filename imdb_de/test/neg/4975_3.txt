This movie was a totally unimaginative movie. It was an immovable story that definitely does not make you think of anything other than where all the strong moving material that the other critics say about the movie you constantly see hoping it will get better and it just does not work. I saw this movie last night and wished we had not wasted our precious time (while the baby was sleeping) with the movie. <br /> <br /> My plan is not to recommend this to my family and friends, and of course anyone who wants to rent it. I was pretty impressed with everything about this movie.
