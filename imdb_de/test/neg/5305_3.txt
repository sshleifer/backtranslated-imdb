Chili Palmer is tired of making films and knows he wants to make some success with the music. As Halbmafioso half expert he wants to ascend in the music market. But you have to know that everyone is like him and making good singer Linda Moon a hit will be harder than expected. The first part is funny and full of irony, this part falls into the joke and has many less good moments. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their part. The film is mostly histrionic, over the top (a little bit OK, too much is disgusting) and the only one you can save is the gay bodyguard who is at least coherent, the rest is too much idiot. The most surprising thing is that the movie is not boring, everything goes so fast and so many things happen that you do not have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie. It can offend your intelligence (very much!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But it's not boring.
