I've always loved bad creations and rhetorical criticism, and my film professor confirmed that for me in college. This is not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing better than this mistake. The movie The Fantastic Four, complete with the I-have-no idea why-hes-over-tweaking-finger-Doom-Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom Dialogue "Kill him! ... Let him go!" is classic because it is stunning in its joy. The cut is good and the director of photography is not half as bad ... these are the benefits. However, I can not get all my friends to see everything in their entirety, but if I have the chance, I'll show them that "Jonny and Sue can come into space with us!" Scene I do. I also join in the final scene where Redd Richards gets out of his FF outfit for some reason next to his bride Sue in her wedding dress in the limo ... The payout is the extended arm at parting. Most people do not believe that such a thing exists.
