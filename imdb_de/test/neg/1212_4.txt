I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to watch it again ten years later. It's not the worst "I Want A Pilot" movie ever, but it has so many flaws that you can barely miss it.) Sounds better on this movie than the average patriotic nonsense you normally see;) <br /> <br /> [**** ------]
