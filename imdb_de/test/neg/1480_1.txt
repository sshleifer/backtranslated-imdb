This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who plays as Charlie's grandfather, is in overacting mode hoping that the more noticeable he is, the better his performance (cue-buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last real movie legends. Seeing him in this movie (though End of Days is the second worst movie I've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the bad action in the nonexistent direction it becomes clear that the movie was made only because the last name of the producer ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad that it's really hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod is a Superman Jor-El wig and a big black porn mustache. It's just hoped that his follow-up film "I Believe in America" ​​by Uber producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem him and leave everyone with a good taste.
