OK, what does all this mean? Halloween 6 (Let's call it that, ok?) Is without doubt the CONFUSING film of the series (and from what I've heard, the original "Producer Cut" does not sound like it's making things less confusing as the "official" publication). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is not a really bad movie, as some have said. It has its scary scenes and some pretty intense moments - it just does not make sense! Do not tell me that Michael was "made" technically from the beginning to be evil and to kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. It was bad enough when they made Michael into Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (just so they had an excuse to keep them in the second movie) - that's too much. <br /> <br /> It seems that this is another case the creator of the movie is trying to be "too smart" by developing a new premise that will shock and impress us all. Bad move, guys. We are not looking for an explanation why Michael kills. So do not try to feed us this crap. Show me how Michael looks threatening and kills a lot of people. Show me how Dr. Loomis tries to track him down, and as always, he only comes out for a moment. Do not waste the last performance of Donald Pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that Michael was "created" by a hell cult and that his "seed" is passed on to another and ... oh, brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 has its moments, do not get me wrong, and we all know that there were far worse sequels than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) What you can do with it (the scene towards the end of the movie) in which Michael downloads a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the plot of the screw ball. Hopefully we can all one day see the "producer cut" and maybe get the chance to make (a little bit) more sense out of it. Until then, however, this must be ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
