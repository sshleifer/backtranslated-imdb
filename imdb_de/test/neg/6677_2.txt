After eating Human Pork Chop and proper digestion, I felt compelled to tell potential viewers that chewing on this product is NOT FUN and its substance is of low nutritional value. <br /> <br /> According to the stupid nature of this movie, the following is a WARNING more than a REVIEW. This is the first time I have wished that IMDB has an "I-do-not-for-price-this-movie" button, as the only reaction to this boring piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference , Any evaluation would do wrong with all the other points listed here, a "10" is out of the question anyway, "1" might convince some readers that this is one of the cases where "it's so bad that it's REALLY REAL bad is that kewl! ", and" 5 "is also unsatisfactory, people may think it's an OK strip and alright, if you want to have a cheesy joke that's not ... Honest to God it's not a "10", a zero or a 5, it's nothing, a black hole, a work understood by an embryo. I bought the Region 3 DVD, which was at least cheap ($ 7 !!!) and from I bought them mainly because of the positive and promising reviews under my own entry Oh boy, I should be disappointed This movie is neither shocking nor repulsive nor disturbing yet ... it is not even ridiculous, it does not need to serious to get out but he is still serious enough not to be funny. A really dispassionate, amateurish effort. The only sequence I found MILDLY DISTURBING is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog ​​in a bag and hit a brick wall ... but even such a cruel condition only leads to a bad execution. The TOILET SCENE quoted below is unrealistic and is filmed without any sense of tension, suffering or humiliation - the droppings look like painted marsh drizzle !!! There is a butcher's shop at the end of a long 85-minute period when three men in plastic raincoats (a setup that can also be seen on the front of the DVD) begin to dispose of the female body. Reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now these films are worth seeing and true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Let's be REALISTIC and not make any Asian wannabe a myth. scary movie as it happens lately ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some Eastern horror, try Danny Lee's masterpiece of the same (English) title "Ba Xian Fan dian zhi ren rou." cha shao bao "(Human Pork Chop) (1992) and was - not without reason - compared to" Henry: Portrait of a serial killer. "There is also a similar film that shares the same story with another film crew named" Ren tou dou fu shang "(" There's a secret in my soup ") of the same year, a kind of competing production, available as a Region 3 DVD and considered by most to be superior to" Peng Shi Zhi sang Jin Tian Liang. "I still can add a few words to the special effects ... what special effects?!? ... there are a few choppy limbs, they look awful - in the wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". <Br /> <br /> This is about all the information I can share on this topic, hopefully it will be helpful ... ENJOY YOUR MEAL!
