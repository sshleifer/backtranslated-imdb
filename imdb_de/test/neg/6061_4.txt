My assumption would be that this would be originally at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how could one explain his kinky, abbreviated plot. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear in terms of character motivation. The movie feels like the plot points are being put together to push them into the timeslot. If it was longer, it might make more sense, but it would not be good anyway. The film's most interesting idea is the war between Zeus and Hera as a war between the man and the woman, but the film drops the ball, making Hera's trailer pretty awful, without knowing what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you can not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So there are some fascinating ideas that do not bring anything useful. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogues, cardboard figures and an interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unsurpassable, but not worth seeing.
