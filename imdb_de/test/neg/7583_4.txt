Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director, and he has done a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (a.k.a. "The Box Office Downfall of Mr. Schwarzenegger"). However, "Air America" ​​must be one of his most inappropriate projects. <br /> <br /> It's a fusion of drama, comedy and war film - it's not a very compelling mix. In fact, I found it overbearing. Robert Downey, Jr. (during his heyday) plays a lead role as a pilot recruited into a top-secret CIA organization operating during the Vietnamese era of Laos. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot and he stumbles over the knowledge that it's drugs and what's not. <br /> <br /> The film was hyped when released because it featured two famous faces and Aerosmith re-recorded the Doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The repetition of the song is pretty bad, which fits in with the movie.
