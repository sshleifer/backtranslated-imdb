Another version of the mother of all gangster stripes - the classic "Godfather" and another case of excessive hype by the media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film directed by Ram Gopal Varma, is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy, including the other two, the excellent Satya and Company. The charisma, the magnetic personality of the two Bachchans playing for the first time a father-son duo on screen, is definitely a pleasure. Not only strong performances, but their perfect chemistry is the biggest point where Varma should be applauded. The other characters of the film, however, lack the same equation of the duo. Reason - the other characters look more like cardboard cartoons. The bad guys represent the typical Bollywood bad guys. One figure that attracts attention is the older son, who is played by Kaykay but can not hold because of the half-baked characterization. , The drama and the conflict are brought to life through the excessive use of close-ups, bringing with it a claustrophobic effect that was rightly needed to build an ambience. The haunting score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev) as well as dark, murky backgrounds overlapped by glowing, powerful images (Amit Roy's camera) contribute to the visuals typical of Ramus style , But there is an overuse of music, though luckily there are no songs in the movie. But can the interest of today's "intelligently growing" audience be maintained only on the shoulders of two performers and strong visuals? I do not think so, audience "maangey more" and here the movie does not fail. To add a new dimension to every customization, the biggest requirement is the screenplay, which is sluggish and in some places not crisp, so the tempo often declines. The audience is finally exposed to a highly predictable, very commonplace drama with few elements of surprise. Allan Amin Ghani, the top stunt director, is also not at his best. Some scenes that require some other treatment include: A minister talks badly about Sarkar and the son overheard. Sarkar Jr., a very amateurish shot in Sarkar prison, escapes from the clutches of his enemies. A son is easily motivated to kill his own father. A son secretly enters his father's room to kill him. A police commissioner beats Sarkar Jr - all this requires a more realistic, powerful approach, which is the backbone to creating the necessary conflict. The dialogues are weak for eg. Take a look at an amateurish line in which a CM tells Sarkar Jr. "Where Jo is a police commissioner who is on a Maine hata diya" .. The women who focus on Sarkar's work are completely ignored. The ongoing negotiations on criminal activity while Sarkar is with his family are also somewhat inappropriate. In fact, the film follows a diagram very similar to Ramus' own production - Ab Tak Chhappan. In presenting the struggle between good and evil, the other side of life - law, police, administration, politics - is completely ignored. Certainly more content is expected. Here the movie is definitely too short and could not rise above an average price. Dear Ramu, you agreed that you are now laughing at the bank. You definitely need to initiate drastic overhaul in your film production factory before it's too late.
