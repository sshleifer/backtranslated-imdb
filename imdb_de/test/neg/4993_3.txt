Rise of the Undead begins as a massive nuclear strike breaks through an unnamed American city. Some people survive in a building by leaning on the door to keep it shut and keep the evil out (!). They fight each other forever, then a monster thing comes out of nowhere seemingly and starts killing them one by one ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton & Shannon Hubbell, Rise the undead is terrible. The script is very serious, but makes little sense. First of all, I was wondering if there is a huge atomic explosive out there that is destroying the whole city. Why is the building in which they are still standing? Then I wondered when something would happen, the entire first 20 minutes are in one room. That's a bit generous, it's more of a corridor, as the main character argues. Then it becomes a reproduction of the Return of the Living Dead (1985) with a government-created virus that turns people into zombies, before one of the most abrupt, pointless and seemingly random conspiracies I've ever encountered, most of them Power just made a complete waste of time. Then in the last 30 minutes, Rise of the Undead becomes a strange sci-fi thing resembling an energy ball battling everyone, and I was the only question what this floating bundle of energy is and where it came from? Back to what happened outside, what was the reason? Oh, that's right, we're never told. Rise of the Undead is a mess, the characters are awful and are not even named. The twist in the middle makes you run your hair out of frustration, the dialogue is annoying, nothing is explained and there is practically no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a bit more) of Rise of the Undead involve no dialogue and the movie ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Horton & Hubbell of Director's Director apparently worked on a low budget, the entire film is set in about two rooms and three hallways! The photography is awful, they seem to use random color filters and sometimes it looks like Rise of the Undead was shot on a camcorder. There are no special effects, there is some wrong blood, but no real make-up effects. There are some CGI footage of the city that is in flames that look good, but the floating sphere of energy creature looks awful. There is an amazing setting where two people sit and talk on a corridor wall. For bizarre reasons, the heads are cut off at the top of the screen! You only see their lower body from the neck down, but nothing moves in the frame, they do not move and there is nothing else, but for some strange reason, their heads are cut off from the top of the frame while they talk! That's a strange thing. <br /> <br /> With an extremely low budget of about $ 10,000 and the IMDb shot in two weeks, I have to congratulate the creators for completing and distributing Rise of the Undead. Here's my congratulations, because otherwise it has terrible production values ​​and is located in three corridors somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Rise of the Undead was shot there. Acting is shitty, so I will not go into it. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Undead is shit, it sounds like a zombie movie, but honestly it is not, everything is subordinate and I know it The filmmakers worked on a low budget, but thats for Actually, no apology. Definitely not recommended.
