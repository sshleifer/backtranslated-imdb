... but I would be lying. A relative was a crew member and we were allowed to watch the production of this movie for a few days (and I was an extra). I can die and have a second of screen time, not that I want to move to Hollywood soon. I just loved seeing how movies are made and being part of it. Also, I got a copy of the movie when it was finally released. They did not have a studio when they made this movie, so he was really independent. I can not say why writing and acting is so terrible, but the main character "Cherry" is the sister of the director. But the cinematography was good. :)
