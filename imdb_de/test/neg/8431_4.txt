GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It is very complicated, as if it had many ideas, but it lacked the ability to bring everyone into a coherent story. Instead, we get different strands of action that go into their own little films. Oh sure, they eventually meet in the end, but everything seems pretty superfluous. Noteworthy is the girlfriend and her problems in the hospital. Was that ... interesting? Then there were the elements "We are spirits, so we have no corporeality," which leads to the same problem people have with GHOST, namely, when the characters have no physicality (ie, no body shape) and they pass through walls What is not, how exactly are they keeping themselves from falling through the ground, or are they raising the ceiling for that matter? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was highly praised as a new kind of South Korean movie. There are many special effects, but the movie itself is hollow and its faux melodrama will only "touch" those who are easy to get started. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 points <br /> <br /> (For a fuller review of this movie as well as reviews of other foreign films, visit www.nixflix.com)
