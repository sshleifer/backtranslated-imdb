After watching the repeats of old Columbo movies, I thought they would all get about the same voice from me (6). But apparently now I see differences in the movies. It happened in some of the previous episodes, where some pretty ingenious direction was shown, and this shows up in this, but in the negative way. <br /> <br /> The film was so boring that I sometimes put myself at peak performance in the paper instead of watching (never happened in a Columbo movie!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away , The director seems too demanding. The scenes with the "oh so mature" neighbor are a malady. In general, the lines and action are weaker than the average episode. The scene in which they debated whether to dismiss the trumpeter or not (who was falsely accused of murder) is pure horror, really stupid. In this episode, much attention is paid to how the killer tries to secure his alibi and hide evidence, etc. I really liked that. But unfortunately no focus on how Columbo reveals everything. And the "proof" that Columbo ultimately leaves victorious is the dumbest one ever. <br /> <br /> Rating: is between 4 and 5
