This soap is worse than bad: it is poisonous. Of the many televisions that have corrosively influenced British society over the past twenty years, Eastenders is the prime example. For two decades, this show has been celebrating the jerk, the bat, the big boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ... <br /> <br /> How many times Has anyone noticed that Eastenders reflects life? Exactly on which planet? <br /> <br /> These are "working class" characters as presented by middle-class citizens who have participated in a creative writing course. Endeavoring to show their fellow middle class citizens how well they are familiar with the "working class", they dream of the rude mob that is the citizens of Eastenders. This has a toxic effect on some heads less well equipped than others, to deal with fiction, we find members of the real population who adopt the attitudes and behavior of the inhabitants of Walford. So it happened that Eastenders mirrored life; But only after life had come over to the reflection of the Easters did other soaps follow in the footsteps of EE, who were filled with ugly, potato-faced, shaved, potbelly figures to their stinking gunwhales, constantly threatening each other. This is the proletariat, as it is perceived by the writers who produce this garbage. The authors will become rich with the proceeds of this production and will then be able to enjoy the finer things in life in their rare enclaves. Meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new drone-induced drones will inevitably lead to a cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> And there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. Much of this is due to the immense power of this lit box of dancing pixels in the corner of your living room. It is your fault, dear reader, that is what you have chosen as the only window through which you can look out of your prison.
