**** A Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> When you're shooting a serious movie that includes a powerful but aging father with three seemingly ungrateful daughters, top-notch actors, great cinematography, and one Beautiful location in the Midwest, where would you go now? Of course, after "King Lear" you would of course create a modern tragedy. I expected that. That was certainly not what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist triplets - a long speech about the man's inhumanity towards the woman. There was no decent man in the story. <br /> <br /> You see early where this movie might lead you, but you can not believe that anyone would waste all these good actors and craftsmen for that trite scenario - you just want them to continue with the subject of King Lear , But it never happens. And there is a real tragedy, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the panorama of the beautiful rural heartland, the only thing worth watching in this movie was the wonderful chameleon, the British actor Colin Firth, who has his accent in the Midwest. Now there was a reward. <br /> <br /> 3/10
