Since I've been one of those people who have never seen the MST3K version of this movie before, I can not comment on that. <br /> <br /> However, I have not seen the original version of this movie movie on the sci-fi channel and I thought it would be just as good as anything else on this channel. I even thought that it was one of her better offerings. <br /> <br /> As I read through the comments, I found that the people who write about SOULTAKER in detail are prone to a certain amount of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity, at least a few things about this movie and rightfully so , Most reasonable people would probably rate at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10 in my opinion. Five is average for me and I think this movie is about average for a sci-fi photo. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the above, I've also found that the reviewers who are immature, dull, and funky, and therefore, from my point of view, as bon-heads, are the ones who do not like the movie well You should basically throw it on the trash for no reason, because it is MOSTLY crushed and fricasseed on MST3K. Or, if they have seen both cuts, they seem to have been badly affected by the MST3K consideration.
