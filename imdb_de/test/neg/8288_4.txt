I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Troma movies. Granted, I've only seen three of them (or four of them including them), but two (Blood Sucking Freaks and Mother's Day) are generally considered the best, leading me to believe that everyone else is not worth seeing. This certainly seems to be the Graduation Day, when Troma is the overpopulated eighties. Although the film is never too bad (given the nature of the movie), it's never too good; and in the end I could just think about it, why did I look at it? Anyway, the plot sees some girls on a racetrack and dies shortly thereafter; more people are dying. Of course, there are some possible suspects; but it's hard to really care about everything that happens. Of course in Slasher terms; It's the gusset that matters most, and given Troma's record of success in terms of the red stuff, I expected buckets of it. There are some decent kill scenes, and some are bloody. but it is never very shocking, which really makes another grim slasher based on a festive event in the American calendar. It's worth noting that there's a small role for Sleaze Queen Linnea Quigley in this movie, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. Direction, action and execution are all very banal. and I'll say, unless you're a big Troma fan or someone who wants to track down every Slasher that's ever been made; Do not bother with this movie.
