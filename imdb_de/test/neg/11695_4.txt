As for the Asian horror, I've seen my disappointment along with some of the scariest things you can imagine ... "Acacia" is not really suitable for both categories. It had a few moments of excitement and was interesting to see, but I could not help believing that there should have been more to this story. The film is about a childless couple who decides to adopt a child who seems to be fascinated by trees. He develops a connection with the acacia tree in their garden and seems to communicate with him. Then he storms during a fight with his mother, who involves his newborn child after he threatens to find his dead mother, who is now a tree. If he does not come back, the parents send a report and wait while the neighbor girl thinks he somehow inhabits the acacia tree. The tempo is pretty slow and the ending is going to be a bit weird, but I have to recommend this as a pleasing effort, even if the story feels a bit flat. Hell, I can not really decide ...
