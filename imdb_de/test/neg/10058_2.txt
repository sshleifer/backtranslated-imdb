Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a pickup one night. Two years later, after discovering the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent house, noting that the man was hanged for murder. Nobody inside or outside the family seems to care that the hitchhiker could not have committed the murder (on his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. Sutherland is the man's alibi, but he turned up too late. Out of guilt, he finds the real killer. <br /> <br /> In Agatha Christie's mystery, there are usually several different people involved, all of whom have one or the other motive for the crime. and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict timeline. There are often, not always, a sidekick that the investigator can use to discuss things. Due to the initial situation of the situation, care must be taken that each element of the mystery is explained to the reader or spectator. Redundancy is perfectly fine. We have to keep the characters and timelines straight. Christie's films are of the rare type in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort, oh, this is Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan Globe production, with everything related to production values, a thoughtfully prepared script, and the ability behind it camera. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes that Sutherland discovers that an innocent man was hanged are fine. After that, everything is thrown at the viewer in incoherent scenes, often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voice overs that tell us nothing. The script has a slapdash quality, as if it were thrown together overnight by two hacks. Few faces are familiar and that does not help at all. Everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless mess. The score consists of four instruments that irritate atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is thrown in to wake the bulldozers in the audience. If Lady Agatha were alive, she would be one of the spectators who needed to be roused. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
