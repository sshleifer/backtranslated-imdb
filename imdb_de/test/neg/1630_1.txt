I saw this here in the late, late, late, late show when MST3K was just a glint in Joel Hodgson's eye. I had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could walk "to the ends of the earth" in about an hour and a half (thankfully, her father gave such specific instructions) and then took days to get back to that closed with help. I did not know that a barbaric-type sword could run into the forest in less than 30 seconds and create a hanglider and lightning bombs. I had no idea how disconnected a movie could be. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, kids, a very bad thing. If you enjoy bad movies, you should do it.
