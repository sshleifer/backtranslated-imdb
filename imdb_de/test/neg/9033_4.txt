So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher, who lost his partner in a drug investigation for a surprise in Colombia! Not to brag or anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my surname), and now he's a doctor in California. No matter what the movie makes you believe, there are a few things other than drug dealers and cocaine coming from Colombia! In any case, Hatcher loses his partner and inadvertently kills a naked Colombian prostitute. He inspires him to go to confession, somewhere I've never been. I've seen him in any of his films before or since. It was actually pretty interesting. Seagal tends to look almost asexual, as he never deals with women otherwise than with a conspiracy program, and like occasional attempts at seduction, either by a stripper or by a lover, never arouse him the slightest interest. He's a get-the-bad-guy all the time. But in the confession he confesses to having lied, selling drugs, forging evidence, and even having slept with informants, to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars I'm not in trouble with God by myself tell you that?). The priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to retire from the army. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is an exercise in the razor-thin characterization of Seagal's films. Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a group of mystical Jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no discretion in advancing their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher visits his old high school trainer. Max (a minimal effort by Keith David), and in the middle of the practice are some of those terrified crackheads sitting right in the stands, cracking some bookish-looking high school girls. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a protected experience in high school, but I did not know that crack dealers and crackheads were hung up in the middle of the day at the school. Anyway, it does not take long for Hatcher to find out how bad these guys are. They not only sell cracks to high school kids, but the coach regularly loses footballers on their drugs. They go to clever heads with Max, and since that's not enough, his 13-year-old niece died of her crackhouse. <br /> <br /> Ah, OK. We get the picture. I am sure that they also torture puppies and beat up old women and maybe steal sweets from children, just to reach a good level. Is it really that hard to determine who the bad guys are? The 13-year-old niece died in her crackhouse. Wow. Anyway. The film not only knows how to develop villains without focusing on what essentially amounts to the naming of films, where malicious acts are superficially assigned through dialogue, but they also do not know how to behave. <br /> <br /> The leader of the drug dealers is called Screwface, and I assume that you alone should say something about the nature of the film. Screwface is a caricaturist from Jamaica with those bright, bizarre green eyes that I think must be an important part of his character as he spends most of his screen time, his eyes half out of his head. His preferred means of intimidation is to shout with his face literally less than an inch from the one he's shouting in his wildly over-excited Jamaican accent. This guy likes to get into the faces of the guys, so he has to turn his head to the side, so that their noses do not touch. All I could think about was how the poor would handle his breath. <br/> <br /> Man, they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaicans, by the way. Her accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that it is almost impossible for most of the film to understand. Not that it matters. It does not matter what they say. All you need to know is that everything that comes out of her mouth is a kind of bad drug problem. They are just the psychos who sell drugs and kill people. The film must have been a huge success in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics, especially the bad guys, as I've described, are spectacularly stupid, even for a Seagal movie. They are so comic-like and weird that it's impossible to think of them as something other than a Goofball B-movie creation, something that was pieced together to provide food, to the Seagal's signature brand of smack-down retribution can drive away. <br /> <br /> But there's also a bizarre kind of mystique in the movie that makes the whole thing look weird. For example, a mystic, I suppose you would call her. At some point Screwface sets a curse by (if I remember correctly) Bacardi spit with a porridge full on a live cock, which is hung upside down before he beheads him and his blood dripping on it a picture of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is the same woman who warns Hatcher that his family has been labeled "For Death" by these people, which means they have some voodoo fields. Not to offend anyone, but to be told that my family was cursed by such people would make me laugh. Hatcher does not seem like the guy who has a lot to do with crazy voodoo curses! <br /> <br /> But the setup is pretty standard for a Seagal movie, as you can see. Unique villains, you might say, though not very impressive. In any case, the craziest movie from Seagal's earlier career?
