This movie should have ended as soon as the joke about Bebe's Kids is told in the opening. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really fun routines should not be the whole family. Compare it to the point of one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and the attempt to press the joke as long as possible to make a movie out of it. This movie had to be selfish because I can not find anyone who felt the settings or antics to be familiar. The funniest thing about this film is that the authors and producers spend it as something valuable. 1/10 stars, because there is no half star.
