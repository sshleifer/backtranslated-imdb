I am quite surprised to see that this film has earned lukewarm reviews. I found this movie terrible. The plot flutters around, trying to decide if it's a comedy or a thriller, and finds that it's not possible. So he throws in the towel and continues with his absurd plot, highlighted by an unintentionally funny scene with Laura Linney, a syringe and spilled coffee that makes the audience awkwardly writhe in his seats as if it were a real person , Basically, it's miserable and really disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and it's believed that someone blackmailed Laura Linney into adding this trash to her otherwise respectable CV. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish I had even seen it for free, I wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time. The computer error in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and in the end, you do not care who wins the election. I agree directly with DVD.
