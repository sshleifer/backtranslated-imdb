* Spoiler alert! * I only get the nerves that some people have to make new (and I use the term here loosely ..) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending was unpasteurized for the American public. So what are you doing? they create a new one! a stupid, unlikely, I am as if I am dead, but I come back to life. Do yourself a favor and get the original.
