After being nearly killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks to itself, "Why can not I be a skunk? Then everyone would leave me alone." She looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some Limburger cheese and some garlic ... hmmmm. The next thing you know, we have the predecessor of "Pepe Le Pew," though she's still a cat in this cartoon, she's one of you and just a skunk in disguise. <br /> <br /> The cat enjoys and takes full advantage of its new stinking skunk status. He is now a happy, happy guy ... until a real skunk (with the Charles Boyer imitation voice) shows up! <br /> <br /> I appreciated that the cat wore a Bugs Bunny outfit. All in all, I have never been interested in these French characters, as I found the stereotypical dialogue exaggerated and not really funny, so I only rate that as "fair". However, I make this a point for the moral at the end of the story.
