Aeon Flux was a bit entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a Wednesday night than the pub, but I was happy to have bought one and got a free pass. I did not know anything about the movie when I went inside. I did not know that there was an animated series before I read this page. I was ready for anything, and as other viewers said, the trailers showed a well-filmed, good-looking movie, and an interesting piece of cinema had pulled me in half. Although I was quite disappointed, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I also felt that he lacked that extra bit of depth, leaving me feeling empty. and enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun battles, if you do them, do it with some style, not just a lot of explosions and inappropriate guards falling down. Personally, I would have preferred to learn a bit more about the history and the people in the city, or learn more about how the chairman was undermined, as another long and loud fight.
