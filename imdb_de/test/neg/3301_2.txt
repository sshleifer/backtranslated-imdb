I've lived in Istanbul for 24 years and I know (39 years of experience) what Istanbul has been through all these years. Faith Akin is still quite young (born 1973) and falls into the big mistake of being ORIENTALIST while watching Turkey (just like his other movie "Against the Wall"). This film misses the contemporary urban Turkish life AND RELATIVES the audience when it gives (fairly false) clues to the geographic and cultural aspects of spreading Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who could speak Turkish can easily confirm that many underground bands and groups depicted in the film (Siyasiyabend for one person) are SO MISERABLE and their members can not even speak a proper language, the they can not be understood as "representatives" of contemporary Turkish music. Much less a piece of crap that many Turkish listeners know nothing about. <br /> <br /> We Turks have long been used to "cocky" Westerners who are looking at Turkey from an Orientalist perspective: to try to fit the actual Turkish image into their thought-forms. What's new in this film is the fact that now a director from Turkey (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: looking at Turkey with some fake western eyewear and showing it as a crawling image when he understands it better. All for free. <br /> <br /> Just ask your Turkish friend: What kind of musical documentation is this without naming the names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? .. and many others who have SHAPED the real MUSIC we hear today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long, long lesson to learn before babbling and puzzling other people's thoughts with fake words about contemporary Turkish music.
