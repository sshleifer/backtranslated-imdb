A terrible B-movie with a video quality similar to Dead Alive. I urge anyone who is an "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" movie fan to count how many times rows or almost entire sequences from the first two alien films were demolished to make this classic piece of trash. <br /> <br Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only actors with talent, and the lead actor "Jack Scalia" was really absolutely terrible. I think they throw him out for his massive chin. I was also annoyed by the stereotyping of the only black man on the set, John Toles-Bey, watching this movie and wondering. Watch him sometime, since he has made many interesting films. <br /> <br /> But for this movie: The script, as I said earlier, was a rip-off of aliens turned into a submarine thriller. These included lines like "I feel bad about it" and "Kill me" when a crew member gets infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts to make the "alien-hop" just before he jumps out of his belly. There is also a rip off of the classic "Get Some!" about Bill Paxton. We also have a number of marine grunts that run through caves and scary creepy-crawlies stick out of the walls. Even the explosions of the mutated creatures are very similar to the shooting of aliens, as they attack Marines in the movie "Aliens". And the kicker is that some mutants spit acid (as opposed to acid for blood). There are many more important examples. If you want to see this script well, check out the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). You have a better time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been made more interesting and better, if not too confusing sequences at the beginning of the movie and generally poor editing. The camera shots were pretty boring and frankly, it was not very hard to stop watching and running around the room to get a snack or check an e-mail. Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went more often than nowhere. The entire command structure between the crew and Captain was poorly executed. I'm not even sure there are captains in the military who have full control of nuclear submarines. In general, this only shows that background information has been little researched to make the movie at least a little reputable, and there are many other similar examples (such as depth, etc.). <br /> <br /> If you like terrible movies or are a big fan of aliens and aliens and want something to laugh and shake your head, then this movie might be for you. As for me, this is always on the shelf.
