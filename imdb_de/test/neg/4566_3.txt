I imagine that this is a teen strip with "alternative reality" ... More specifically, a character of the type Ferris Bueller as the leader of a cheat ring. Yes, I know that it should not be compared to Ferris Bueller, at least not in an "orange-to-oranges" method, but it will not change. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: galaxies are not even a small classic. However, it is only visible if you do not expect much. That said, the main character has some charm, but the premise is thin, because writing is just not smart. The movie just did not bring enough laughter, twists or tensions to keep my interest. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept looking. Did not do it As stylish as it is, I would not recommend this movie. By the way, it seems weird to see Mary Tyler Moore as her client. She really is a late bird, I hope the salary was unusually large.
