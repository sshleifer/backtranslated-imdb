Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari was absent in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why is she staying with Guy? I am not sure. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things about this movie that I'm not sure about. But Kevin Spacey is a terrific verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman? and absolutely believable because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> The guy from Frank Whaley is certainly out of his element working for Buddy? he wants to write and make meaningful films, not a gofer verbally abused to become equal to sweet and low. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes' Dawn, who wants to make meaningful films, seems to be well beyond Guy's league. <br /> <br /> The end leaves something to be desired.
