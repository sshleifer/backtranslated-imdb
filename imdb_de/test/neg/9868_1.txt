No doubt this is the WORSE comic book movie. PERIOD!! Yes, it is worse than Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yes, worse than the 1979 and 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah, it's even BAD when Christopher Reed wrote Superman IV: Quest for Peace. Sheeshh ... this movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man just played in another movie and it was just on TV. I had the chance to see it on the sci-fi channel in 1997. I'd heard it was pretty bad, but I had nothing else to do that night, so I thought I was watching. What a waste of an hour and a half. I could have seen more repetitions of Different Strokes. Apart from the lameest special effects and worse shows I've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not well-directed at all. Fortunately, a NEW Fantastic Four movie is currently being shot, and hopefully this version will do the hero justice. I was hoping for a new SPAWN movie in the future, but it's not materializing yet. <br /> <br /> Do not borrow this movie. If you see it is being transmitted via cable, check it. However, be forewarned that it is best to turn the channel after the first 15 minutes.
