I know that this is a small statistical sample (8 votes at the time of publication) but 5.9 out of 10 points? I give this movie a 3 and even that is generous. I've tried to watch this movie three times now (premiere on Saturday night at 9 o'clock on SciFi Channel and Saturday night at 1 o'clock in the morning and Thursday evening again). I fell asleep three times before the movie ended. That leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen having so much money that he has to constantly play supporting roles in these god-fearing "pumpkinhead" continuations? Is Henriksen contractually forbidden to make films without "pumpkinhead"? Can not the creators of this series be better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, emaciated "alien" who walks as if he has a stick sticking his A **? When will the wild characters in these films find guns and rifles will not hurt the pumpkinhead? Why are not they trying to jam another stick? And finally, the authors of this film are so creatively challenged that they could not find names for the two warring families that are more original than the Hatfields and the McCoys? Why not write a script about a fictional president and call him George Bush? One day maybe I have the mental stamina to go through this movie all the way without falling asleep. If someone has answers, let me know.
