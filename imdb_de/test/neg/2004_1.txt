I will not repeat what so many others have said about this film; I will try to add some new points. The Coolio-as-vampire tune is an allusion to fans familiar with the Blondie song "No Exit", in which he plays the role of a rapping vampire (he actually works as a musical concept and is really great song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and actually looks better. And what is actually going on in a Brad Pitt movie for others as a feast for the eyes? The same is true here, though this is poorly filmed (instead, "Starship Troopers"). And of course, after playing Dracula in the Morrissey / Warhol movie, Udo Kier has little more than a cameo. Enjoy it, if you can.
