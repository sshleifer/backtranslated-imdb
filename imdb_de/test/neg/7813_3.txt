"There are some things you just do not do," says the slogan of this 2003 David Zucker comedy about a young man who is in a terrible situation after another entangled under the title My Boss's Daughter should speak for both the people who made this garbage, as well as those who are thinking of watching it. There are indeed some things you just do not do. Placing almost all the content found in My Boss's Daughter is one of the things that you should not do with the Cinema medium by inserting it into your image. The daughter of my boss is a dirty man. creepy; grotesque experience, a chunky and heavy piece that is indescribably infantile and disgusting disgusting. To see, to endure, to endure, to survive and to survive is a performance in itself? if one of the cast; Writer; Extras; Hell, even the guys who worked as runners on the set are helping to produce anything as an earthly shattering arm, either either because they were sent here by the devil themselves to destroy the medium of film, or It's that because they most likely found employment on behalf of the Friedberg / Seltzer mob. <br /> <br /> The daughter of my boss (who I'm pretty sure was going to wear the title "My boss's daughter" entitled "Grammatically Spoken") is all about his unfortunate male leader Tom Stansfield (Kutcher) and a night in His boss's house as he chases after this seemingly elusive "target" that is his young blond daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone who works in the same department as he does in a towering office building in Chicago while working under the stern eye of Jack Taylor (Stamp) Tom spies on Lisa early, she takes the subway to work with all the other Shmos, though she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damned company after he tries had talked to her but his attempts were frustrated by a puking baby and a guide dog who cared more about Tom's pace than anything else, he finally gets the chance in the office when elsewhere an after-dark party is said that he should come to her house to visit her - and yes, she still lives with her father. Remember Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho, in which the gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother are reversed and then played for laughter. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene where Tom sits in the subway, the character's clear characterization will painfully train and travel to work with his yuppie cohorts. They are a reckless and grubby bunch, apparently pulling through the briefcases of those unhappy enough to leave them in the door the next morning without ever returning them. Someday Tom will happen there, and his wish is to give it back to him, so that he does not bump into us like other guys (!). This is when he sees Lisa in the carriage for the first time and is a bit shy of approaching her like the other men treat the whole situation, as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position. This rather blatant and crude attempt to try to get us to side with Tom is uncomfortable with what it ostensibly needs to earn a place among these colleagues in this company. <br /> <br /> As close as My Boss's Daughter comes to every level of filmmaking. From a seemingly harmless premise of a boy who meets a girl and wants to meet her, the comedy comes from hell. Tom, who arrives at the house, will not see him invited to the party, instead being accused of sitting Jack's pet owl in the house and generally out of mischief while maintaining a spotless home. The character of Terrance Stamp means business in the strictest way to fire people for the smallest, such as making a bad cup of coffee. It's not that Jack is a beaten businessman, he's a cleanliness freak. obsessed with control and a border sociopath in placing bear traps in the garden to keep the children next door away from his land. You can imagine that if we are left in his big and exquisite home with the order that nothing should go wrong, there will obviously be trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie has fun on this premise of danger about ten minutes. If someone uses the worktop for the first time to crack a beer and use it to mark the flawless top, you may be grinning, but when half of the house is destroyed and Michael Madsen urinated on the carpet, you have your head pure your hands. Each joke of the film is constructed in an omnipotent, clumsy way, before being played out in a slow and tormenting manner as smooth and flawless. The only thing missing from the next gag is the sound effect. Someone turns the gears wrong in a car as it falls on the next accident. Amidst the gross craze, the film needs time to pave the way for happy, saccharine romanticism as Lisa and Tom talking about job and out-of-work personas, and they may have more in common than first thought. At the hour of the hour, the film opted for rough out-gags and hate-filled jibes more than anything else, when there's a whole scene intended only for paraplegics, and a stupid subplot turned into a blind with a head-injury sports neighbor Date has really unsurpassable visual gags are unfolding. Meanwhile, Stamp's character enjoys tearing down people and asking if the simplest tasks are too difficult for them, to which the usual response should be loud as they channeled Jack Taylor: Reading the script was initially too complicated - a concept for You, Stamp?
