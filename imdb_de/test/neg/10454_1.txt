I knew where his monster was going five minutes after the monster appeared. But when I saw the first credits, I said, "Oh my god, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek), Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan coming in My movie was played by Liebling Soap, All My Childen, a few pounds more, but he can still play, then there was Veronica Hamill, too bad I was not sick to see her in the movie, I'm out for 20 minutes This is bad, I have never seen William Katt (by Perry Mason and The Great American Hero). <br /> <br /> All those stars and a lousy movie, I hope they got their paychecks. <br /> <br /> Badly bad
