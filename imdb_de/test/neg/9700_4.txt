While the new Pride & Prejudice movie is great to watch and the soundtrack is lovely, we do not see Jane Austen's pride and prejudice. For some reason, the film is set in the early 1790s, not in the Regency era, in which the novel takes place, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-free and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Nevertheless, the Bennets are in the novel Gentry class; They own a farm, but the pig does not go through the house, and the manure and manure yard is not adjacent to the house. Scenes are reset from the novel, and not to mention, Jane Austen has placed scenes in certain locations for some reason. For example, the film puts the great Darcy scene in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple and not in the Collins parsonage: why did Jane Austen put her in the rectory? Because while Lizzy and Darcy are talking in this scene with total, if brutal honesty, the Collinses never shared a straight word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre, who meets Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and see the panorama, she expects to cry "Heathcliffe" every moment! Austen was bronzed! Judy Dench is a great actress, but Lady Catherine is said to be big and flashy. Dainty Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor. But Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, suggesting that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine MI-5 on A & E; In P & P, however, he's rather the young Heathcliffe who never smiles - though Austen finds in the novel that Darcy Lizzy smiles quite a smile, and she notices this when she sees his wonderfully smiling portrait in Pemberley - a portrait made in This For some reason, the film is replaced by a sculpted marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is transformed into modern language. Mr. Bingley became such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that this is a great movie to watch and hear, but so different from Jane Austen's novel that any student who has watched the movie and believes it can replace reading by watching fails!
