I could have liked it if I did not like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> Do not really capture Arbus 'unique visual aesthetic (like Stanley Kubrick in "The Shinning", with the twin girls in the hallway), a direct tribute to one of Arbus' most famous photos and one with haunting qualities that none of these films, and certainly none of her characters (outgoing), parable (thin and Jewish, not wasp, Queen Kidman) or life, except some very superficial similarities, she was a fashion that later became, among others, "freaks" and "outsiders" This film focused on the "freak" as a symbol of artistic and personal empowerment in a very shallow and predictable way, but otherwise it might have been an interesting movie about the middle class fetish, but I was too upset to take care of it. <br /> <br /> If the name Arbus had been omitted, it might have been less annoying, but it had it ha Did not give her name in the title, I would not have cared to see this at all. A flop by the "secretary".
