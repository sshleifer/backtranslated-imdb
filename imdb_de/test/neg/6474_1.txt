The 1965 Disney Studio remake of a 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever cat running a F.B.I. Agent for a kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci gives a churlish, let me-outta-here performance as a cat owner, and the nourished is played by Doug E. Doug, who is embarrassingly exaggerated like a human caricature. A few rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and original cat actor Dean Jones) are funny and the recipe still contains some juice, but the handling here is so heavy and deceptive and the cat is so lifeless, that's strictly DOA <br / > <br /> * of ****
