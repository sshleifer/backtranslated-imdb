Tempest is based on the eponymous classic Shakespeare work, but bears little resemblance to the source material. <br /> <br /> It masquerades as cerebrally as its namesake, but is instead a jumbled, twisted and deceptive exercise in boredom. The original explored the premise that humans have a nasty side that would be destructive if left unchecked. Here you only get one uninteresting incident that makes everything go wrong in his private and professional life. He is endowed with a supernatural power with which he tries to control his surroundings; In other words: to find your own way. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something else has gone awry in his miserable life, he finds a secluded place and begins babbling, "Show me the magic!" while he whirled around with his hands and made a phrase "serious concentration". The way these scenes are shot makes it seem like he's trying to turn mistakes into other kinds of mistakes. Make a cockroach out of a spider, maybe, but at this point you really do not care. <br /> <br /> History has thrown him out of his life with his daughter on a Greek island, then you have an awkward relationship with a girl he meets, one of the most boring romance novels ever to be made for the film , The story just slows down and runs slower and slower. You are never given a reason to like or dislike someone. <br /> <br /> I will give this because of the beautiful Greek locations and the semi-optimistic conclusion (2) (though it is not clear whether the storm is there.) Power brought this end about or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other films; A notable example is "Forbidden Planet," which gave credibility to how power gets out of hand. <br /> <br /> In this Tempest, his only magic is to cure insomnia.
