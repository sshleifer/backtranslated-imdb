Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour wear this movie not without effort, as the script was apparently cobbled together from old episodes. If it came out, this must have been a real disappointment as it also applies to a bus ticket budget. Try to get it out of the house - which is terribly unrecognizable - a bad job all around - with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing match at the local gym just do not work. Most of them are just character setups for a solitary, not very good gag. However, the interaction of Rossiter and de la Tour (and everyone else with him) is usually funny; You even manage to create a soda-siphon gag, but you can see the struggle with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes the action halfway. Don Warrington has very little to do except "be black", and due to the random script hacks, Christopher Strauli changes the character at least twice. And in the end, as he often did in the TV series (though you may not remember - read the scripts), you can handle a 'time-up' ending. Were they so cynical or too desperate to work in the film business? Rossiter and de la Tour are always fun, but as a movie it's a terrible postscript of a lovingly reminisced television series. REST IN PEACE.
