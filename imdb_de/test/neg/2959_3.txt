Based on the true story of two young Americans selling state secrets to the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, "Falcon And The Snowman" aims to be both exciting and philosophical, slipping away in both departments. It's less le carré than who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton stars as Christopher Boyce, a former seminarian disgusted by Watergate and the civic values ​​surrounding him, is probably the wrong hired by an employee company Spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug dealer, Daulton Lee, who makes himself Boyce's courier and delivers secret files to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. An unusual synth jazz score, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for everyone and many scenes of angry boys getting angry in rooms, all leading to a decent moral dilemma thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really Penn's movie despite the second billing; His character can talk to the Russians while Hutton plays with his falcon. Hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before calling "Action." With Penn, it's a joker, whether you get a brilliant performance or a superior performance. Here it is a bit of both, but rather the latter, especially in the second half, when Lee changes from coke to heroin. He yells. He snorts. He crashes Russian embassy parties. He is beaten with phone books. He spits in the mirror, a big goober that he must have saved for paparazzi. "I do not remember who my friends are!" he cries out It's exhausting to just watch him. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to model Lee a bit on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo of "Midnight Cowboy", complete with excessively nasal line readings and constant eye displacement. John Schlesinger directed this film as well as "Midnight Cowboy," but apparently he had another Hoffman movie "The Graduate" in mind, which shot up scene by scene by Boyce and Lee by the pool and tried to decide how he should live his life her gilded cage. Too bad that nobody has suggested plastic. <br /> <br /> From the first pictures associated with Boyce and his bird in connection with the American decline, "Falcon" makes it clear that this is a news story, even though the news itself is still a long way off is clear, probably because the characters never get into focus. Should Boyce be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger do not seem to know what makes us harder. In the meantime, there are opportunities to build some excitement, such as Boyce stealing documents from the top-secret Black Vault he's working in, or Lee, who plays games with the Russians, leaps to scenes with the couple's families and friends interrupted. It is the normality of history that Schlesinger considers interesting, but for us this is the least interesting aspect. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: It's interesting to see a movie that makes the vibe of the 70s as good as this and refers to Maria Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, memorable in "Full Metal Jacket" , has a nice twist on Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but has some serious "Nam problems" under his party. Macon McCalman is doing well in a different way than the no-nonsense boss who gives Boyce his highly secure job. David Suchet, a Russian embassy official who deals with Lee, creates a fascinating blend of threat and friendliness. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon And The Snowman" stands or falls to the question of the two title characters, and neither the actors nor Schlesinger can reduce much of their answers. Worse still, after more than two hours in their alternately wild and catatonic society, you do not really want answers. They just want these credits to roll.
