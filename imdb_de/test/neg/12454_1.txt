This movie was recently televised by Turner Classic Movies. Although considered racy in his day and possibly earning money, even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit in the mud. <br /> <br /> There are many fifties musicals that can stand the test of time, even though they are outdated by current standards, but still enjoyed for good music or dance or an amusing act can be. However, "The French Line" fails in all these aspects. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that Russell was an excellent singer when she received lousy vocal material. The entire cast is pulled down by a boring, banal plot and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth recording and skipping just the musical numbers - they're lousy.
