This is probably the worst movie ever made. I know people are talking about how horrible Ed Wood movies were (Plan 9), but this movie makes Plan 9 look amazing. Chuck Norris makes a cameo, which is why I have no idea. Maybe to ruin his film career. Apart from Chuck Norris, the cast is made up of extras in daily newspapers and Mike Norris ... that's right, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director does not even have a CV and I have no idea where action or script came from. This must have been illuminated by a dreadful Southern Baptist minister who somehow had a third cousin who owned a studio (which I'm sure has been closed since then). <br /> <br /> I do not really know what else to say about this movie. I want to give you a summary of the plot, but I'm lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... an eternal fight. Apart from that, there are Indians. And a bunch of freaky kids who do not know how to behave ... they're just awkward and should not be in front of the camera. I do not know what was going on most of the time, but I know the movie was a great laugh. Mike Norris somehow pushes his daughter (on her bike) into the street ... but in the shot he is in the middle of the park. Somehow she learns to ride her bike at a speed equivalent to that of The Flash, and is hit by a car or bus ... I do not know. But she is dead. This is actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds sick, but as soon as you see Mike raising his hands to victory and then holding his head and screaming in horror, you'll understand. It does not show that the daughter is hit or anything ... you just have to assume that she was hit by a vehicle. But the movie is not clear. Maybe it was completely independent and she died of cancer. Anyway ... after that the movie gets really confusing and I have no idea what's really going on. I am a Christian and have no idea why this movie was made. I do not see any value for this film in a religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing they show students in film production 101. This is what you DO NOT want to do. <br /> <br /> Just look at it ... you'll hate it and for me it suggests you see it.
