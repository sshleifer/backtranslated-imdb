The actors are so bland that it is almost impossible to distinguish them (Pauline Kael said about the film: "The actors have names, but they are really anonymous") and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and recycle the trick that made Fred Astaire dance on the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" (but none of these men moves so well that he looks convincing). <br /> <br /> The low point of the movie is when one of the characters, an aviator, tries to convince some other "giants of the industry" to join him in a moon-rocket consortium showing them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon explaining how a rocket works in 2nd class! (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the script ...) <br /> <br /> The only plus is that the production design conveys a sort of "Amazing Stories" sensibility, and even that gets a lot better In the following film by the producer (George Pal) "When Worlds Collide", which looks similarly bad, but much more entertaining. However, Pal's best sci-fi film must be The Time Machine.
