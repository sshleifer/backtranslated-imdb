The attractive husband-wife writing team Robert Wagner (as Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) arrive in the sinister mansion of actress "Lorna Love" (actually silent movie star Harold Lloyd's house). Mr. Wagner and Mrs. Jackson are assigned to write the biography of the silent movie star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project because his father was once the famous star lover. Mysterious events unfold, and Jackson has to fight to save her husband from the ghost of the beautiful blonde "perfectly preserved" in a crypt on the estate; In addition, the evil woman seems to be anxious to own her husband and murder Jackson! <br /> <br /> This is a "Night of Dark Shadows" version featuring the real "Dark Shadows" alumni Kate Jackson, who knows and plays her role well. Robert Wagner lacks the intensity of David Selby. Sylvia Sidney (as Mrs. Joseph) passes Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is no comparison for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good at a role played by John Karlen (in a Dan Curtis production). <br /> <br /> There are smooth cameos by Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour. The delivery of Ms. Lamour resembles Joan Bennett, raising the question of why producer Aaron Spelling was no longer getting from the original "Dark Shadows" regulars. <br /> <br /> Director E. W. Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband; He worked with Ms. Blondell on "Here Come the Brides" and with Jackson on "The Rookies." "Death at Love House" has a tighter plot than the movie "Night of Dark Shadows"; it differs in the movie star angle; and with its "Father Eternal Fire" ending, it resembles the "Laura the Phoenix" series of the television series. <br /> <br /> **** Death in the Love House (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
