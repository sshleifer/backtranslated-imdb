Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in 1996 when I was eight years old. At that time CGI movies were a rarity; and good even more. At that time we also called ourselves CD players. But I digress. I liked this movie a lot in the past, and until I looked at it again, I had a really good memory of it. Hey, that's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All Dogs Go In Heaven" is clearly a robot. But I digress. <br /> <br /> Then I saw it again. That's really not one of his best, I can say now, eleven years later. I've seen a lot more movies and gained a bit more knowledge. Well, sure, the voice output is good, I'll give it to you. The story is okay. I mean, we see it all the time. A LOT OF. But it works. The musical numbers annoy me. This would have been at home in the eighties with this kind of music. In '96, most children's films had epic numbers, like the Lion King (who came out about a year ago, but whatever) or something similar. Here you will find show tunes in variety style. <br /> <br /> The animation also hurts. Sometimes choppy and others who change style and format completely with the change of attitude, it's really hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like "All Dogs Go To Heaven", but that could have been waaay better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
