This is officially the horrible, boring, cheesy and ridiculous movie ever created. The film is all about a crazy kid and his friends, and they end up with a 747. His dreams are very hackneyed and make no sense at all and are made very bad. Each special effect looks like it does not have modern technology and may have been developed by the kid who plays the "lead role" in the movie. If you watch this movie, you will definitely be stupid. I recommend you never to watch this movie, and if you do it, good luck and do not miss the brain cells that killed you. My comment does not quite cover the terrible creation from hell. The person who wrote the comment in front of me did not see the same movie I was looking at awfully and wished I had never seen. Peace.
