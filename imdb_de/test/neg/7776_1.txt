Terrible horrible movie for the television. Again the lifetime brings the predictable triangle. To find a damned, sloppy woman to get stupid, ignorant woman from another stupid husband who has no idea. <br /> <br /> I get nervous when I watch these films. You may ask, why am I looking at them? I have no idea. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad that I can not get away from it. I'm waiting for the bitch to start her up. And usually I'm not happy with how she only gets desserts. <br /> <br /> Well, if you can believe our vixen, is she stealing embryos from the clinic, and how do you do that? Without blood tests, DNA, requests and recommendations. She continues to kill the realtor Gabrielle Rose, who is for sale in broad daylight in the front yard of a home and no one sees her? She kills her mother, Susan Hogan, and one might predict this assumption if the mother evidently mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills are in her pocketbook to combat this allergy. Guess what? I will not continue. <br /> <br /> Finally you stay alone with the wife and the bitch in the house. Well, the evil triumphs, but far too slowly. Victoria Pratt as the bad girlfriend is appropriate in the role and looks a bit too unkempt and obvious. Tori spelling is usually empty. She has those big, big beds Davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head. I liked them better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays around the husband, who assures his wife that there's nothing wrong with him and his ex-girlfriend, even though he's seen all over the city being very chubby with her and half-naked at her house stands, as he sends the woman to the guard city to stay overnight. Nevertheless, he continues to deny the romance. <br /> <br /> Life never disappoints viewers with inhumane acts and stories about women and their stupid husbands. I wish I could rate this chestnut with "0".
