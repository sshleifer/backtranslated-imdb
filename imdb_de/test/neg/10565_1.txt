After the credo over a black sheet of paper with white paint stains on it oh, I'll be generous and call it a star field. We see an alien spacecraft crash against a meteorite and be forced to land on Earth. A terrific-looking model spacecraft lands on a terrific-looking model field. Inspect three nearby campers. From the burning spaceship comes a reptile that looks like an alien, the 'Nightbeast'. OK, so I lied, it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and a silver space suit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun, which fires at people with terrible special effects. The towns Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is being informed. He alerts his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a group of men to investigate. Meanwhile, the Nightbeast has killed an unfortunate motorist who stopped at the roadside for a leak. His two annoying children are running for help. They approach a house where two young people are kissing, the girl says "Someone is running towards the house". The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and looted by Nightbeast, he also kills the girl. Then he manages to kill the two children with his laser, maybe the Nightbeast is not so bad after all. Once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene, they have a gun / laser battle with the Nightbeast. After perhaps the most indescribable shooting fight in film history, only the sheriff, his deputy and a local Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survive. But the night beast is still alive, bullets seem to have no effect on it. The next day, the sheriff visits the mayor of the city, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to obtain permission to evacuate all residents of the city. He refuses to say that a party he holds for Governor Richard Ruxton can not be canceled and that he does not want to panic. The sheriff evacuates the city anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth), are attacked by Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to scare away the night beast and survive. Together with the sheriff, his deputy, and Jamie, they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler, it must be an amateur movie shot with family and friends. Look at the credits and see how many Dohlers are involved. That's probably why I should probably relax it, but that still does not stop it or excuse being a thoroughly horrible movie in every department. It has neither a story nor a purpose, it just happens time, what about Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex-girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? These and many more scenes do not add anything to the movie. The script also has no logic. Why does the Nightbeast stay in the city after it's supposedly evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when the nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect that would be embarrassed by an '80s spectrum. There is not really much blood or blood inside, a torn belly, a severed arm and a beheading, but they all look predictably poor. Credit where it is due, the Nightbeast itself looks mostly ok. There's a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy seen to be believed, music that even embarrassed pornography, and two really nasty nude people make this a difficult sequence. Less than outstanding acting, photography, music, light and editing make it a real task to prevail. And the worst part of this movie? It commits the deadly sin of being boring and having no fun in the least. I'm sorry, Don, but do not give up the job! To avoid in any case.
