I had never heard of this movie until it came to DVD. I was immediately fascinated by everything that went with it: the actors, the title, the cover and above all the author. Arthur Miller, you can not go wrong with him, right? Yes. I did not read the novel, but I guess it was much better than the movie. I had high hopes in this movie. I love Macy and Dern and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this film never really raises cookie statements about racism and bigotry. If you have never seen other films that deal with this topic, or if you never knew America was founded on bigotry, then this movie might inspire you. Others will probably find it predictable, stale and bland overall.
