Minor murder mystery about a lawyer trying to free his client from a murder the man sentenced twelve years ago. The case is compounded by the fact that he has escaped custody after his conviction. However, the PD believes that the man is innocent of the murder and is working to find the true killer. Gig Young as PD is fine, and James Anderson as a convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole is unsteady, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below average. Director George Archainbaud seems to have been more at home doing westerns - at that time he was producing Gene Serry's TV series in Columbia - but even if he had tried to liven up that image, the hacking script would have defeated his attempts. On average, at best, the film reaches its climax with a court scene that stems directly from an episode of "Perry Mason" and is just as predictable.
