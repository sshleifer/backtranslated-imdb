Ni√±as Mal is not a movie, but a bad episode of a cheesy, ill conceived soap opera. <br /> <br /> Acting is no better in soap operas, I think the author and director has seen too many Mexican soap operas and can not imagine anything else. <br /> <br /> Give up, go back to your soap operas so you can have an audience. <br /> <br /> Stop picking up our time and money and giving the once-respected Mexican film industry a bad name. <br /> <br /> It's NOT OK or good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
