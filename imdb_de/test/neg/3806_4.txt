A dreary drama with Pat O'Brien as a slimmed-down reporter emerging at his ex-chief's house to demand money for his son's operation, only to find him dead on the ground. Since O'Brien knows the identity of the offender, he offers to pay the rap for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted on a movie that pretends to have surprises, twists and turns, even if it is not. The performances are rotted all along the line, the film dresses like a hardened American Noir, but the mix of dodgy accents does not work and the story barely captivates. And it may contain the least attractive screen kiss of all time.
