What an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical play like fight, incessant and completely unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering on the confused victims, big "surprises". , Add a few bad camera moves that pretend to be stylish and creative, and you've already impressed the crowd. The totally undeserved popularity of this film shows impressively that the pop subculture at a very low level has not only succeeded in recent decades, but to give the dominant taste to an unconscious public. (For much deeper insights into the human suffering of mental illness, without the "vulgar excesses" of the Old Boys, I recommend an older Dutch / French movie "The Vanishing".) Well, do not think there's absolutely nothing good to say about this film. In fact, there is. The famous scene in which the hero (actually a "hero", a bad father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to get forgetfulness instead of salvation?) Eats a living octopus from the vivid presence of the best actor in the world the entire cast: the octopus itself. Too bad that the poor beast that was eaten could not survive his only act to get another worthless diploma for the "Best Actor" at the Cannes Festival. <br /> <br /> Which festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless, if somewhat exotic, craze, became a festival of gloom and ridicule. <br /> <br /> Sic Transit Gloria mundi!
