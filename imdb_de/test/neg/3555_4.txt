The acting in this film was from the old school: hackneyed and stiff. Irene Dunne is bright and comes out the best, although she has some very unnatural lines to say. Her ability to convey emotions is still going strong. <br /> <br /> Old film lovers will find at least some redeeming features in this film by watching the cinematic technique of the 1930s. Otherwise, it is not really worth it.
