Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) overtakes Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they pay back the money they stole (in Oceans 11), plus interest. However, he refrains from violent actions because he is under the guidance of the world's biggest thief, the Night Fox. The team then has to make a series of raids to repay Benedict as they test their skills against the Night Fox, who wants to maintain his position as the greatest thief of all time. Simply put, this movie is an absolute mess. The masses may argue that it's "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt have done a great job, but it's the same people who subscribe to the "Hello" magazine and believe that David Beckham has the potential to be a great one To become an actor. The story is complicated, it's neither complex nor smart, and it does not have any smart twists, it's just a complete jumble that runs in multiple directions, with the hope that the audience thinks it's cool and smart (Readers of the Hello World). Magazine)). Any respectable movie guard will, however, see the movie for the farce he is. Although Oceans 11 was not a great movie, it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent phrases. This movie loses its way very fast and then basically gives up. It's as if the director and the cast were saying, hey that does not work, let's just laugh! The cast looks like it's having fun, but it was not me. I will not delve into the plot as its kinky development justifies no trial. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes in which Julia Roberts personifies herself (with Bruce Willis as a cameo role) as they look amused amused seem to be a desperate step to interest the audience. The film is so full of action holes that it's as if Arnie had emptied a Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Some scenes in which the Night Fox uses Caopeira can be honored against the backgrounds of funky music. However, this is hardly a justification for the film. The last scene shows the team in a nonsensical, drunken stupor; This sums up the movie exactly. Stay with the original.
