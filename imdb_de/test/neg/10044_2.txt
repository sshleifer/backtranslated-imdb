If you have taken all the important elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitten, compulsory dance number, etc.), put it in a blender, and condensed it to 20 minutes, you would have this mess. To see painful; I may have laughed once. The story and the dialogue are incomprehensible, and the speakers of the voice sound like they're calling in their lines. The last revised version of the poem "The Christmas Story" felt like it had been written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With their desperate attempt to be hip and up-to-date, this show has long since been superseded and forgotten, while classics like "The Grinch ??" will remain timeless. A sad waste of all involved, a true "jumping of the shark" for the Shrek franchise.
