The unthinkable happened. I saw it for the first time a few years ago. I had a movie that was my measure of horror and the movie was called "McCinsey's Island". A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I do not mind that), it plunged into new depths of filmmaking and is still the only movie I've ever seen that asked me what else the budget of the movie would be can be spent for. Like new schools or cancer drugs. However, with sheer and unadulterated amount of crap, every film needs to lower its standard even further if it wants to outnumber "Guest House Paradiso" by distinguishing one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the puerile but amusing TV show "Bottom". He introduces us to two of the biggest losers you can imagine. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as rude as you can imagine, and so twisted that he almost drains mud from every action. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human lives and together they try to lead Britain's worst hotel on a cliff next to a nuclear power plant. Between them, they periodically treat themselves with cartoons (with sound effects), stealing everything they need or interest from the fools who stay there, staring at each woman wistfully. The plot as it is includes the arrival of the famous Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel), who fled her wedding and is trying to settle down at the Guest House Paradiso, much to the surprise of Richie and Eddie. And that was it. <br /> <br /> I used to think that the carry-on films were all bad in the British film industry and God knows we've spent so much time and money to escape this god's terrible legacy. We had films like "Trainspotting," "28 Days Later," "Four Weddings And A Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg), but that ... that pulls back the screaming and screaming films to the days when Sid James and Barbara Windsor flew away with the help of a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it offends you as soon as you see it. I kept looking, waiting for the jokes in anticipation, but they never came. Just an endless stream of trapped gags, unimaginative scenarios that resist any explanation, some amusing force with frying pans and refrigerator doors, and almost nothing that makes you smile. Come on for the first commercial break (it was on TV, you see) and I was ready to switch off, but my loyal duties towards you, my readers, kept me going. "I'm watching this so they do not have to become my mantra, so you better remember how much you owe me because it was about as much fun as putting sand in my eyes and force-feeding Dog food was given. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I loved the "Bottom" TV Show. The combination of appropriately dingy drama by Mayall and Edmondson with OTT's youth cessation worked ... every week for half an hour. Certainly not for an hour and a half, while Edmondson and Mayall take their little private joke and annoy and depress the rest of the audience. Honestly, Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" is like "The Godfather" and if you happen to meet one of the two people (who are pretty much alone in the chaos of the screen pretending to be a movie), you can hurry to bring a boot into the testicular region. You would probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both hotel guests) are pulled down with this sinking ship, but at least survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so happy. The film equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
