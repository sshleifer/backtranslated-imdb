The seven collaborations between director Joseph "von" Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so different in appearance and tone and so different from the events of that time that they almost represent their own subgenre. Like every genre, they have their absolute masterpieces and their absolute turkeys. Time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the stubborn temptations of The Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss Dietrich saw her image as a cabaret singer-prostitute, someone At Paramount, Marlene decided to play a mother. There is nothing wrong with that. As an actress, she had grown to the role. It's just that the format has changed nothing else. It's like the Blue Angel plus a kid. The story of a woman dragging her child on her grubby escapades is a good prerequisite for a tragic drama, but that's not how it is played. Dietrich's journey is played as a kind of adventure, with her mind and accomplices, to stay ahead of the law. This is not a cheeky example of pre-code libertarianism? it's just bizarrely uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Although we can accept Marlene as a damn mum, there is absolutely no way to buy Sternberg as a director of warmth and sensation. Although it is one of the few images for which he has earned a writing credit, Sternberg is simply not in the story arc. The emotional reward of the film is supposed to be the later reunification of the family, but even at the beginning this is not considered to be of value. As usual, the interiors of Sternberg are dressed and shot like brothels or madhouses. The home of Faradays is actually a pretty scary, dingy environment, and it's a miracle that little Johnny did not wet the bed and turned on the light to sleep. <br /> <br /> But anyone who is familiar with them will know it The purpose of a Dietrich / Sternberg image is to make Dietrich look fabulous, and in this respect, at least Blond Venus is a success. Marlene is presented in a bright, shimmering close-up from a forest pool, and even if she disintegrates into rags, the camera still loves her. The same can not be said for the rest of the cast that Sternberg saw as moving sceneries. The otherwise sympathetic Herbert Marshall is here reduced to a moody nag who lurks in the shadows. Even the loveable and lively Cary Grant becomes a boring background blob and does not seem to be nearly interesting for Dietrich. <br /> <br /> The only outstanding moments in Blonde Venus are Marlene's vocal and dance routines. In particular, the famous Hot Voodoo number, in which she parodies her own surreal stage figure by appearing from a gorilla outfit. But these too feel like they've been cut and pasted from another movie. The fans of Sternberg may call it another masterpiece, as is usually the case, but for the average fanatic this is a huge disappointment. The audience of that time had not made it like their previous hits, and this was the beginning of the end for Marlene's heyday. A year later there would be a new queen at Paramount? Mae West
