The movie had moments, but was still disappointing in my eyes. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and thus of the treasure of the Sierra Madre, with less tension, bite and human emotions. There were some nice shows, but the story was limp and had no real depth. I saw the movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, both were not enthusiastic and both had little to say or act. This movie was shot to death in the past and did not have to be shot. He consumes money that could be used for better movies. It was sparse for an action movie and not thrilled as a thriller. Better to watch than snow, but not for me.
