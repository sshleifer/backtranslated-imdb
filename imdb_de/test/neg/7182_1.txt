Another example, that we should stay away from spectacular action films in Sweden, it does not work, except Widerbergs is still an unsurpassed MAN PÃ… TAKET. I think Stormare is doing the best he can, and some scenes are mildly effective, but the storyline is full of holes. Why is Hamilton continuing the attack on the base and knowing that his wife is being held hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his Bad Guy part was very well signed. I'm always amazed that relatively large Swedish films are made without a decent, working script. 1 out of 5.
