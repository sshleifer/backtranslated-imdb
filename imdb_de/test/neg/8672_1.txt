Please ... if anyone gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if it can be called that, do not ... do not waste your time !!!! I saw this movie right after the book was completed and was seriously disappointed ... the main character is basically a newly invented Fanny, because she bears no resemblance to the book ... she is so lively and laughs all the time. .. if there was one thing the author wanted to get involved with was that she was a very shy, introverted character ... please !!!!! All important parts of the story that are supposed to lead to the heppy ending are simply not taken into account ... and the rest is made up !!! I think you use the time better to either read the novel or just do nothing.
