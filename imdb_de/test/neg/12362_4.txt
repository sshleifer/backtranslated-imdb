Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of one of the old "Attack of the Giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]" movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more of a remake than what was. How is a monster movie shot in 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemicals that make the spiders grow to gigantic proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers and give them parodies like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best match, but Eight Legged Freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that sometimes it was more like Scary Movie. It was way too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie full of jokes. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this you do not expect much from acting. and that's just how it was. However, the story was extremely thin and there were only a few loose-knit events to show some action with all the jokes, resulting in a slightly soiled ending. <br /> <br /> I rate Eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and that also includes that the special effects were pretty good and that the sounds of the spiders were funny.
