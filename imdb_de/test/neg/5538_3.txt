The artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his buddy Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are drawn by his wealthy childhood friend, Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish), in an old house in Cornwall, UK. Natasha has a crush on Daniel, who is an ambiguous man in terms of his sentimental life. When they are alone in the house, strange things happen and Laura is scared and scared. When Laura meets old maniacal priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) in the street, she is advised to leave the house immediately because evil has lived there. But the couple remains and must face tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a chaotic screenplay and a horrible and cheesy movie is this "Devil's Harvest"! The cinematography and the camera work are not all that bad, but the amateurish performances of Chris John and Carol Kentish and the direction of James Shanks along with the terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this movie one of the worst I've ever seen genre , I've occasionally seen some shorts from Cinema College on YouTube that are better and better than the pointless and horrible "Devil's Harvest." In the end, it's not a horror movie, but a horror of the movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Colheita do Diabo" ("The Devil's Harvest")
