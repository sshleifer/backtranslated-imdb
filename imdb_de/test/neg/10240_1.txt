How can ANYONE give anything higher than a "1"? <br /> <br /> I thought "Manos, the Hands of Fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to hit my optic nerve. In fact, I did not think something could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxina" is this rare film in which EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT is painful, agonizing, blindingly bad. How many times have you watched a movie and commented, "Who the hell LIT this thing?" From the lighting to the soundtrack to the effects to the screenplay, to acting and cinematography. , , Well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely unbearable. It's so bad that I could not even say if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to be ridiculous at all. I'd rather eat a plate of broken glass than go through it again.
