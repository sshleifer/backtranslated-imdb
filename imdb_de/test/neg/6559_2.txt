I've just seen this movie recently and I said, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of an action, we have a very bad action called action! What I really thought was bad was when Kirk and McCoy taught Spock how to "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" Not me. But when it comes to being a director, he's shit! This movie is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But it's the worst in the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that Shatner did not make another movie in the series after that. They did not seem to want him to shoot another movie after this event! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is shit! <br /> <br /> 2/10
