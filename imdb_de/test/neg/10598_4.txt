I was really looking forward to this movie. The commercials made it look really cool and action-packed. And I've heard that Claire Daines' character was arrested for assault, so I thought she might kick a lot and that would be cool. BUT NOOOOOOOO !!. There was hardly anything to do and the character was somehow mild. The only saving grace was Omar Epps and he also did not help much with this film.
