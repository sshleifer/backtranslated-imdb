Sometimes it's funny to implode movies from your couch, but sometimes it's terribly painful for your eyes and head. House Party 4: One of the rare examples is to the very last minute, when both your eyes and your mind ask you to turn off the movie. This last installment of the House Party series is by far the worst, not just the sequel, but the movie released by Hollywood. This "feature" makes it very clear that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off out of passion. I say that because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no difficulty in taking Bueller's originality from John Hughes' hands and opting for a film that is completely devoid of humor. One might think that by "stealing" motifs and images from a funny movie, one's own movie could produce at least one or two giggles. With House Party 4, Stokes proved he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, let alone a Hollywood movie. Through his confusing and choppy history, the inability to understand his characters, and old and tired clich√©-moments of recycled material. All Stokes does is push a bigger nail into the coffin holding the House Party movies. It reminds me of this student who forgets his project in an hour and quickly brings super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and straws together and presents them as "Hannibal Crossing the Alps". It just looks awful and you feel embarrassed for the creator. <br /> <br /> So, where did this movie first take the stupid stupidity? To be honest, I do not think most places will allow me to talk that long. Instead, I would like to address some of the bigger issues that hit me hardest. At the beginning, I still can not shake off the Ferris Beuller rip-off. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to feature another House Party successor, and decided to introduce a completely random formula (from a funny movie) to see if he would cut elements from the original series into that formula and could insert. That was a big mistake. When a director tries to do that, eventually confusion happens in the audience. We believe that we are going in one direction, but we are going in another direction. This is exactly what you can testify in House Party 4. In one case, we're trying to get John-John to have the "biggest party of the decade" and at the same time try to get a record deal (ok, somehow that reminds me of the original House Party)), but then we disappear to that random island On which Uncle Charles is afraid to fly, Grandmother gets drunk and some idiotic moments with a supposed murderer. Again we start a bit strong and end up chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes had neither the ability to hold the pulse of humor, nor the ability to tell an ongoing story. He would rather cut the corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the public is idiots, rather than trying to revive a stone coronet. One might think that if a director were given the task of making another House Party movie, he would think that he / she would be the one who would revive him or bring him back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to get paid. </ p> <br /> I notice that as the days go by quickly, I am getting older, but I think I still hold my hand in the culture of the younger generation. I heard rap and R & B as I grew up, but the group "Immature" never made it to my tape deck or my CD player. Why? I do not think they've ever had any followers, but apparently it's an advantage for director Chris Stokes to be the lead actor in his new house party movie. Did not anyone in any studio know that this would be pretty fast in the red? Or what about the option of letting Stokes play the comic car writer himself, nothing like a director with no weird timing pretending to be the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few instances in which I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would say that in any movie. Outside of a band that plays the main role, I thought that the rest of the cast only sucked the life out of this movie. Uncle Charles was angry when he tried humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted on her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ?? Well ?? All others fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend most of his budget on this film? Not for special guest stars, because while this movie might boast some, definitely no one was present at the "memorable" house party, nor the possible dream that Kid or Play might have a final performance. House Party 4 did not follow a pre-set design, which eventually ruined this feature from its inception. Can anyone explain why it was necessary to use the routine "The escaped murderer, who happened to be a licensed taxi driver" out of humor? Stokes reached deep into the bottom of the barrel and only produced more dirt instead of substance. For once, I can admit that there is no redeeming value for this film. House Party 4 has buried the series, and although I hear there's more in the pipeline, I just hope Hollywood recognizes that this series has died. Hollywood has to end this series, forget the past and go to the future. I think a sequel to Who is the Man? would take them in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Note: * out of *****
