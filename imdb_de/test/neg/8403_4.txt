A disturbing film that culminates in an intense reunion between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure it contains a poetically presented visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesicist. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two threads, the weaker is the gradual revelation of Graham / Pablo's condition. Through this wound, however, a beautiful description of his condition and his meandering path leads to a partial awakening, driven by his affair with Irene. The affair is the strong thread, while the peculiarities of the act are borne by a seemingly pinned character collection: Graham's best friend, who can uncover the cause of his condition in a shrinking retrospect, his manipulative boss and his weird scientist, the crazy scientist and psychologist is and dependent. <br /> <br /> The failure of the film is in conflict between the two threads. One is visual, meandering and sublime, while the other is structured like an inappropriate thriller, all expository dialogues and unsolved patterns of symbolism. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I liked Novo. It keeps flirting with the abyss of taboo, shying away into something beautiful, like the quarry, with the double bass player and the two women, when building a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still do not have the tooth. <br /> <br /> Odd, clunky and a narrative failure, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
