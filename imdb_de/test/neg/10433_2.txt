When I think of a movie from the 70s, I do not think about it. I do not want a monotonous, monotonous Robin Trower soundtrack. I want a soundtrack to the day's top 40 bubblegum songs that epitomized the 70s. Particularly annoying was the generic karaoke disco music during the prom scene. Acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden and just seemed to be monotonously read from the script. The film quality and camera work was terrible; the dialogue clouded, the script seemed to be scrambled without much thought and the plot was thin, if not absent. I can not believe that people are giving the high ratings I read here. Essentially a forgotten, feeble attempt to restore a beloved era of the past. Two stars is everything I can imagine. I'm sorry people.
