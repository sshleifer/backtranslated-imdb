Coen Brothers MÃ¶chtabe, by writer-director Paul Chart relies too much on ideas that come from other (better) films, but creates a spooky atmosphere in which you can constantly watch. Robert Forster plays like never before a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha), who makes a series of murders in the desert. The film is unusual, but in an attempt to be one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and repulsive (with a role that makes Amanda Plummer extremely humble). An admittedly bravura finale, many quirky shops - and Forster, who looks great naked - make this a curious subject, nothing more. The experienced film director Irvin Kershner has produced and perhaps should also direct (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 of ****
