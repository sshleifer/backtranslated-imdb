This is the third movie in a month that I saw and did not go as I expected. The first two are "The Black Dahlia" and "Hollywoodland," both of which had no fresh ideas of who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I've always had a fascination for UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie subject of a UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes everything went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could have stood for acting, camera angles and stereotypes, if only there was a good story about hunting for UFOs, but not here. I'm not saying anything was wrong with the topic, but Netflix has won this film as a UFO skeptic and UFO creditor who is investigating multiple sessions. <br /> <br /> I stopped halfway. I can not believe that I wasted so much time with this. Please do not make the same mistake as me.
