I remember that as a devotee of Mrs. Frank, I was so excited that the play was rebuilt for television. That is, until I see it ... This film is a prime example of how important casting is and how directing plays such an important role in creating a sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL for a production of this kind ... Shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the main actor's charisma. And in the cast of this film, the whole thing is destroyed by cruelly occupying Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is not ONE MOMENT in which Ms. Gilbert has almost reached the sensitive, mature spirit of Anne. Ms. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the movie. The only time I was close to tears was the reading of Anne's most urgent line: "I still believe that people are really good in the heart, after all" - this is spoken of so quickly by Mrs. Gilbert that it is theirs lacking in conviction that she may have been well rested and accomplished the same. The film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production - she would have had to refund her salary! Although Ms. Gilbert has ruined DIARY, other performances for most of the particular Kudos are satisfying for Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter, and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the deep-rooted soul and the deepest mind like Otto, as the creator of the role on stage and in the film (Joseph Schildkraut), but he is fine. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial - they are shrill and bombastic, but only on the surface. This could be due to the fact that the pace of the project is far too hectic (as noted in previous postings) - this movie is 45 minutes shorter than the movie version - the difference due to the pauses for dramatic effects that seem obvious necessary to spread the appropriate mood for the story. This is NOT compulsory, especially for teens who first learned about Anne Frank - stick to the original movie version and, even better, the TV production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley, which is the first NEXT thing is experience the heart and the reality of Anne's situation that was ever filmed! Note: Especially horrible is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Annes sister Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex ... She is in the post office together with the actors who play Miep. Credits listed and Mr. Kraler. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I would LOSE!
