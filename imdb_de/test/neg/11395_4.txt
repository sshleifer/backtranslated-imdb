After watching this movie, I thought they really glossed over Errol Flynn's life! The movie is really a feast for the eyes. They made the atmosphere of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s just right. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked good and bleak. <br /> <br /> Is this a serious movie about Errol Flynn's life? Close! It's a funny movie based on all the scandalous stuff he's done in his life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this movie? This is a movie that was promising but did not deliver. Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn. He did not look as good as the original, but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a pretty playboy who did not take himself seriously, but a man who, although he had great talent, was somehow disturbed and disturbed was unhappy. Flynn's love life was a disaster, considering he had so many failed marriages. He also lost many good friends during his life. He also suffered from an unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The final scene of the film showed that Errol somehow asked Olivia to stay with him and instead she leaves. He is shown in his tuxedo, looks really empty and walks slowly around the pool while pouring his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the film, but somehow fitting, because everyone now knows how he ended up separating from his alcoholism and distracted lifestyle. This movie could have been much deeper, better written. Sure, they showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to make the character of Errol Flynn a little more emotional, even if the writing of the film was not deep enough there. I'll probably never see this movie again, but I can. Remember, after watching this movie, "Geez, that could have been so much more ...!" I give this movie a D +.
