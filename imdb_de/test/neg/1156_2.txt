I'm a big fan of horror movies and know lots of information about serial killers. Obviously, the director refused to research the film he created because half of the film was fictional. In addition, the character of Ed Gein was depicted in the wrong light. I did not borrow the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to see Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was awful, the only reason why I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the blood pressure was not that bad. Acting = horrible actors = sub par movie = waste of time. <br /> <br /> A big surprise, but I'm not giving up my search for a good horror movie.
