All this show is the same action. Kuszko (spelling?) Run the risk of failing the school, he must exist to become emperor. He has to learn something he considers stupid, he uses it / learns more about it and realizes it's not that stupid. Eezma tries to turn Kuszko into an animal to stop him. Every episode. <br /> <br /> Jokes from the movie are copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko constantly breaks the 4th wall, squirrels.) You should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
