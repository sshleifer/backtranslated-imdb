The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character, as another user put it, is "unnecessarily cruel." Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith. Well-dressed but appropriately bumbling Robert Montgomery plays well. The movie has some fun moments, especially if Montgomery's character does anything to get his "wife" back. Understandably, she is upset because the marriage is not technically legal, but she only finds out three years. <br /> <br /> Lombard's character seems rather cold to her husband's righteous attempts to pull her around. Although Montgomery is not very skilful in this endeavor, he is visibly adorable, and yet Lombard is as cool as an ice pillar. There is almost no evidence to suggest some sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the film, and it's hard to see any kind of comedy - even dark comedy - in that aspect. To a certain extent, the film almost suggests a sadistic undertone, with Lombard's character getting "kicked" by her husband's weak efforts. One might think of this as another "Battle of the Sexes" movie type, but the reality is that it is a highly one-sided battle if the: Montgomery's character, though certainly flawed, is not flawed enough to become one typical copy of the male to make chauvinist / misogynist (a great example of this is Michael Douglas in 'War of the Roses'). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as is not only Montgomery's sharp dress (which is probably due to the ever-keen actor himself), but also his discomfort in trying to play the role of a female bachelor. His only serious mistake is his vanity, but this mistake does not offset his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no indication that she is trying to make jealousy out of subconscious love. That makes it so cruel and sad. Montgomery's character just looks weak. In fact, no woman would want such a weak man if she does not "wear pants" in marriage. On the other hand, a woman who wears trousers during marriage would never be so cruel because she confirmed that role early on. Therefore, the whole topic seems funny. This film is neither an advocate of feminism (Lombard's character shows some signs of a kind of independent woman of the 60s, but this idea is soon lifted and the character goes back to the 1940s) the genders (Montgomery's character is really a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause). <br /> <br /> This film is slapstick on the surface, but under this veneer it is really much darker and sadistic undertones. All this makes its resolution look good, odd. (Maybe this weirdness was the whole point?). In any case, slapstick this movie is not.
