Several years ago, Sara, a young girl, witnessed her parents being murdered. Now, as an adult, she suffers from various mental ailments (as I've already mentioned, that she has an imaginary girlfriend), but more like a sense of drowsiness. It was deadly boring, and it was hard for me to go through with it, as I felt my eyelids heavier and harder with every passing minute of thoughtless bantering and pretended "mystery." Is Sarah crazy? Or is it the paranormal? A better question would be: who cares? And the answer, no one. Nobody at all. Skip this movie and save yourself time better suited to other, more rewarding tasks. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
