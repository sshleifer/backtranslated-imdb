This is the first movie I have seen from Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem. The above title was later added superfluously, as there is a similar 1961 film starring Richard Basehart, which was the only engraving of Michael Carreras of Hammer Films in the West; The original Italian title was originally translated with HIS NAME WHAT SAM WALBASH, BUT THEY HAVE LOOKED AT IT AMEN, although in the Italian version it was actually WALLACH, which of course implies a kind of tribute to the Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> Although certainly not unsurpassably bad, there are many cases of awkwardness and awkwardness, so I often burst into laughter: a terrible number from a possibly irresistible French Chanteuse; a completely irrelevant brawl in the barroom; Actors who do somersaults when shot; an old villager performing an improvised dance routine; ineffective use (yes abuse) of slow motion; and, the simplest absurd thing to do is see Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate playing two shooters (the actor's own names!) hired by the villain to kill the title character and then never in the rest of the movie to appear! ! <br /> <br /> Lead actor Robert Woods is just whispering the Amens ineffectively over the bodies of his victims. The actress Simonella Vitelli (actually the director's own daughter!) To support, since the villain is wide, she looks pretty good, but she does not get much in the film, unfortunately? despite a heart change towards the end. The main musical theme is actually pretty good, but the title song is pretty bad in itself.
