A friend of mine showed me this movie yesterday, and I was really surprised that someone could make a movie so horrible! <br /> <br /> Mix the most dreadful, clich√©d dialogue with most of the wooden acts you've ever seen, with the coolest special effects that man knows, and you get that great beast! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is funnier than most of the comedies I've ever seen, it's really awful! <br /> <br /> I was in a scene where the ex-cop / vampire assassin drinks character with the internet journalist. Just look at it and you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> I honestly can not believe that someone did this with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but a really good laugh. It has to be seen to be believed.
