*** SPOILER ALERT *** Disjointed and confusing arson that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a large vacation spot before New Year's Day. Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is insured for ten million dollars. The man behind the Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains in Australia is determined to set his own project on fire to collect. This must be done by 1 January, two weeks before the policy expires on the project. <br /> <br /> With his thought of construction worker and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt has no idea His boss, Julian Fane, plans to burn down the resort he is building and possibly use him as a fall warrior. Anderson gets a little suspicious when insurance investigator Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs him of some fishy things between Fane and the insurance company Proud Alliance. It turns out that Stolze Allience actually or 60% of it owns Fane itself! This explains why Fane has sparked all these arsons to collect the $ 10 million in insurances that are at least twice what the entire Valley View Estates are worth! <br /> <br /> Later, we murdered Sophie McCann on a fake swimming accident so she can not figure out what to do with the suspicious fries in and around Valley View Estates. It is when Lloyd's of London, who is responsible for the Proud Alliance, James Mason, the insurance investigator George Engles, emerges that Fane takes a powder that leaves his ass-arsonist alone and gets out of control to the entire plan of Fane destroy. Meanwhile, Anderson has asked both Fane and Engles, who, unlike Fane, let the Valley View Estates go under for reasons that are never quite clear. Just look at the last few seconds of the movie to see it, by its author and director. The arsonist is unmasked as he comes to rescue his girlfriend with Anderson. We then have this wild chase scene where the arsonist got lost at the Valley View construction site to set her on fire with the help of Howard Anderson, where he burns down at the end of the fire department. <br /> <br /> The sudden and inexplicable ending never made it clear what exactly had happened to the Big Cheese in this whole scheme of things, the sinister and evil Julian Fane. It is as if Fane had escaped without a hilt and only his unstable and confused henchman, the arsonist who was only the instrument of Fanes crime, ended up being the only person to pay for them.
