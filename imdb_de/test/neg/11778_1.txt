I like hunting. It has its charm, but lately it's too much propaganda. For an outsider (a non-American), the patriotic feeling can be a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I do not like that Rabb and MacKenzie are lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become superheroes that stop wars and save entire continents. It's almost like watching a recruiting video from the US Army. <br /> <br /> I'm still watching the show, so it's not so bad. But I would prefer more episodes if Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military accidents and save the world in the future.
