David Bryce's comments are exceptionally well written and informative, as they say almost everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This huge musical is so strange and overused, overproduced and must have led to fractures in Paramount in 1970. It cost $ 22 million! That's just irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have shone green from a board meeting that said, "Hey, we have this Pink Panther guy and this Sound Of Music girl ... let's get that, too" and handed over a blank check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) That are as hopelessly old-fashioned as being musical porridge, and MATA HARI drama. The production is colossal, lush and breathtaking, but the rest: The ridiculous romance, Julie, who looks confused, Hudson is already dead, the wrong comedy and the amazingly boring songs make this spectacular movie irritating. LILI is like a twenty-year-old mega-musical with a few vulgar pieces to spice it up. STAR! unfortunately crashed a year ago and is now finally appreciated for the excellent movie is real ... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and me I think, really killed by the mega-musical of the 60s ... and Andrews again looked like Poppins ... which in my opinion was not Edward's intention. Paramount must have fainted collectively when they saw this: and with another $ 20 million in CATCH 22 and $ 12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON ... they had with 77 million US dollars a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA shares bound in 4 films with very uncertain future. Maybe they should have asked Seers Daisy Gamble of ON A CLEAR DAY ... LILI was very popular at the first release in Australia and ran for months in 70mm cinemas, but failed once in the submarines and the sticks and only ever After that, ONE CLEAR DAY saw a Sunday night double on one night. Thankfully, Paramount had shot her simple movie, LOVE STORY, with a million dollars (yes, a million dollars), and this $ 4 million pic hero THE GODFATHER was also ready to recover all $ 77 million in just two years ... for only 5 million dollars. ... incredible!
