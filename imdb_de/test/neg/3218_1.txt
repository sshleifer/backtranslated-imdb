What's the deal with all these ethnic crime groups who copy movies about Italian Mafia? We all know the godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican who is just a close copy. I can not understand why other ethnic groups have to imitate and imitate Italian gangsters, but that certainly makes them stupid. They certainly seem to be wanabee Italians. I would much rather see Mexicans putting on their own ideas and seeing their own culture and the way they do it instead of copying ideas from the godfather trilogy. Apart from that, the movie was disappointing to see how Mexicans play and trying to be Italian is not my cup of tea. After I've looked at this, I now look at the "real" Godfather, so that this film can be deleted from my memory.
