I'M BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Films <br /> <br /> Pros: Absolutely no <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: I I do not know where to start! <br /> <br /> Summary of storyline: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, speaks and behaves more like a live action cartoon character. That's all I got out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Review: I remember the time when I was in ninth grade during the release and everyone in my class pampers that clown named Master P, it's not even funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired clich√©s, the sound is only audible when playing music, and the movie looks like it has been recorded on video from a public channel. Fortunately, I did not buy this movie like all my degenerate classmates downtown. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My conclusion: I do not like this video a sexually transmitted disease.
