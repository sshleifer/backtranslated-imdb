"In the seething summer of 1958, the gang of Brooklyn prisoners finds their turf threatened as the leader of a rival gang, the Vipers, is released from prison leading his boys through bloody brawls to keep the Vipers out, but as his brother (Brad Renfro) into a sultry and dangerous relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), the sister of a Viper, and brutally attacking his own girlfriend, Leon and his gang are involved in a war over his brother, his girl and save his neighborhood! "according to the DVD cover description. This is definitely not a basketball diary. <br /> <br /> Think of it as a "West Side Story" hit by baseball bats and steel pipes over your head. The stickball has left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some cool Hollywood sets, cars from the 50s and soundtrack songs; and many of them are beautifully photographed by John A. Alonzo. The story and the direction never go beyond these strengths, so that the film can reach its peak in the first few minutes and drive downhill. The cast looks good when you read the credits, but translates into an aging, limp confusion of fake pompadours, blood, and brylcreem? and a scared wig. A feeling of sadness and regret pervades production. *** Deuces Wild (03.05.02) Scott Kalvert - Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
