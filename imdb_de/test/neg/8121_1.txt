Seriously ... I am amazed at the good feedback this show has here. All we have on this show are two stupid kids who are always making annoying laughter, and they are doing funny stuff only in ... 2 of the shows, while most of the others are sucking ... then how do they comment on music videos i can not stand in person while they either love or like. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, you'll just hear the repeated "Let's score with some chicks," or "I'll kick your ass." "Or better still and usually used quote" that was cool ", and especially her annoying laugh. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy , South Park This show is simply not worth the time and energy to truly see this terrible MTV series.
