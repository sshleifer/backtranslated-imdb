Uwe Boll returns in his film art to tell a sci-fi horror story about mercenaries and reporters fighting super-soldiers on a remote island. A good cast, led by the outstanding Udo Keir, is dropped by Boll, who makes the worst script that should work. The crazy scientist being investigated by a reporter was put to death, but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked. Also, the effects and super-soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have a certain amount of scary quality, but Boll somehow manages to film everything in an open-minded way. It's as if he could not bother to figure out what would work. Instead, he rattled off his camera positions and walked away. In addition, the composition of scenes has no spark or life. I suspect that Boll shot only one or two takes and used only what he had. It really stinks. Boll is clearly in one of his periodic, retrograde films, in which everything he has ever learned about film is washed away. The last movie he did so badly was Seed, a serial killer movie that's one of the worst I've ever seen. That's not so bad, but it's close to being better. On the other hand, Udo Keir is good enough that he's worth watching his scenes, and this is almost a bad movie. I would take a pass unless it's late at night and you catch it on the cable.
