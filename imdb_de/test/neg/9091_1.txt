I was pretty disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan out of the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just different. I'd rather have a movie on your face and press all those "shake-up" buttons. Tetsuo has done exactly where few films are for me. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like to get a breath of fresh air, those who appreciate these unusual styles will make the indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II is probably a disspoint. If you are looking for the visceral "HYPER-KINETIC" movie of the first movie, skip it as it has been removed. Tetsuo II is for some reason a typical action movie in Hollywood style. I was pretty confused. For any die-hard Tsukamoto fan, I think it's still worth it.
