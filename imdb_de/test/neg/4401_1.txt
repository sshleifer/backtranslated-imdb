<br /> <br /> Will not take long in this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring I've ever seen since I started watching movies. The story was not advanced, nothing was explained about the characters. It felt like a non-film. (Many people had already left the audience by then.) Many scenes were completely unjustified and inexplicable. The director should have studied a bit of film to know more, that every sequence, every scene must drive the story. He never did that. <br /> <br /> The supposedly funny moments were invented, and few people laughed (people with a funny sense of humor, I think). Prize of the jury in Cannes 2002 ..... I do not know what the jury is thinking about ... probably the "politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would have loved it, so the disappointment was even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
