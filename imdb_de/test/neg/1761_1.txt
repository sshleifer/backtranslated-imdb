The Jew Law makes Keanu Reeves the most wood actor fighting for his money, Renee Z's character is straight out of the Beverly Hillbillies, and the two leads have about as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. The "bad guys" are the worst clich√©, and there is no subtle moment in the movie. Unbelievable that some critics really liked this movie.
