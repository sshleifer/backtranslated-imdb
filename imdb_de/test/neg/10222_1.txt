Now I'm a big animation fan - I love Svankmeyer and usually stand in all applications of stop motion, so I had high hopes for this. Then I came to IMDb and took a break. I'm always suspicious of movies with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here's another one - a few 10's (Shill anyone) and then some really low ones. I am also suspicious of tens with the word "visionary". <br /> <br /> Certainly there are visionaries, but this character is not one of them. Despite my concerns, I have seen this movie and have to put myself on the side. The stop-motion animation was fine, but the plots were banal and overall amateurish. Treat yourself to the right thing, get some Svankmeyer and let it stand on the shelf.
