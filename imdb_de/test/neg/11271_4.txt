Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known for his Japanese gangster films, at least in his homeland, a series with which this film shares a number of features. Violence and political intrigues are a theme in both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both have one main character that challenges loyalty through betrayal. Both films also show a large number of characters who appear to have little to do but die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little effect when they come. This film also has other shortcomings. The make-up, the costumes and the sound design are distractingly bad and the fight scenes were also below average and inferior to other samurai films of earlier years (Seven Samurai). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays the Sonny Chiba character in Shogun's Samurai, the no-nonsense swordsman, who penetrates the film menacingly. What a guy; he may even wear an eyepatch. If you reckoned with the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you may be disappointed. His performance is little more than a cameo, and when it looks as if his character might do something interesting, he finally disappears. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film's strengths are its story, which is infinitely more understandable than the gangster films, and the challenges that traditional concepts of good and evil represent. Two brothers challenge the throne of their recently deceased father, who may have had help on the way out. At the beginning, it looks like we are confronted with a few characters who could not be good and bad; After all, the older brother stutters and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a rogue. At some point, however, it becomes clear that in a fight for the winner, everything is about power, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
