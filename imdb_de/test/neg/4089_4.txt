Well, I've seen this movie expecting to roll in the hallways ... how wrong I was. The movie was moderately amusing at best and irritating at worst (the slapstick comedy styling, building an ark with archaic tools, laughs ... no, I did not). I'm very disappointed with Steve Carrel leading the way. I looked at the Office US religiously, crushed myself immensely, I thought the 40-year-old maiden was good ... but Evan 'elp us - why on earth did he accept this script. And as for Morgan Freeman, he's old enough to know better. <br /> <br /> So the idea seemed reasonable, the actors to whom I had every faith. Well, it seemed like they ran out of money or ideas. This was for me one of the most beautiful endings that I could imagine. They took a biblical story and suppressed it into a cautious story about localized environmental problems, not even about global issues, but a local law - yawn! I was all washed off when the credit rolled.
