MTV has received a lot of bad talk from its half-naked stripper beauties, while THIS collects positive reviews in IMDb. Well, Newsflash to everyone - your butt is cool too if you show it in the middle of winter and show what they're probably going to do. There's no need to make a movie about your butt - and yes, those two would probably do that as well.
