This movie has no heart and no soul; It is an attempt to turn the losses of other, better directors, notably David Lynch and Tim Burton, into a cult movie. Rifkin seems to think that he makes a statement when he overflows with a kind of rotted visual style and fills the street with shit and garbage. But it's not a statement about anything except the director's shrill cry of "HEY LOOK AT ME! I'M ALSO ARTIST, EVEN." But he does not have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for things that worked - like some of the actors who are trapped here - for other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a clumsy, boring work to go through.
