I loved the blood and the blood. The kind of violence is alien and predator movies that nobody spares. This really answers the question of what it would be like aliens were on Earth. The answer is simple. We are screwed. The effects were beautiful. However, there are some real problems with it. <br /> <br /> 1) Acting was terrible on the part of the human characters, who almost fell asleep because it was so dry and boring that the really disturbed flow of the movie was very annoying. The authors could have made SOOOOOOO much better. The good thing was the alien and predator drama that I thought worked well for the most part. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller than in the first AvP movie. This is a scratch on <br /> 3) predators that had their mask on the ship. That annoys the people and I can not understand why. It's not a plotting hole like most people do. So I tell you, people are calming down. It's not a big deal. If you feel better, remember, they had facial Hugger's boring in storage, so this could be a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Predator fires his plasma pusher in the ship. I thought that was pretty stupid on the Predators page. But then I started to wonder if it was a younger Predator that panicked. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son arrived at the site almost instantly after falling a few miles away. At least they did not bore us by letting them run through the forest for 30 minutes. So be happy about it. <br /> <br /> 6) Why has only one Predator gone? I thought that was weird. But then I thought that it was because he thought it was just a predeal he had to deal with, not an outbreak. <br /> <br /> 7) Why did not the Predators in the ship destroy themselves? Well, if people were paying attention, they did, but he was killed before he could fully activate them. <br /> <br /> 8) The unlimited blue melting goo. I thought that would be pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) Predator hides evidence with the goo, but a policeman. That was stupid too. <br /> <br /> 10) The blackout. Well, people, an alien and a pred, did it in a power plant. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien is half a face / queen. That really impressed me. I am an alien and predef fanatic. I know for sure that aliens will not do that !! Just as they do not give birth like a human, as they have shown in Alien4 !! Of all the comics, games, books and movies 1, 2 and 3, CLEARLY shows her behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into Face-Hugger's infectious host, Face-Hugger, the parasite pops out and kills the host and grows into a drone if he's a human, a predalia with a human Predator and runner infected with any kind of four-legged animal. And then, after years of living, they break into a Preatorian (a mini-me-queen who does not lay eggs), I can go on and on, but I do not know. But this scene alone almost ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart, they would go back and work that through making a face that infects the pregnant women. In any case, if you are going to watch this movie, just go to Aliens and Predators. And when the scene comes up, where Predalin infects these pregnant women ... Close your eyes so you do not have to see the insult of the Alien and Pred universe.
