None of Monograms better (not trying to be amusing here), chan entries. The Shanghai Cobra has a lot to offer, but in the end it's just too confusing and confusing to be overly satisfying. The film begins with a killer named Shanghai Cobra, who has already struck twice and is now in a scene in a diner. We have a man, a girl, and another who has some connection when a man dies in the street. Yes, I'm simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, because that's really the heart of the problem with this movie - it's too much going on without a really satisfying explanation. I have not even gone to the diner-chef who has anything to do with and a jukebox that talks to you and has a screen, so not everyone seems to have a problem! It's all in the first five minutes. Then, Chan enters the movie, works for the government and flies out to help a friend. He also has the right to check a bank's radium store and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages and with whom he was arrested in Shanghai many years ago. I found the plot, as already mentioned, very involved. Toler is back as Chan. He is always friendly. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are also back. Both are doing good jobs and are quite amusing. But the intricate storyline just did not convince me, and much of the film was seen with a weird, questioning look. This is not a bad movie, not just a very interesting one, except for the most devoted Chan fans.
