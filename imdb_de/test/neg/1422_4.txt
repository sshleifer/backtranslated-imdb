This is a standard action movie, as we have often seen. Not much action in this case. Again it's about the man who protects the president. He is as usual macho and at the same time soft and melancholic. Does he have the courage to give the president a bullet ?! And then there's the girl and the usual conservative. Stereotypical and predictable until the last minute of toe crumbling.
