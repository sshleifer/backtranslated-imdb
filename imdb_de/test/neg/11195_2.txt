This show started okay, but then it became a nightmare. The worst part was the participants. Most of them were crazy. They did stupid things for a living and also did strange hobbies. In the second season, a guy said he was talking with his pants. That's sick and disgusting. Besides, nobody was interested in raising money. All they ever wanted to do was alliances like "survivors" or something. The men were always afraid that the women would band together. The women were the same. I just could not stand it anymore. I had to stop looking at it. It really was one of the worst shows ever.
