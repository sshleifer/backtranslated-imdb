Carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action, racist stereotypes, and related topics in his show, which makes him very much like Judge of the Supreme Court of Thomas. He is there for his race and then vilifies it. He's supposed to make fun of Mexicans because he's Mexican himself, and I'd say he could make fun of the mentally handicapped because every layman knows he's not the sharpest tool ... even though he's up definitely a tool. <br /> <br /> He's a hacking comedian who, even with a staff of writers in a 30-minute show, can not put together 3 minutes of really funny stuff. I can not think of a single comedian who's on TV regularly, to whom Carlos can hold a candle, except maybe Larry the Cable Guy (not surprisingly, he also has a show on Comedy Central that no doubt addresses the same audience.) < br /> <br /> If you ever see the greats, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc., who talk about comedy, you really get a feel for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny, weird one Lead voice. All of this work was completely skipped by Mencia, his comic voice was partially stolen by other better comics and partly banished from his inclination to scold his idle, rampant Tripton. Mencia's show is loved by some of the "at least I don" "do not suck so badly", which I believe is better in terms of dumbing society; Unfortunately, Carlos and his fans are part of the problem and not the solution in this area.
