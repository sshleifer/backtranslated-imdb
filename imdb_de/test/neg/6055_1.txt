Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV movie, must be the very best on two legs. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a 100% distortion of the Hercules story. Just like "Troy", this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it particularly offensive is that they actually invented a gay character just so people can hate it, making it as mean and evil as any character in the history of television or cinema. This is three times offensive, since Hercules may have had a wife, as this was the expectation of those old days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. It is therefore ironic that they should create a gay, royal adversary character for this film. No, not ironic. Angry. The creators of this travesty should be ashamed.
