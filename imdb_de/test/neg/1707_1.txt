There was a time when Michael Jackson was revered as King of Pop. Then he came at a time when he made negative publicity while lemonade put on wasps. It's finally time we really regret this man. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is another reason for that. I promised a rabid Michael Jackson fan to see it with her. You know the kind of fan - someone who instructs himself to like everything the object of affection has ever done. As I watched this movie, which she had already seen twice, I realized how far this fandom goes. Probably enough to rate this film over a tenth, as some people miraculously did. <br /> <br /> The film tries to be a spoof on many other films and series, notably Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails miserably on every level. Acting does not save the absolutely terrible story, the filming has the quality of a too-often-played videotape, the special effects were better executed in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not make this film now: with aluminum foil) .. that would all be funny, if the movie could manage to be good. Unfortunately it is not. It hurts to see this. <br /> <br /> And then Michael Jackson's appearance in this garbage. He appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message, and he manages to be as agile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4-year-old. Just when I thought, "Who is the terrible person who has led this poor man to take part in this movie and make himself totally ridiculous again?", I finally reached the end credits and found that the film was actually part of Jackson was turned Neverland Ranch. In other words, he. Likes. It. <br /> <br /> This movie and Jackson's involvement in it is really disturbing. Do not even look at the effect "haha, a movie in the IMDb Bottom 100". Or be warned.
