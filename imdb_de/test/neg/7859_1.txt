"Heaven Can Wait" is a bruise and a misunderstood, misogynistic lie. I can not imagine anyone except film students who are going through it today. Don Ameche can be seen in almost every scene, and although he has a resonant voice that has undoubtedly contributed to his successful career on the radio, he does not have the charisma to wear this movie. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henrys sexual incontinence delightful and amusing, and he tells Ameche to play the role as mildly as possible. The combination of Amech's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on fadlen leads to a main character who is both deadly and completely icky. You do not want to spend time with this man; he would let you fall asleep. You would not leave him alone with your daughter, regardless of her age. Something scary would happen. <br /> <br /> The look of the movie is pretty boring. Scene by scene consists of static, over-lit, diorama-style shots of carefully-clad Gilded Age-filled shirts and tufts lounging in overly-animated Victorian salons. There are so many ruffles and ruffles and flourishes, so much lilac and sky blue and pink that you need Dramamin. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it shows hatred with a candy coating and a touch of candy and a sweet little bow at the top. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is pathological. In one of the most hated scenes in the film, an elderly woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
