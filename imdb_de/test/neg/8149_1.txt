With the little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this movie was awful. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of focus and production value obviously lacked much. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good, hard laugh and then wasting two more hours of his life to endure a truly painful experience. I am surprised that I even found this movie on the $ 1 DVD rack where it was properly placed. I thought, maybe it would be good and I could discover an amazing independent film - I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie before. My three-year-old cousin could not make a worse movie. I'm glad I saw the movie because I can finally tell people that I've seen the worst movie ever made and that I'm sure.
