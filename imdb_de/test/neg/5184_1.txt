I can not really imagine a good point in this movie. The story is absolutely terrible. The drama is as dull as a carrot, and the script is so bad that you want to kill yourself. OK, if you love snowboarding (and you need to love it to understand it), you can enjoy it better microscopically, as it has big mountains and some cool moves. It has some absolutely stupid ideas and it's racist, with both blacks and whites offending the other races. They will only laugh if you laugh at stupidity or feel embarrassed about the movie. I've seen a lot of movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. If you have this film, I would suggest that you bring it back to where you bought it and get money back.
