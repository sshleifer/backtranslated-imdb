I could not believe how horrible and boring this remake was in Hollywood. It's so terrible. It easily lands a place in my ten worst movies of 1998. The only thing it had to offer was Bruce Willis, who was supposed to stick to action movies, as a completely unemotional killer who would kill his own mother at the right price. But me would rather hear Robbie Coltraine talking to Americans for a week than listening to Richard Gere's sickening Irish accent again. But this movie is also implausible, unconvincing, inconsistent, uninspiring, unimpressive, and puts Sidney Poiter in a garbage roll of potential career comeback. All for filmroll footie purposes.
