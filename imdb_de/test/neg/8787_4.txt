I am an animator myself and a better fan of the medium. When I saw this movie in a 5-dollar container, I thought it would be worthwhile to supplement my collection. Although I never regret that I found a new addition to my animation library, this movie was definitely disappointing. <br /> <br /> The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect stone to give to the girl in love as an engagement ring, but before he can give it to her, he is driven out by a rival and lost at sea. Then he befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home. The setup is not great, but it's enough to make an adventure that could be fun. Unfortunately, the heroic deeds of the duo are never really big and everything gets pretty repetitive. Most of the situations they are in are really unimaginative and lack creativity ... and the connection between the two is cheesy and forced. <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but does not match the usual behavior of Don Bluth standards. This is the guy who gave us the secrets of Nimh, Land Before Time and An American Tale, all of which had a love of detail that often went beyond Disney, the feature animation's grandfather. This is not much more than the high-end TV show. <br /> <br /> The music is alright, but rather forgotten, and the speakers are all wasted talents ... Martin Short is particularly wasted as a protagonist who, though he is spoken as a jerk, practically through the entire movie a pure man is. In short, the movie is likely to appeal to very young children, but a good family movie should appeal to all ages and ages Unfortunately, it does not have the makings.
