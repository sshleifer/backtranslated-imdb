As a child of the eighties, I grew up with numerous educational and distraction programs (or both) and still learn so much from them that I admire the wisdom of those who have worked on them. After learning that Sesame Street, to give the best example, was not solely responsible for the fact that I was able to read before going on an adult level, it only increased disgust, not just towards the company Lyons and its product but also felt those who defend them. As if I trusted those we entrust to protect us or our children from the start, the fact that Barney & Friends is still polluting our air waves after more than a decade later is a discrediting not just to the FCC, the American trade and its makers It is a discrediting of all humanity. In a world where I can be held guilty by the police, social services, and child protection agencies just because I was born differently from the rulers, and broadcasters are allowed to pump this swarm into my house, you have to ask, what about People wrong. <br /> <br /> In a world where we are expected to behave like adults and hold us accountable, what we say to our sons and daughters is important, as it often takes a long time Time will follow we are gone. Our attempts to make our children more normal, similar, thinking and potentially devastating do not just play a big role. So, the question arises as to what Barney teaches our children to be normal. Apart from such lessons, we are not good at not having good feelings, or that someone is changing the rules to make us happy when we come up short, other shocking things that we show in the Barney show include annoying ones Children of Barney. The issue of child abduction and child maltreatment is a big issue in our society, and since we tried to pretend that it was not, it would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways of presenting the subject. " So far I have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons that Barney presents himself. Added to this are the children shown in the show. I use the word "children" here loosely, as the specified age ranges up to three years and up to fourteen years. At both extremes, however, there is no difference in the emotional response. Fourteen-year-olds respond to Barney and his proposed situations just as much as five-year-olds. Experts in childhood and juvenile autism consider this an incredibly bad thing to be exposed to children. Adults on the autistic spectrum, faced with increasing problems, not only not having their needs met, but being ignored by themselves, tend to observe this and feel the urge to do things with Barney, the fourteen-year-olds to cry would bring. As disrespectful and sick as shows aimed at the market for older children, like You Can not Do That That Television, they were everywhere in Barney, demonstrating that not only different age groups react differently to it, but also different people , <br /> <br /> So I have to say in reply to mdmireles1295 that I hope they have no children. Every time I see a parent showing their kid this jerk, there's an overwhelming urge to report it to the police for child molestation. And I speak as a man whose entire education was dominated by abuse. They may sing about manners, loves, worries, or parts, but the examples they show are not only so awkward that they are the opposite of education, but they are so realistic that they do not become dangerous, like The Light Triton already stressed. The lessons that Barney's children learn are that people are indistinguishable, that emotions must be suppressed at all costs, and that the rules are completely arbitrary. Compared to the lessons that variation moves the world, and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television has taught me as a boy, it still baffles the mind that the authorities have yet to intervene and pull this garbage out of the park , If a parent did to their child what Barney is doing around the world, they would be prosecuted. <br /> <br /> So I gave Barney my favorite two out of ten points, which I value to give any trash with absolutely no salvation. She has no place in a world of adults who knows how to respond to their children.
