Seriously, folks ... I just wanted to write the Razzie Council and recommend this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I came to IMDb.com and realized that the copyright was 2006 and not 2007. This movie could easily have been a Razzie Champ. This movie is shit! It's a mystery to me how in the world this piece of crap was missed even in 2006 for a Razzie nomination, because it could easily have competed with Basically It Stinks, Too for the 2006 Razzie Championship. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie on the recommendation of a neighbor of mine who said, "Oh my gosh, after watching this movie, it will be a long, long time before I ever get back to it stop a rest stop! " I could not believe how scary and horrible this movie was! Possible spoilers down, not that you would miss anything. <br /> <br /> OK, especially ... the problem ... the rest itself. Obviously, the director of this bitch does not know the first thing about women. The toilets in this rest area were at the same level as the movie Trainspotting. I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing I know is that women are for the most part perfect hygiene / freaks. Given the choice between taking a crap between these toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the forest, a woman will choose to squat in the forest. I know, because I've been camping with them before and they have no problem squatting in the woods. Right there ... big plot and untruth. <br /> <br /> Secondly ... she's from the truck stop, and her friend who drove the car is nowhere to be found, neither he nor he his car. He just left. She begins to scream his name and wonders where he is. Um ... hello? You stand on wet mud ... did it ever occur to you to search for tire marks? I mean, his car is gone ... it did not just get up and fly away. And that makes me think ... I actually looked at her feet and there were no marks in the mud. How ... exactly ... did that happen? <br /> <br /> Thirdly ... the family that pulls the mobile home together with the crazy dwarf in the background and makes Polaroid pictures ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They made absolutely no sense, and it's as if the director had considered them weird just for the sake of craziness. They made no sense at all and had no place in the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh my god, that ... I mean, finally ... at the end of the movie. ..she finally sees the emergency hatch on the ceiling in the rest area. I'm like "you ... stupid ... bitch. You're locked up in this truck stop all this time ... and you ... now ... now ... you see ... the .. .. "Escape hatch on the ceiling? "I mean ... it's like throwing it in just because the killer threw gasoline on the floor through the window and prepared to light a match, so she needs to get to a higher level so as not to get burned a perfect reason for her to go to higher ground! A emergency hatch on the ceiling! It's like ... why has not she done that before? Most people in this situation would have from the moment they were imprisoned in this rest area and thrown the Dodge out of the Dodge, when they showed this escape hatch at the end of the movie, I thought, "You have to kidnap me." Fifth ... what was the deal with all the people she met is just going to disappear? The girl in the broom closet in the truck stop? The stupid cop? She at the end of the movie when she herself ended up in the broom cupboard? It was never explained. I thought to myself, "Oh, Ch ristus on a cracker, she is her. She is the murderer. Wonderful. She killed all these people, can not remember doing it, and the authors of this movie just tore off a certain French horror movie that I can not mention on IMDb.com, or I'm blacklisted, when I forgive the end (by the way, the movie is also the people). "But it was not like that, she was not the killer, and the whole deal with the missing dead was never explained." For the love of God, people, stay away from this movie! This movie has sucked balls and I have a serious one now Bones at my neighbor's home, it's the 2 in $ 1 rack on Family Video, do not even lend it to someone for free!
