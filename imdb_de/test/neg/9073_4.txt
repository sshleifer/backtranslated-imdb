THIS EVENING! 7.30 am! <br /> <br /> One day his mum dies and Jarrett goes insane. He kidnaps the audience in the theater and lets them all stand on a huge gas cylinder. <br /> <br /> When you lose control, he screams: "MADE IT MA, TOP OF THE CYLINDER!" in line. <br /> <br /> The sound is so deafening that it bursts Jarret's eardrums, causing him to fall out of the cylinder into a tub of acid. <br /> <br /> This Warner Bros. movie is not all it promised.
