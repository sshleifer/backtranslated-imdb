I went to the cinema a bit worried, cooking with rage over the garbage I had seen. The actors, especially Travolta, should be ashamed of their participation. Obviously the only thing they remembered was the paychecks, not to mention the devaluation of their talents and us. Travolta has to do some "look who's talking" movies again as he has sunk back to the level of his work before Tarantino. Something happens when the LW Talking sequels are better than this. Travolta is no longer the king of Cool, but the king of corn. Michael Caine himself admitted to making bad paycheck movies. Trvolta should follow the example if he respects himself.
