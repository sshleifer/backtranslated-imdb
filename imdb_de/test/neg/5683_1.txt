I had never heard of Null author "Auteur" Neil Johnson before I saw "Battlespace" on DVD on Hollywood Video. A few minutes after the movie, I realize that's not bad. As with many sci-fi movies shown directly in videos, this movie is dominated mainly by overburdened, bad special effects and a constant parade of sophisticated sci-fi concepts that do not create a religious-sounding text introduction, then a spoken story Introduction, followed by a narrative of the main character's daughter. For me, this seemed like a smoke mask to mask a movie with militantly ugly images and a zero-mark highlighting. Some people here seem all too ready to take this movie seriously and swallowed it seems to be New Age messages, hookline and sinker. These cheap reviews must come from the same people who are fooled when they think that "Battlefield Earth" was a brilliant movie or that Shasta is as good as Coke. Those Who Were The cheeky cover art art can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses with long blocks of non-talking people), rotten computer-animated effects (in extra-large doses) and irritating talking computers. What you do not get is excitement, emotional stimulation, a memorable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Battlespace" is an impenetrable bull and the constant appeal of the narrative proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real filmmaking, it's about characters and their dialogue, not about special effects and boring predictions. This is just below with similar direct videos like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If the boredom of "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you are looking for, you should definitely watch it out. If you like good storytelling and hate spurious lens effects, you're in better hands with a real movie.
