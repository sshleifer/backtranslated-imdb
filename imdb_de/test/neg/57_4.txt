In general I do not make any negative comments here. However, since this is a festival piece, I do not want you to waste your time if you could see something else that may not be played anymore. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they did not play each other out, but waited to RECITE their lines, which were pretty bad at first. The dialogue sounded really forced. Norman, or whatever his name tried, or it seemed he was witty and sharp in the lines he chose, just fell short. <br /> <br /> After words, he asked if anyone saw the end coming and some people were all "yes" and he called them all liars. You see, there was so much evidence, the biggest one was a briefcase full of cash for one hour $ 500 an hour. I mean, the boy gave her at least 20 g ... narrative. No, you could not see exactly what would happen, but when the spin actually occurred, I did not care at all. I was just happy to get out of this. I asked him which design he shot, and he said 8.1. Maybe next time he'll be shooting until 3:33 pm because it takes a lot of work turning his own films, he'll probably get better, and I hope he does, not sassy, ​​I mean, I wish him luck. Remember, this is just my opinion.
