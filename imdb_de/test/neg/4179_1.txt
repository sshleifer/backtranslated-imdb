If you want to enjoy the money you would spend on renting this money, buy an ice pack and watch it melt. This is more entertaining than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to watch this movie, go into a corn field, bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find, and run around for a few hours, with the girls as loud as they can scream. Then send me the few dollars you spent. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, after watching the sequel, I'll cry myself to sleep.
