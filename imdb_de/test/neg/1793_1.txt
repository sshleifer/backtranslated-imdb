A pity, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. The director could not put this together. There is a lot of action, a lot of promise, but everything comes from hokey. The director did not do his job. Promising measures come from lame. So much seems to be a desperate attempt to save the movie. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV writes in 1996) is simply not worth it. Another director would have done a better job.
