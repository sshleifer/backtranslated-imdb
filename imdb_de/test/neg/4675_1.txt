As a Scot, I find the idea of ​​"Macbeth" in Time and Space to America completely feeble-minded. I'm sure this is not true for a broad range of IMDb users, but why are not so many Americans able to connect to any film concept that is not? t put in their country? This attitude is not beneficial for Americans in the big wide world. <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that "The Wicker Man" was redone and hired in the US, completely out of the cultural context and with a Polticaly Correct Gender Transformation for a main character. <br /> <br /> One wonders what's next, Robert The Bruce as a New York cop, Mary Queen of Scots as "Soccer Mom" ​​- juggling, kids, careers and relationships <br /> <br / > Come to Hollywood, open to all other cultures on the planet!
