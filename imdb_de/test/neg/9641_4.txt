My mistake, when I thought that this was a serious war in hell before he saw it. It all ended in seconds when the logo "MTV" appeared. It could just as well be called "National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose". And it played in front of the crowd "MTV"; The film, which followed these comic first few seconds, was played like the music videos they played over 40 years ago. At least Disney was clever enough to send its rated stuff to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm tough. It was not a bad movie. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely one-sided. Granted, I'm not a war fanatic. I can not see "Platoon", "Full Metal Jacket" or "Saving Private Ryan" more than once. Sure, they were good movies, but they're not my strength, and they all seem to interfere after a while where I'm unable to distinguish one from the other. Following a tour of Iraq, Phillippe is planning post-war life, but is withdrawn under a contract clause. Or at least that's the plan of the military until it goes AWOL and the characters are amazingly never caught with a few bucks across the country. No, I was neither in a war nor in Iraq, nor do I agree with it. I also do not have all the knowledge when it comes to recruiting or contract signing. I can say that even though I'm sorry that they get involved in this conflict again, I can not feel it for someone who is stupid enough not to read the fine print. It's like someone leaning forward on their deathbed to finally read the surgeon general's warning on their pack of cigarettes and say, "Oh, they're what, deadly, I'll sue them!"
