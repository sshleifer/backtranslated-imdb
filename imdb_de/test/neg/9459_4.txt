I own this movie. And it's awfully hard to find. It's a unique little bauble about a doctor who is looking for the perfect companion. It has a really humorous, low budget and it's amazingly good for a budget of $ 500. The director is considered the master of gussets. I would not go that far, but maybe it was in his day. A total of 6/10 on the Gore chart.
