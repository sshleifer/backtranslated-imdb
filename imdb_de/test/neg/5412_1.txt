Thank goodness for the DVR and the fast forward speed. Nevertheless, I could no longer face this travesty. When they came upon the old Indian who was asking for beans, I gave up and put them out. Is this the best SciFi Channel can offer for Saturday night? How about old classics instead? The idea of ​​a Coed Special Forces unit was bad enough. It seems they want to save money by filming everything in the forest. What else can I say? It was so terrible that I do not think I can get enough lines to qualify for the placement to check it out. But it looks like another line is going to do it. Save time, not to mention your money for this dog of a movie.
