This direct film about cheap film is based on a true story. I do not doubt it. That does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who actually experienced this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a great big old country house that is really cheap. Well, as we all know from horror movies, when you buy a big house cheaply, it usually means it's being tracked in some form, shape or form. In fact, it only takes a moment for Angela to hand over the wise little guy who lived in the house to Angela. It takes a moment to introduce Angela to one of the ghosts. Nice guy, right? Angela calls in with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is being followed and invites her to come here and see the ghosts for herself. They come to a party and really, there are ghosts sitting on the couch, hanging out in the garage and trying to seduce the people in the bathroom. A few friends sleep over the night of the party, see the ghosts and swear never to come back to the house. (Look at the girl, Deadpan's "I'm so scared, I'm so scared.") Completely unemotional, if she was so scared, why did not she get up, turn the knob and go?) Actually does it all , which is threatening to show itself (and there is no blur or aura. They look like normal people). They steal celery from the kitchen, move chairs around a POLTERGEIST and a bisexual spirit woman seduces Angela, who, if you know it, does not mind! This scene is like a softcore porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Um ... not that I KNOW it! Hahaha). The actresses are not typical pornstars. You should work more on the beach and in the gym. When Angela does NOT love the dead, she becomes angry and stands alone in a room, shouting, "Why do not you go ?! This is my house! Get out!" I can not help but think of the time when I heard the psychic Sylvia Brown on TV saying that if you have a spirit in your house, you should rationally rationalize with the mind and say, " Look, you're dead. It's time to move to the other side. In other words, get out! "According to Sylvia Brown, they will leave unless they are hostile and evil. This movie looks like it costs about $ 50. It has a really cheap feeling and bad demeanor. I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder.
