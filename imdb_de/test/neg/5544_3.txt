Pumpkinhead was a decent 80's horror movie in and of itself. Not a classic under all circumstances, but a delightful piece of fluff. Why did we get a fourth movie in this series, I do not know. As in the previous sequels, there's nothing here that really connects the movies except the monster, the witch, and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we're tracking the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys. Part of the film is a Romeo-and-Juliet romance as a young McCoy boy and his Hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. Soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed. The boy flees into the forest and gets the witch to revive Pumpkinhead out of some revenge. The acting is passable at best, in the worst case amateurish. The titular demon does not even appear for nearly forty minutes and when he makes a pale comparison between the original and the original design. Overall, Blood Feud is not impressive. It may be worth a watch, but certainly not an addition to the collection.
