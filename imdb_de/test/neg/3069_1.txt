I'm big in acting, writing and directing but not famous yet. My friends and I often borrow bad movies just to have fun and a good laugh, but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called Biker Zombies from Detroit, we knew it would be the worst movie ever was! Biker Zombies from Detroit has no script! They can say that they have one, but they are liars! There was a four-minute scene with only two guys ripping about women and sexuality, and you could say it was improvised. And if they want to improvise, it should at least be decent, but it was not, and you could tell by the two actors, who mixed up the lines and said things that did not make sense. <br /> <br To give you an idea of ​​how awful and restrained this movie is, here's the beginning: A girl throws a guy away, he slaps her face, beats her and rapes her. Then we see zombies attacking, and both turn into zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the lead zombie voice that runs through the entire movie trying to be eerie and thought-provoking, but sounds like Marylin Manson has a fitting fit. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever. Conclusion, people. But watch it if you use films without a script, without plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and over 100 words in the movie. <br /> <br /> If this can beat video stores, my future movies will win Oscars.
