I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good at all. There was no sympathetic character in the picture, and the action was almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Ms. Masterson is a great actress, but she just did not pull the "tough girl" actor. (She had similar problems with her character on the second day of Christmas.) Maybe she should avoid those characters, especially those with a vile woman they can play with. Evan Rachel Wood was not impressive. Her character was simple and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> In the interest of full disclosure, I could not even see this picture. 45 minutes of my time are enough to lose.
