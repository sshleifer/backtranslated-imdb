I always thought "It Came from Hollywood" was the worst movie I've ever seen, showing clips from horror, sci-fi, crime and drama movies. Of course, I had not seen THIS beauty before. <br /> <br /> What's up with "Terror in the Aisles"? Four Things: <br /> <br /> 1) It's believed that most of the big moments in the shock movie story began in the 70s, when directors like John Carpenter and Brian De Palma appeared. And what bones are thrown to the true classics (ie the black and white films) such as "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Wolf Man" is shown side by side or not at all with either Martin and Lewis or with Abbott and Costello! <br /> 2) The clips are usually so short and out of their originals that they only temporarily shock the viewer and make no sense at all for those who are unfamiliar with these films (in fact The Moment in which the shark jumps out of the water at Roy Scheider in "Jaws" shows much of the effect of a visual gag, while he possessed power in the context of the original, he is strong.) <br /> 3) Do we really have Pleasance and Allen used in the audience, reminding us that "it's just a movie" or that most acts of violence in the horror movies are "unfortunately against women"? So is that a charge against the filmmakers for adding those scenes or watching the viewers go to the cinemas and keep watching the same kind of food? Sorry, that's a whole lot of worms that you can open for a deserved movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And most of all, why is the movie so short? It's not that there were not enough films of this kind. If they had just taped their resources and used EVERY available movie, they would have a movie "That's Entertainment!" Could have been who was comparatively more entertaining. Heck, even pull Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive then, mind you) and even better, even Vincent Price would have been more than willing, I bet I bet! What a jubilation that would have got from the audience! <br /> <br /> But no ... all we have left is a bleak little movie pretending to pay homage to these films, but all he does is leave the movie Viewers feel betrayed by less than 90 minutes of watching a REAL movie. Do not get me wrong; It was good to see what clips they showed, but if they could have done more with the merchandise! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea remained "in the hallways".
