I was 12 years old when I saw the original movie (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!"). It was a funny movie and not just for kids. This awful remake is pathetic even for 5 years! What did Disney have to ruin his reputation and the memory of a beautiful movie, I do not know and I just can not believe it. Even the theme song of the original movie (both the original and the Italian version) was extremely nice and created the mood for the story. The title song is even worse on this remake than the movie itself. It was nice to see Dean Jones, even though he only had a cameo and played regularly with the big old Disney movies. I honestly can not see anything positive in this Remade movie.
