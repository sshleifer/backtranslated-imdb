I'm a fan of low-budget B-movies and campy horror movie movies, but that was too much even for me. <br /> <br /> If you pass the feeble action, the cheesy effects and the uninspired acting then the terrible scripture will kill you, or you wish it. The dialogue was most likely written by high school stoners who thought that singing "Sir, yes Sir" sounds military over and over again. The characters were all typical stereotypes of cardboard: Gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho, another guy with a sensitive side, bad scientist with a secret agenda (bald or natural), bitchy clever chick that would be hot if she tried , stupid sexy chick with vital information, idiot "genius" nerd, random other military who are about to die, and pernicious scientist who was responsible "until something went wrong." Oh yes, I almost forgot, there is a secret Submarine of the military (naval?), Which sits 5 minutes from headquarters (it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) And corpses. Your mission is vague and poorly defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you see this, do not say that you have not been warned.
