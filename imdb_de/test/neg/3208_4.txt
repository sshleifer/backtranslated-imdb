Sending Critters into space seems to be a fun idea, but was a third film needed, not to mention this fourth movie? A movie with Brad Dourif can not be all bad, right? Well, maybe in this case. Those cheap sci-fi stars who bring back the lovely Klutz Charlie (the faithful Don Keith Opper) who wants to eradicate the last two eggs of the Critters species when Ugh (Terrence Mann) tells him he's breaking some kind of trans - Galactic law on endangered species. At Ugh's request, Charlie places the two eggs in special holders in a space capsule. Unfortunately for Charlie, the damned thing is making its way to space and he's trapped. The smoke underfoot puts him in a hibernation and 53 years later he awakens in a run-down space station as Captain Rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malice and greedy to the core blasted Space-Pod trying to see what possible new items for sale or trade are present. Rick, who is unknown to him, lets out the two animals who enjoy his meat. You see, Rick and his crew found the space capsule drifting, and their eyes flashed with intense dollar signs so they donned them. Ugh tells them (now in a good prominent position as a consultant) that money can be earned by docking at a space station under the Terracor organization. Once the crew has docked, they find that this station is in poor condition with many corridors, but even worse, the station computer is Angela. Angela is a real thorn in the side of the crew because she has not been repaired for some time without proper maintenance. There are a few small tricks needed to open and close the doors, not to mention the elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, pretty much the impresario of computer functions (and is actually the real leader of the group because he's the smartest and smartest). He seems to be a father figure to Ethan (Paul Witthorne), who just wants to make it to Earth to find his father. However, this story does not necessarily reach its zenith. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is primarily intended in the movie as a drugstore for the animals. In the film, after one of the animals enters Rick's mouth and eats his throat, Charlie becomes the leader of the crew to understand what they are fighting for. The film has some elements that I found rather confusing (or for a better word, ridiculous) .. The two animals are growing up fast, can somehow coordinate a ship for the earth, and in this lab in too big the Space Station Die Crew is able to get a log from Dr. McCormick {Anne Ramsay, whose badge is set aside in a cloak for which Ethan finds her access card worlds and humans. Al Berto, who wants to leave Angela and her blood station to find greener pastures, bothers to know this. Things do not work this way because the well-meaning Charlie (partly thanks to Al Bert's "ancient" Colt.45) kills a living creature that had come aboard, but when several bullets are fired, this encounters key guidance systems in the ship. So many repairs in the right order, but they stop them when Ugh and his stormtroopers dock with Angela and prove that they are not what Charlie thought. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes that he is totally evil and his mission is to preserve the crites for cruel purposes (representation of corrupt corporate governance?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie. He may have grown a bit bigger (a little bit) and now understands that some people just change for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will argue about these animals. Will the crew escape a space station that can be destroyed automatically? This movie does not use the creatures as much as the other three movies. I think we can clearly understand that as the true end of the franchise. The first movie was a scream ... a really entertaining trump, but as this sequel approached, the creatures were only too happy to be seen. The cast, however, gives the film a boost. The critters get something to eat, but their plans for global domination are underdeveloped. Her role in the film is not highly defined. I told myself you have this huge space station with unfortunates aboard .... Could you not take this idea with you? Unfortunately they do not do that.
