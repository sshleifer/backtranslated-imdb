This is definitely the worst vampire movie of all time. I looked at it right after the interview with the vampire and was deeply disappointed. Not only did the film's screenplay have craters as big as the Grand Canyon, the film seemed to leap from one scene to the other, thoroughly confusing the audience. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible - having a good body does not make you an actor! The Queen's End was too light and sudden, insulting the spectators' intelligence. I give this one star because Aaliyah did her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Otherwise, I would advise Anne Rice to take an ax and hack those who destroyed her ingenious story.
