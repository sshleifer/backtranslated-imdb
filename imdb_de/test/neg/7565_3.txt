Gosh, that was unbelievably boring. The lead actor (Christian Schoyen) must be the worst actor I've ever seen. And one more thing, if the character in the movie moved to America at the age of ten or more and lived here for over 20 years, he would speak English much better than what he's pulling here. or to say it "skikkelig gebrokkent" in my own language. But it's cool to see Norwegian guys in a movie from Hollywood. It was just a shame they were talentless hacks. The plot itself is below average. I suspect that Christian Schoyen made this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the movie, hurling one beautiful baby at a time.
