You can not really blame the filmmaker for glorifying Che, because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are absolute circles made by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murder from day one. Here is a list of the great things Che has done for Cuba: 1) He has committed thousands of innocent Cuban men, women, and children to satisfy his lust for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good reputation in the rest of the world. The Cuban peso was equal to the American dollar. Now it's basically worthless. <br /> <br /> 3) Everything that has dealt with diplomacy, business and the military has always failed. He did not make it to his first year at the medical school, and he was only in a real battle, surrendering himself with a fully loaded weapon. <br /> <br /> 4) He took over the largest property in Cuba for himself. He had a yacht, a 60-inch custom TV from America, a pool and a view of the ocean. So much for avoiding the materialistic lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Cuba is now an absolutely destitute country. and you have no thanks except for Che and the Castro brothers. If you drive to Cuba today, you must not leave the tourist areas. If you have managed to leave what you are supposed to see, then you would find slums, beggars and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> If you believe that something of what I am saying is not true then study it. Compare 1950/60 Cuban exports with those of today, talk to people who have survived or had parents in the so-called Cuban "revolution" of the 1960s, read all the reports of murdered innocents, read the reports of people who served under Che and Castro and escaped because of a terrible, disgusting human being. <br /> <br /> And please, please, always remember to read or view EVERYTHING objectively. Stop taking everything at par and think about it.
