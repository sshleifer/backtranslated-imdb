Years ago, the feature film "MA2412" tried to be a kind of "regional blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is for sure: I hope nobody out there ever has to see you. If you're familiar with the original sitcom, it could be interesting to see what director Sicheritz has made of his series. I think he missed his chance and wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> So far, many directors and authors have failed to create a series concept that is compatible with a 90-minute film (Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). How difficult that is, look at "MA 2412". The result of this experiment tastes like a never-ending TV episode (and not a good one) in my opinion. It does not provide an action, the humor is too harsh and the direction seems to be very blurred - which also applies to the visual style. <br /> <br /> So in summary, I would not recommend this model clearly ...
