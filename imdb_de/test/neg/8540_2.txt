Good old Jess Franco! The always reliable choice of the director in case you are looking for undemanding negligence, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess really excelled herself with this totally dirty jungle "adventure". Let's face it, this movie is basically just an excuse to put the gorgeous (and underage?) Actress Katja Bienert on Topless. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to go through a movie naked in front of a whole crew and in front of the perverted Franco! And it was not even the first time, as the duo had previously made "Linda" together. Just in case you wondered: YES, "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" has an action, albeit a very feeble-minded one. During the opening sequences, an airplane collapses with a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl between an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian, because they never try so hard at a point in the movie to eat human flesh. The disgusting Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl becomes the beautiful and barely dressed White Goddess. A few years later, an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to bring the girl back to civilization. Even more important is to steal some of the tribe's legendary diamonds. This could have been a captivating and action packed adventure movie, but obviously Jess Franco could not be disturbed. Why take up jungle chases or bloody cannibalist rites when you can point your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most jungle settings just seem to be filmed in someone's garden, and there's a huge amount of clumsy wildlife photography by National Geographic to fill in the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Diamonds of Kilimanjaro" as an ingenious, feminist and adult-oriented version of Tarzan. Yeah, right, they just put that sentence because Katja Bienert's character swings from tree to tree a couple of times.
