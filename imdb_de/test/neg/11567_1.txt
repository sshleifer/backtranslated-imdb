What a desperate movie. Dress actors in furry rags, put them in suburban wastelands, get cameras rolling and hope for the best. One can only imagine the gratitude the performers gave when their characters were killed by sock puppets, which further degraded them in this boring feast. This rival Monster is a go-go as the best cure for insomnia ever made. Oh God - how can I fill 10 lines explaining how boring everyone looks in this movie? Whiney crappy plastic robot annoying everyone on and off the screen, the giant spider is reduced to a single huge hairy leg pulled by a string.
