ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of the greats of John Candy. This movie about a fired police officer working for a small security system operated by the mob is very weak and not exactly a comedy. There were a few moments I enjoyed watching Candy in a pilot's suit, but it does not seem to be much. ARMED AND DANGEROUS is still a dangerously disappointing trick brought to us by the director of the equally stupid COMMANDO actioner. What a sorry excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 of 5
