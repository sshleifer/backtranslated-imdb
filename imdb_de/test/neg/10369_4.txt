A serious step backwards for the dolls in this usually boring and boring trip. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in three games, this time barely, and Richard Band's fantastic play with the puppets a few minutes before the movie. At the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some of his youth friends (many of the performers are Canadian and all are very good in unpretentious roles - Teresa Hill is pretty yummy). Totems, henchmen of the Egyptian god Sutek, want to return the mystery of animation life and the puppets (if they appear) act with a previously invisible wisdom to try to destroy the ugly and very computer-game-looking totems. The totems just make the series more complicated and distract from the things that have made the series so unique - they do not share the strange beauty of the dolls and therefore do not really fit into it. The top scene is Pinhead, who uses a cloth to cleanse blood using drill bits, classic and over the hottest movie. The fifth movie was shot simultaneously with this movie. So expect similar sections of the mediocre and a Toulon performance that was filmed in another epoch (or even in a galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserves better, and serial fans will definitely do it. Grrrrrrr.
