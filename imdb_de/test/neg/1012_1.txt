OK, I just turned channels and caught DW3. I saw it was junk ... BUT ... as a person who has seen tons of movies, this one stands out as one of the worst bad movies I have ever seen. It's so bad that you have to watch it, like a bad accident that you can not turn away from. Sometimes these types of movies, IE, Troma movies work ... but seeing Martin Balm and Charles Bronson in this slum is painfully a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can not believe it went over 1.5! Just as funny, this is not even the pinnacle of this series ... somehow this garbage has promised part 4 and 5? And to top it off, some comments from Dude have referred to the best of the series and his favorite movie of all time. Such statements make me afraid of this world!
