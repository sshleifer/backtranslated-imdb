Bled is a very appropriate title. When you see it, you will feel how your life is bled by you. The clich√© in horror is about people doing exactly what they should not do (go down to the basement or go up to the loft). Stay clear. Do not enter. And if you need more incentives. This movie? As bad as the worst Uwe Boll movie I mean, The House of the Dead is bad. I've often thought about a movie about I.M.D.B. and after looking at some of them from the comments, I found that everyone thinks he's disappointed. Please trust me
