Mindy (Rachel Miner), who is the best student in the class as she studies the differences between religion and cult in college, convinces her classmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely), and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) to investigate the massacre of Kwan Yin supporters by their leader Owen Quinlin twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern China that would give him tremendous strength after the sacrifice of human souls, but a woman struggles and he is destroyed. After the death of Morgan, who appears to have committed suicide, the students discover that Quinlin has returned and chased after her soul with his amulet. <br /> <br /> The plot of 'Cult' is not totally bad. The script, the direction, the staging, the lines, the camera, the CGI and the edition are terrible, I was totally bored and tried to use the FF button of the DVD, but I resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life Never ending crap on a Saturday night, my voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Amuleto Secreto" ("The Secret Charm")
