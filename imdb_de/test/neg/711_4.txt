OK, it's not great, but only because Laurel and Hardy have been so great in the past. If this movie got a complete overhaul with improved picture quality, adding new syncs to the poorly dubbed voices and adding nice unobtrusive background music, then this movie would really take shape. As it is, it has its problems. People are planning how old the boys look. Quel surprise! They were 60 years old and had a "life". For me they were still a bit full of charm, and while this does not nearly tickle the feet of their classics (I gave them a 4), it's worth watching because they are. To think differently would be impetuous !!
