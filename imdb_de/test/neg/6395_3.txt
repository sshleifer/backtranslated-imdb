This film should be referred to as "the fault of the script". Directed by Stanley Donen of Singin 'in the Rain, this mid-life mid-crisis is not all that bad. There are some sumptuous scenes of Rio de Janeiro and various lightly dressed extras swarming and frolicking on the beach to the sultry sounds of samba, but there's only something to be had when watching Michael Caine with his fifty-year-old wife Michelle Johnson you look ... good, sloppy. This story is also a complete route. No one but perverted and vain old studio staff in Hollywood could have made this embarrassment greenish. Maybe they're so used to having young bimbos as Arm Candy that they forget they're their fat wallets that hold the key to their charm, not their huge Larry-King-style goggles and yellow, cigar-stained eyeglasses Teeth. It's one thing for a young sex pot to fall in love with an older man, but into the father of her best friend, who happens to be married? And then shamelessly throw himself at him? Pooh! That's nothing entertaining. It is rather pathetic and grotesque. Notice the young talent of young Demi Moore.
