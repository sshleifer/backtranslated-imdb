The one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and made a puzzle. I do not know for which age group this was written, but the author himself did not even want credit. As for the song, it is mildly amusing. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen some more than these, they are still enjoyable. Whenever this happens, I try to encourage my child to see something different. A positive comment that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1 is that it promotes good moral values. That would have been encouraging if someone had seen.
