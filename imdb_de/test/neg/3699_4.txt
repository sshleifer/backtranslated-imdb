This is a fair film that is suitable for one-time reputation. The plot itself is pretty well made for a picture of this kind, which is a pleasant surprise, as well as the acting, which is a bit hammy but better than normal for these types of strips. <br /> <br /> The 'special effects' are hilarious - a translucent giant and an exposed hand made of polystyrene / papier mâché that wobbles unconvincingly on a piece of wire. <br /> <br /> Definitely on Pay attention to kitsch entertainment value. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
