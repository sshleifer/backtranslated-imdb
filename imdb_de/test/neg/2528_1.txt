Man, are you serious? Did you read the book or saw this movie? Well, if you do, let me warn you, it's a hoax. Mark Furhman has been looking for a job since losing his job at the LAPD. You remember him, right? He was the guy who lied on the stand and gave the defense of OJ Simpson a foothold they were looking for. Well, he has since written three books. I have read all three. No, I'm not a fan, they were given to me. However, I will share a similarity on all three points that severely distorts the meaning of Mark Furhman. In all three cases, he shamelessly exaggerates his size. In Murder in Spokane, he claims he has something to do with the killer if he has nothing to do with it. In all books he has great pleasure in stopping local law enforcement actions. A bit like his efforts were condemned in the Official Journal. In this film, there are many slow-motion shots of ladies watching and coveting Furhman. Many other attitudes have brought him into the limelight, though I was sure that the only people who thought people at the time were, "Hey, is not that the racist who made OJ quit?" This was an interesting real-life story, but not a good movie about it.
