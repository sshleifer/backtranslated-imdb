Let me start by saying that you know that a movie goes bad when extras print on the cover. Whoever says that this is the worst movie of all time is dramatic, and whoever says that the movie is great is completely insane. The movie "is what he is". And what is that ... A modest studio sequel ($ 4 million, I guess). The movie is not terrible, but it will be disappointing for road house fans. And that brings me to a problem, just as Dirty Dancing without Swayze would not be what it was, without a road house. The lead lacks depth, character and sympathy for the movie. I feel that the lead was badly populated and the producers had to bend over to make Patrick do it if they were to do a sequel. The other cast was inconsistent with outstanding actors like Will Patton and side players who could not operate out of a paper bag. Busey, whom I've seen to have great characters, seemed like he'd just send him in. Ellen was well played, except that as Bayou chicks they were not credible at all. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar, was hot and a good actress, but her role was awkwardly small and undeveloped. The author missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and the characters. Instead, opt for a one-dimensional movie. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the script ... I got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three scriptwriters separated by a "and" and a "&". It looked very amateurish. And that was the writing. I heard that the original script was better, and then a rewrite was done and the hardcore sucking started. Some naughty parts of the movie to watch out for are ... During the first covert meeting, the obvious drug deal was under the table. "Hey, let's meet in a crowded Nudey bar, I'll pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you'll pull out cash, then we'll put it under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look cool when you look to the left and right to make sure no one is looking for them!" Second, I love being shot in the chest and then, ten minutes later, you see him sitting happily like a lark. Towards the end of the film, there are some nasty cuts, especially during the fight scenes and when the main character chases through doors and meets a patron. That brings me to the realism of the DEA training. I'm not going to learn both technically ... But jumping through the doors is not standard training ... Also, no typical female agents fucking their butt to reach a male-oriented field behave like weak characters ... boring ! Thanks for the chauvinistic view. There are other things I could teach at a school about it ... The accelerated struggle, the dialogue, the recycled stories ... etc ... But apart from everything you can not like, ex-Lord. Applegate, he really lacks the modest Zen coolness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze so bad. He just does not seem to me to be one of those five feet of actors who think they're a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit he gets into a bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Do not Fall) and he teaches him a lesson "badassdom." Therefore, I believe that this is the main linchpin of the film. If you are an ass, you are an ass, you do not have to try it. Example: Swayze! If you're a handsome boy trying to prove that you're a bad ass, among other things ... All right ... you're why your audience, Average Joe ... will not rent this movie, and if so you will write reviews like these.
