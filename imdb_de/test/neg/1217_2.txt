ZZZZZZZZZZZZ. This came straight from the "Jaws" cookie form, and some other bizarre clich√©s were added for good reason. I was interested in seeing that after finding a picture of it in a book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I think I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very slow and talkative, lots of it This killer shark movie takes place ashore, which is not really surprising. It seems that the only way to show a shark is to take a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as the actors, and that's too bad ... Most of the characters are so annoying they really wish they'd be eaten. <br /> <br /> The "conspiracy" concerns a group of four children who one day meet up with a mysterious Indian on the beach while they fry small varieties of wine. For some reason, the Indian gives them an ancient artifact that allows them to track down an ancient evil that took the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... allegedly because they were able to fish the ocean and the sea god too well worried that they would take all the fish with them. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's also a good thing because you would not know ... Years later, a monster shark pops up and starts devouring people in the sleepy seaside community. If one of the four men is eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the thing ... especially since (big shocker here) the authorities have killed a shark and the threat is over. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The compulsory death scenes are unbelievably boring and you can see them coming a mile (my favorite was the girl who fights with her boyfriend while they sit in a van) pops out and says, " I'm going swimming "(immediately devoured by the waiting shark). They had a lot of nerves to call this movie "Deep Blood", because you hardly see anything, only murky water. The actors treat their stereotyped roles as if they are all thumbs, and there is even a witty subplot involving a sleazy rocker-type villain. <br /> It took a very long time for me to find this movie have. It's pretty dark, so I do not think there's a danger that too many people will waste their time. However, if you should be involved ... do not say that you have not been warned!
