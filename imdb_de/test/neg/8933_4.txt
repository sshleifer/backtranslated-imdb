"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or should simply be called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, mainly because he still has something to do with J.V. Cheerleaders has. As someone once said, "That's fine - more than okay - but as you get older, you have to branch out, whether you like it or not, society demands it". <br /> has the biggest JV cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone before her "unsuspecting" days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the dreadful "Teen Wolf Too" three years later, in which she plays a fickle southern beauty, much like Martha Smith's character in Animal House. Personally, I admire Miller's choice, as the two characters could not be more different and they both are convincing. <br /> <br /> Mary Ann is a naive cheerleader from Moline (member of "The Lucky Ducks" crew)) who comes to cheerleading lessons at Camp Beaverview. She is friends with Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the hard girl group appropriately named "The Demons." Jenna protects Mary Ann after her main opponent Mary Ann immediately refuses. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary Ann is crushed into Tommy Hamilton, the chief instructor. Tommy spends his summer wrestling with the dilemma of growing up and moving on, which is a problem, as he can only teach cheerleaders and perform intricate dance routines in the shower to thrill audiences experiencing such a thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's longtime girlfriend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirtation with Mary Ann and trusts that Tommy does not really take advantage of young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Although these four characters are solid and their relationships are charming, the understaffing is almost as weak as the material they need to work with. What a pity, because if they had brought a real comic relief to the production, that would have been a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climber and unobtrusive, easy-care instructor who continues with the money-hungry owner of the Bucky camp. And there's another couple with a thing for the characters of "Mad Max." Since nothing is very funny, all that's left is a cute semi-romance and a few great dance routines. <br /> <br /> An attempt is made to build some excitement by slowly starting a final competition, unless this is your first movie experience the result is never in doubt. And there's a backstory about some Japanese businessmen Bucky wants to get money from, but nowhere is it dramatic or weird. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
