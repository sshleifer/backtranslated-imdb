Although the concept of "exploitation cinema" is inevitably linked to the decade of the 1970s, it is almost as old as the cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios have come up with the term in their long-running monster cycles Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy invented. Each original classic made at least a few sequels, and after a while, they even considered whether they should stew real monster! "House of Frankenstein," released a year earlier and directed by Erle C. Kenton, was a pretty successful performance with interesting ideas and enthusiastic performances, but "House of Dracula" is a bit too indecisive to recommend. The plot suffers too much from extremely irritating "random" situations, forced twists and dialogues, and ??? most ?? too short a time to shape the monsters' personality as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive top billing, but plays the most fundamental role as a miracle. A physician challenged to cure Count Dracula (Carradine) of his uncontrollable thirst for blood and to fix Lawrence-Talbot's disease when the moon is full. During a nocturnal walk in some caves, they also pick up the remains of Frankenstein's monster, and the good doctor himself eventually undergoes a Jekyll / Hyde metamorphosis due to a poor blood transfusion. The last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback (though not by Notre Dame). Something is very wrong when you watch a movie that is literally filled with horror symbols. The only character in the entire movie that can freak you out is an ordinary villager named Siegfried. The actual monsters are boring and their once fabulous backgrounds are completely exhausted. Count Dracula is a lamenting romantic, Talbot is a pitiful and whining old martyr and the Frankenstein creation. Well, his part in the conspiracy is not even worth mentioning. This universal film lacks atmospheric attitudes and sophisticated photography, especially compared to all of their other endeavors, and the abrupt climax is a catastrophe.
