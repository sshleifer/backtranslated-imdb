Would it be too trivial for me to write a review in which I keep saying the word "stupid"? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Serious. There are better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party while he was still in the cinemas. Although it was actually * with friends * and at one of their * birthday parties *, I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I just apologized and went out. Fortunately, some parents did the same thing, so I did not look like an idiot ... Anyway, this movie is awful. There is nothing to like. It is painful (as actually causing physical pain), slow and pathological (literally causes vomiting), insatiable. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but not because you remember he was actually in the movie. It really hurts me to think about it. <br /> <br /> It was on TV a few months ago and I decided that I only had to look at it once. I remembered why I went out at all, and felt guilty for only raising the rating from a spectator. The gags are not funny, the characters are not interesting. It's just a meaningless mess of Pratfalls and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There are a small number of then-eight-year-old kids who watched the movie when it came out and thought it was brilliant. If you think your face is being removed bit by bit with an ice cream scoop that's brilliant, then definitely rent it. But if you have any dignity, avoid this big STUPID mess. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1.
