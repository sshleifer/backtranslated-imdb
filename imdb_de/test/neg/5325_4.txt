Unfortunately, Koontz seems to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very closely, apparently until the production company runs out of money. All sets in the first half of the film were meticulously reproduced from the book - which was missing in many other Koontz films. Despite the other (numerous) crashes, I continued to watch in anticipation of a truly magnificent landscape. Not correct. When the detectives show up at Crack Head's apartment (in the book), the movie has run out of money and one of the most thrilling scenes in the book is ruined. Where the book offered a grisly discovery, a search and a chase through the boys 'apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the boys' car for free. If a Koontz novel is ever turned into a decent movie, no one will see it because it has been so many, many, many times before disappointed. For this reason, Dean Koontz 'Frankenstein is now only Frankenstien. If you had seen your work so often slaughtered, you would come out early if it looks like it's going to happen again!
