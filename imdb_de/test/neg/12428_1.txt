OMG, another bad movie by Larry Buchanan. This guy did not learn to stop, did he? First, he gives us zero-budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead, and now he exploits the Loch Ness monster as malignant. <br /> <br /> The "conspiracy" is essentially about some Southerners of the USA, who pretend to be Scottish and camp outside on Loch Ness. Oh, by the fishing hole, oops, I mean, Lake of Loch Ness, there's an inflatable monster that calls itself Nessie, who's trying for no apparent reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised the MST3K crew has never heard of this movie before. Yes, that's too bad.
