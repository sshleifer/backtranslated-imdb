Horror movies could have done "rest stop" on many levels better. Director / writer John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions when he started. Unfortunately, he was not sure what to do with the material, or perhaps he was under pressure to deliver another film than he had intended, either from the studio or the lenders. The DVD has several endings, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psycho roaming the back streets of a remote part of California brings many opportunities first. After the disappearance of Jess in the canny rest stop things get out of control. Poor Nicole is left alone to save herself for all the nuts she finds on the way. <br /> <br /> When they heard "Amazing Grace" in the background, it was clear that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which Nicole and Jess profaned their necks of wood by engaging in careless sex, which is not appreciated by the locals. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. For gourmets there is a lot of gore.
