From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune) I think I saw a bit of it in my media studies class, and I recognized the lead actress, so I tried, despite the critics' rating. The basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelsons Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt) of Bully assassinate a random girl to challenge herself and see if they can get away with it without the police finding her. Murder investigator Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock), with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), is quite confused by the evidence found at the scene of the crime. unrelated hair. The plan does not seem to be going very well, as Cassie and Sam quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects. It's just a question of whether they can swing them away. With Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R. D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. THERE. Al Swanson. I can now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope murdering a challenging thing, but this movie does that in a very stupid way, and even a reasonably good Bullock can not make it stupid and predictable. Appropriate!
