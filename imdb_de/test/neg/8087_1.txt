Rare and auspicious are the moments in filmmaking where size is a crucial monument to the rest of the industry, where we can compete and immerse ourselves in that glorious moment. <br/> <br /> Some stories transcend their time and strive for the high reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends. Cast the subtle skills of an ensemble of theaters that are at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where has the originality gone?" It's here how this story and its story are cast through a plot and a story that not only teaches but also entertains the most seasoned Shakespearean / action / love storygoers. I can not imagine where the writers dreamed this extraordinary story. Where do genius get this kind of inspiration from? I now have hope for humanity, knowing that this kind of talent still exists, gives me the hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the gates of heaven. <br /> <br /> I have it like others in front of me, dreamed of the size. Although I have not written this film, I have seen it, and because of the noble size of this film, I feel as if I have been elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that this kind of fame escapes most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach that level of splendor? We would probably be consumed in a white fire of supernova glamor as we transform into transdimensional spiritual beings capable of almighty creative power. The essence of your being is that "Tomcats" is nothing to what I've been talking about. "Hangover" is the opposite of everything that I mentioned. It could destroy our world. Since some reviewers rate a movie on a star system, ie 1 to 5 stars or even zero stars, I rate "Tomcats" as a black hole. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to donate money to a cause that will stop this kind of atrocity that seems to be going on at the box office lately. I am also not detrimental to the use of nuclear weapons. It has to stop. How much more can we need before aliens come down from space here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, blatant, vulgar, uninspired and degrading Hollywood movies? I will not even make this movie dignified by mentioning the name of someone else who starred or produced it. I will not even waste my time describing the story as we have seen it many times and all previous versions have been at least a million times better. <br /> <br /> By the way, my head almost imploded during this movie, but with the highest selfless effort and good luck I survived to warn the public. You were warned.
