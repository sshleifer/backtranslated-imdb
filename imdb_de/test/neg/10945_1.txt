Well, I like the Bollywood movies and I am very happy that they have recently been successful in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's last attempt is a very flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood version of Amadeus was pretty exciting, that is, until the two alleged "musicians" appear on the scene as if they had never touched a manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very handsome man, and the film plays with his narcissistic feelings, but as a modern Mozart he is never credible. In terms of acting he can only stand and sulk. His facial expressions, hair and clothes look the same all over, including the scene where he is supposedly "dying", and in fact he seems to have only a slight runny nose. Bobby Deol, who plays the role of Salieri, does his best to enliven the small woodcut, but unfortunately he seems a bit angry if he is to be angry with jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely known for their stunning sets and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like a gritty BBC drama reproduction. In fact, what comes closest to Shakalaka is Hollyoaks, as it obviously hides a really bad script behind beautiful people who look good. "He has not reached mediocrity yet" - the same could be said for the completely forgetful songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darsan's latest offer has no boom, bang, wallop or twang. Instead, it just trudges with its head held tight and hopes to grab your attention with a gentle tapping on the shoulder. And that's not good enough at all.
