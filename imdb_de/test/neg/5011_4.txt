Necessary Roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried to make a serious movie about college football at every level. In this production, many of the current and former superstar athletes were seen during one of the comedy highlights of the film. Apart from that, it's a very mediocre movie. They should have just stuck to doing a straightforward comedy filled with no realism. Instead, the filmmakers try to play both fields and land at the short end of the stick. When will someone make a decent movie about college football that's funny and realistic? Not recommended, unless it's free on t.v.
