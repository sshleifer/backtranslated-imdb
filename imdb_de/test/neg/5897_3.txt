I tried. Lord, help me as I have tried. But there are only a few that can hardly create quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. "The 9/11 Commission Report" seems to be the company's honest attempt to enter a more sophisticated state of storytelling and filmmaking. But in every way, it's another true movie in her gallery. At the opening, the disclaimer tells the audience that all names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively similar. A man named Mussaui is trying to learn to fly a plane. With a cold-blooded grimace that would make anyone feel uncomfortable right away, this "covert" agent can learn to fly on a small computer. And you have to wonder, not how he got into this program so easily, but how those people did not even ask questions. Because this scene is so far-fetched in their presentation and the actor who plays this man is extremely exaggerated. And you can see that director Scott is trying to imitate Paul Greengrass with a light, grainy photograph, followed by a very dizzying and irritating handwriting that tries to differentiate itself from Greengrass's gung-ho guerrilla filming techniques throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> You can sense Scott's imitating Greengrass's technique for realism, but it gets lame in halfway. In the meantime, the movie is coming off less from a "traffic" start than from "Law & Order", in which the disclaimer informs us that the names have been changed, the logo is almost reminiscent of the "Law & Order" logo, and then ninety minutes in which the actors pump their breasts and discuss politics. <br /> <br /> None of them is as convincing as it is tried. And when the movie looks like he's trying to be an adult drama, Scott relies on his old fail-safe sex scene. Scott's new film looks like he's really going to be considered a "low budget" Munich, but it's not like that and he manages to stifle on every possible occasion. "The 9/11 Commission Report" is flat, and that's because his attempts to imitate other films are limited. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate the ambition behind the camera, this new perspective on the events that precede 9/11 is shallow and boring. As hard as it may be to be a "low-budget" "Munich", it's just as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren movie you would find on Cinemax.
