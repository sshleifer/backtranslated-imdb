A ridiculous movie, a terrible cut, a bad script, a ridiculous drama, a story that's totally incomprehensible ... <br /> <br /> If God decides whether to continue making movies, judge that entire world of the film industry is dead ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie that shows that cinema should not be made by people who "think" they can make films. <br /> <br /> I'm still wondering who these two gypsy girls are, who appear in the movie for more than half an hour and are never introduced to us ... <br /> <br />
