After reading the books and seeing the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br /> Seymour version, I have to say that this is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is actually an apparent aristocratic aristocrat when he's Percy, and witty and smart <br /> <br /> if he's the pimpernel br /> Percy and mean as the pimpernel. Marguerite is said to be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due to poor make-up.)). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, and Elizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat. The joke and <br /> <br /> dash of the books and the Andrews / Seymour movie is replaced here by <br /> <br /> through muscular and eye-catching editing that does not create the cut. <br /> <br /> I could add that to a person who has not seen a previous version <br /> <br /> or read the book, it would probably look okay.
