Considering that Carson McCullers is one of the most important literary figures of the 20th century, it seems that there is a lack of talent to ruin one of their stories, but this film shows that it is possible! How can actors judge their way to being a director? Woody, unatmosph√§risch, unsympathisch, completely in accordance with the poetic pity of McCullers' letter, my jaw fell in horror and unbelief that such a mishmash of a film would have ever found money and supporters. The only salvation traits are moderately good acting (though Vanessa Redgrave seems to always give the same performance no matter which character she plays) and some good cinematographs in places, but otherwise it would have been a bitter, bitter disappointment and should be a contemporary masterpiece his. Simon Callow should shame his head and confine himself to acting!
