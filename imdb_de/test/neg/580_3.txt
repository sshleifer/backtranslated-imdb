Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: it grows and grows. However, I did not discover a subtext. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of this era were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inappropriate computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And whoever uses this computer is Lou Costello! I like some of his films with Bud Abbott. Although this is a pretty bad movie, he is fine without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil. <br /> <br /> Green plays the pompous city of the city. He is the father of Provine. He is determined to be elected mayor. When his beloved daughter has problems, he drops her. He does not just throw her off, but gives up his fight against her longtime admirer Costello. <br /> <br /> That's pretty implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector minimal. And the subplot, in which the military is involved, is extremely lame.
