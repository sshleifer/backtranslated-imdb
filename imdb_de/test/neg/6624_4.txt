People do not seem to agree with me that movies can be both bad and good at the same time. The same kind of people watching a Carrot Top movie on the cover, surfing through a crazy office and continuing to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is the carrot top funny? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a stupid movie and everyone figured it was based on what he knows about Mr. Top. Films like this or Kazaam or Killer Klown's From Outer Space and just about every movie Pauly Shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously, so they should not be considered the worst movies ever made , You either see them with a stupid movie that is weirdly bad, or you're six years old and really think Carrot Top is weird, serious movie and the trouble of writing a serious review ... do not look at that. The selection for this film is like choosing a 5 year old girl because he does not know the alphabet.
