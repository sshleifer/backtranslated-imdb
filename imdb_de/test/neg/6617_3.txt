Despite the famous cast, this animated version of Dickens story is the most meager thing I've ever seen. Enough that I wriggled in his first commercial break. The characters did not touch me at all and the animation looks cheap. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a very low rating. Give me the Disney version anytime.
