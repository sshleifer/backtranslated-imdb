The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology - similar to Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated lovers of the series who think that every episode was a winner, regardless of whether or not each episode was a winner. It is they who can rate each show with a 10 and can not rate the show objectively. That's why I checked all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) some time ago because the ratings and ratings were too positive overall. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now, I was very surprised to see reviews for this mild episode describing her as "among the best," rated with ratings of 10. If that's the case, why hates Then everyone I know who saw this episode, as much as I did? It's possible that I and my family and my friends all go to their knees, but it's also possible that this is another case in which rabid fans inflate the rating in an average or below-average episode and other than different archetypes - a soldier, a dancer, etc. They all sit in a cylindrical room without escape and only at the end do you recognize the "shocking truth" - which is not shocking at all and is in fact mainly lame. No, this is a poorly written and uncomplicated episode. Yes, there were many episodes of the series that had earned a 10, but few that were as undeserved as this one due to a flat font and unsightly resolution.
