This four-hour mini-series production is about two hours longer than necessary, especially because the filmmakers seemingly had no clear idea of ​​how to adapt a novel to the screen. They did not seem to know what to keep in it and what could safely be left out. The film begins with Sir Walter, who reads from the Peerage book, which is the most important consolation in his difficulties. This introduces the family - everyone we'll get to know each other in the next four hours anyway - but serves little purpose. Similarly, the scenes in which the Musgroves complain to poor Richard are for no other purpose than to drag the story down. Part of Austen's actual dialogue is associated with different characters, and some of her stories are recycled as a dialogue that falls awkwardly out of the tongues of the characters. There are also some dialogues to fill in, and this is equally awful. The scene in which Charles Hayter Henrietta with his concerns, Dr. Getting Shirley's Curia, bored, was hardly interesting as a narrative in the book; The scene at the Cobb when Louisa falls and is "taken in lifeless" is completely without urgency, and I wondered if Wentworth's line "Is there anyone who can help me?" was possibly addressed to the authors and the other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often looks and feels like a piece that was filmed, rather than acting like a real movie, that's the opposite of subtle: boisterous lines, exaggerated gestures and actors that are not Have a clue what to do with their hands, feet or faces if they do not speak their lines. Charles Musgrove stands shoulder to shoulder in his salon, seeming to reach out to the balcony (if any) as he talks to the other people in the room. Louisa Musgrove's face seems to be in confused silence when she is not actively twittering or giggling. Louisa is a dizzying, daring, stupid creature, and I did not for a moment believe that Wentworth was interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are mixed, but mostly awful. Anne Elliot's green tartan dress is probably the most disgusting supposed costume ever designed. The dates are given at the beginning of the show - it's the end of the 1790s or maybe very early in the 19th century - and yet many of the costumes appear to be Victorian, about 60 years too early! The hair is just so wrong that I do not even mention it here. Except that I do not mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> However, this production is doing a lot of good. Mrs. Smith is given her proper importance, and her story with Mr. Elliot, his dissipation, and his intrigues are fully addressed. I was also pleased that in the end the detailed "reconciliation" scenes with Anne and Frederick were to be seen, which are a valuable reward for the reader, but were revised in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you love the book Do not convince yourself, like the 1995 movie, and do not waste a moment (or a cent) on this production. You will find it very painful.
