I can not even describe it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm a nice guy when I call him a movie). Just another big budget-made-to-someone-who-don't-think-much. It's not even scary. It is outrageous when there are great films that never reach the big screen and then this "thing" for cartoon fans comes. I think big producers do what they want. <br /> <br /> Just get a big producer, hot girls (though awful actresses) and a lot of horror movie clich√©s and cook them for a week or so, and you'll get it "The Nun ". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 would be awful !!!!
