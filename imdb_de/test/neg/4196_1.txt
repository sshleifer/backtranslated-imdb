A man with the unlikely name Shy Walker is looking for one and a half hours in a corn field for his two daughters. That's the whole plot ... of course with perverted bad behavior. Walker wanders through a corn maze (maize? I understand! HAHAHA ... not funny) and shouts, "Girl, where are you?!?" about 1000 times. For some reason, whenever he runs past a pumpkin, a voice laughs, ringing for a chipmunk (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yes, ok ...). His daughters are screaming for most of the movie ... even if there's no reason to scream (maybe because they're still in that horrible movie?). From time to time, twin girls emerge directly from 'The Shining'. Most of the corn maze looks the same, so Walker's search gets very old very quickly. The filmmakers recognize that there is NOTHING for this film (even the music is repetitive). So you're trying to make things interesting by shooting the camera very fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller images of the same shot from different angles, using red lights to make the corn look weird, and the camera 360 degrees to turn (at least I'm assuming that was deliberately done, but they're probably just examples of incompetent filming). Most of the time when Walker wanders through the maze, you can not see his face. I think the kid holding the camera can not look up so high ... This movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie except the fact that she also has a cornfield). Do not be fooled by the R rating. Walker says the F-word three times, and now we have "an R-rated horror movie," ugh. The scarecrow on the cover can not even be seen in this movie ... and if you want the cheesy scarecrows from the first movie to come back, you know things are bad! Instead, we get a guy in yellow boots who's chasing our hero (unfortunately, he's dressed similarly to Mr. Walker, so I did not even know he was being followed for a while). I found out the identity of the man in the yellow boots long before Walker did (the movie is almost over when he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the film keeps on going ... and in case it's not slow enough, there are slow-movers! The last sound you hear (apart from your own laugh) is very poorly dubbed. If you can not know, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. At least they did not end with the promise of another sequel!
