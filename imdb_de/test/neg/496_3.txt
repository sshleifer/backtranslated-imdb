Here's another great movie critics will love. The problem is that it is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie premise is simple. Nine convicts escape from prison after the tenth goes mad and tell them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> The first half contains a lot of slapstick, some of which are very wide, while the second half is a character driven into descent. Fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> The two halves just do not mix. Single Scenes Work Very Well (The boys who collide with a friend's house and have a new Filipino bride are weird, while a later scene plucks with the big man working in the restaurant.) They just do not go together. <br /> <br /> There are also missing some settings in the movie. A scene shows the boys desperately looking for a change machine to buy a snack. In the next scene, the whole crew is sitting in a restaurant. Where did they get the clothes and wigs from? (The crew includes both the big and a dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why they are on the train? You are clearly types in the tongue and can not keep it in mind, as a big guy and a dwarf who eats a meal dressed as a woman? I mention the big and the dwarf, because next to the old, all the others seem to fit together. (In fact, they wear similar white coveralls in most parts of the movie). The film has very little character development in the first half, and the second half lacks an emotional impact. Since we often try to find out who is in their individual profit scenes. <br /> <br /> When talking about a resistance, the second half has all those wonderful camera shots and big emotional moments and great imagery that makes a great movie. It is also painfully slow, which makes for a boring movie. <br /> <br /> 9 Souls is a big disappointment, the reviews are bubbling over a great movie and it's in there somewhere, good luck if you find it yourself.
