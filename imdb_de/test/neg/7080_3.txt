The biggest problem with "In Search of the Historical Jesus" is that there is no search at all. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary films" in the 1970s and 1980s, where interviews with "experts" and discussions on "science" and "facts" took place to illustrate the title of the film. <br /> <br Unfortunately, "historical Jesus" is really something more than a third-rate dramatization of Christ's life. In contrast to Shick-Sunn's "Looking for Noah's Ark", which spends much of its time discussing the possibility that the Ark rests on Earth today, and where possible, this film is basically made the story of Jesus without effort to prove or disprove his existence. The famous Shroud of Turrin is mentioned, but few other detective works get a lot of screen time. <br /> <br /> For fans of these quasi-documentary films like "Jupiter Menace" and "Looking for Bigfoot" etc. This movie does not offer much.
