Why do you ask, does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the Almighty? Well, it's his deductive logic, my friends. You see, I know that God exists because Satan does it. How else would my poor eyes have been soiled in such a horrible movie? Yes, there is no doubt that on a cold Friday in 2006, Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this movie. He what? You wonder; the devil lets little girls spit vomit and climb to the ceiling, why waste his time watching this movie? My only conclusion on this question is that Satan believes that observing Camp Fear is the worst form of the death penalty, not eroding your eyes or letting you speak in tongues, but getting you to mentally sit down for an hour and a half of the most awful filmmaking. Can this movie be as horrible as it says? Yes, my friend watching this movie is about fifty million times kicked, maybe more. But maybe I'm too hard, this film has a few moments, the beginning begins, for example, in a dorm with many topless girls. I'm never sure if girls really do that, but you can always pray. Now, after the five minutes of breasts and buttocks have ended, a scene is presented to us on the campus of All Girls College. The girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient hills. The class professor (who appears to be the only man at this girls' college) takes a handful of his students and his girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains, their quests to find ancient Indian artifacts. Yes, right professor, we know at what angle you make the nod. Now the movie starts, the group of five, four girls and one of them stops at a gas station to get instructions, but lo and behold, a group of bikers attracts and molests the girls, only to let them go on their own their separate ways. Continue to a "campsite", which consists of four logs and some trees. Then things start to go horribly wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend set out to have some time for themselves when one of the girls takes upon herself to find her, only to be caught by an unknown force. The other two girls go in search of the missing girl when the bikers and a drunk guy look for them, their plan to rape the girls and do terrible things to them. The film continues with something about a druid who needs four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from a water monster a millennium ago; but it's a drag on this plan, Mr. Druid, one of the girls is being desecrated right in front of us, so this plan goes away. Well, since I said there would be spoilers, I'll ruin the end of the movie for you. The four girls are taken away, stunned with some green soda and are ready to be sacrificed after one of the two was killed remaining biker and the prof. come to save her; They stand on a ledge where the non-leading biker says, "I think I can do it!" Just to jump and break his leg. The prof. Runs towards the guy and is muffled just to leave the once-raped-now-heroic biker who can fend off the 6'3 "giant druid, first making a pathetic attempt with a stick, then pulling a knife, The Knife Shows A Lazer They shine with a golden serpent mouth and immediately set fire to the druid, then they carry the wounded over emergency brackets and wonder if it's all over, just to see the bubble that the monster shows The film is still alive and this is my review, which unfortunately is not read by most eyes, as this is only the fifth published review for a movie that has been on the market for fifteen years. "Fortunately, Satan can only do some of us and not all The judge would like to apologize to the poor girl in Circuit City and I will have this film loaned to me: "I'm sorry, Sheila, please do not hate me, that you may look at this.
