What a fucking movie! The main character in this movie was born and raised in Canada, but had a stronger Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Do all the chicks in Canada get dressed like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All women are dressed like strippers. Do not waste your time with it! The only good thing about this film is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. I wonder why Bollywood is going through a crisis. It's because of movies like this. I miss the good old days when Hindi movies were really entertaining. I could not even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood needs to stop copying the style of Hollywood because it just does not work. They have to stick to their roots, because that makes the Indian movies entertaining.
