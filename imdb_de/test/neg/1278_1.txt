You are the living? OK, I think I'm intelligent, educated, liberal and really in movies. I like and have a great sense of humor. I had the impression that this was a gritty painful comedy. They were paid for it, gas was consumed, electricity was burned, food was consumed, sets were built ... why? I blame the current state of the world in this movie and all the people connected with it. I will even involve the audience. We are all to blame and deserve whatever comes. It's not funny, not much happens, everyone seems boring or boring. There are no discussions, the communication is minimal. As far as I know, there is no conspiracy. In fact, I've lost 89 minutes of my life. I will never get that time again. The only message I got is that maybe life is too short to watch movies where people do not do much ...
