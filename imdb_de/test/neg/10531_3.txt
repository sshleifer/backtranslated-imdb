Steven Segal has made some horrible films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is executed because he stole some money? Some mercenaries kidnap a Supreme Court judge? Your goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so that they can find out where he has the money? The execution chamber is now full of trapdoors and raised floors and looks like a set from one of Cirque Du Soleil's circus shows. Then there is the question of the prison. Here is the Warden a homie, played by Tony Plana. The prisoners have all their colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve meals and keep the jail clean. Nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating some guards while the warden watches. What happens? The overseer gives them a stern conversation. He could punish her next time. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are many moments that are good for a laugh. However, Nia Peeples looks pretty good and Ja Rule tries to be an action hero. It's a lot of fun watching the prisoners "do the right thing" and get armed to free the Supreme Court from their abductors. Regardless of how bad Half Past Dead can be, remember that this movie is the best movie Steven Segal has played since Under Siege in 1992.
