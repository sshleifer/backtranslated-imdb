There are times when I'm less than halfway through a movie wondering what the creators thought, why they decided not to burn every roll of film and instead release a movie that has no real value. And I mean, somehow. This movie does not even stand up as cable porn. In fact, the tears of the sky are totally and totally boring and sometimes a little disturbing in their naivety. The girl, who I remember is eighteen years old, masturbates and thinks of an older Nazi who beat her in a car - "pushing her down the hall to introduce herself" from sitcoms and Robert Zemeki's films , Then, at the second or third meeting - get this - he's the shy one who defies the girl's sexual advances, and yet she just has to say, "I'm old enough, I 'I want to," and he brings her into it Bed. Then, after having slept with this girl, he barely knows, he feels ready, as if he could die with her right in bed, and he had a full life. It's like "Lolita" without a hint of social and personal comments. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the most boring part of the movie. No interesting angles or originality, not even for the sex scenes, which should be the main attraction for this type of films. The masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girl's bed (very fake, as if she's on a stage), and she's entangled with her imagination about the man showering in a waterfall. The scene "I'm done" is just a close-up of the girl's right side (head up to the breasts) with the guy on top, and it's the same setting for the entire time, even though repetitive incisions result in a pretty disjointed one Scene of the older sister of the Nazis, who has a kind of incestuous crush on him (she is ridiculous and stupid, so it does not matter). I think it takes five to ten minutes and it's neither enlightening nor exciting.
