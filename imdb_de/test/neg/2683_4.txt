After Loomis gives a brief summary of Micheal Myers, we look back on 1989, where Jamie is kidnapped by Man in Black before the burning police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby. In this version, the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems to be much more pro-active than he is in the final cut. The score is much better and is more like Parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitars BS. And the end makes a bit more sense. For these reasons, along with the fact that this cut has more character and tension and reduces the Gore factor (Halloween, unlike the "Friday the 13th" franchise, it was never a blatant Gore), so I prefer this bootleg -Producer's Cut. Not to say that the cut magically turns a feces into gold, it only polishes a bit and makes it more understandable. The whole cult act is still very stupid, as is Micheal, who bears witness to a child. <br /> <br /> The cut of my producer: C- <br /> <br /> My theatrical cut: D-
