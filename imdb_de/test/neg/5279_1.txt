Low-budget movies like these give me hope as a rising screenwriter. In other words, if there are people willing to finance such a piece of Schlock, then there is certainly more than a glimmer of hope for someone like me who can actually write stories. This movie is at the top or should I say "down there" with the Ed Woods of the world. History, if you can call it that, and dialogue, not to mention sophomoric, is a travesty of the genre. Someone should have staked a bet by this stinker while he was still on the paper. It follows that, since the literature was almost killed off, this film should follow. To have a good or even passable film, you have to have at least decent writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak comes to my mind. They've used many of his stories for low-budget movies when they still seem like good, serious entertainment today. H. "Donavan's Brain". The cast for this "work" should seriously consider working again on their respective hamburgers joints or shoe stores, and forget all future weak attempts to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this like the plague itself !!!
