I've been pretty much lost for most of this movie, and I'm the one who usually understands the work of such mysterious movie greats as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire with Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork makes no sense at all, but does not fit together into a fully coherent film. Over time, the themes and intentions of the movie become clearer, but at first sight I was really confused, and I find that this is the main flaw of the movie. The property is focused on the city of Northfork, Montana, in 1955. The city was emptied and is soon flooded to make way for a hydroelectric dam. The main problem is that not all residents are ready to be evacuated and resettled. A group of men are hired to force the remaining inhabitants out of the city before they drown and most of them succeed in some rather unusual situations and city dwellers. At the same time, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick boy (or is he a fallen angel?) Whose adopted parents brought him back to the Northfork Orphanage because of his illness, from which they adopted him. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) takes care of the dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or does he ?!) that a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have arrived in the lonely and empty city to to seek a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and head, trying to convince the angels that his scars are where people have amputated his wings and halo. Oh yes, and meanwhile, a strangely surreal animal is traveling on stilts that runs through the landscape. There are many other little events that happen in the movie, but none of them is much more than a passing intrigue. You can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers paid a lot of attention to this movie) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whines without much to make statement. As I wrote earlier, after watching, it becomes clearer what might have happened in the movie. Irwin dies, and Northfork too, and in coping with his own loss and death, Irwin has most likely created characters he draws from the objects of the orphanage to reassure him as he is deserted and his life nears its end. On the other hand, he may really be an angel and he has found his way and can now return home. I must stress that there are some really beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, lively and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole feels disconnected and somehow incomplete.
