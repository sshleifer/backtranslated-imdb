I have seen this movie with great expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that this would be a nuisance. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfactory. The violence was not something I have not seen a thousand times, the gore level was just average (although there was probably more than in Hollywood in the last five years - maybe more) - and at no time was it myself to be uncomfortable, startled. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps, did not live up to its hype. <br /> <br /> Sure, rent this movie, but do not go with any expectations. I am keen to immerse myself in the entire Asian horror scene, but I am constantly disappointed. Ichi loved Ichi and Audition, but on the other hand, Miike is alone at the moment. <br /> <br /> Please inspire me ..... there is a large collection of annoyed genre fans suffering from quality scares!
