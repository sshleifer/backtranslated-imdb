I looked at the version with miserable American over-dubs, maybe it was even worse, but in my opinion the movie was pretty bad anyway. It seemed like a low budget. The visuals reminded me of a second-class television movie, a random white dog that replaced Dogmatix, embarrassing BBC costumes of the '60s, etc. Mainly, though, I think that the characters in the movie did not behave like the comic characters, and even as I never felt ready to forgive even the bad look of the movie. It will always be difficult to capture the feel of the comics in a non-animated movie, and I do not feel that this attempt was ultimately worth it.
