"At the Earth's Core" was on TV yesterday. I was at my computer and accidentally glanced at what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made. I was immediately struck by the film's modest output, horrific plays (including everyone - even Peter Cushing) and horrific, unintentionally funny action sequences and puppet monsters. The film is about a Victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical Buff American Hero on a floor-length journey into the Welsh countryside. They hardly know that there is a great evil in the center of the earth's core ... Forget the fact that the title makes no sense. (If they were really in the heart of the earth, they would be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and come alive in a sea of ​​iron or whatever burn down there.) Forget that the puppets in the production rival "The Beast Master" for the worst of times. No, the true genius of "At the Earth's Core" is its naive stupidity - a gung-ho action spectacle with no real action and no real spectacle. It's essentially just a gung-ho movie and a stupid movie. People who like MST3K style stuff will love it - it's awfully bad and indeed so bad that it's almost funny in a strange way.
