Again this kind of zero-budget digital video cam garbage. and again I fell into this trap because the title "Zombie" (ZOMBIE ATTACK!) had the story: On Halloween, some people visit the "Museum of the Dead", it's a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill people, everything associated with Aztec cult. so they fight against some zombies there. <br /> <br /> ultra cheap scenery: some hallways with black tape. a few dilettantische drawings and a few skulls, as one can find in every shop. no actors, only inferior models who have absolutely no idea what to do. no make-up ridiculous make-up, your local hobby make-up zombie fan will do better, at some point it looks like they do not have enough money for enough paint, otherwise they just could not do it, man, they have to recognize the look of their "zombies". some ridiculous martial arts are fighting with the zombies, slow motion. If the director wants it scary, he uses a standard digital video cam effect, where everything goes away. incredible! 0 out of 10!
