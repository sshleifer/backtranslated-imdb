I switched this movie on and off about an hour ago since launching, and I have to say, that's one hour of my life I wasted and will not come back. Acting is crap and scripts take a serious look And whoever wrote them must be beaten, maybe the TV will explode and get me out of my misery ..... The only good thing about this movie is that it is for Guys and girls have some good eye candy, of which I wish most special effects like sh * t, Dante? Anyone who thinks a man in skintight leather pants and a half leather jacket is scary, looks more feminine than most women in this movie, Dante's voice is pathetic, no one thinks THAN threatening or frightening. please TV I ask you to blow up !!!!!!!!!!
