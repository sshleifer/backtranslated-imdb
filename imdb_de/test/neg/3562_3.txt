This film tries to say something profound; I'm just not sure what it was. In the end, too much is left open to find the main point. In some scenes, I really wonder what was left of the tailoring floor. I do not think the wall is very well developed. I never knew what was going on there. When the mother finally revealed it, I just could not connect to the boy's silence. What was the point that the boy did not speak? Was he just crazy or did he gain any power? What was the scene with the burned girl? Another power the boy has or what? I do not understand how any character developed from it or moved the plot. I got the bully, but what happened to the dog? Did the dog come back or did Mama let Fido go somehow forever? <br /> <br /> There were several additional plot elements that had more clutter than use. Like the radio talk show in the background about the Iraq war. I think that should be a comparison to the grief and insecurity that Mother and Addison experienced, but for me it was distracting and tense. I did not buy the link especially. I also found that the teacher came to Addison because he had not said much "here". The mother who visited the doctor was useless, how did she serve the conspiracy? Was that how to show how desperate the mother was, or was it something medicine I did not get? Was that the father in the last scene, or just a guy? So did writing on the wall work? What happened to the dog?
