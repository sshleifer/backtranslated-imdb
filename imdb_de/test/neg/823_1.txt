Bean, Kevin & Perry, UK TV creations that made successful transitions to the BIG screen. Now Ali G's turn, and I'm afraid to say that this is not one of them! Ali has always been obscene, but funny. This movie was extremely sick and not funny at all. Scenes of bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be presented for the sake of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is garbage and earns little money. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
