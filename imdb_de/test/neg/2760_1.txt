I had to read this juicy love story between a German 24-year prisoner of war and a 12-year-old Jew. That has written "political correctness" about everything. It's like the movie "SPIRIT", in which a horse wants to be free, but these "bad" Americans do not leave because they need it. Well, I have good news that the Americans in the German soldier and his summer book are "evil". Why!!! Horses were given to us by God, and if the Americans needed a horse, they could use it pretty damn well. In the same vein, the German had tried to kill Americans, but this book / movie makes it all right! The casting is absolutely terrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white, the father is probably made up of mostly white offspring and the little sister is "Shirley Templish". The acting is also pretty bad, the serious parts become a comedy! Concluson Bad Movie, Bad Book, but both have different endings, do not read or see any!
