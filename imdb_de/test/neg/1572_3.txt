Such a highly anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill to take. Very, very hard to swallow ... everything. There was no credibility anywhere. And if you do not have a rose, you have no show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seemed to be born to play this role. All she could produce was a cute, witty, dazzling Bette Midler brand ... burdened with all the well-known Midlerisms. Roz Russell does not have to worry. She can rest in her grave and know that she is still the definitive Mama Rose (at least the movie). <br /> <br /> I thought Midler would really mediate this time ... to throw in what is one of the biggest musical roles of all time ... as she did in "The Rose". But no, she has played it safe. She played herself. She made Rose a complete cartoon dinner theater. Even her songs were not inspired. It was crazy to see that Midler has the talent to outgrow their banknotes. She only once showed promise in this "Gypsy" and that was on "Rose's Turn". But until then it was too little, too late. A sincere Cynthia Gibb as the title-hero gave the film its only true spark, and if Gypsy's role outshines Rose, you know there's trouble in River City. <br /> <br /> A huge disappointment.
