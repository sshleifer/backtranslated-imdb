I would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is really beautiful and experiences the architecture of the 20s and 30s, like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead, and I'd like to know if it still exists. It's really amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Oscar. It must have been a time when she was much appreciated by her colleagues in the academy. It would have been really interesting to get an impression of Wyman and the other actors in the film about the script. The film's script, like the recently released Kevin Costner movie with a message in a bottle, is so incredible that it limits the credibility of the actors. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, but was able to prevail mainly by his appearance and only later in his career credible roles (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman had to take this movie through contractual requirements or through the studio system.
