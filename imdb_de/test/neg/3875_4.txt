"Return of the Seven" has some good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's score is as thrilling as ever. Still, it's a boring movie because it does not involve us emotionally. McQueen's absence makes a very bad impression, and the fact that his character is played here by another (little known) actor is strange - in a bad way. The characters are not developed, so we do not associate with them - and we do not care when some of them die. This sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.
