I do not know who funded it or why, but this vampire movie that "wants to be" is really awful. It tries to be hip and appeal to the young audience of the MTV generation, but it's downright ridiculous. The show is terrible and the direction is terrible. I heard the budget was $ 600,000. I would like to know where all the money went?
