This film and several other 1950s films with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, Samson and Delilah, unfortunately show all the Gentiles, or anyone who is not a Jew or Christian, to be morally corrupt and decadent. The focus is only on biblical stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. For them, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. <br /> <br /> Every film that preaches about the "one true God" leads to a brief shift in religious freedom. The films ignore the fact that the lack of religious freedom in ancient Judea made it fertile ground for religious extremism. Most of the religious films of the 1950s overlook the loss of freedom that Christians adopted in the 4th century.
