I've seen the movie many times and am always disappointed, which is a shame as EX YU's films are usually pretty good. The shame here is that Holiwood was trying to make a movie about the place and the people he does not know about. I myself came from the Balkans (Macedonia) and found this film disappointing. Only that the Bosnian characters are not really understood and not really portrayed. To understand the mentality of a person of EX YU, you have to know their background and their way of life, which makes them cry and laugh. And the director of the film did not understand that as a guideline. When we make (EX YU) films, a lot of symbolism is built into it, which makes the characters recognizable and sympathetic and mostly represents the truth (if based on a true story). The films like "Pritty village, pretty flame", "Tito and Me", "Underground", "No mans land", "Before the Rain", "Black cat, white cat", "Otac na sluzbenom putu" (If the Father was on business trip), "Ko to tamo peva" (who sings over there?) Rarely the masterpiece of cinematographic art in the Balkans, and nothing is comparable to him. Not the half-baked story of and Holiwood's studio Other no real connection. I'm sorry, but when the movie is shot, it's not just for the American audience of the most diverse audiences, but for the rest of the world, and some of them are also living in the Balkans and Sarajevo. Half of the stuff is in Bitola (Macedonia, where I come from) brought to shooting, and I am shocked when I saw the Broad St. of Bitola near ng scene of the movie, when the bride shoots from the sniper. And what was the insertion of real footage from the news in the movie? In any case, very disappointing, because the truth is far from the movie. Too bad that no one has asked the real people how they should live in Sarajevo under attack before they shoot the film. Book is one thing and real life is different, and this movie lets you down.
