As much as I hated the movie that follows this series, I can at least say that Zangief was amusing. The animated series is probably one of the worst things ever produced. The animation is often inconsistent, although it remains consistently poor. The character of a character can even change drastically in the same attitude. Also, the script and the voice output leave a lot to be desired, since most performers are about as talented as the actors of a drama. Characters like Cammy and DJ are so forced to stereotypes of their nationality that episodes they contain are almost physically painful, not that the series is not painful anyway. Episode plots seem to be getting new levels of lame with each round and are so full of plot holes that I am amazed that they had time to show commercials. Honestly, I'm surprised that someone who wants to advertise during the show is paid. Besides a bad series, it's an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters retain the failed adjustments from the movie. Examples include Ken and Ryu as idiots (though Ken is supposed to be rich), Blanka as Guile's friend Charlie, and Chun Li as a reporter. It takes talent to take something bad and make the movie worse.
