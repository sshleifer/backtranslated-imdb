Well, where do we start, there was a lot of potential for this movie, with such big stars playing a role. But the whole story was destroyed by a terrible conspiracy. This movie did not turn out to be what I would expect, the good makes it alive, I mean, my friend, nobody wants the good to be successful. The end was damn worthy and very clich√©d, no thought whatsoever, YOU GET ALL THE FALSE THAT THE BAD GUYS COME SUCCESSFUL Time spent doing something else, this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors made this movie for some fast Vegas cash. Save your money and watch a better movie.
