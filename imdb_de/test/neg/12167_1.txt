I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I did not finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst crap I have ever seen. What did you expect to do for three hours? It may have a pretty good story, but actors? No tension? No. Romance? No, horror? No, it had nothing. <br /> <br /> It has this weird, crazy scientist with Einsteinhaar, the classic. Not real at all. And a man is getting younger and younger. It seems they just used the name of Stephen King to make a shitty, too-long movie with nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> I give this movie "1 (bad)". If they had like -5, I'd probably take that instead. It was a total waste of time.
