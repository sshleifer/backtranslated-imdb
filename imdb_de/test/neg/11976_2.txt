Another terrible film by Mr. Boll, who completely overlooks the entire filming of a video game. How he continues to be hired for filming is a constant surprise to me, and of course for most of the films in which the film is set. <br /> <br /> As a whole, I'll say that this attempt was a lot better than so many of his previous attempts. Part of the dialogue was even halfway decent in Far Cry, though he still abuses some phrases, and in some cases he does not even use the phrases correctly. <br /> <br /> Well, except that Jack Carver should do that. Be American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role. An exception are the ridiculously lame lines with which he goes to bed with the girl. And we're supposed to believe that she's ready to have sex with him so casually after such a minimal dialogue? Emile? I'm just there to make comic easier. I am sure and still lame. Jack's character looks old and tired, but he is still able to handle the extreme acrobats needed to avoid one of the altered supersoldiers in the lab. But you could only spend an hour and a half watching it when you have nothing better to do.
