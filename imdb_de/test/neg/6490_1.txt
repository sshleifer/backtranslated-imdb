Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are two happy, murderous aliens stranded on earth stumbling across a small western town. They become deputy sheriffs and condemn racers, killers, and others with a deadly form of justice, while getting rid of some of the natives (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, her sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) arrives with her black man (Christopher M. Brown) in a skimpy outfit to find her, and television reporters and government officials appear to fill the time. <br /> <br As far as I can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to capture all sorts of genres (comedy, science-fiction, horror, westerns ...) in a movie, and what a stupid, frustrating mess it is despite energetic spectacle is the two stars. The script is downright cruel.
