The spirit of Mencia could be described as nothing more than a clone of Chappelle's show, but it's really worse. Carlos Mencia is a Jacka ** that is just as funny as the original, which does not say much. The show contains paralyzed parodies of American television advertising and political issues. The "comedic" insight of Mencia into politics adds to the poor quality of the show. In addition, mencia throws more lame ethnic jokes and stolen Jeff Foxworthy lines than I can count on a hand. While Carlos gets a cheap laugh now and then, he spends the rest of the time offending everyone in sight. This also means that he exploits his own audience. With the exception of South Park, which is being merged, and Friday evenings stand-up, this show marks the end of Chappelle's Glory Days show, which was for those of you who have not heard before he went to Africa.
