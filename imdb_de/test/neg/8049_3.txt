The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clich√©s it reuses. Chinese gangsters growl. A female vice president. A ventilation duct just big enough to go with a tall Caucasian man. Shoot through the wall to kill the evil. A situation where you have to spit out some innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scenes where you air some memorable landmarks in a fireball. The vice-president in a nice, well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese prime minister practically appeared alone in a dark, dimly lit room, growling as viciously as the slimy gangsters. A lonely hero left alone in a ship (building, plane, whatever) ravaged confusing guys with big automatic weapons. Etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The second best way is to count how many zeros you need to put after the decimal point to accurately estimate the likelihood of the movie scenario. I counted up to 45. A president who agrees to a meeting aboard a private ship. The impossible not overwrite command from the nuke box. The part where the Chinese decided to shoot. Etc. The earth is more in the sun than for this movie. <br /> <br /> I admit the movie was interesting until the evil Taiwanese gangsters abducted the president. Then the boredom entered. The lifting of unbelief ceased, and I thought of the fun I would torment this movie ...
