I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historical classics". It's hardly a classic, and since the story was updated to the point of its release, it's not historical either. The actual title on the DVD is "Indecent" and additionally titled "The Private Life of Becky Sharp". Myrna Loy is not very persuasive, though in her defense she has terrible script and banal dialogues. As with many early conversations, and especially in smaller studios, there is little talent shown by the cast and crew. Although Loy wears some fashionable clothes, her costumes and make-up in the later scenes are overkill. The only saving grace is a bearable performance of Billy Bevan playing one of her many lovers
