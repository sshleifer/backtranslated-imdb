In the last few years of Ron Millers (son-in-law of Walt Disney cum producer) he ruled live action crap on a stick, often with the very boring Dean Jones, whose entire career was based on this kind of light. empty with the fare. Other terrible films from this period include Pete's Dragon, the last flight of Noah's Ark, Unidentified Flying Oddball and the dreaded Condorman. I will not mention Tron because I thought it was ambitious and Miller was just the executive producer, so he had little to do with actual production. But he was in full force as this horrible piece of human garbage was expelled from the guts of creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. In the second installment of the popular Love Bug story, Herbie falls in love with another car that also has heart and mind. There's a race, a few lame bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. The film shot in France is actually beautifully photographed and the landscape is beautiful. But one has the idea that the film was made so that everyone involved could have a three-month holiday in France. The rest of the movie is a wreck. Prat crashes, plundering thieves, nasty German racing competitors and a pretty jumping feminist fall under the category of stock supply. The biggest insult to the film: trying to further develop Herbie's lover personality through shocks, beeps, blinking lights, and movements suggestive of a horny seventeen-year-old, Disney's writers do wrong to our cute little VW. On the other hand, I would think it would be hard for someone to overtake Helen Hayes, who drives Herbie around a skyscraper luff in the second round.
