I have little or no interest in seeing another horrible movie that is completely new, which is creative or funny, and abuses the National Lampoon Day. Whatever has been noticed in the cast of this film. I see Danielle Fishel's name. I'm a big fan of Boy Meets World! But the movies are terrible. Even more so as a fan, I'm not rewarded for seeing her horrible movies with the treasure of her bare chest. Here comes my question into play. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, does Danielle Fishel get naked in it? I would save myself the 2 hours of my life that I would never see again when I see this horrible movie. Many thanks
