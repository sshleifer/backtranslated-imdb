A new wrestling show paves the way for the most feared wrestler imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell is doing everything in his power to pull the WWF champion Rip into the square to face Zeus for the "Battle of the Tough Guys" championship. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip ever faced. <br /> <br /> Normally, as a wrestler, I would give Hogan a margin that turns into a movie role, but this film did not ask the Hulkster to do a lot, just asked Hogan to play himself, what he failed miserably. 'Tiny' Lister has made a great effort as a mighty Zeus, but even his work left the film a bit to be desired, namely acting! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, if you wish, otherwise you'll probably need to turn it off for more than ten minutes.
