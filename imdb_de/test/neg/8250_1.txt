So many fans, so little to show. I know, I know, these words will find me in a large minority. Many people liked Good Will Hunting very much. But seriously, great film work, not even close, and let's blame where it belongs ... in the Scriptures. <br /> <br /> Well, I know you won an Oscar for that, and the boy did it well on the screen. Good Will Hunting is a post-school ABC special with a lot of curse and a slightly bigger budget. <br /> <br /> What this film shows is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take crap, feed you and make you think you eat well. And that's exactly what the studio did with the movie. They created so much Faluttin Buzz that people believed in it and wanted to believe it - that they saw brilliance where there was none. <br /> <br /> Well, I know that some people think it's great movie, I do not think it's a terribly bad movie, I like to compare it to movies in the middle of the road movies and also with some great Made for TV movies (though HBO movies are not HBO movies that are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would always be.) It's just a nice little movie, with some good performances. Robin Williams was not good at it, they just gave him the Oscar because he had been irritated for a while. And of course, the Miramax public relations machine Ben and Matt secured their scriptwriter ... but, come on guys ... there are better movies that are not GWH.
