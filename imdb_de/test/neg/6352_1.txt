I bought this movie for a dollar and thought I could never make a mistake, my big mistake was to look at it. I enjoyed the spectacle of Ice-T and the Rappen, which gave this movie about Los Angeles and the world of the pimps a lot of lessons. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and has a career, but due to mental health issues from childhood and the killing of this other boxer, he retreats. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls working for him in his profession, and make sure they are not beaten up. This boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all sorts of problems begin. That's entertaining and turns into a big laugh comedy.
