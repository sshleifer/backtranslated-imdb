In the event that you are surprised that Loren C ***** by (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a living idiot and all the information he provides, are thrown away with the garbage. The guy is just a newspaper cutter. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, it was a predictable train crash, the actors were mechanical, the lighting was awful, and the props / clothes were cheap /> Bobcat Goldwait should be in the movie about that Clowns are standing. I was physically ill after seeing ten minutes of it. <br /> <br /> There are insane monkeys who are still responsible for the films I see. <br /> <br /> Dan
