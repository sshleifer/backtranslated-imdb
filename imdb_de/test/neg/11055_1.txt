THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It offers passable acting, bad lighting, a faint story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. In the plot, a student is forced by his attractive landlord to join a cult. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a fun attitude for this group if it had not been for a stupid script and the cheapness of production. The monster effects look horrible and the picture quality gives the feeling that you are watching a home video or a public service announcement. I think whoever sees this will agree that movies should be shot in the movie.
