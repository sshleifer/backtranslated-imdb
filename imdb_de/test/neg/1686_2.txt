I never really started to watch the show until it was canceled and reruns were shown. I actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. As soon as I saw the fourth and fifth, I got angry. The first problem was that they repeated this irrelevant scenario in the story (Jr had a child like his parents). The second had to be the one everyone had teamed up with (ex: Katie and Franklin). The third was when they made Jr even more idiotic than before, which was getting boring and annoying until I wanted to go on TV and steal the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious. The fourth had to be the zealous idiot Clarie claimed to be a friend. The fifth had to be Katie, she was getting too well for herself and was treated by her "friend" Franklin as the weakling he was. Last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like seeing a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson, which was just more annoying !!! They jumped seriously with the shark when he came to the show. His character was barely realistic and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious violence, showing that Noah can not act. At any time, when I saw the child, I wanted it to clap. But B.F. (in front of Frank) this show was funny and very entertaining.
