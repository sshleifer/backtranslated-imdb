Okay, you hippies are probably wondering what I have against a "education" and "informative" show like "Barney"? Well, I hate it for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that a personality and individualism is immoral. Nobody on the show has a personality. Everyone dresses, talks the same way, acts the same and dances equally. Even in the episode "Being a Individual" children try to tell Barney what they like and EVERYONE on the planet should do what I want. Would you like to teach your child that it is wrong to be a person? <br /> <br /> 2. "A stranger is a friend you do not know yet" - episode. Although seemingly harmless, the show's producers soon found that it could be extremely dangerous to young children as well. In fact, several young Barney lovers from the US fell victim to the pedophiles who used the show's friendly message to lure children away from their parents. The episode has since been pulled, but the damage has been done. So-called "innocent" mistakes in programming, like this, clearly show why parents need to watch TV with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. No one seems to show any emotion other than happiness, no matter what their situation. If, for some reason, the child's parents go crazy or sad, the child may think differently about mom or dad. Not good news at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! Seems like every problem is solved by magic. At least in shows like "Fraggle Rock" it teaches us that magical CAN backfire is best for him to solve problems on his own. Does Barney teach that? No of course not. There had to be magic in it. And the problem is that many two-year-olds can not distinguish the fantasy from the reality and may think that their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, but get confused when they can NOT use magic and feel crazy , Another boner moved again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney does not differentiate between stealing and sharing. He even said explicitly that "stealing is alright when the person stealing you does not mind". Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable method to get it. This is not something preschoolers need to tell authorities. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I'm just right, I can solve all my problems." When the kids have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message sent here is "Do not try to think to solve the problem, it's too much work, and the solution probably would not work anyway, just use it." Because of this, children could stop thinking about things (Barney said it was too much work) and they would rely on the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) This is obviously good news for Barney marketers, but not for preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The news that fraud is alright. In another episode, the children are involved in a contest in which a peanut is carried on a spoon without dropping it. A child puts peanut butter on the spoon and wins easily. The child will then be rewarded for his creative thinking if the child has actually changed the rules and changed the game so that he can win. This teaches that cheating is good, you win and people think that you are creative when in real life they are often disqualified or worse and are not liked at all by other rivals who abide by the rules Children in this show except cake, biscuits and sweets something else? This teaches that eating tons of junk food and avoiding healthy food is okay, despite Barney's so-called "health food" song. Apart from that, EVERYONE eats junk food on the show. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And finally .... <br /> <br /> Most other children's television programs teach creative problem-solving without the need for "magic". Barney could have done that, but decided to use the method that A) was best for the marketer and B) needed the least amount of time and money for scripts. It's a blatant sell-out that shows how little the Lyons Group really cares about children. <br /> <br /> This is my chatter for you all.
