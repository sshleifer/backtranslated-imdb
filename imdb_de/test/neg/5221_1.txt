Usually I do not like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually pretty well choreographed. Chuck is undeniably one of the great martial artists. In my local antique shop I found a movie I had never seen and took it home. <br /> <br /> Although the acting in this film was worse than in most Chuch Norris films, I hoped to see at least one fight scene. I quickly realized that this was not a typical Chuch Norris movie; It was more of a Christian film that should illustrate the paradigm of "gaining goodwill." <br /> <br /> There's really nothing on the packaging that suggests it's a Christian movie except the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, of which I had never heard before. I'll remember that for sure when I next see a movie from this company. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with sneaky proselytizing. If someone is going to do a religious movie, they have to at least tell common sense that they are getting what they get. The only redeeming part of the exercise is that I only spent $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to see how a great martial artist does not fight. At least it was during dinner, and I spent some of it cooking and eating. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts movie and do not hope for much, don 't mind this movie because it does not even offer that.
