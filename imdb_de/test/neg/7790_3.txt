I once had a conversation with my parents, who told me that in the 1940s and 50s, British moviegoers would see the country of origin of a movie before they saw it. It did not matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it was an American movie, people would want to see it and if it were British people, they would not want to see it. That may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing THE ASTONISHED HEART, I can understand why people then preferred American cinema to native diversity. In the 1940s, British non-working-class investment showed it in this film. Everyone speaks with a top-of-the-range British accent that sounds like a working class to the British royal family, and what this does alienate much of a potential British public that Jimmy Cagney would no doubt prefer to see in WHITE HEAT because people would have, if They would not be related, certainly with a violent gangster cinematic more than a few high-class English weaknesses of 1949 felt. That's entertainment, the reason why people go to the cinemas. Even the names of the characters are bizarre - Leonora! How many British were named Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "oysters". One has the feeling that this was not marketed for a 1949 British mainstream audience. But why should it be if the majority of British moviegoers stopped in the cinemas to see far more entertaining American imports? <br /> <br /> When I watched the ATSONISHED HEART in 2005, I was amazed how old everything was. In fact, it's dated so I thought it might be a parody of THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What did not surprise me was the fact that these types of films almost came close to the downfall of the British film industry, an industry that only became apparent when American money was invested in crowd pullers like ZULU, ALFIE and the James Bond films
