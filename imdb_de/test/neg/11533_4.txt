The only reason one of the hundred users watched this movie was because they were crew members, friends of the crew or obsessive fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. Personally, I follow the "Lance cult", so I was disappointed that the headliner, even though he's just in the name. Lance plays the rich criminal Newcastle and is a pleasure to see, but his entire screen time is banished to the beginning of the film. Newcastle is building a 747 robbery that includes ketchum (lamas) and a bunch of forgetful characters. The biggest shock to this viewer was that the scenes before the robbery were not that bad. With the exception of the somewhat vile and rather confused Aviva Gale, who played every line with the finesse of a theatrical actress, the acting was decent everywhere, and none of the lines really made me flinch. </ Br>> But as soon as the robbery occurs, the movie falls asleep. Not only is her plan the most ludicrous thing ever caught in the movie, it has been dragging on for far too long. This is not a very deep movie, and you have to fill in your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I almost took a nap at 2 pm. A particular sequence in which we observe how each character performs the same task over and over again is particularly difficult to deal with. The film is called "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is anything but fast - it's too long and bloated to extremes. Maybe it would have worked if one of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's only so much you can ask for from a Showtime Extreme movie. <br /> <br /> Luckily there are various, deliberate and unintentional laughter (Lorenzo Lamas seems to be a master of disguise, which creates some incredibly bizarre scenarios), and Lance returns to the end of the movie for a short while back. It's a bad movie, and I probably did not have to tell you that myself, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. I would not put it too high on the list of Henriksen movies because he had some real jewels with a longer screen time and the movie definitely loses steam as soon as the raid starts, but the best thing I can say is Rapid Exchange is that the last two movies I've seen before were the mainstream hostage and the overrated, overbearing crash - and that was better than both.
