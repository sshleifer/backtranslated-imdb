Notice, I only saw about the last half of this movie. So feel free to take my review with the salt that you find appropriate when you say that what I saw was more than enough to have convinced me that star rating is enough , <br /> <br /> In short, it's a bleak slaughter of the wonderful forerunner (NL Christmas holidays) with Chevy Chase, only Chevy Chase is not included in takes place on a generic tropical island, essentially unrelated to Christmas. <br /> <br /> Ol 'Chevy probably did not want to because the plot is not really fun, instead they got the damn cousin Eddie, who was great in the original, but he's just over the top in that respect and a most extreme bad basis for any film, considering the plot and the acting. The experiments of humor are so widespread that even contemporary television comedy trumps them, and considering that this is supposed to be comedy, I doubt I have to say more. <br /> <br /> This is not to be seen His qualities have none, but for his mistakes and again how Hollywood sheds its blood of the past when it comes to making quick money. <br /> <br /> I think I'm looking at the original before Christmas is coming, just to try to reclaim my innocence from my childhood, from a lost time when movies were more than just budget but more meaningless Rubbish.
