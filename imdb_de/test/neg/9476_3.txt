Now I looked at it when I had a hangover on a Sunday and my aunt and uncle visited one day with my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We sat on TV and Passport To Paris had just started. My cousins ​​both said that they sometimes see Two Of A Kind, and I said they could watch the movie if they wanted. Since I was not able to get up, I just stayed with them in the living room and finally watched the movie! I have to say, as a person who is not interested in this type of TV show or movie, I really enjoyed it ... it must have been the alcohol. But I admit, it would probably only appeal to girls who are between the two 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or show that you think you do not like, but for fun, you enjoyed it.
