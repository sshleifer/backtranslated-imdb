Even those of us who like cute animal pictures - and I detest them - will hardly find merit in this hideous wickedness of a movie. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians" with its intelligent and loyal dogs, its silent and insidious people and its absurdly "happy" and predictable end, I remember the alternative title "101 Turkeys". That would cover almost everyone involved in his unfortunate production. I dismissed it as an insane Hollywood perversion of British customs before I learned, to my horror, that it was indeed a Canadian movie filmed in Victoria BC, that fake British theme park in a city, while driving Ottawa ON The dollar also sucked up a fake pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count how bad it is. The dizzying story? The asinine script? The gloomy achievements and the sophomoric direction? The clever animals? The endless clich√©s and the predictable slapstick? In the second thought, neither I nor those who search the IMDb have time for a complete catalog of their mistakes. If I were not too detailed, this room would be empty. Trust me, it's bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have already seen it, my condolences. If you have not done so, stay away from SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Do not even let your children see their tiny heads being distorted by the even tiniest heads of those who financed, crafted, and filmed this terrible folly. Maybe tonight, when I'm retiring, I'll have a nightmare in which horrible little creatures spring from the bed table as I fly in a hectic flight. Hopefully. It will be far better than watching this animal banal boondoggle. But maybe I dreamed that I had to see it a second time, and the terrible horror and cold sweat make me want to stay up all night, trembling at the possibility of even seeing it as a bad dream again. I could even find something valuable to see. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes". Maybe the instruction video for my built-in vacuum cleaner.
