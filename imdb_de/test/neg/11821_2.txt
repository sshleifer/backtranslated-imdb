Imagine an exploitative remake of The Defiant Ones with a black and a white chick. Set the story on a Caribbean island where the drug dealers reign and the revolution has arrived. And let the black woman from Huggy Bear's stall for ladies and the white woman be a watered-down Patty Hearst, and you have Black Mama, White Mama. <br /> <br /> In these waning days of the Drive-Ins Theater this article must have been a great old hit. All key buttons of the seventies are pressed in this area. Although they both better fill their clothes and get a few whistles from the men in the audience, no one will ever mistake Pam Grier and Margaret Markov for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. All right, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. Margaret and Pam are prisoners, in which the guards and the overseer look at the newly arriving fish lasciviously. Margaret is a rich girl from the state who has tackled "the revolution," while Pam is your basic, expensive call-girl who served the local drug kingpin and is tired of leaving the island. Margaret's co-revolutionaries raid the bus that takes them from the women's prison to the city, but they lose their flight. Both have their different agenda, but like Sid and Tony they can not quite agree on which agenda comes first. Do some interesting times when the police, the drug dealers and the revolutionaries are looking for these two unkempt chain friends. That's the only way you'll get no false ideas, the head of the revolutionaries, and Markov's kanoodling partner is Ernesto, played by Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole mess was filmed in the Philippines, which started their own film industry. <br /> <br /> The beautiful location photography in the Philippines is all that Black Mama and White Mam have to recommend. But if you're a fan of really bad black exploitative moves, then this is one for you.
