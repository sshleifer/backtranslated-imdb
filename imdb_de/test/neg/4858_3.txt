This 22 minutes short, short forerunner of the later, much better "Rock and Rule" shows two folk singer mice that go nowhere. The female mouse Jan signs a deal with the devil to become a rock star. So it's up to Daniel Mouse to save her soul. Made in the late 70's, it has all the peculiarities of this decade (crap music, crap clothes and hairstyle, terrible folk tunes). it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
