I have seen most of John Waters' films. In fact, with the exception of some of its very early ones that are not available, I've actually seen almost everyone. So it's obvious that I'm a big fan and that I have a high tolerance for the gross and disrespectful in his films. On the top and disgusting, I admired FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental tributes to bad tastes and excesses that are really funny movies. So I'm certainly NOT squeamish and can claim most of what Waters has to offer. In PINK FLAMINGOS, however, he has created a film that is so repellent, so insistent and so offensive that I could not even stand it. In his other films, which he made before he became mainstream, they were funny. But humor is simply not there, as it seems to shock the audience and not entertain them in any way. I am glad that Waters sense of humor was improved after the creation of this film, since Divine consuming dog waste (as in this film) is shocking, but by no means entertaining. My advice is to skip this movie and just pretend it never happened, and then watch its infinitely better movies of the '70s and' 80s.
