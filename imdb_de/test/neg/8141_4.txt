Certainly not a bad little low-budget movie, this "bride of the gorilla", but also nothing special and not memorable enough to be counted among the significant sci-fi efforts of its time. Director Curt Siodmak was a stellar scriptwriter in the 1930s and 1940s, delivering stories for some genre classics ("I went with a zombie," "The Wolf Man"), but as a director, he obviously lacked the necessary skills. "Bride of the Gorilla" is similar to the aforementioned "The Wolf Man" in history and atmosphere, but the movie looks much more moody and pathetic. Both are about cursing men who turn into big animals at night, but the title gorilla does not look half as threatening as the werewolf, even though the movie was released a decade later. In a cheesy opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a threatening place and hides many secrets, but there's no real mystery in the storyline. It's all about a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague because he has such a beautiful young wife and he kills him. A native testifies to his crime and casts a spell over Barney, which transforms him into a terribly gorilla at night ... Or she just wants him to think he's turning into a terribly big gorilla. Lon Chaney himself plays the police The commissioner has been charged with murder, while Raymond Burr (who has played in about a thousand Perry Mason television films) portrays the greedy plantation manager / nocturnal gorilla. Siodmak tries to make the movie look like a supernatural thriller? is it or is not everything happening in Barney's head? ?? fail miserably and it causes far too much talk and too little jungle action. Some of the jungle settings are pretty, but the rest of the "special effects" are sticky and poorly executed. Nevertheless, the acting is pretty good, Barbara Payton looks beautiful and ?? although very predictable? The story is strangely compelling right up to the end. Funny movie, it probably voodoo-cursed me ??
