If you look at this film, think of a few words: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "unlikely", "selfish" and finally (and fatal), "boring". Badly judged, poorly photographed, and poorly played, the film is a confusing mess with plotting lines (if you can call them that) moving in all directions. Someone may have used the finger painting of a five-year-old as a template. As a punishment for this childish crime of a movie, this group of "stars" should be loudly beaten and sent to their respective beds without dinner. , All in all, it seems that George needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation, and we're the shits who pay for it. Bad George! Bad!
