In a post-apocalyptic future, the new Highlander is a dazzling little guy named Quentin MacLeod, who is being looked after by a new Ramirez while his little sister is coming in search of a wicked immortal overlord. To do this, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before that Overlord, Korton, does so. In short, this is pure crap, much like the Highlander sequels. Quentin is a pretty silly character who is constantly wailing and moaning and in a "woe to me because I'm a reluctant hero" and he never realizes that he's immortal and can not be killed. At least not easy. Ramirez would have done better to give him up and defeat Korton himself.
