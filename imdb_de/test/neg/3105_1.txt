I'm actually too exhausted to write this review - bad movies always do that for me - but I feel obligated as if it were my civic duty to warn anyone who might consider buying or seeing this terrible mess - a picture. Please, please, take my word: this is one thing you want to stay away from. It's so boring and boring, so bland and uninspired, a bad excuse to put together a well-known talent. Burt Reynolds? Wasted (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is barely in the film, and when he appears on the screen, his performance is so subdued and subdued that it becomes clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by Ice's intense gaze, did not know what to do with him , Rob Lowe has never shown so little charisma on screen as a title character. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed; his performance is a joke in the truest sense of the word. Of course, Satan himself has signed Marios check for this film. The plot is as weak, half finished and annoying as all the music (the boring club song seems to literally continue in the first third of the movie). The look of the film makes one seriously wonder if even the cameraman was forced, like one of the film's forgetful female characters, to smoke the gap from a tube glued to his mouth. And if you are looking for stylized force, you will not find it here. I assure you that this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities! Please, I implore you, avoid this flick! Do not use it and believe that its pace is increasing, getting better, and becoming a decent solution. It will not not It can not! It sucks! Well, you have been warned, and I can go to bed now (it's 3 am - please forgive the resulting mistakes this admonition may contain) - knowing that my conscience is clear because I'm duty to my fellow man have made!
