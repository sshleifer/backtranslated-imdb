I am alarmed that people are not so critical of work that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with "Amadeus" aside, "Copying Beethoven" deliberately chooses the simple way by putting the audience before the art. And therefore refuse the world a sophisticated, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Now consider the following: Is not it possible that the actual story of the creation of the Ninth Symphony can actually be a stimulating and powerful story? and also in a dramatic narrative? Beethoven was completely deaf by writing the symphony. Is not that more interesting? How was the symphony performed? Would not it be great to know? So, ask yourself what kind of motivation a filmmaker might have to introduce a woman as a copyist. If there were a copyist, he would certainly be a man. What was his story? (Please try to be a bit critical, even if you like the invention of a composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve a writer. For those who want to compare and justify Anna Holtz's invention with Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in 'Amadeus', you must confess to a priest in a lunatic asylum (Schaffer uses this device in the movie with great effect ). "Copy Beethoven" may have worked if Anna was a figure of Ludwig's feverish imagination. But we should believe that it is "possible" ... Yes and that Strauss was supported by aliens. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I've read here are often an expression of DESIRE's movie, to be good; almost an intentional amnesia. Remember the movie for what you want for what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, then you think you not only accept an inferior interpretation of real events, but also sacrifice truth for reasons of triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief reference to the acting that may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is NOT as good as Ludwig Van Beethoven. Is that shocking you? He looks awkward throughout the movie, much like an actor dressed up but standing firmly at the bar table. Most of his lines are clues rather than answers to Anna Holtz's lines (ie H. He does not listen to the actor). He is clearly an actor disguised as the character rather than the character. <br /> <br /> Really, how often does Beethoven have to roll in his grave before we get it right? Just ask yourself, would Ludwig agree?
