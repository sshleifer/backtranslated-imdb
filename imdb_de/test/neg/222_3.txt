I watched this movie today, hoping that there will be a least half-witted story. I was extremely disappointed because it was not so. The plot and the decisions of the main character were so far-fetched. I hoped for a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie, but got something totally unacceptable. In fact, I had really hoped that the "hero" would be crushed, and I had almost gone out of the theater several times, as this should have happened, which was not the case. Heist films are not feel-good films, and this one wanted to be just that. In the second half of the movie, every few minutes I found "no way". Without disclosing the whole story, it turned to an armored car patrolman, who had fallen into financial default and whose house had been put into foreclosure. He was invited to a robbery and accepted to calm down after the action began. Weak.
