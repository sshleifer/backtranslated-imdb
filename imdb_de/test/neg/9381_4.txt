Although supposedly autobiographical, this film offers very little insight into the protagonist's psychology (which leads to a shallow, fragmented characterization), as well as into larger historical processes and my hopes of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran. has remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found my feelings somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other to kill or kill the wanton victims of a bourgeois Iranian bourgeoisie whose Western cultural sympathies were patented (and whose liberation the film is quite obviously seeking) seems to understand the film, as it serves to nourish the prevailing Western popular ideologies (ie, a "crowd pleaser"). <br /> <br /> What liberated the movie from boredom was its creative animations - really minimalist images that still keep the screen rich, expressive and unique - not a small celebration for which I give it some stars.
