Dreadful in a whole new way, EVERYTHING BUT LOVE should probably be seen by movie fans - if only as a precautionary measure proving what can go wrong with a "vanity" production. I suspect a vanity production because there is no other reason on God's green earth to act as a talentless and not particularly attractive non-singer / actress like Isabel Gold - for "Lookers" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie. Her vocals leave much to be desired, and as incredible as it may be, all the other characters in the movie think she is great. Here are some moments of true charm or humor, but VERY few. Otherwise, this is a stupid, sad fiasco that changes from color to color by numbers to wrong numbers. You know what it's like when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "My child could be better than that!" Well, this is a movie your child or someone else might do better.
