The creative ideas in these films do not really bother me, but seriously. There is no coherent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend to buy the rights and then just make a film that has nothing to do with the wishes of the fans. This slaughter is almost entertaining because you know that you are hiding behind a lack of skill and control over the money (not yours) that allows you to do so. Play a game or hire someone and make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and get your butt out, claiming that this is not the case of text and I was done. had to add bla to annoy you, sorry
