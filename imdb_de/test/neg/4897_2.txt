Probably the most disgusting thing Australia has produced since Vegemite ... Predictably unpleasant comedy with Barry Humphries in a dual role as Australian diplomat Les Patterson and undercover agent Dame Edna! So many physical gags that even the Farrelly brothers would have been sick, and several rough moments, especially the effects of the terrible H.E.L.P. Virus. Only for fans of extreme toilet humor. Oh, and that's the NeverEnding Story II, NOT the "Mad Max" George Miller, who directed ... * Â½ <br /> <br />
