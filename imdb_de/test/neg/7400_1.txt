What a bloody nuisance! With television budgets and an intelligent director who can not tell the difference between a Lanc I, II and III, such issues are not possible. All the stupid stereotypes are fine; At the character level and on the human level, the story is so clever and unbelievable that it hurts. And all those responsible can be enthusiastic about the brilliant ratings. Technical details: garbage. Lancs flying near that would have thrown each other out of the sky in a dozen. Single-engine night fighters attacking the line behind: ridiculous. As I said, a director I bet he did not even hear the name Lancaster before this project, and some young 3D guys making Lanc's Waddling ducks. But these are little things compared to the mediocrity of this film. Although it may be too hard, I dare say that it hurts the memory of those who died on both sides. TV crap, entertain the stupid masses who do not care anyway. Shame on those responsible. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you made from it.
