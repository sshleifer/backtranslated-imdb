I knew it would be awful, but not so terrible !!, it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, and it's not a damn thing! All characters are boring and the story is stupid and incredibly boring, plus The end is especially lame! The only reason I leased this piece of crap because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, but he's wasted and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion! And I screamed loudly when the movie was over. It's as if the movie had no plot and it was not about anything, and Ice-T is terrible to God (though he's okay with some things), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar had no chemistry at all. There is a scene where the director has tried to get emotional, but he fails miserably because Yvette Nipar did not really show much emotion. However, there is a decent car-tracking scene. and the dialogue is cruel. Avoid this movie like the plague, no damn thing will happen. Please avoid and trust me in this movie, which you can thank later. The direction is terrible! Fred Olen Ray does a terrible job here, with inferior camerawork, ridiculous looking set pieces, terrible angles, ridiculous use of stock footage, and an incredibly boring movie. Acting is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is not far from his usual amazing self, he looks extremely bored and shows no emotion. His character is also extremely boring, as I can not believe he signed for this piece of rubbish, he also had no chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff is still in charge !!!). Ice-T has little to do and looks bored, and he has not convinced me a bit. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he had a slightly shaky character, I did not like him. Yvette Nipar is pretty, but here she was really terrible, she did not show much emotion and had no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I did not look at her character! Art Hindle (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh) and the rest of the cast are also bad. All in all, please do not be like the plague! Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB of 5
