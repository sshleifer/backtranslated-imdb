So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but on the other hand, there are not many. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe I'm the only one). Apparently Boll has already acquired the rights for Far Cry before the game is completed. <br /> <br /> People who have enjoyed slaughtering mercenaries and infiltrating secret research labs on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry jewelery. Loneliness on the Set Mr. Boll charges three his compatriots to play. These players are called Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. Three names that made her pretty big in the movie business. The story goes this way: Jack Carver, played by Til Schweiger (yes, Carver is German, the sausage eats the guys !!) However, I think that Tils is acting in this film. People have complained that he does not really stay in the spirit of Carver, but we only saw Carver from an ego perspective, so we do not really know what he looked like when he stepped into a **. <br /> <br /> However, the story in this matter movie is beyond dementia. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Warrior played by Udo Kier and doing so called genetically modified soldiers or GMS. Doing his top secret research on an island that for some reason reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver. That's right, there are no palm trees here. Instead, we got beautiful lumberjacks. We did not even go far before starting CRY (mehehe) I can not go on. If you want to be loyal to Bolls shenanigans, then watch this movie. You will not be disappointed most of it will be shit. <br /> <br /> There are a few noteworthy things that suggest that Boll did some good work in some areas of the movie, such as some nice boat and fight scenes. Until the whole Cromed / Albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything makes me laugh .. The movie Far Cry smells like shit (that's a nonsense for you Simpleton's) from a Fa, if you want to do a wiff you get a lot annoying buddy who wants to shoot you in the first three minutes when he appears on the screen
