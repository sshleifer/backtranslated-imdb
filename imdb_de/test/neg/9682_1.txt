This replay of "Noah's Ark" has cut back the reputation of Hallmark (and Turner) about 100 years ago. However, the production has its bright side ... a learning experience for newbie movie entrepreneurs in "How To Make No Film" <br /> <br /> Where in the annals of biblical literature and in common sense are these quotes and situations : <br /> <br /> "Ok, guys, let's saddle up." "It's too bad that God created the sun to only shine on the day when we really needed it at night." "We do not kiss ... we just whisper in the mouth of the others." Wood for the construction of the Ark of the Covenant with the imprint "Georgia Pacific". Metal nails. Children fly kites. A peddler (how can James Coburn sleep after) selling Chinese hats. Pirates attack a wooden ark that they wanted to catch, with burning tar balls shot from catapults. Glass Bottles Wine (Noah was in a constant state of inibriation.) It was a miracle that he could see the ark without building it.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blond wig running around the ark on a white horse ... still rated with G) Defense of biblical pirates with an iron pan (lined with teflon?). Landing on Mount Ararat after crossing the Strait of Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... You must see them in order not to believe them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This film may not be missing. However, if you want the full TV version, you must call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree to relieve NBC of any responsibility for having ever aired the thing. In the video stores there is only the rejected version (no pirates, etc.), ie the video stores that dare to guide them. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
