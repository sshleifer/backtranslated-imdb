Let me first say: If you have not enjoyed a Van Damme movie since blood sports, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these films may not have the best acts or the best actors, but I like these kinds of movies the way they are. This movie is much better than any other movie the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought in recent years. Van Damme is good at the movie, the movie is only worth it for Van Damme fans. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I can recommend to anyone who likes Van Damme) or In Hell. It feels just like Nowhere to Run. Have fun!
