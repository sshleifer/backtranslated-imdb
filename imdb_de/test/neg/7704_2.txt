This movie plays like a denied episode of "Where Are You Now" or "Behind The Music" by VH1. Abbie Hoffman is in the first half of the film (which represents his "glory days") unintentionally presented as a kind of mad rock star. You know the kind; the Poseurs√§nger, the handsome boy who has not written music, has no idea, but gets all the fame and chicks in vain. Consequently, he takes his success for granted, abuses it and eventually destroys it with himself. Hoffmann's glorious days ended abruptly when he was abandoned for cocaine trafficking, skipping the bail and hiding. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film deals with the time he hides. In it we see Hoffman as a miserable crybaby who blames everyone, everyone but himself, for his downfall. At some point, times pass him by; and he can never deal with it. How sad. THE END. Guiding roller and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman finally committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for Hoffman to make this film. Considering the fact that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I was sure that the film was meant as a kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the 1960s and the anti-war movement of the left. They have failed miserably. The film depicts Abbie Hoffman as a thoughtless cartoon. We never know what drives him. How did he come to his views? How did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did he organize such a tremendous movement? Why did he engage in the cocaine trade at the height of his fame? Why? Who knows, and the filmmakers do not seem to be, who cares?
