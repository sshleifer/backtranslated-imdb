Norris plays a policeman from Chicago who encounters a devil's apprentice? who wants, well, Armegeddon create. At some point, he kills the creature, picks it up and throws a massive, 24-inch, not very sharp, about twenty-foot-long spike, which is hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? That's the rest of the movie. A lot of it is CN and his buddy who drives cars and talks nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) child is there alleged to humanize CN. OK. Does not work, makes no sense and brings the plot, a so-called, not one piece before. Also, not all police officers from the country are invited to be interviewed by other police officers. It is ridiculous as a premise. The whole thing is bad. Unfortunately it is not so bad to be entertaining or combative. Only bad. But you can see Norris trying to find his way into the successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
