Hellraiser: Bloodline has to receive a kind of praise. It is actually full moon. She carries all traces of her "Demonic Toys" or "Puppet Master" series, without her stupid, uh, charm? Full moon can get away with silly products because they know it's silly. These hellraiser things, man, are they ever taking seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I've seen) made the low budgets even balance by style. Now it's just like that.
