I had the misfortune to see this last night on the BBC. I think maybe I was the only spectator. From the beginning, the film was not right, after a few minutes I was able to find out what it was. The movie was bad! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal movie, just old-fashioned bad. <br /> <br /> Why did it turn into a movie? I've seen a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was alright, but I only saw it repeats because they did that and in the end I was not the wiser one. At some point I seem to remember a character, perhaps Farina notes that the Mod Squad gets into places that ordinary policemen can not. The "place" turns out to be a "club", one of the hardest places to find one, maybe it was student night? I lost track of the plot at this point, or maybe there was no plot, and the movie was simply made up of various remnants of other TV series. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I can not remember a laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie lacked the scene where someone like Seymour Hoffman stole power. With him Ribisi would have had someone to jump off.
