It's hard to criticize a movie titled "Deathbed: The Bed That Eats" and it's a ghost narrator trapped behind a 2-way painting painted by him and a bed that snores and ?? if I'm not mistaken, he masturbates. (Well, that's back with his human companions!) Also, it foams (for some reason in orange) to pick up edible food on its surface, including apples, wine, roast chicken and, of course, humans. Again, is it enough to say that you do not expect too much when you see what stomach acid is? the last remnant of everything that takes orange foam? only dissolve certain things. It will drink the wine, but the bottle is okay and it will eat on the chicken bone, but the bucket is fine. The bed will replace even the unused containers. Hilarious, eventually beat down Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh about it. I do not think they really wanted you to take this seriously. The budget is low and it is very easy to see where they save costs and save a lot of money. I thought that in a world where there could be a killer "lift" and a "blood beach" it might be amusing to watch this "deathbed". For reasons that may be costly, 90% of the movie is in conversation, no one is shouting or showing very faint signs of anxiety / confusion about why a bed would attack (I can imagine one, and I've never been one of them Children who have jumped on the bed), and you must put your disbelief down forever. (A victim loses all flesh on his hands and hardly says "ow"). Only one scene that took too long was extremely tense. A woman tries to crawl and is only pulled back with a leaf. Where are the MST3k guys?
