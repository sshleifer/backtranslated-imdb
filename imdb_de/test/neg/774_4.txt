That could have been better, but it was alright ... it helped me escape my boredom. I did not even want to see it, the only reason I wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is an actor, but he is brilliant and the highlight of the movie. The end was so terrible and the acting was good for a movie. I give him a 4 out of 10 points
