This movie was incredibly stupid and meant whatever. I was bad for all the actors and actresses who ruined their careers to be in that stupid movie. The entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could do it to do as little as it did, which made it even more stupid. Even some names were unrealistic. The movie is fun, which is why he had 2 out of 10 stars. This is probably the 3rd dumbest movie ever made. I was really made, after realizing that there were mainly adult actors, but in a children's movie. The worst was Danny Trejo, a horror movie actor who's always dirty. The other actors were pretty clean for me.
