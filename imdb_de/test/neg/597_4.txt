I rated this movie four stars for several reasons. At first I had the feeling that this movie definitely preached and I hate that. Nevertheless it is my own fault that I even saw a Christian movie. <br /> <br /> My boyfriend and I rented this movie because it sounds interesting. The back of the case said something in the direction of a spiritual struggle. Someone who opens a kind of border that lets demons into our world and the like. Something that interests me very much. This movie almost reached the goal. It was more like being at the edge of the target, more like the tree than the target itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this film is that two couples are kidnapped by a group of terrorists to become victims experiments. However, since their experimental serum comes from the research of a scientist who claimed to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, the couples' men can now feel, smell, hear and see the demons in the spirit world. In this order. Apparently, the sense of taste in this area does not exist. <br /> <br /> This movie is very clich√©. They took the title seriously, as the men, while chained to the beds, demanded that their wives look behind them because there was something there that was made so much better. The demon scratching at the woman was funny in one word. The woman was hellishly disgusting and everyone in the room was cheering when she died. We all hoped that she would be beaten by the other woman with the chair. <br /> <br /> The message is one I do not want to comment on, apart from the Christian filmmakers I have found a better medium for it. <br /> <br /> And so I give him four stars, because it's not the film's fault. I am not a Christian and do not like to make comments of this kind. My friend and I, who watched this movie, seemed like a MST3K episode.
