Down in the Movie Gallery, I saw a streak I just had to see. It looked like a fun, cheap horror / action / western I could get into. Yes, I knew it would fuck, but I still rented it and hoped for a laugh. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It starts with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest protagonist in film history. He looks like he could accept Chuck Norris, but he can not. His dialogue is also shit. Anyway, he goes to a village and shoots some zombies. You could say that they tried to make this longer by using those boring scenes where it takes him 3-5 minutes to load or watch a few zombies. At least the zombies look cool. In any case, some people are shot, some zombies die, and in the end, all are dead, except for our main character, who was supposed to die when he was shot down by four people.
