Please do not see this. I laughed several times in this movie, but all were due to an unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played again Pacino and was annoying most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem to be composed of 20 other bad movies of a really bad editor. There is no continuity and I was wondering why I had not spent 15 minutes in this matter. I would suggest never to watch a movie by D.J. Caruso. That was really terrible.
