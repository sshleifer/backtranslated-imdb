When it comes to an art and essay film, there is not enough art, not to mention the essay. If it's a thriller, there are not enough thrillers. If it is a teenage drama, there is not enough drama, and for teens there is not enough NOFX and too much Nino Rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie. But there is no Tony Hawk. I think I was cheated. It's not Tony Hawk biopic. If it's an action movie, explosions are missing, which would have sparked interest, or at least the sleepers would have had to jump into their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. When it comes to a movie, there is not enough action. If it is not a movie, it takes too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, it's an album I will not buy
