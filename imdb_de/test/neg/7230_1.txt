Oh wow, the character shares my first name with first name! Nick! This movie is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, at least there is a real octopus in this movie. A real octopus who has a better performance in this movie. Better, I mean, "longer" acting is pretty dry and it's hard to get away with it. Just to let you know when this ninety-minute movie ends, not only are you freed from your couch, but you also have the ability to breathe again. Not only that, you realize how stupid you are, and then commit suicide by realizing how horrible life is after seeing this movie. Really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more crap like this is being realized and where the hell were the real masters of horror lately? This movie should have been the last straw so we can bring back cinema-obsessed geniuses in horror cinema who could make some really GOOD modern horror movies that movie bites.
