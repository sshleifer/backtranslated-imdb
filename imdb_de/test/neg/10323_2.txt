Wait until you have seen most of the other films ever released. Wait a year and look at it when you're ready for something with such low production levels that it does not put everyone's imagination in doubt. <br /> <br /> I agree that anyone who rates this movie as a ten-star production must do so to distort the data. Everything over 8 would be strange. <br /> <br /> Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her gossamer hair, though she exaggerated the New York accent, but at other times NC's accent crept through. Old story for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section containing only Sandra's biographical material from IMDb. There was also a quiz quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. I hope you get everything right!
