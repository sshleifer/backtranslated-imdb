Sappy. <br /> <br /> I liked how they went to "Haaavaad baaa" to quote each other books to impress the ugliest girl there. <br /> <br /> Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too, but is waiting to land this big construction job. <br /> <br /> Just because you hold your nose to the grindstone is no reason to cut a steak with it. "Do you like apples?" <br /> <br /> the guy nods or something. <br /> <br /> "Well, how do you like it, THE APPLES?" Wow, that's a genius. <br/> <br/> Duh, Minnie Driver would give everyone the number. Robin Williams can not paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf. And there is a professor who always wears a baseless priest's scarf.
