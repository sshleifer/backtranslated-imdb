Let me say that this new He-Man cartoon does not destroy childhood memories because I did not like the old He-Man cartoon either. I loved the action characters, but I found the cartoon crazy and hated the story (the He-Man I liked was the one from the early mini-comics that were included in the character boxes before the comic series, in which was He-Man.) was a barbarian, the Sword of Power split in two, and there was no Prince Adam, no premise for Shazam rip off and no orko. Anyway, we leave the old stuff alone. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man cartoon (or at least that pilot) is a shame in itself, representing both the worst cheese of the old show and the worst of today's trends. I saw it because I had heard that the in-your-face morale of the old show was (fortunately) over, and it had more sword fighting and character development. But I encountered a terrible mish-mash of the genre's worst clichés, characters that I could not help but hate, and the unfortunately inevitable matrix-like visual style. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give a bit of background to the characters, as they showed a skeletor in front of the face peeling, but so far is the character development going, apart from the usual fumble that I have in see the following episodes where this is the case Teenybopper Adam will learn the responsibility of his newly acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old show Adam was no spoiled brat! I hated his guts. That's what we get when they put on an adventure show for the pre-teens: pretty faces and funny clothes that should look cool. I should look in new episodes, if N'Sync has a special appearance. Man, this show reminds me of the 1996 Flash Gordon Stinkbomb cartoon! <br /> <br /> dialogue? Ha! It follows absolutely every cliché in the book, from the Goody-Lil-Two-Shoes Randor in the opening scene to Skeletor's immortal "Oh, and he-man ... I lied!" at the end. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high pitch as in the old series. 20 years and nothing we have learned. <br /> <br /> And sure, there can not be anything remotely actionable today that is not matrix-style. Leave the Japanese anime, think of fresh ideas. And seeing the characters' poses during combat did not help either. <br /> <br /> Of course we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I'm thinking of who the hell he's got names for?) now has no yellow skin, but gray-ish. Oh, so no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu will not appear on the show either. Shades of the FG 1996, where Ming the Merciless was a green, toad-like alien! <br /> <br /> People complain about Cringer's lack of language. I do not think I would have liked that more or less if Cringer had spoken, he is so stupid enough. And with Orko you have your extra ration of cheese! The shocking thing is that probably many of the people who hated Jar Jar Binks (rightly so) could be huge Orko fans. <br /> <br /> I saw the longtime pilot and I have enough. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.
