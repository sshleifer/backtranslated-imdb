I have always been a fan of Chuck Norris for his performances and films. I wanted to watch this movie for a while, but for some reason I had no chance. Apparently I did not miss much. This must be one of Chuck's worst movies. This trucker, Billy Dawes (Augenstein), has a chance to make his delivery, but is diverted to a water town where he is arrested by a stupid local corrupt judge, Trimmings (Murdock), who runs the entire city and false allegations made against him. He denies the allegations and runs away. The local police beat him and he disappears. But now his brother JD John Dawes (Norris), another trucker, is looking for him. He quickly realizes that the city is run by the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. Not long after, he begins beating up almost everyone in the city. In the meantime, the film girl is calling local truckers with a CB radio, and everyone's running into the city to tear it down. LOL with big rigs. Finally, Norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. It actually starts out well and you feel great when Norris starts smashing some of these corrupt local cops because there are such losers. But there's almost no story, acting is bad and the end. The judge rammed his house from a big rig and you never know what will happen. He lives? Norris can not even throw him in the bin. In the meantime, Norris picks up a bat cop at the end. Who cares? Norris can also stand up to anyone in town, his hand is broken and shot in the side and continues to fight. Come on! This movie was apparently made to take advantage of the CB enthusiasm of the time, which is why there was one that is above me. They even use the CBs in the movie. In addition, the movie seems to stretch in the end and you wonder why it is not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you get bored and need something to watch, time goes by. As for Norris, he made much better movies. 3 out of 10.
