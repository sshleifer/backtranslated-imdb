There are good movies, and there are bad movies, and then there is Moscow Zero, a movie that is so bad that it spends a month alone with an insurance salesman, an attractive entertainment alternative. <br /> <br /> With an unintelligible plot Over the Gates of Hell, opening in a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a jumble of repetitive and nonsensical shots of a little girl running through tunnels, red ones Lights float and strange wall shadows, which do not arouse anxiety or tension, but instead solve the reaction "this is the point with the girl (or lights)" from the audience. <br /> <br /> Directed by María Lidón, for reasons that I can only disgrace was The movie stars Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow looking for Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) , a friend and colleague who disappeared in the tunnels. He asks for the help of a number of natives, all of whom, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are portrayed by Spanish actors and try with little success to influence Russian accents. On the way they intersect with members of some sort of underground leather-coated religious mafia, led by a savvy Val Kilmer whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he appeared in such filth, and the henchman Sage Stallone (Slys Son), who seems to be kneaded Only the name Stallone can be included in the marquee of the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the troop tries to navigate through the tunnels with the help of a funny drawn map, following repetitive shots of them or exposing them to a pale face, that does not go much further. The dialogue routinely switches between English and Russian, with actors often taking turns in each language. Whole conversations are halfway talked into one and the other half, for the sole reason that they feel the viewer is getting a frustrating dimension and trying to figure out the crazy ragged story. <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that makes Moscow Zero right is the title, which could only have provided a more accurate description of this movie, if it were the word Moscow had been left out.
