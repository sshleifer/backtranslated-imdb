Rarely have I seen such a badly translated on the screen literature. The hysterical cast of B-movie and sitcom extras just make the characters look like bad Jewish stereotypes. The worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from the first scene and never get sympathy for it. Performances like these should be respected and used against actors who want to work again. All in all, a rundown, budget-priced TV movie that gives television movies a bad name.
