Unfortunately, this film had potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. I do not think I have ever seen a movie where every scene goes flat with a loud noise, like this one. I also do not think I have ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that did not bring at least a laugh, but this maelstrom of pain brought nothing but groaning and misery. The last time I was so amazed at how funny a comedy can be was the horrible "Big Momma's House". Scene by scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly. Stupid and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here stupid and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer. An absolute blast.
