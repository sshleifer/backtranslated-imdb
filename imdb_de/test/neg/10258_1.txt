This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. it makes Plan 9 from outer space wonderful. The acting is made of wood, the plot is stupid and the SFX does not exist. The only good thing is that it's not a long movie. The landscape is sometimes pretty pretty, provided you like trees, if that helps you!
