This movie starts off great and tears you down. Most of the acting is good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang - everyone else sounds British - even the Muslims) - and proves that he can not act. With this you can live until the first fight scene where everyone collapses. Why is Patrick Swayze battling bad guys with an ax when he puts his sword in the ground five minutes ago? <br/> <br /> A few minutes later, the swords continue to be misplaced over. Other reviewers mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not care about the fight scenes, the CGI Dragon was weak, but the story was the biggest one.
