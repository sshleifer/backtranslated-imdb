If this movie had been in English, all the critics would have devastated it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are terribly directed and it is not funny at all. After the movie, I thought this movie might have been written by an eighth student, at least considering the lack of credible characters and fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, even with dogs ...) The story is just nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av Glas, which had its premiere almost at the same time. Of course, the public has chosen Jalla! Jalla! While Vingar av glas received little attention. <br /> <br /> What really bothered me was the fact that the movie looked really bad. This was probably because director Joseph Fares used really cheap camera equipment for the first time and then decided to just play around with it, for fun, I think. The result, however, is a film that can easily be divided into 12 short films with a new directional style in each one of them. That was very frustrating. Perhaps Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films, as this is the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together. In the middle of the movie, the story has to progress very quickly several times, and the characters then meet in a way that's just too incredible. <br /> <br /> And then I did not mention the 2-dimensional characters, especially those in the supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Although I consider this one of the worst Swedish movies of the 90s and the most overrated, it is somehow understandable that the audience liked it. I mean, the bad taste has always been the hallmark of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I'm rather surprised that the critics enjoyed it. You should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
