Terrible "comedy" in which a beautiful, crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "funny" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a killer (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What happens to the comedy? The year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies of all time (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcat, etc.). This is one of the worst. There is not a single, repeated, not a funny moment. The jokes are either stupid, listless, dirty or really sick. There is also a strong hatred for women in this garbage - the only female protagonist (Tyler) is constantly being used as a sex object. In the end, extreme, bloody violence is used. The only bearable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychos. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser have reached an all-time low - the only way they have to go is the way up. And poor Tyler! She stopped making smart, brave independent films for THIS? And DOUGLAS ???? What was he like when he agreed? An absolute crap - absolutely to avoid !!!!!!!!!!
