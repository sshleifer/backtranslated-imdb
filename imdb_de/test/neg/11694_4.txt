From the encouragement it received, I expected more from a Korean horror if it were to be seen in the same caliber as A Tale of Two Sisters, as stated in other reviews. This movie is not in the same caliber, except in the budget for special effects. Think of Amytiville horror. With a tree and sparse dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you have a movie with limited dialogue, the plot and the characters have to wear the movie. This movie could have been told pretty well in a 30 minute short film concept, for two hours, with a lot of trees and horror scenes that not only do not scare you, but distract you in a kind of "what to ..." does not do any good Horror movie. <br /> <br /> The people who claim that this film gives them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks if decent horror movies are included.
