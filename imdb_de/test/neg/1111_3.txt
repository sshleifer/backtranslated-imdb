The concept of this film is quite convincing: zombie children get out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their death in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. Cool. The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity in dealing with the zombies. The makers could have spiced up this movie with some terrorist images like "The Ring" like stop-action, back-camera-walking or something similar. When the zombie kids walk through the woods, they look like a bunch of nine-year-olds going to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of picks and shovels, they could easily carry baseball bats and gloves. Why should I fear these little children? Everyone could walk safely in a straight line. Who would have spent a night with their children in this creepy, rundown house? The moment I opened the front door and looked around, I would have said, "Mm-hmmmmmmmmm son, get on the car, I'll go back and piss on a bush, and then we'll be out of here. "A totally incredible movie. Do not waste your time.
