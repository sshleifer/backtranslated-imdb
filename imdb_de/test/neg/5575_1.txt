This must be the BAD Train I've ever seen !!!!! It was not just boring, it was "dumb with a spoon". Where did you find the actors ... on a street corner? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God's sake I could have done a better movie with my CELL PHONE. And if that was not bad enough, there were even extras at the end of the movie so we could see how stupid the actors are in real life. Whoever made the make-up for the aliens ... must have spent $ 5 and called a day at your local costume shop. And who wrote down the film description on the back of the DVD case all over the world, should be rotated. PUHLEEZ !! It is not even 1/8 of what is described. This description only serves to get people to buy, rent or pay for a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer ... you would have expelled them all !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) < br /> <br /> Time watching this movie .... total garbage! (I should sue you for my time.)
