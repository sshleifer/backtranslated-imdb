This movie was very disappointing because some elements of the book were done wrong. The main story is the same, but there are several flaws that hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles is injured at the beginning of the story in a preseason game at Texas Tech. That means he did not do anything during the season, and Chris Comer is on the team earlier. <br /> <br /> 2) The game against Marshall was lost in Marshall. The team portrayed as Marshall was actually Midland High, one of Permian's main competitors, and here's proof that Marshall High is the Mavericks in the colors Scarlet and Silver. Look at the jerseys and you'll see who it is. Even the football squad of Marshall High is overwhelmingly black. The shown team was racially mixed like Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Permian loses Midland Lee by one point in the district game. Midland Lee lost to Midland High and Midland High to Permian. These are the teams that set up the coin toss as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie joins the team as a reserve for Chris Comer and after finding no play time in the Midland Lee game, he finishes the game completely at halftime and never stands on the sidelines or retires to any games. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a tight end and a defensive end. He wore # 85, no tight end and strong security. In addition, Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) The coaches like Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie, because he has a better ethic and plays more direct, as the employees prefer him , That's why Boobie leaves the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter will be played in Austin at the Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium, where UT plays in the state's semi-final and not in the state final. Carter wins the state title, but has to give up because of an unqualified player. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, but if you read the book, you will find that these mistakes are quite accurate. I am also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites complaining about the portrayal of Dallas Carter's football team. The team is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the movie shows, according to the book. People say it's a racist view, but when you read the book, you see a real representation of the team. The story is very different, so this movie has reached 3.5 / 10.
