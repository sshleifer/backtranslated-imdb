STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker trying to get through his job and as a Good father for his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother (Maxine Peake). After a confrontation with said daughters, who are present in a workers' club, he uses a trip to their dance class A look at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his gang of hard men who train there in the boxing gym and become a harder, more self-confident Training person. After a short time, he took the philosophies of Louis to heart and joined him as a nightclub pianist as the 80s disco chunk breaks in ... but when Sparky (Scott Williams) collaborates to play a secondary role in drug trafficking, everything becomes pear-shaped , <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once stated in the film A Bronx Tale, "There is no greater tragedy than wasted talent." The author of Clubbed had a good idea and a talent to turn him into a kind of movie ... but without the ability to put everything into a coherent film, it does not seem possible. <br /> <br /> As Brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the end of the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) were pretty easy and fun to spot ... but the somber look of the Cinematography is really a downer. Some really bad actors, for example lead actor Raido with an unintelligible accent that's everywhere, and a pounding script with some misfiring dialogues are bigger issues for the movie. More established actors like Peake and even Neil Morressey's favorite player are rejected by side effects, while Raido and Ronnie Fox's catastrophic villain take center stage. Williams makes the Sick Boy of a Poor Man Trainspot-like, and seems to make Salmon and Shaun Parkes the only performers who consider the whole thing as having integrity, given the excessive, blood-spattered violence (which becomes a common trend for Brit flicks) takes over. Really a missed opportunity. **
