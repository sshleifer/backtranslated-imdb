"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy in the style of the 80s with more than an eye full of sex during the entire 101 minutes of its duration. The plot involves two men in crisis, one of whom is in crisis is sorted by his divorce, the other deals with the possibility of the same perspective. Both good friends, they choose a holiday in the exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter by her side. Complications occur when one of them comes into contact with the other's daughter. This potential uproar of a story is pretty funny, and there are some good lines that never really get weird how it could have been. Any attempt to treat the moral issue seriously does not work either, and perhaps director Donen should have stuck to the humor of the situation. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, but what really ruins Michelle Johnson is terrible performance as the naughty little temptress Jennifer. As she takes full advantage of her body, it is the only thing she has. Michelle's acting leaves much to be desired. No wonder we have not seen her otherwise. Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
