Impressive! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the most profound thought I have taken after seeing the rather oppressive George And The Dragon. For a fantasy comedy, the story was very boring and the impact unspectacular. <br /> <br /> The problem was not acting. James Purefoy is a good knight and his various side steps are not bad characters. I even thought Patrick Swayze was a pretty good idea in that role as well. Flat Piper Perabo also had good potential. I even liked the child. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens and the way it happened was "eh". Not interesting. Compared to another fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually funny, this movie comes awfully short. I'm sorry for the decent actors involved in that yawning stupidity. 4 out of 10 points.
