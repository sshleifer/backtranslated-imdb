Want a good recipe for failure? Take a fucking, left-wing political conspiracy, add weak and completely undeveloped characters, and then take the worst sequences a movie has ever known. Leave it to stew for a week (the time you've probably spent doing this junk). <br /> <br /> The result is "Steal This Movie", a cinematic experience that brings bad movies into dangerous and exotic, previously unknown areas. <br /> <br /> This film has chunks in it throughout its lifetime my face was blown. Words can not convey how painful it was to watch. This is not a bad movie where you and your friends can sit around making fun of each other. This is not "Plan 9 from space". This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. "Steal This Movie" is the biggest energy and talent waste I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people * actually * have taken the time to act in this coach, if you can call them "acting". But on the other hand, if you have a bad direction, bad writing, bad ALL - "actors" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a huge, disgusting bastard, after which you want to quickly rinse yourself out of fear of the existence of a friend or loved one. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this movie so it does not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for your respect for every other movie I have ever seen. They showed me what's really terrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are just crappy and / or boring.
