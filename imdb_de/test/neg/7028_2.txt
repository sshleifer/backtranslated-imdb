This movie could have been a lot better if it had not been for a Disney movie. I thought the young girl Shirley was playing was fine, you could say that she was really trying to get the job done right. Teenage boy Shirley Temple was not right at all. I think they should have spent their childhood last, the first lesson should have been about the young Shirley, then the last hour should have been the older Shirley. This was a boring movie and not a good Shirley Temple story.
