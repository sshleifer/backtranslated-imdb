Why watch this movie? It's probably an award for the worst career move of a major movie star since Clark Gables played Irish patriot in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It's unimaginable that Bergman would choose this film as well as his director over a movie lucrative career in Hollywood, where she could vote among the best scripts and directors offered at that time. At first, there was no script that could be used except for a few notes. Then we should believe the polished Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to get out of a refugee camp, including marrying a poor Italian fisherman she does not even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the first choice for this part. If so, that made much more sense than bringing the shining Bergman into such a proletarian part. However, since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window. <br /> <br /> So she goes to this poor village where the men have to strive to live a lean life out of the sea. A place she obviously does not hate and does not like. <br /> <br /> Her only friend is the village priest, who knows that she is not fit for the life of a poor fisherman, but tell her. For love's sake she has to repress her true feelings of disgust and poverty Accept the desperation she faces every day. In addition, this volcano is always facing the eruption and drowning in hot lava. But like a real heroine, Bergman defies her misery by declaring war on almost everything else in this grim movie. She even goes so far as to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would cause laughter if it were not so miserable. Since her husband's poor slut needs to lock her up in a room to keep her from running away, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her away from the island. No sacrifice is too great for them; No man is aloof if he is ready to help her escape the island and her misery. I will not tell you how it all ends. The end of the movie without a script is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (seen from TV on Late Night TV) that it had two different ends! So be warned if you feel brave enough to sit through this big turkey and catch the Miscast Bergman. For seven years she collapsed in Hollywood and she was convicted of sleeping with her director while she was still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the films she shot with this director (whom she later married) is remarkable, except as evidence of insanity. That's no joke. It's pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
