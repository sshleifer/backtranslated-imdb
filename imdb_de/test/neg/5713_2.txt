What's up with this movie? Do Mr. Lyne and his authors think that a sado-masochistic move between two twisted yuppies can make a feature film? Maybe if it had some comedic elements (at least deliberately not), or if there were additional dramatic elements (that are not there), or if it's hardcore. No, it's just the story of the matter; a chronology of a series of R-Rated Trysts. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine Â½ Weeks" deserves every Razzie nomination. It is a loser. <br /> <br /> And what about Roger Ebert and his enthusiastic review? Where was his head back in 1986?
