I can not believe that there are people who voted 10 for this rubbish! Did any of you get access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtedly being held, or is there a special colony that secretly holds in particular blatant people of whom I know nothing? <br /> <br /> If it were me To say what I really think about this movie, none of it would be published. <br /> <br /> First of all, to start with his "star" is not an idiot who behaves like a bad impersonator of Jim Carrey who has stung enough angels dust his nose up to the Sahara desert again conquer. His name will be an absolute guarantee that I will not see a future movie with him in it - even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> As with the 'conspiracy'. Another crime that we can attribute to the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they could be considered "bad guys" in that form. mere criminals and killers would have the audience on their side in no time. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this movie - Stop making movies, and if not, then limit yourself to ads where your efforts are. At least you have the advantage in the Duration to be fleeting. <br /> <br /> Last but not least a criticism of IMDB - Why do not you have the opportunity to vote for a film with "zero"? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this threesome, I would have to choose a double zero or something else.
