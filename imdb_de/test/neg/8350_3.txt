Although this film (and I use the term loose) was made in 1997, we have just seen it for the first time today. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie we had never heard about made him worried. I still watched cheerfully, sure that if Jones was in the movie, it should be worth at least two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our coveted actors for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, another familiar face calmed me down. The list of accomplished actors grew steadily, so I was able to endure more and more of this film and was sure that if I enforced enough clich√©s and banal social statements, I would appear victorious on the other side of the plot. Unfortunately, there was no conspiracy. It seemed as though it were being burned by the lava's sinking lava. The characters were as thin as paper. The plot was so full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie. Was the fee for a short consultation with a science teacher too high for the budget of this film? No acid rain ... no poisonous gases (like sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no deadly ashes ... no skin heat only a few meters from the lava. Wow ... it's the friendliest lava in the world! <br /> <br /> The events were no better than the characters. Every incident was so elaborate and far-fetched ... it's like the writers say, "Okay, we have to get rid of the little girl NOW" ... and puff, she's sprayed with a lava bomb that burns her like that that she has to get to safety (not from the lava, but from her own helpless stupor) ... but only a few moments later in the car she has no obvious pain and soon after she runs effortlessly through the (groan!) Building that (oh no!) Is being blown up. After you've endured all that, your reward is the little boy's line at the end (about all the people who look the same) ... which must be one of the worst movie series I've ever heard. Even though it was not written so painfully, it was a ridiculous time for all involved characters. Child and policeman aside, as if the mother was still in the area and just needs to be told because she just does not talk ... what ... she hopes to sneak into the shadows and get away from the police little brat once and for all? Obviously, the child's mother would obviously be missing or dead - or shouting her head to find her toddler. <br /> <br /> The black Gangsta gangster with a secret vulnerability to the chip on his shoulder, the close-knit cracker policeman a secret patchy scene made my eyes bleed. Even if there were such Pat characters, they would not behave the way the movie portrays them under the circumstances. Something about the imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to hit people unprepared, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many snapshots like this to mention them ... really, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. These poor writers ... where are they now?
