I saw that with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal who are all great in their comedy. I really hoped that there would be a laugh. Unfortunately, I did not get that at all ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing really made me laugh in this movie. There were times when I giggled about a thing or two, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was a bad comedy and, in a sense, a bit of a Hera Pheri wannabe. <br /> <br /> Among the three main people, I think the role of Paresh Rawal was the most powerful. It was not the biggest part, but it was certainly more than Govinda or Akshay. Your performances were okay, I guess. Nothing special, only mediocre. Although Govinda Akshay stole the limelight in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta are also featured in this movie, and both were pretty bad. Lara's role did not move or make me laugh, and Tanushree Dutta's character just got on my nerves! The music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin" followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" are also worth a visit. <br /> <br /> You will either like it or not. And judging from the poor comedy and the lack of orientation, I do not think you'll do that.
