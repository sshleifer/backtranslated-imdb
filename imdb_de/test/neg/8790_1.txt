This movie was obvious and predictable. The scenes were written poorly and were even worse. After the terrible scenes followed the terrible screenplay, filled with meaningless and poorly thought-out lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who has a feeling for watching decent movies. Not only did the film have the same ideas as the Bachelor and Bachelorette show, but it also contained many parts that would tell you what the next step and the next line would be without seeing the movie before. The casting was fine, but the actors were playing terribly with more drama than they should have used, and said lines in that wanted you to change channels quickly. Please do not watch this movie.
