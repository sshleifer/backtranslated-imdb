... and boy is the deafening collision. A female telephone operator, taken by the ghost of a recently deceased ninja, stretches to her underpants, pours tomato juice on her body for her friend to lick it off, performs a seductive dance, and then sets out to kill the police killing him Ninja she owned. Just to be hunted by a one-eyed ninja master. Just like in real life, how? Only to animate Sho Kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his refusal to include his vile children in it) does one really have to see it to believe it. It's the ultimate mix of completely different genres.
