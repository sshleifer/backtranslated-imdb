After reading the novel for the first time, I do not mind filming how different it is written as long as it adheres to or at least includes the plot. For reasons known only in Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and another plot added. The reason why this novel passed the test of time is undoubtedly due to the intertwining of both the characters and the plot as a whole. To interfere with this structure is to destroy the complicated balance of the plot and thus the intensification of the narrator. Although this is a matter of opinion, the casting of this film leaves much to be desired. Characters called "fat" should at least look lighthearted to make the character believable. The days of slavery can not be over, or certainly actors of this caliber would have been in revolt, in such a travesty of history. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as male. Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance does not seem to be true. Again, Laura Fairly is called "fair," if not "ethereal," and so dark-haired does not quite match the impression she gets from the novel. .... done bad, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
