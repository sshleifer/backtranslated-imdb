This film is supposed to be three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and Bla bla. It's really just another movie about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who to sleep next. The peasants and Naxalites and the political struggles of that time serve only as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, if we do not hear the villagers say a word, the name does not have to be experienced by anyone, so they take on the same role as the "natives" in old Hollywood movies. The movie is boring as well, and history does not really get us anywhere except in different bedrooms. We should seem to admire the artfulness of the whole thing, which does not mean a good song and dance routine, which of course would not have saved the film, but at least alleviated the boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was annoyed with the immorality of the whole story, not the bedroom, but the whole futility of the story. The message seems to be that it is not worth pursuing ideals.
