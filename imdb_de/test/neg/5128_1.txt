I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out, and I'd never seen him until last night. I finally decided to look at it because I like good dancing and because the film had such a cultural influence. After watching the movie, I am amazed at how it had other effects than putting people to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty absurd if you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that this pub full of gnarly old steel workers and Teamsters could keep their clientele with the high concept dances of these girls? You would have all come to Zanzibar faster than you can say "Performance Art". Can you imagine the reaction of the real versions of this audience to this bizarre TV? You're welcome. <br /> <br /> It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman who worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer - after all, both are physically demanding jobs. But I did not buy for a second that this girl worked in a steel yard. And I did not buy for a second that I considered a real steel yard. Steel works are dangerous. They do not make your workspace look like a junkyard, and you do not lose a limb in the end. I love some of the crazy shots, as if two welders sit and weld in the large corrugated pipes. What the hell are they doing in there? Or when she cuts six inches from a rusty steel rod with a cutting torch. She was obviously on board and was just beginning to cut random things. <br /> <br /> But such story holes can be overlooked when the movie is fun or at least somehow stimulating. However, Flashdance has nothing to compensate for. <br /> <br /> Dancing is awful. It's the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined American musicals until ... well, did we really make it? The sensuality the film aspires to is ruined by Jennifer Beal's utter lack of personality. I mean, I'm a 42-year-old man and when she was supposed to eat lobster, I just thought she should get a lobster bib. <br /> <br /> You can not really leave Alex and her dreams behind because their character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more than her. <br /> <br /> The love affair is flat. It looks like nothing more than a boss waiting for one of his workers. No passion. <br /> <br /> Even the final scene, in which she dances for Orville Redenbacher and other moods, is unsatisfactory because the panel response is so incredible. Which serious dancers would not roll their eyes at Alex's lame cheerleading routine? In short, the movie only had leg warmers and big sweatshirts. Oh, yes, there is a good deal of nudity when Alex saves her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a ridiculous piece of hypocrisy). Apart from that, the movie is a waste of time. I wish the MST3K crew was still in business. That would be a good food for her.
