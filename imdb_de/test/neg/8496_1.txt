Mr. Kennedy should stop testing bad movie scripts. What did he think? This is a movie that should have failed the "hey, I have an idea, let's make a sequel" in the early stages. If there was a ZERO rating, I would forgive them, but I think I'll settle for a generous 1 from a bunch of writers and see what comes up. (Hey, I said "hit and run"!) Describe somehow how I felt when this movie was over! It's full of uncomfortable humor, weird animations and jokes that you can not take anywhere, except for confusion. If you are dragged to this movie and someone pays for you ... all right ... but it will be even more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you want to pay for your own hard-earned money, look for a better alternative.
