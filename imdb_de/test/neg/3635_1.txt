This TV show is in many ways stereotypical and far-fetched. <br /> <br /> First of all, the setting. All characters visit PCA, this incredible boarding school with painted, stylish dorms. The campus seems to have no rational rules - for example, the boys are often seen in girls' dorms and vice versa. However, this may just be because the dorm consultant, a stupid character that basically makes the viewer bored, rather than amusing them, as I assume their purpose should be, sits around and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show. <br /> <br /> Next the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not at all creative with the personalities of this show. They all represent a feature that is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is supposed to be perfect in everything she does (appearance, class, sport, guys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is the ridicule, Logan is the arrogant idiot, which basically does not do anything Besides aggravating all the characters and us poor viewers, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but bluntly claims that Dana was the tough girl. Quinn is the unrealistic "smart kid" they're always making fun of Chase is the guy who's afraid of confessing his "true feelings," which really makes me worse over the show, and that the new girl - Lola or something else - just another clone of Nicole's. <br /> <br /> The two most important characters that make me worse the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I do not understand the character of Zoey. It was obviously created as a "perfect character," as I said above, but it seems to be the most flawed of all - in most episodes it causes a problem that needs to be addressed. What is frustrating is that we should love her and think that she is amazing if she has not even created a very realistic character. Quinn bothers me because she's over the top to the point where her character is absolutely insulting. The impression Nick gives me about their character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh, criticize, mock. In the spring vacation episode that they did a year ago, they introduced two more "nerds" who had to make the characters "cool." I found that very offensive and stereotypical. What message does Nick send to these kids? Is it: Not being good at school, not getting good grades, not learning hard - you will end up being a geek and we will mock your job in future TV shows! Because that's definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters, and it's a terrible message through and through. <br /> <br /> All I can do is to hope that Nick will one day realize this by putting down the intelligent people. In our world, they do no good to anyone.
