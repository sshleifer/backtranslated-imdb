I rented this movie with my sister, hoping to see a great entertaining movie that was funny, but my expectations were disappointed. This movie was not disgusting and disgusting for a PG-13 movie. He would have to be classified as R for the many mature references that exist in this film. I would not recommend that a 13-year-old teenager see this. <br /> <br /> Even though no one under the age of 17 watches this movie, beware of a really stupid movie, there's no humor in the movie. just a few disgusting sexual allusions, including a little pedophilia, something that should not even be joked about. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to PG-13 films, which were actually safe for a 13-year-old? This is beyond a lamentable movie and should be re-evaluated.
