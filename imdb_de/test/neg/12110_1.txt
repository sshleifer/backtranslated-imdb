The director of this film is the famous French television presenter Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. It's the story of a young retarded person named "Zep" (sic). One night, he sees the sexual relationship of his sister SM and decides to do the same: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is in an asylum and his unfortunate friend is in a clinic. A man will find her. A man will reunite her. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an angel of hell. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! With overuse of stereotypes, we will see how absolute love can break all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist. We also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sebastien believe that he can do more than a century of psychiatry, he also forces us on a silly left-wing ideology; with the character of the girlfriend of the father, a boss who wants to take away the weakness of his girl. Worrying But it's very pleasant to laugh at Zep (mentally retarded persons are not funny except in this movie.)
