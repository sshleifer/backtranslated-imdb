I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commandos used to fight zombies. But they certainly did not behave as if they had seen a zombie before. How amateurs jump and turn their backs. Second, the characters are written pretty poorly. The actors did the best they could with what was given, I blame bad writing and bad governance. Last and here are the spoiler warnings highest. They lose the rehearsal twice and the girl Jennifer Holland does not know if she was bitten or not. How stupid is that? As much as it hurts to be bitten, one would think you would know, and gallons of blood leaking out of your body are a good clue. Stupid, the first movie had flaws, but he has readiness to resume, unlike this catastrophe of a movie I could barely ever get through. I give the HOUSE OF DEAD 2: NO GUTS, ALL STUPIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN
