Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's worst movie he has ever made. It is full of its usual ingredient, d. H. Fleet dialogues, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feels like a deja vu. The director is typical for Tarantino and nothing seems new. It's almost as if he's been copied from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds, to be honest, it's just a war drama that's neither funny nor brilliant as Pulp Fiction was. Basterds is allegedly tarantinos tribute to Leone's spaghetti westerns, but seems out of place, especially due to the continued use of great subtitles and balance.
