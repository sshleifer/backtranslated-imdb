After a covert mission in Bucharest to unveil an international group of arms dealers, agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is charged with protecting the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of a Romanian mafia accountant. However, the CIA's safe house is broken by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information from the agency has leaked out. Sonni relies only on his friend Michael Shepard and struggles to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> The career of Wesley Snipes is going downhill. I've just seen this streak, and it's another disappointing movie by this actor whose career is currently very similar to Steven Segal's. The film has many explosions, shots and car chases, combined with a terrible story and terrible spectacle. First, the African-American Wesley Snipes is persecuted by the Bucharest police, but they never find a black American. I've never been to Romania, but I think there are not many African Americans in this country. His character does not like bathing and wears the same clothes for many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and sexy Silvia Colloca, but she has sex freely, falls in love with him and shares her happiness with him. The boy who plays Nadia's son is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("The Detonator")
