This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but after that things fell. Until 1990, the show was not really fun anymore and it continued until the complete waste of time of today. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mild entertaining recreation of the innkeepers, this show would probably not always be in the air. I can not believe that the same creator who selected the original cast chose the band of hacks as well. How can one recognize such brilliance and then consider it appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I had to give two stars out of respect for the original cast, which has made this show so successful. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can not believe it's still in the air.
