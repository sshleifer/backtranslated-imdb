I will not tell the story of the movie as some people do. I'm pretty sure the people who read this know what the story is. I will not continue to talk about everything that is wrong with this movie because I'm here forever if I do that. The plot is typical and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie fan (as most of us are here). Small things will disturb the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you're an occasional movie watcher looking for a movie, then this movie is for you. Have fun. It would also be a good movie for a partner. Just not for us movie freaks. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
