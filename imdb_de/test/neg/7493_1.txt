After half an hour of investigating Rumors, the gay bar outside Tupelo, Mississippi, shifts to the assassination of Scotty Weaver at Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks of the interviewers. Here, however, there is a problem. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, as the movie suggests. It is not even in the same state. It is actually about three hundred miles away in the coast of Alabama. <br /> <br /> Director Malcom Ingram does not necessarily underline this fact, and he does not bother to mention that, while Bay Minette itself is little more than one. It's a broad point on the road. In fact, it's about two deep breaths away from the large Metro in Mobile, Alabama, which has a flashy gay community, some gay bars and even a Metropolitan Community Church community. If Ingram is insincere in these points, you have to ask yourself if he is also with others. <br /> <br /> As someone who was born, grew up and continues to live in Mississippi, I have to say that I find most of SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities that Ingram focuses on, are as rural, small or as isolated as he imagines, and gay bars are actually more prevalent in the state than the movie suggests. Nevertheless, Ingram ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean the absence of a gay community, thus showing a rather profound ignorance of the culture of the south, which holds those who frequent bars ... be it gay or straight - in low reputation. <br /> <br /> SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is, in my opinion, a case in which a filmmaker with a personal agenda came to his topic and then went on to film the agenda. Are gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi facing big, sometimes frightening challenges? They bet they will - but that's no excuse for playing so much with reality. The DVD contains a commentary title and some deleted scenes, but I found the feature film itself so ridiculous that I wasted no time on it. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
