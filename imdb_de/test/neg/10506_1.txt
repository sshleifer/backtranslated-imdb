I hope the people who made these films read these comments. The choreography was terrible, the plot was nil, and the actors, who manage the power rangers on such a low budget, appear to this junk with 5 stars. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes in which the actors slowly came together to perform the next move. Camera cuts and bad lighting could not cover the cheap effects. The flash was just stupid. The weapons looked like a final fantasy game, and the double bow and arrow was just boring like anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As a next movie, you should rather invest in wireless microphones script and actually try to spend some time with your stunts. <br /> <br /> Actually there are shows on TV They play every night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one. <br /> <br /> Stay on the martial arts (unless it's as poor as your acting) and quit.
