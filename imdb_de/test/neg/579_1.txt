I'm a big Robert Taylor fan and I tried to find all his films. This is one I did not have, but I recently saw it on the Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the drama was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the relationship between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was amazing how little chemistry there was between the two on screen. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: the US President would order a Navy Lt to secretly leave the service to chase bank robbers, and report only to the president that he found it difficult to learn anything else about the film Movie. The scenes on death row were completely motionless. The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing. Later she felt better in Ball of Fire, the sky.
