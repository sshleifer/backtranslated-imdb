Much can be forgiven in historical pieces that invite us to recall important historical events and spice them up with enough love interest to continue the story. BATTLE OF THE BRAVE tackles the eighteenth century struggle for control of Quebec (a whole Canada) between the British and the French, with the sidebars forming the new America. It has the makings of a full-fledged epic of fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of writer Pierre Billon (whose script earns a Razzie Award for the worst of the season) and the diffused, fuzzy and confusing direction of Jean Beaudin is this guy - one two and a half hours boring confusion of a movie. <br /> <br /> Even a cast of a good actor - Noémie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur and added the beautiful Bianca Gervais as Acoona, the venerable Gérard Depardieu as Le curé Thomas Blondeau and Irène Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in wigs), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin, and Jason Isaacs as Général James Wolfe - Does not Help Veterans Actors like these must be fomented by the raw lines used for their characters were written! Treat all the chaos in juicy music by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long movie that should be avoided. Sorry to say such bad things about a costly project, but be warned ... Grady Harp
