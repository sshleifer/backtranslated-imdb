Well, here's a zombie movie that may not even be a zombie movie. The entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future, but with this concept, the film does little. Instead, he focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get his revenge and money back from a group of other bounty hunters. What use is money, when almost the whole world has gone to hell and the cities are mostly abandoned. And why pay people money for killing zombies? As if people would not kill these dangerous menacing monsters if they are not paid. <br /> <br /> It is needless to say that the story of "The Quick and the Undead" is by no means tight. Of course it is not filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogues. <br /> <br /> Still, it's not a completely disgusting movie. It's certainly not as bad as some people would have you believe. It's a pretty good-looking movie, or rather said that the movie has at least a cheap look on it. The effects may be a bit overused, but they look pretty good, as do the make-up effects. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie was not what I had hoped for. His title might suggest that the movie plays in the wild west of the cowboys, but the title is just a misleading movie that undoubtedly decides to make money. I was looking forward to it, expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a bloody zombie horror movie. <br /> <br /> For fans of zombie movies, this movie is usually a disappointment. Of course, it does not add anything new to the genre, but it does not contain enough genre to be considered good. <br /> <br /> Not unsurpassable, but far from a recommendable <br /> <br /> 4/10
