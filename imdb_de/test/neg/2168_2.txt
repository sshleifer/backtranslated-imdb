I understand that this was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was boxing. The entire movie is over because the audio coil was garbage. The voice overs were so bad and terrible quality. As much as I love Troma, they are a bit cumbersome in the voice over work. The acting was terrible. One thing I enjoyed about this movie was the fast-paced appearance of Trey Parker, who hired the aristocrat joke with a silly wig. There are many great directors in this film, such as James Gunn and Eli Roth (Friends of Lloyd Kaufman). I think it was again Llyod's attempt to save a fucking movie and not try to lose thousands of dollars. I will not go on and on, but this movie was a mess. Take a look at other Troma titles.
