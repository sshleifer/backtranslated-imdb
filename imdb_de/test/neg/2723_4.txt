This could have been a good TV movie, but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie. As they give the viewer information about the way (will the movie progress), I wondered why she had never said or mentioned that at the beginning. Then the whole way would probably not have been necessary. When the movie ends, you understand why she filmed, and of course she is not guilty. Too bad that the producer / director used the flashbacks this way, but otherwise the movie would not have been worth it at all. <br /> <br /> Nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the evening.
