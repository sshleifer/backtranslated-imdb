This movie was absolutely and clearly awful. The storyline was so predictable and boring and the script was so hackneyed and overbearing that at the end I wanted to sting my eyes with the next pen. Usually I do not write reviews, but I was surprised at the number of positive reviews. I admit that the play was fine in some places, but the shortcomings of the script outweighed the decent spectacle. The only reason I looked at it was that some of my friends saw it and thought it was probably the worst movie ever, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed. The only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You only want in my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I do not see you wearing pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would call this movie the worst movie I have ever seen.
