I can not understand why anyone allows a subordinate director to put such a thing on celluloid. This movie has been made at least two more times that were better ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941 and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans would have been some nice skates done by professional skaters. This does not happen. The best thing the public can see for good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character lies on the ice for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and do not go for figure skating at all. There is not really much emotion shown and there is no reason to listen to this obviously made TV movie. My tip: Rent the original.
