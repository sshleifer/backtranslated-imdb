I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was charged by the host as a "world premiere" of the movie (though it seems like people have seen it here before). I have to say, I still do not know what to make of the movie. I'm not familiar with the book, I bought the ticket only two hours before and knew little about the plot. Not enough, it seems, because I had problems getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes told by Jones's character, but somehow the perspective did not suit me. And I really can not say if some of the movie's laughs were calculated or not. The cuts were abrupt and disruptive, the scenes seemed to have collapsed somehow and storytelling did not make sense immediately (even if the supernatural parts were omitted) - the actors were really good, but could not really save the movie. It was entertaining, but sometimes just in the sense that I was sitting there thinking about the technical details of filmmaking and what went wrong. I still do not know what mood the director intended to have the movie. It was a strange mixture of light, dark and supernatural. Unfortunately it did not attract me at all and I watched it more with a technical eye. But if you look at what's wrong with a movie while you look at it, that's the best sign that a movie has somehow failed. I would definitely have expected something different with these actors ... too bad!
