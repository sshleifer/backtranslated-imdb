I can not really see how anyone can be interested in watching this movie. A woman meets a man, he wants to play games, she too, but only until she realizes what she misses. She leaves, and that's really it. It took 9 1/2 weeks for Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) to leave John (Mickey Rourke). She should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery.
