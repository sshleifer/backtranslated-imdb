I had this movie, in the back of my mind I saw it. I always wanted to tell people about it, but I never remembered it. Now I found it. Now, finally, I can tell people exactly what the absolute worst, worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. There is no. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely garbage and unsuitable for a dump. All prints and other copies of this film should be loaded in a big rocket and shot in the sun. Only the purifying heat and the pressure of the sun can cleanse the materials on which this film is stored, so that they can be useful again for the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. and yes that is an opinion. But this movie was garbage, dirt and excrement of an animal you should never see, much less called by a man. I would rather see a Uwe Boll Movie Marathon than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll's films.
