Orson Welles's documentary "F for Fake" (1974) examines tricks and deceit and focuses primarily on two men who have themselves been exposed as fraudsters. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the supposedly fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes, but at least it seems to be his innocence. The other main theme of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has painted fakes of famous masterpieces all his life and sometimes sold them to museums as true works by the original artists. Scattered among these stories are pieces in which Welles performs magic tricks to illustrate points, and so forth. He also addresses the fact that his career started as a scam when he lied for the first time in his resume and then created a radio sensation with "War of the Worlds". <br /> <br /> I wanted this movie I really love it and find it profound because I'm an avid Welles fanatic, but I could not bring myself to get in. Part of the problem was that it was not just nonlinear but was completely dissipated, and I appreciate stylish editing as well fast jumps and zooms, especially when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, but in "F for Fake" was just too much going on, they created a distraction in contrast to the credit style, if the story had been clearer and more comprehensive I guess the editing was probably not that annoying ... The scattered storytelling was characterized by the fact that they were really interesting topics on the other hand around Elmyr de Hory. His artistic forgery deals with fraud in the art world and who can really determine the authenticity of certain works? and if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums? This is a documentary that I would say should give you at least one shot, but do not be afraid to turn it off if you do not like it. It's certainly the most disconnected documentary I've ever seen. It is a mix of documentary, art film and experimental film, none of which is properly portrayed or isolated. I have no less opinion of Welles after I have seen it, but in my opinion it does not stand out in his oeuvre as a luminous copy. 4/10 - Shelly
