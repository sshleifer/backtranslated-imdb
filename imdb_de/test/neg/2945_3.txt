TWINS EFFECT is a bad movie in many ways. The only good element is that it does not take it seriously. Otherwise, this is not really a movie, but a merchandising tool for the movie's two stars, popular pop idols in their hometown of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly constructed and played. The direction offers some silly martial arts, which is strange since the action director (and supposedly co-director) is Donnie Yen. As in many Hong Kong films aimed at the young audience, the big fanbase of "actors" like the Twins (the two girls starring in this movie) and Ekin Cheng, there is so much bad music that make the audience feel certain scenes funny, smart, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: It's all in vain. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, this is a bad movie. Not funny enough, not serious enough and in general also about chewing gum fakes for his own good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> (Go to http://www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and other foreign films)
