I first saw this movie in the mid / late 80s when I was a kid. We could not even get through. The dialogue, the acting, everything was just lame. <br /> <br /> Here are a few examples ... Imagine these spoken words really dramatic and exaggerated: "Oreegon, you go to Oreegon, why would anyone want to go to Oreegon?" <br /> < br /> "Survivalists, no one ever told us about survivors!" <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, my sister and I rented It was back for her 16th birthday, just so our friends sit down and could laugh at how terrible it was. I do not think we could finish it then!
