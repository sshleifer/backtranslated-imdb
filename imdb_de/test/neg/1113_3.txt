If you have described one of the scenes; Nightmares of children killing you in your sleep, your toddler daughter talking to ghosts, looking for a lost child in a deserted mine at night, so frightened by fear that you can not move, even though the blood of a murder victim dribbles on you Floor up ?? Then I would say you had a horror movie. But some, like "Wicked Little Things," were just not scary. I'm a horror fanatic and I loved the location, the plot in principle and I liked the three leading ladies. I did not want them to get hurt, I wanted the 'bad guy' to get only his desserts, the rest of the cast is just cannon fodder, so I was indifferent to them and every clich√© played out on the book - except for that Torch battery running out in the dark just as you start whispering voices here. <br /> <br /> I would still recommend that you watch it, unless you are new to horror movies or you've seen it all under 12 years old.
