I saw this show for the first time and hoped for a few laughs, good acting and good action. Unfortunately, I have none of this. <br /> <br /> First of all, this show is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to a boarding school, which is great, has a great location and barely rules? Plus a sushi bar. A SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what about the huge, ultra-cool, ultra-hip dorms? That does not happen in boarding schools! Everyone on this show seems to be perfect. Zoey looks perfect, has perfect friends, never has to do homework and is very popular. Sounds like a bad guy to me! I hate how they use so many cliques on this show, for example: Dana, the skater chick. She is completely ignorant and wears "edged" clothing. The jokes are so old too old! I would not see this show if I were you. It's one of the most horrible shows I've ever seen, and I hope it will be canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
