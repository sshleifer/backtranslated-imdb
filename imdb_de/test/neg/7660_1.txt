The Concorde: Airport'79, is for the time being the last of the high drama-high, Camp Airport series. At first glance, in the TV guide or DVD cover, you would simply think that the movie you are watching is just as exciting as the previous one! What you covered is unintentional laughter for 2 hours and 3 minutes, thanks to the worst script ever written. It was even written by Eric Roth. Who brought the world Forrest Gump! Well, one thing is for sure, the script is not Oscar worthy, It is worth Razzie! Universal's executives in '79 did the right thing by marketing it as a "comedy." Apart from Charo! the film has an impressive cast list.
