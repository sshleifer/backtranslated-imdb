Crash is overworked, considered and baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and even important movie with a message. Haggis tries too hard to assert himself and attacks almost every category of the movie. He feels very much in love with his own sense of social relevance and has all the subtleties of a jackhammer on his skull. Sure, inter-racial relationships affect everyone and there is a lot of ambiguity, but the Crash universe suggests that we are all victims of our own racial perception. It's an annoying thread that repeats itself to the limit and worsens its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I did not find the characters' results surprising and forced, and the movie took forever to spit and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 films on IMDb is testament to the public's willingness to convince themselves of Hollywood Malarkey. <br /> <br /> If you really want the "crash", look at one of David Cronenberg's: dark, twisted and original. This movie plays as a preacher, tiring and masochistic.
