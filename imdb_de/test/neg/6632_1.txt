This should not be turned into a movie. Everything was idiotic and I do not think I laughed once. There were bits that were okay, I think, but that's about it. Many parts were strikingly similar to many other films, which made them much better. There were some famous actors, but no one did a good job, they just did not care. This is one of those movies that tries to have a "sweet" ending, but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian right now. Do yourself a favor and avoid them! <br /> <br /> Final decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: No way! /> Hire Hire: Only if you've seen EVERYTHING else and have a free coupon, but even then it's not worth it.
