I was pleasantly satisfied with the end. I saw this movie yesterday and wanted to turn it off, but I changed my mind. It was not at all the direction that I thought the story would end. That's all positive what I can say about this movie. All actors are Nobody's, especially the lead role. Although she is an attractive young woman, she will never make it big. The writing, the direction and the acting are wooded, as one sees it during the day. The filming locations were very clever and made you suspect that it might be somewhere instead of cracking in Canada. Since this was completely shot in Canada, I assume that Canadien was a whole lot, which is not so bad on some recent Canadien TV productions: "Cold Squad", "Stone; Underover" are pretty well done.
