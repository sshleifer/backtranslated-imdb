I saw the movie in a preview this evening and it's a children-only movie. It in no way enhances or complements the original Disney movie. There is a shabby Scottish pastiche style everywhere that is not helped by weak writing (where motives are cluttered through the clutter) and irregular and often incoherent action (regardless of what reads like a decent lineup). I have no problem with the little dog - although there is a certain "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" quality (see below) about his attitudes. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was an Australian children's TV series from the 1960s, in which the kangaroo was an integral part of all stories. It is said that in order to get poor old Skippy to "act", they stuck a rubber band around the muzzle and tried to get away with their paws - somehow it seemed they were communicating with human actors !!! Bobby has a similar range and you just can not buy his series of heroic rescues. <br /> <br /> It would be advisable to take children aged 8-12 years. They could be scared of that. In addition, if you or you love it, good luck to you, but this is strictly cardboard cutting film making for the undemanding. It's a missed opportunity as Bobby's story has a real pathos and cuteness and this movie can not make it.
