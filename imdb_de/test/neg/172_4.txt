As noted in other comments here, the camera work is ridiculously bad. I'm tempted to say that the director for photography is a 7-year-old, but that would be mean - up to 7-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Okay, but what about the topic? I was looking for an insight into the world-wide status of the wine industry, you know, Mondovino. What the movie is about is a very close view of an intrigue in this world: the fight between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that would put the entire deal in context. Therefore, we stay with the director's selection process and the interviews with the different characters in this little psychodrama. There is no shortage of despicable characters or even despicable dogs. However, there is a lack of equanimity. Is the director a Marxist? I wondered when I tried to maintain a semblance of focus as the camera dipped, deflected and zoomed up a chaotic swing. Smallholders in France: good. Huge growers in the US: very, very bad. Forget the hundreds of small wineries across North America, Australia and South America. There is one dead horse that can be hit here for more than two hours. <br /> <br /> If you want to know more about the intrigue, read about it elsewhere. And you will be able to taste your favorite wine without feeling sick. <br /> <br /> I propose a new award for Best America-bashing Diatribe in Cannes.
