Part of the film's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. While this is good for dramas, in the comedy we know the pain that it does not need to emphasize. Therefore, "Fun with Dick and Jane" is not an appropriate title and I was just disappointed that I did not enjoy joking with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but the execution fails and the title was not suitable for the plot. <br /> <br /> However, if the film got the title "The Art of the Steal" and the emphasis on bubbly slapstick comedy, the robbery would take more and the plans to steal (of course stupid) the movie gave a big boost. At the same time, the film should at least initially show the CEO that he is a crook. It will therefore be easier to project the pain early on to a responsible person and to leave it at that. The film suffers from a point of view point of view, and against this background a comedy can not work if the point of view is not executed properly. A clever husband-character who is a Wile E. Coyote on the Road Runner would be funnier, including the slapstick comedy. But in this case, theft instead of catching the bird with complicated equipment would be extremely funny. I mean, you can make a lot of them and build them into the movie. However, since the position was wrong, the robbery had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You'll enjoy the movie in the first fifteen minutes (during Jim Carrey's big rise), but to solve the problems they faced were weird, because it's a comedy that is the part that needs a major overhaul. It can be funnier if problems such as John Travolta's Civil Action occur during the crash. This movie was a serious movie, but the problems he faced were a bit strange.
