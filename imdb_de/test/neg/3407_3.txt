I love to see a good gory giallo. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. It's long. Very long. The story is cheesy and makes little sense, even if it's very obvious. The script spends so much time on the murders and the girls, but there's almost no time for the killer. This leaves a big hole in the story: we may see a group of young women showering together, but we do not get a characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls. Yeah, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we're still pretty much in the dark, as why, the [boring] murderer decided it was worth getting rid of those oh-so-naughty girls. It's all so elaborate that I could not go into it a bit. <br /> <br /> As for the look of the movie, boring again. Nothing memorable about it. The actors? Boring. The script Laughing boring. The whole "hot" love affair between the teacher, the blonde and the student was really embarrassing. Which planet do you live on? The music? Boring. Skip it.
