This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the movie itself was awful. It was so terrible, I just had to register to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and wanted to break it every minute. It could have been great. Had a great premise. If you want to rob an armored car and there is a homeless person seeing you, you have to do what you need to do. For the main character to decide to have a police officer killed and kill his friends and colleagues after the homeless man was already dead, that's just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers to how his consciousness came to him, but come on. <br /> <br /> The main character crawled out of the armored truck, nobody saw him. He blew up the money supply, grabbed the cops and pulled him right behind the other guards, and no one saw him. He could get back in the armored car and nobody saw him ... This movie had potential, but he screwed it up. <br /> <br /> You could not pay me to see this movie again! Never look at it! Annoying ...
