Aug. 7, 2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): Dummer, a teenager-focused film about three children being zapped with their parents in their favorite cartoon. The script left a lot to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara, such as ripping off a live action with people in dinosaur costumes, which took place on Saturday morning, with some stupid cavemen. Nothing to admire and not much to say. I'm just astonished that I found it as bad in a blockbuster video store as it was and how the stores rid themselves of old VHS movies. I guess they could not even sell it, so it went back to the rental frame.
