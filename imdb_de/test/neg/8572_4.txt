Six students in a monastery do the unthinkable - kill an arrogant nun. Now, eighteen years later, the spirit of the nun is back and avenging herself for her murder. <br /> <br /> Yeah, that's basically the shortcut. It's more than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really cool thing is the impact on the spiritual nun, since I was pretty impressed because I was more of a low budget movie. I am also confused whether it is in English or not. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title is in Italian, but they spoke English in the movie (I think, or it could have been dubbed, I still can not say). > Anyway, the actual premise of the movie is pretty idiotic, and the end not only makes no sense, it ... well ... does not make sense.
