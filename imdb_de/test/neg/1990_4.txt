I am amazed that "The Hospital" has been so well received by critics and the public. I found it bleak, visually ugly and generally meaningless. After the first virtually unsurpassed 40 minutes, the film improves (relatively), but remains far away (to mention that he is not successful as a satire) and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. The unsafe tone of the film is the biggest mistake that even overshadows Scott's grandiose (as usual) performance.
