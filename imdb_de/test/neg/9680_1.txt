I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER making a "biblical" movie again when Noah's ark will be the norm. Apart from the terrible, completely uninspired acting of the entire cast (Voight and Steenburgen are undoubtedly the day the film was approved), the timeline has been completely reorganized. I also missed the role in Genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman passing by on his paddle boat. Hello? Everyone else was dead, according to Scripture except Noah and his family. God piled lumber and added plans to build the ark when Noah asked how? I also can not remember reading about Noah's wife, who has been tormenting him uninterruptedly in the 40 days, or Noah, who has been constantly walking around with glassy eyes. The screenwriter obviously had very little knowledge of the book of Genesis, or simply did not care that his abomination of a story mocked it completely.
