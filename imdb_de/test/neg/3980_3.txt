Like most people, I saw this movie on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Though it did get some deserved barbs, it's one of the better movies shown in this show. <br /> <br /> The premise is better today than even the average Hollywood blockbuster. it raises some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also offers a few nice moments when Richard walks along the river. If you look at the film, you can see where on paper many developments of the plot probably looked very good. Richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting issue to think about, and the end would probably have been a nice seventies-style think-fart if the previous incidents had not been so stupidly visibly cheap, making the flaws all the more obvious , The "clone farm" is obviously a college campus, and a beer can serves as the main point of action. Lena and Richard have no chemistry - we're supposed to think this is a meeting of like-minded people, but there does not seem to be a brain cell between them. The "crazy old couple" is aging very fast. There are also some mistakes that are due to poor management decisions, such as For example, the decision to keep a climatic conversation out of range of any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> All in all a noble effort, which nevertheless is best seen on MST3K.
