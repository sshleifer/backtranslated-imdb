What kind of film is this??? A horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity that the Bhatt Camp has already achieved. The film features EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI and DINO MOREA. The film has "no basis". It just works ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich mansion. However, Dino Udita does not like the heart because he only wants her wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So he convinces Emraan that he has an affair with Udita, so he can catch up with her and finally break away from Udita. How boring !! Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. When Udita is finally arrested for the murder of Emraan, Dino tries arrogantly to save her and show his false love for her. Udita, however, does not understand that and feels that he really loved her. So she gives Dino all her wealth. Finally, Dino comes out of the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a scam !! The songs are good and the only thing that's good in the movie. Now for the single ratings: (from 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 Overall effect: * 1/2 Director: * * Story: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final Rating: * 1/2 Bad performances and bad casting ....... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Do not waste your time !!!!)
