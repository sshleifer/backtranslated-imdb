I remember that Hey Hey Fuss and I saw the Jackson Jive, it was a pretty straightforward comedy sketch, but I saw that and it's free and it's clear in the room? Did I miss something? If the Black Community complained about any racist comments on a television program, this should be here, and if you've read my previous comments, I'm not the easy offensive guy. The basic plot is that an African American moves next to that white guy and drops those racist comments like the value of a house just because black neighbors and the white guy like references (if you're easily offended by racial slurs.) Read on Nig -Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I apologize, but that really happens on this show.) I'm really a guy who gets along well with the Black community.) Can swear in an episode I've seen someone's eyes focus on something that is not related to the situation, all in all a terrible comedy.
