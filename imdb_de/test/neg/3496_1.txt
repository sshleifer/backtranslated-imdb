Through his 2-hour run, Crash captures the emotional turmoil of his twenty-sixth group of characters when faced with the sometimes stark and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying American society. That and the emotional anxiety of one of his viewers, sitting close to the front, desperately trying to find a sense of the films that have become these days. <br /> <br /> The era we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, but also the not very enthusiastic flag-waving of the ideas of postmodernism is always shot down by what postmodernism aims to destroy all these ideas, and thanks to the great destructivist not ideas of these great "thinkers" , But I digress. That does not have much to do with what the movie is about, but rather with what the movie is. <br /> <br /> Sure, it seems hard to earn a livelihood in Hollywood that's geared towards a market so post-post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a life motto. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think about, whether we like it or not. And so a new studio product is created! Indie films, once energetic and idealistic in their defiant experimentalism, now seem to be as stubborn as Hollywood movies to sell to indie film markets. An indie film must sell at Sundance before being "celebrated". And so nothing is easy anymore. Even a good movie turns so dark. While filmmakers in the past only wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in those seemingly simple attempts, the biggest films have to carry, filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good in the first place; Movies must make people think, need to be meaningful, provoke, raise questions, Yadda Yadda Yadda. All that matters is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formula-like similarity of Hollywood movies, with the myriad types of differentiation essentially representing the same product. <br /> <br /> And I have not even started the movie yet. Maybe I've become too picky about the films I see today. Maybe it's my primary need to be entertained rather than, for example, watching a movie. But hell, this movie is a lot of crap. And I'm back from this movie, not just because it follows the "How to make a good movie" guide. Good guidance for the T-characters who spray eloquent lines and are as witty as if they were gifted with God's speech; it raises questions about racism and life against racism in America; There are "touching" moments when everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people. Not to mention that as soon as you hear the Ambient / New Age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know you have all the above qualities. <br /> <br /> And something about that The point mentioned - about raising questions about urgent issues like racism - pisses me off completely. As with all post-post-post-post-all movies, it is not important to just have a message about this issue. After all, our audience is far too intelligent today in this post-post-post-post world. Our viewers want us to make them think, not that we interpret things so simple (and then they go into existential crap and say), because life itself is not easy. Hahaha. As for another common drill, we have to think about topics here instead of feeding them. Okay, okay and okay. So, the movie wants to beat the audience with these non-messages, and since it's not just a message, it's very subtle and subtle means good, right? We are thus repeatedly struck by this credulous subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony is not steep enough, we have Ludicrous' character, the only character who does not seem to take all these racism discussions seriously and is "converted" to an irritatingly meaningful character, in which he learns some meaningful looks and Give breaks in which the audience "should also learn something about themselves". HM Yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist movie right after this man. <br /> <br /> To keep the bullshit short, I probably would not have questioned the movie if it were not so bloated. Self-importance The fear that makes up the entire movie felt more like a white boy who should moan as the actual anger of Spike Lee. So it's Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the guy who wants to wave flags about the humanitarian mission if they just do not know that the flag they're waving at is their perforated underwear. Moreover, it is so trendy in the post-post-post-post world that it is completely subtle. Nothing is easy anymore. In his best efforts to be really good, provocative, and ultimately human, it's neither imho nor another indie crap by an indie director who wants to make a name for himself as a credible indie filmmaker. At least Hollywood is easier and more sincere in its manipulation.
