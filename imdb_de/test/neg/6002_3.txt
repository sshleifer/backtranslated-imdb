Predictable, bloody, exaggerated, mediocre. Do not waste time - there are much better films. <br /> <br /> The resuscitation will start OK, but the plot will be repeated quickly. My interest dropped steadily. At the end of the movie, I was just glad it was finally over. The characters are never fully developed. The cinematography is muddy, and the fast-paced POV rotation - perhaps impressive in 1999, is currently merely a way of describing the film as an attempt to replace Gee Whiz Flash's storyline and character. The gimmicks for filming serve a purpose (convey tension and fear), but are constantly overused and eventually become counterproductive. Overall, a shame - the film / the story obviously had potential and the producers / directors and actors obviously have technical skills. A disappointment.
