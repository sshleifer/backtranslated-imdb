Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a dirty, insidious smile that every character he plays has a vicious effect. Therefore, it does not look good to call him the good of the play. The audience is just waiting for his character to break and begin to blow people away. Fresh from her acclaimed role as "Poison Ivy", Drew Barrymore must have just made this film a favor for director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer of "Ivy"); She plays a character named Daisy Drew (!) And immediately left, which nobody (except Blaver Runner) had seen for us except Jeff Fahey and Sean Young. This witless screenplay by Michael Angeli refers to a police sketch artist who draws the face of his own wife from the testimonies of a murderer, and while this is not a bad idea for an action, it would be much better suited for an hour-long television series. This cable movie is short of inspiration (starting with the casting) and shorter with surprises. * from ****
