I looked at it because I've never seen Tel Aviv where the story is. I was disappointed because it does not offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It is also presumptuous? One of those movies where you can guess its meaning until you finally give up with a shrug. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress at weddings. Obviously, her parents are not particularly interested in her, and when a little girl with an inflatable ring goes out to sea, Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The little girl does not speak, and Batya can not pass her on to social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed. So she takes her back to her apartment with her leaky roof, and when it's time to work, she has to take the little girl with her. The boss is very unhappy about these and other shortcomings in Batya's job performance. Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (on which Batya, of course, works), she breaks her leg out of a women's room whose door will not open, and she and her new husband can not take the Caribbean vacation they're planning. You end up in a dingy seaside hotel with no view. It smells bad, there is traffic noise, and Keren complains constantly. Your husband meets a strangely attractive older woman? an author ?? who also stays in the hotel, and Keren worries that he slept with this stranger. The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy, who takes care of old people. The old woman she is hired for is very grumpy and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English, but not Hebrew or German. Joy is mainly concerned with how her son is doing in the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat, as he asked. She finds the perfect boat in a shop and plans to buy it. The daughter of the old woman whom Joy hired is an actress who appears in a kind of postmodern "physical theater" adaptation of Hamlet, and does not get along with her mother. <br /> <br /> The road to which of these three overlapping stories is about to break is probably something deep. I Did not Understand Batya's relationship with the little girl is a fantasy element, and perhaps Batya's nonexistent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in that respect. When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, a strange effect is used, where the small sails are blown up by the wind, and they do it as if they were on the scale of a real ship. Keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship, which is on a brochure cover in the hotel room, and a narrative of the poetry of the strange woman mentions a ship in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and found that I would not lose sleep. If someone out there has a clear idea of ​​what it's about, he may fill me.
