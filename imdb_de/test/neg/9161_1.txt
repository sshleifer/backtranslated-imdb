I am surprised to read all the positive comments on this film. Even my 4 and 6 year olds were bored. The chipmunks are cute ... but the plot is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with the least demanding tastes. <br /> <br /> We heard some laughter from the audience when we were there; But I was wondering why. I do not admit to ever be a fan of "Chipmunks", but I expected to talk. As far as I can tell, it's not even an "escapist" movie. Simply a hard act on "success spoiled too young". With Britney Spears, we've seen more than enough of it, right? <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it.
