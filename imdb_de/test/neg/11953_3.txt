This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only kung fu movie! This is the only kung fu movie I have ever seen! I give this movie way too much recognition! My best guess for the movie is that someone wanted to show off someone's martial arts skills to another person, but it became clear that you can not just film a guy who fights another and people look at him, so he has a story behind them fight ... and people still have not seen it. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was onion shaped. This drama was silly and stereotypical for every Kung Fu movie. The synchronization was literally the worst I've ever heard. If you've played a minor role in this movie, like the fat guy or the two trying to net the main character, it does not matter who outranked your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a sloppy stutter, and nobody would have said anything. Apart from that, the movie makes up for it by the awesome fight scenes. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were definitely what this movie was about. But the impulses of the fighting were absolutely absurd! In most cases, a man either jumps out of the tall grass or looks at the main character from afar and attacks him. But as soon as the fighting started, things balanced out. However, there were only two things that really hindered the fighting. These constant "fuzzy" sound effects added to each vibration of a fist or foot or sword, and the bad editing that made 25 percent of the fights very nervous and choppy. Someone was in the middle of a back flip and was then suddenly kicked to the ground, and then he was instantly back on his feet, blocking a blow. But while editing cut and paste was more annoying than anything else, it did not have much of an impact on the entire movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was not a great movie, but I was not expecting a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie. I saw this movie as a way to overcome an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that, but this was just one of those films that you have no practical use for, so always look at it when you have some spare time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it. Good day, gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Scottish
