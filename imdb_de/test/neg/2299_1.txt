When my mother went to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson to always accompany my mother in the video library! In fact, the only reason she chose her was because Colin Firth was in it and she thinks he's a good actor. <br /> <br /> It starts with a few beautiful pictures of Africa and then goes from bottom to bottom AND DOWN AND DOWN. After this movie, I was very surprised that Colin Firth got as far as he did because this pointless movie could ruin an actor's career. The story is about a divorced woman whose son tries to make her into a relationship. Man called Matthew Fields, whom he met while impressing his friends about his big house. <br /> <br /> Nimi Matthew does not like the divorce at all and he leaves with the local vicar, who does not like her son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you disagree with me, and I hope I did not offend you, but for all the people who have not seen this movie, I'm leaving you with a word of caution , DO NOT VIEW THIS FILM !!!!!
