The Shanghai Cobra begins like gangbuster, with a rain-soaked diner scene straight out of Shack Out at 101 or Gun Crazy (the first one). Unfortunately, the film then delays with a standard formula of Chan, barely animated by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if director Karlson had bloated half of his budget in the first five minutes and made the setup exactly as he wanted. Look at the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.
