I think it's the first time I'm going to a theater and so disappointed. There were two reasons why I saw "Astérix et les Vikings": first as a movie lover and secondly as a big Astérix fan. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film fulfills no wishes. It's just a big animated mess and it proves that the Astérix franchise is getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> Actually, this has been the case since the death of the first scenarist René Goscinny in 1977. His faithful collaborator, illustrator Albert Uderzo, took his place, but the following books clearly lacked the quality that existed in the Goscinny years. <br/> <br/> "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands" published during the reign of Goscinny The basic story is the same: Goudurix, Abraracourcix 'nephew' comes in the Village on and Astérix et Obélix must make him a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to discover what is fear, because it seems that fear gives wings The similarities end here What follows in this book is one uninterrupted series of laughter, jokes and witty dialogue, with the result that the Vikings discover fear and flee from Gaul, the film is stupid, not funny, fast, hackneyed ... well, just call a standard and it has a good chance to be applied ... <br /> <br /> The difference between book and film could be more acceptable if the movie was good, but the new ideas simply overthrow in a bottomless pit, even older Astérix films like "Astérix le Gau lois ", which transmit the lines almost without changing them, are simply better. <br/> <br /> Animation has the quality of other 21st century films, but has its faults and every beginner could find the flaws. The biggest example is the continuity error, where the day follows after a fraction of a second in the same order. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They have taken animation studios from many countries and still can not make adequate films. <br /> <br /> The changes in the original story are simply unbearable. And they could be, if there was no original story. Goudurix has in the movie a pet pigeon called SMS, which is his cell phone (!). Grossebaf, the Viking leader, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!), And she is constantly resisting the authority of her father. There's also a stupid Viking wizard, his caricature, dumb and muscular son, the faithful bride of Grossebaf obsessed with decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can not stand this much longer. <br /> <We are a long way from the original gags from the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of putting the pictures on the big screen, especially because the biggest laugh in the books is due to verbal jokes and visual gags that do not have the same appeal on a theater screen. I remember that the greatest moments in this book were when Obélix laughed at the names of the invaders (all ending in 'af') and Goudurix tries to scare them ridiculously. <br /> <br /> And if not all would be enough, someone in public relations decided to write on the movie poster that there is already a Celine Dion song that will be included in the credits. If it was a new song, I could have understood it. The use of an old song, however, is just another proof that the film is so badly made that it is ready to do anything to attract viewers. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can not go out of the theater without getting cold. In a summer version, it just can not hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point of the film is how Goudurix gets brave. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and untrustworthy, while it is better portrayed in the film and the motivational point is more credible. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen the movie yet, do not waste your money on it. Get the book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh René, why did you leave us?
