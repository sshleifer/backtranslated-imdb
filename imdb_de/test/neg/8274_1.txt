OK .. At the time of writing, 65 people voted for this film and scored 5 out of 10. I suspect that only the film crew has chosen. So I'm here to bring justice to justice. <br /> <br /> Never before has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this. In view of that, I laughed a lot - but the movie / story did not want me to do that at all. <br /> <br /> I have seen many bad movies. A LOT OF. But man, this blows them all away. <br /> <br /> Speaking of 96 computers, ridiculous spectacles and wheelchair pursuits - and we have young Tarantinos who can not finance their ideas. Life is a cruel joke.
