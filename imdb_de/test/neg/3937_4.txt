Daniel Auteuil's Bruno in Petites Couperes is a model of Pierre Pierre in Christian Vincent's La Separation of 10 years. In both films, the youthful confidence in left-wing ideology and love collapses into paranoia - manifesting itself as captive aggression in Pierre and the desperately weird-witted woman in younger Bruno. Unfortunately, for Auteuil fans The actor is dependent on a unified world fatigue (not unlike his compatriot Johnny Hallyday in Leontes recent l'Homme du Train). It's not like that and gets frustrating as the movie progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as author / author of the project. His sequencing of episodes associated with a symbol does not mask the rhythm of the film. I was particularly angry that Grenoble's imposing dramatic-romantic backdrops were virtually obsolete by a cameraman who was obviously shivering in the cold. Beatrice She dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as Bruno, in a character that becomes increasingly complex to become surreal. Bonitzer, however, can not maintain this, and the grave conspiracy challenges Beatrice to compete with another bourgeois mannequin. In this way, Bonitzer then denies Scott Thomas the Oscar Cabinet. <br /> <br /> Submerging the characters in the bourgeoisie may be a viable and sustainable outcome, but in this case, it's a cadence (unlike the brutal, painful resolution of La Separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10.
