To call this film a decent or entertaining horror tribute is far too optimistic. Heck, you can not even call it a nice spoof of the genre because it's way below average (it's funny, but not "haha-witty"), but still I'd say I'm watching it Tons of little things. By the way, all the people who complain in their comments about this movie, are your own fault. If you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should already know that it will not be on the same level as "The Piano", so do not complain ... <br /> <br /> Evil Ed would have something but it totally screwed up. I suppose the main idea behind this movie is the criticism of the growing "cutting committee" in horror these days. It shows an editor named Edward, who is slowly (well, not too slow) going crazy when he sees all the violence and blood in the movies Produced by his company The big boss is called Sam Campbell ... Funny, right? Personally, I also expected a character named Bruce Raimi, but to my surprise there was not. Anyway, this guy got rich by making movies called Loose Links. They show (and I'm not kidding!) Scenes in which a girl is raped by a BEAVER (?) And then shot in the head by a bazooka !!! Well, who says that horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> With all the blood and 'loose limbs' it's hard to believe, but it gets boring very quickly. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from it. Now all you have to do is press the eject button and of course look for the obvious amount of clues to other, much better horror movies. I saw scenes that were obviously stolen from The Evil Dead, The Silence of the Lambs, Braindead, and a few others. In addition, there are a large number of classic horror posters on the walls, which can also be admired. Evil Ed finds its origin in Sweden. I'm convinced that there are a lot of talents talented in the north (take the Danish "Nattevagt" as an example) ... but none of these talents joined the cast or crew of Evil Ed. Just to see if you are in a stupid mood and do not want to use your brain at all.
