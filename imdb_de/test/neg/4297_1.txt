As a flying and Kriegsfilmfan this is at the bottom of my list. It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and seems as if they had just stepped out of a high school. Acting, script, directing, production standards and casting are all garbage. The only salvation are some of the flying sequences. If the people who represent them are fictional, I might rate them at 2, but if there's anything that annoys me more than anything else in movies, they pretend it's history and the great people, they are indeed doing this! It's almost as if they were trying to enroll as many notable WW1 personalities as possible. There are many good war films from World War I, and this is NOT one of them.
