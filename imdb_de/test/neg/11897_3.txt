One might think that anyone who wants to succeed the pioneering, nude civil servant over thirty years ago would at least try to honor the original with an inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biography of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century, which has no style of its own. It's true that the filmmakers have put together some outstanding actors - and handed them a tattered mug of bleak mash. Everything in the infrastructure of this movie is wrong, starting with the script. This is another of those TV movie compilations of great lives, where every other line is a "famous quote" of the theme, and every other scene is an in-your-introduction to the next key character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR expert who promotes Crisp as an entertainer on the state side. Denis O'Hare, the publisher of a gay magazine Crisp engages as a film critic, gets a bit alienated when he's indifferent to the passions of AIDS activists in the 1980s and returns to the group as the compassionate friend of the dying eighteen-year-old; Jonathan Tucker (in a beautiful performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay motives, a friend of Crisp; and finally, Cynthia Nixon as a performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia penny arcade who, fascinated by Crisps Persona, offers him a place in her cabaret career. Nixon is a convincing and gifted performer, but the script is not offered a way to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a studio apartment in an old mansion in Manhattan's East Village. He's known to have never cleaned anything because "the dust will not get any worse after a few years," or something like that. However, if you look at the presentation of this apartment in this film, you will never get the impression of dustiness. He visited a caf√© on a busy street and saw every day of the week he sipped tea and watched the world go by. In this movie, we get a dinner that looks at 12th Avenue on the Hudson River. Most "streets of New York" have a sterile, unreal look with no sense of the time. <br /> <br /> The soul of this movie is the big John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years, he can still grasp the essence of this strange English Englishman after Eduardian and convey it to the third millenarian. Every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes, he even modulates his voice projection in order to adapt to a person whose life ends in death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this kingdom that very old skin, when you get very old, takes the character of a stinking coat that can not be removed and you long for death. You can feel that feeling in Hurt's performance. So for him and him alone, this movie is worth a look.
