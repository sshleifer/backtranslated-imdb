Now I saw this when it first appeared on the VHS, and all my friends and I found it a pretty good movie, but then we were teenagers. But honestly, not as good as a movie in retrospect. A kind of hair metal, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not mean exactly that it is not customizable. However, this seems to lack the charm that a normal Mst3k food normally contains. But if it was cable and I was bored and drank beer - surely I would watch it again. But on the other hand, I've seen Howling VII about five times now, so you really should not listen to me. <br /> <br /> Everyone else thinks it's sad that the director supposedly made his own opinion movie? And why did he feel the urge to use Caps Lock so many times?
