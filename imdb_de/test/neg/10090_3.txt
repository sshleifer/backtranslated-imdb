Imagine any stereotypical, overclocked clich√© from all the movies and TV shows that hit the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. During the "Rumble" scenes, give a mix of "period" music and plaintive electric guitars. Then spend your time trying to figure out (or take care of) which of the Deuces will be killed in the (anti) climatic finale: romantic comedy, adolescent slasher, explosive action film, adolescent sex comedy, children's music or Oscar nomination vehicle. But it might have been nice to bring something new or interesting into the genre of street gang tragedy.
