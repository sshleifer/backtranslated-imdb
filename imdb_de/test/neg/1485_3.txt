Yes, the movie was so boring and bland. After a certain point, I wanted the croc to eat these people so we could bring the movie over. where the fishing guide straps a weapon. He says he does it for insurance purposes only, all the crocodiles were hunted out of this river. He is eaten immediately by a croc. The trio is then driven into a tree and picked up by the reptiles during their escape attempts. They spend most of the movie fleeing the best way. <br /> <br /> Probably the survivor finds the guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. Oh, they killed the only sympathetic character of the movie! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
