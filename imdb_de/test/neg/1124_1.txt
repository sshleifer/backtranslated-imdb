** WARNING ** MISCELLANEOUS MOVIE ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas Eve a crazy case decided that he would entertain us by broadcasting this movie as "entertainment" on television. What in God's name did he think? <br /> <br /> This film is full of terrible humor, despicable plays, bad jokes and a catastrophe. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role of cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain-dead person who is incapable of even the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was dumb like a brick, but he was sorry for the company he worked for, so they sent him and his family on vacation. But as stupid as he is, he has managed to make a disaster out of his vacation. All in all, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I still have nightmares about the miserable drama and the even miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad that you almost have to see it ... but not. The nightmares I have are far worse than any other nightmares you'll ever have. Trust me ... I hate this movie so badly because it is acting, humor, jokes and history. The only good thing was the beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my opinion and I hope everyone agrees with me ...
