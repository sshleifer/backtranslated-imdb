I was entertaining to see that some of the reviews here were crowned with ** SPOILERS **. The joke in my family is that the only part of this film that is not given away on the back of the box is in the title. Maybe I'm just a tight American 17-year-old who would not know art if he bit my leg, but I prefer movies that have at least a few words. This film makes the second half of the year 2001: A Space Odyssey chatty down right. This movie is so slow that it is not even art, just boring. We follow this scary guy who follows this boy in Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A movie should not make you fall back on the book, but stand alone. This movie has no way to stand. It does not even have the bones of an action to lean on.
