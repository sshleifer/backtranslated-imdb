I really wanted to have this movie, but the pace was just too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a nice story, but it was really like a slug race. <br /> <br /> The film would have been better served if it had more action. I do not mean anything great, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It could also have helped songs that determine the tone / mood of the longer periods in which there was no dialogue. <br /> It's been about 10 years since I saw it, so maybe I have to give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
