This is the worst movie I have ever seen. At first I thought it would be good because I was interested in the Bermuda Triangle, but instead it was terrible. All he did was do a series of lame investigations that made no sense (if time changes there, how did the woman age and her son quickly age), and have a terrible, juicy ending. The next time the guys who did this go to Bermuda, they should take all the copies of this movie with them. Please vote for this movie so it can be included in the worst movie list.
