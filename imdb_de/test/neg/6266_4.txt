Crazy scientist Professor Tabani drinks a potion brewed in his lab, but becomes a vampire craving for blood. On his visit to Dr. Aqil, Tabani sees a picture of Aqil's wife, Shabnam, and, after turning Aqil into a vampire, goes to see Shabnam to make him his bride. Aqil's brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother in Tabani's castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul. Tabani manages to bite Shabnam and tries to lure her child Achilles' brother runs against time to stop the vampire curse. "Zinda Laash" almost put me to sleep. The plot is extremely slow, but follows more or less the famous novel by Bram Stoker. The tension is completely absent Gore and Nudity. The film is only recommended for curious horror fans who want to see the second horror movie made in Pakistan (after "Madman" from 1964).
