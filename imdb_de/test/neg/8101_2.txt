I'll probably have to blame myself, but I'm certainly expecting more from a movie called "Black Dragons," which refers to secret World War II conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons, and revenge. This film is a boring mistake with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which is basically more resourceful and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explanation at the end, but the problem is that you have not stopped caring for a long time. We see how the horror icon Bela Lugosi invades a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one after another. The story is about to World War II and ?? especially after completion of the end ?? It is certainly a premise with a lot of potential, so it is a shame it will not be elaborated. There is, however, a great dialogue that I can not resist sharing! Man against woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So I can beat you up, it's the only way to leave this place!" It's the only highlight in a very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is beautiful? as usual ?? But its scary performance alone is hardly worth buying this movie. If you're interested in seeing other spooky performances (in decent scriptwriting films), check out "Invisible Ghost," "The Corpse Vanishes," "White Zombie," and of course, the 1931 Dracula Version.
