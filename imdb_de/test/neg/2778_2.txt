Each time a movie shows a dwarf or a dwarf in a prominent role, the odds are 10 to 1 that the director threw him in because he did not know what else to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case, the featured little guy is not so bad - he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes (except for the part where he pulls the lead man down the stairs of the dungeon), but the movie itself uses it like a dog toy. <br /> <br /> The problem here is a common problem with low-budget films - there's a decent idea here, but the director and scriptwriter do not know how to develop them. A good director would take the various elements of the story - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret labs and a dungeon, car hunts, fist fights, monster Frankensteins assistant, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy, etc. exciting movie with cheap thrill and fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a group of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab, then a cheesy operation where the patient bleeds Tempura, followed by some of the same people who stumble and argue The doctor's lab went a little further, followed by another subgroup of the first group that drove around and had an accident, followed by a dungeon escape scene, which is mostly a woman putting on her shoes again, followed by a chase on the roof (the actual climax of the movie), followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie seems to be escaping from everyone else, followed by a nice walk in the countryside where everyone either hunts, attacks, or otherwise escapes, and again, followed by well, not much else. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in here is a creepy peroxide blonde dressed in white, a well-intentioned heroic guy who looks somehow naughty, a three-foot lab assistant, a big stick with a mass of molten rubber on one side of his face Child wondering in the middle of the movie to deliver more of the "Frankenstein Factor", a brunette who somehow falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the crazy doctor himself who must be the happiest man in the world History of the evil super villains, because nothing works according to his plan, but everything is still working for him ... and all, because he has thought to put an electrode in the transplanted brain sometime in the operation. <br /> <br /> This was by no means the worst movie I've seen, or even the worst exploitation movie I've seen, or even the worst, badly made exploitation movie I've seen, but it just lies there It's cheap and inattentive at every point, and there's no real reason even bad movie lovers will see it.
