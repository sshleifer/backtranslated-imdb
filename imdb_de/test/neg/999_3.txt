The basic genre is a thriller that coincides with an uncomfortable Menage-a-Trois. Fellowes has been trying to make more of it by using the lies of the title to create all sorts of little twists that should always surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really messy. Fellowes seems to have no interest in presenting the thriller elements in a way that gives us seat edges. Rather, his focus is on the moral relationships themselves. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inconsistent, here in stages, indigenous and with the constant surprise of realism occasionally interrupted by a clich√© landmine. Although there is no excitement about the scenes, so that the actors can continue with the existing in their space, the terrible score can not add any dimension and often opposes the emotional moment of given set pieces. There is also a very prosaic thing, dare I say that the British feel they are being shot. I did not want to see a document from two successful middle-class people trapped in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see a kind of artful narrative of history. <br /> <br /> After all, it's actually the story that leaves the rest. Just as the elements of the suspense are rather flat, the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of various shapes and sizes woven as a bearer for character testing. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances, and John Warnaby's keen colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil to much of the forehead ravage. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed; Not that it's bad, but it could have been a lot better. 3.10
