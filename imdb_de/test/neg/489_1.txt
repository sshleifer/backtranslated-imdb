Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you did not fall on your head as a kid and then used it as football, then you agree that this is one of the worst yet funniest series ever made. She turns to a woman who was beaten as a young girl by her father, who also killed her mother. She spends her time drawing but waits, then becomes her superhero drawing and continues to fight crime and is therefore marked by pain. "The story itself is fine, but it's just like that Jesse, the writer and director, has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue with the hero's 8-year-old version and it sounds as if he had been written a 30-year-old man while you Father, who wears a great mustache, walks around the house all day and looks angry, just shows how bad the characterization is, especially where he gets angry in the first episode and the repetition begins phrase "no more" while he holds his wife's head before he kills her over the marble work surface.The following bang sound effect and only his horrible acting, as he can only convey, is angry, just awesome, even after he his daughter has hit with the belt, which is done with the moaning and angry in slow motion. The episodes themselves could easily contain a good, clean script that lasts over 5 minutes, but oh no, Jesse does not want that. Little Jesse craps modernism as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko and then drunk himself to death. Pointless camera jerks, all in unusual angles, overly repeated lines, and even meaningless sequences, have been put together time and again to fill in the overlong episodes. In conclusion, the idea is not bad, it's just how it's done. Also, there is a great character of a fat man on a bench who does not get enough on the table and is great. I just want to hug his lilac chubby cheeks because they look so soft. The character development is non-existent, since the main character only says the first philosophical-sounding thing that comes to their head, although they all contradict each other. All in all but mostly Indiana Jones 4 is much better. Enter "Jeeharv" in the tube as well. The results can also make you cry at the beauty of the world You hear a lot of cheap sex jokes, mostly gay ones.
