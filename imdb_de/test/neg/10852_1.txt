Hello! I'm Sheena, an African (and yet white!) Jungle tribal princess with the incredible ability to become the cheapest, most insecure monster in the world (think of the '60s Star Trek aliens) by being seductive rolling in the mud! When I was in this terrible position for the first time, the only logical action I took was to turn myself into a tattered jungle bikini, where I portrayed my bad antics. I enjoy romance and occasionally rip up the inconspicuous African warlord. And I would be reluctant to mention my (white) buddy, Mr. Cutter, an ex-military American who seems to have fled the US after his divorce. Can you say, are you kidding alimony? In any case, he occasionally distracts me from my difficult life. I mean, how many idiot blonds do you know who is an endangered species of meat-decomposing monsters? Despite my many difficulties (acting is so hard! * Moaning *), I have not given up, and after much soul research, I have finally discovered my role in life: terrorizing Insomniac nocturnal television viewers who are so unhappy with no cable or satellite.
