First a warning. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie on DVD in the Universal 'Hitchcock Collection' series. The source print seems to be in good condition, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting it's a second-generation copy taken directly from the video. The frame is too narrow, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the movie is cut off. I can tell from other IMDb reviews that there is a much better version. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> In his long interviews with Francois Truffaut In the sixties, Hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his entire work, but all he could say about this image was that he had done Carole Lombard a favor and that he did not understand the characters, so just photograph the script of Norman Krasna. <br /> <br /> In truth, there is not much more to say. <br /> <br /> It's a screwball comedy that comes from the same shape as It One One Night, His Girl Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typically vivacious wife who learns that her marriage is technically void, deals with her husband under the most fleeting pretext and spends most of the image as "adorable" good enough as the husband, but it's hard to do that Patience with him not to lose. Long before the end of the film, the audience says, "Let the stupid cow fall, it's not worth it." Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she gets engaged. It is believed that he is a courtly South American, though he is not apparent from his accent and really makes himself felt in the drunken scene (which he otherwise plays very well). He is an honorable, generous, devilish gentleman, so of course he is bullied and patronized by Robert Montgomery, and jokes many of his jokes - though he is not treated as badly as the similar Ralph Bellamy character in His Girl Friday br /> This movie feels like it was made by people who only knew screw comedies by reputation but had not seen one yet. For example, a good screwball comedy has a strong basic idea with a series of continuous comic threads that constantly overlap and overlap. Here are all comedy elements like pearls strung on a chain. This is a screw comedy by numbers. <br /> <br /> It's the same with the direction. Normally, these comedies race at an ever-increasing pace, rising in the end almost to hysteria. Hitchcock does not understand that. His direction is a bit lethargic and the picture becomes a stately sequence of scenes, all of which are slightly over-written (but malnourished) and a little too long. He was never a very good director, so he just lets the actors move on. They do OK. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor that he often used in his thrillers, but he had no sense of comedy as a genre. His later problem with Harry was a dropout for similar reasons as this film, but at least he was involved in this image. Here he only goes through the movements. <br /> <br /> All the people connected to this movie were good solid professionals, so it's not that bad. It just feels a little distracted, over-trusted, overly long and ultimately rather flat. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is only for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock enforcers.
