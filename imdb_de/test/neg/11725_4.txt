One might think, with all the painstaking care and expense incurred in this movie-making film, it would reflect something of the tastes and manners of the upper-class pair - Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales - rather than too its a mawkish, unappetising historical romance. <br /> <br /> It also does not help that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable performances where the events are far too slow to grab the attention /> <br /> es It's difficult to understand why a star of the caliber of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND wants to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie, because the role is so colorless that she is just out of sight. At this point in her career, Olivia performed in so many "nobility" roles that required a royal presence, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> A trivial film that was best forgotten in the TV movies era.
