Nice idea that Dionne Warwick takes over the song vocals for this movie adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's bestseller (a la "Valley Of The Dolls") ... although it's too bad, this brew has not pervaded Neely O'Hara by Patty Duke "The Love Machine" is unfortably boring. Even the last brawl (with an Academy Award for fighting support!) Can not save her. Dyan Cannon seems to be embedded in her heavy pancake make-up and lumbering fall (though her tiny tanned figure is a beauty), John Phillip Law is a woodblock star photographer. And where does Robin Stone go at the end? Is he on his way to the water to pick up a couple of sailors? After Cannon has emptied his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. In this case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" could have been an interesting movie. Surely better than this yawning snooze opera. * 1/2 of ****
