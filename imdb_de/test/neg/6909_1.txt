My friend and I decided to watch this movie after hearing on the radio that it's a good movie worth seeing, even up there with "Cars." In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was horrified. For starters, the cows, who should be women, had male voices. Then I realized that they really should be boys. I put the transvestite cows aside for a while and tried to watch the movie open-minded, but it was just so cheesy that I could not help but shake my head. Probably I checked my phone about ten times, if it was almost over. The plot was decent, if unpredictable, but it took too long to reach its point. I had problems sitting and I am 19 years old. The children in the theater actually stood up and ran up and down the hallways. I wanted to join them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking prescriptions, not to mention that the cows / bulls actually wired hot and stole a car, then drank and drove, got into a boy's house, to He pushed him out of bed (he deserved it), then ran away from the cops who made the movie's authors look like terrible people. This is not what I want my child to get in touch with. There is way too much of it in the real world. If I wanted my kid to watch guys dropping and driving and tracking cops in a chase, I'd throw them at 10 o'clock. Children's films should be an escape from reality, not an escape to ridicule. What happened to the good manners and the happy ending of the children's films? That's why Disney's old movies like Beauty and the Beast, Lady and the Tramp, The Little Mermaid etc. are classics. If you want your children to see a great cartoon that basically has the same action as "Barnyard", hire "The Lion King". You can get a great story without the horrible drunkenness, driving and car documentation of the big theft. The authors of "Barnyard" obviously tried to continue the big trend of making a children's movie that parents can enjoy as well, but they had a very bad taste. I would never take my children to see it, and I suggest you save your money and look at something else.
