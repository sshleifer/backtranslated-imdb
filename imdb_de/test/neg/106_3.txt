Dr. Stephens (Micheal Harvey) has a madhouse. He has a different approach to the maniac. He performs unorthodox treatments. He treats everyone like a family, there are no locks on the patient's doors and he lets some inmates live out their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier, and Harriet (Camilla Carr) becomes the mother of a doll, including the fact that she leaves her in a cot. Dr. Stevens has the judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) chop a wood outside with an ax. It turns out to be a bad step when Dr. Stevens turned his back and the judge puts the ax in his shoulder. Shortly after Sister Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the sanatorium, an interview with Drs. Stevens arranged about a possible job. She is received by senior nurse Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and offered a trail position. She gets to know the patients and becomes popular. However, things are starting to get sour, the phone lines are broken, an old woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut out and she gets a strange feeling that things are somehow wrong. Then one night all the dark secrets of the sanitarium are revealed violently. Produced and directed: S.f. Brownrigg This movie has a great idea that fits into a cool twist, but in the end it's a bit of a hassle to get through the low budget constraints and a rather slow Tim Pope script. There are just too many boring patient dialogues, not much happening in the last twenty minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it plays completely in the sanatorium and the grounds, which is basically just a big, bland house in the middle of nowhere. There is no graphic bleeding, a few drops of blood here and there, and that's your lot. There is a bit of nudity, but like the blood is not much. The acting is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photography is flat and unexciting and I can not remember what the music was like. The twist end is great, but it just takes too long to get there. A movie with a lot of potential, which was probably slowed down by its budget. OK, I guess, but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had shot 'Tales from the Crypt' for half an hour.
