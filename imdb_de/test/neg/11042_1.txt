There is a thin line between theater and simply coercion. Forced conduct compulsion takes compulsive action Even forced photography. There are people who say, "The movie is developing that way because it's from Asia," but I do not see any forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There's a thin line between fiction (and to some artwork it's fiction in a way) and just unlikely nowhere, and I just can not believe the fictional world being proposed. It just does not feel right, there is something in it or it does not click through it.
