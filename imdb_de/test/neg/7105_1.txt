Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of comics (but if the comics have the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe that there are any), but this must be one of the worst movies ever were filmed. Non-existent plot, ridiculous drama, stupid dialogue ... This movie is so bad it hurts. A lot of. That some people actually gave this movie 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. If you hate yourself, then look at Tank Girl! To another thought, if you hate yourself so much, you might just commit suicide ... My rating: -34/10
