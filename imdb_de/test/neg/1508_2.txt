Grandma, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends in a night of horror as a psycho killer wearing an old rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts her party. <br /> <br /> You say I can not judge a book by its cover, but it does not seem to be for DVDs: last night I felt like a REALLY bad horror movie, and since the cover Granny was shown a modest photo of the movie titular killer swinging an ax, terrible typography (they even use the system font sand, a definite design no-no!) and credits with absolutely none of which I had heard of myself thought it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> If a movie arrives in less than an hour, it really should not waste too much time before it comes to action. Grandma, however, spends the first 20 minutes with an unlikely group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely trivial conversations. Anyone who actually stays in the movie long enough to start killing (and I doubt most healthy people will bother) will be surprised with several terrible death scenes with amateur gore, a lot of horrible drama and a surprising ending, which is no surprise (If you've seen the April Fool's joke, guess what the phrase is before it's revealed.) Grandma is unimaginative, unruly, and almost unsurpassable. Avoid.
