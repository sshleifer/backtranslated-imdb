I've never seen the first three, but I know they're all better than this ... garbage. It's about a kid who is celebrating a party. Impressive. Sounds amazing (sarcasm). Is it? NO! It starts with a child lying in bed, and he is awakened by his mother. So the child pretends to be sick so it does not go to school. He goes to his uncle's house, gathers some people and organizes a party. I did not laugh when I saw this garbage. I can not imagine anyone sitting down and writing down this dialogue, thinking "man, dis! @ # $ Gunna is big, yo!" I wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I saw how I knew it would be bad, but when I see a bad movie, I feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. That just disgusted me. TWO THUMBS!
