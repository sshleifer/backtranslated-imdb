I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to presenting real life (in every way), it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. Nor is the Dominican Republic presented as it really is. In fact, I was shocked to see that the filming location for Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And incredibly enough, Cuban-themed films (Havana, The Lost City, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather II) were actually filmed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did you shoot the movie in Cuba instead of the movie? The Spanish dialogues with the Cuban accent are terrible! They are not Dominicans! On a historical level, Galíndez would never have been hanged. He might as well have been shot, beheaded, or died from the inhuman torture he had received. Then he threw his body into the Caribbean. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by choking. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> Acting will not be delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he's just waiting for a paycheck. I prefer the lead actress in Deep Blue Sea. The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban films, and the same applies to the selected location. <br /> <br /> I propose "La fiesta del chivo" (The Feast of the Goat) by bestselling author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It is a bit more realistic with the history of the Dominican Republic. The figure of Trujillo is very well represented, and the incident of Galindez is treated very briefly in this film.
