I was unhappy enough to see this movie with friends. What a waste of time. What a total and total crap this movie is! There is absolutely nothing funny, from the shower scene to the insulting and demeaning depiction of the Germans. There is no conspiracy, I hated acting, and in the end I wanted to beat John Leguizamo personally with a stick. I thought John Woo movies were bad ... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
