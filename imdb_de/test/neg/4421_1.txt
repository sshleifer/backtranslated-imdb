This movie is a mix of different idiotic cliches. For example, a girl who has spoiled herself with the boys and makes them fall in love with him by molesting them in college (an overexposed backdrop in recent commercial films in India). A male chauvinist glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (it has been used ad nauseum in several other films). As with many other commercial Hindi films, the film has countless songs that have probably contributed to the success of the film.
