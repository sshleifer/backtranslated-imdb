What a terrible adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizer play in a story from the early 1800s ?????? The only character who did not let me sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open and I usually love Jane Austen movies. I did not even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. You should have paid me for it. I do not quite understand how Catherine and Henry ended up making a passionate kiss when they did not have any chemistry or signs of caring each other throughout the movie. Isabella and her brother were far too exaggerated; It was no secret to me that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen films is the discovery that the one you think is good is not. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
