OK, I would give this a 1, but I'll give it a two because I laughed watching this movie ... First, I can make a much better movie than this ... in a week .. The special effects left this one out Movie look like a joke. You should not do such films with terrible special effects because people do not take that seriously. The acting and the direction were also terrible. The script had many storylines and the whole movie was not believable at all. This is the worst Indian movie ever made. The songs were bad too. Acting was bad and artificial. Do I have to say more? Look at this movie only if you are curious how bad it is. That's why I saw it. I go into the movie and wanted to see how bad a bad movie can be. Trust me, I've seen one of the worst films in history, if not the worst movie.
