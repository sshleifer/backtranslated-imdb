"The Sexorcist" is the most appropriate from a handful of alternative titles in English, as this is basically just a shameless rip-off of William Friedkin's classic horror film, in which she has replaced 13-year-old Linda Blair by 19-year-old Stella Carnacina just so she could show her ravishing naked body. I'm not sure exactly what Satan is trying to achieve here, but he seems to own only the young girl who plays her sexual tricks! Poor Danila masturbates around the clock trying to seduce priests and even her own dad to sex with her. The young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology student with a strange-looking friend (stupid yellow car) and affectionate, though zealous parents. When she takes a special crucifix home to renovate her, the ancient relic comes to life and Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Planet of the Vampires") begins to torment her. The overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three-quarters of the film, and finally director Mario Garriazzo begins the actual exorcism. This last segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests do nothing but speak a few vague prayers, but somehow Danila suddenly seems to be healed. There is not much Gore, the dialogues are awful and the producers seem to compensate for every little mistake by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why the hell are they referring to The Rocky Horror Picture Show?), But definitely not one of the best. If you like clones of "The Exorcist," I recommend "Demon Witch Child," "Beyond the Door," and "The Antichrist."
