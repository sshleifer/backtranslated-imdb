Made and released at the time the internet was just getting huge, this is an action that Hitchcock would have loved. Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not around to do it, and we occasionally find ourselves to be a thrilling but mostly stupid thriller, barely held together by Bullock's intelligence. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995 but is already outdated, and the number of computer errors and inaccuracies must be believed and you do not even have to be a person on dot.com to discover them!
