OK, it was a "risky move" to rent this strip, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. This is next to "Bloodsurf" the worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Shit actor, shit technical issue, shit story and so on. The soundtrack is not bad though. That's why I vote 2, not just 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actor in this movie ..... do not rent or buy it. Stay away from it and hope that this terrible, terrible movie disappears into an obscure existence and does not become a "cult classic". It definitely deserves no recognition.
