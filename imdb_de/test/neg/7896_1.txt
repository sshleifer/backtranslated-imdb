The film starts relatively well and seems to come sometime when an African-American passenger sues an airline for negligence. There's a scene where his dog gets sucked into the engine and that's really a sad thing. But the way it's portrayed makes it difficult to figure out if this was an attempt of gross humor or really a tragedy to think about the degree of carelessness. After this point, they clearly had no ideas. If you stay long enough, you'll soon be treated to one of the worst movies ever made. Basically, it's an extremely racist sequence of smoke, toilet humor, styling of all segments of the plane that reflect African-American pop culture, and pretty much nothing else. One would think that the only three white passengers on board would lead to strange consequences, but none of this happens. They were basically just added to show how badly they could be treated initially and later put on the hood when they behaved. Avoid.
