As a nice anecdote to one of the comments above: In Mumbai, about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached to be aware of dubbing some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio. <br /> <br /> While I also speak German, I was kindly asked to do all the dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... Therefore, all Germans in this film actually speak English! funny, I made several characters. So if you really want to spoil the movie again, listen carefully. <br /> <br /> all non-Indian characters will only run with 4 votes! , , , ,
