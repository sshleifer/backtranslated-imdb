Like no other, this film illustrates the state of the Australian film industry and everything that holds it back. Great talent, outstanding service (especially from Victoria Hill), but a downer in almost every other respect. <br /> <br /> A kind of "adjustment" has not brought anything new to Macbeth (no, it's not enough to put it in today's Australia), and essentially it could not justify its existence, except for (let us make it completely unnecessary) to pay homage to the original work. If there is a job that has been done (and done and done and done) then it is Shakespeare's. Therefore, unless it is a selfish and meaningless exercise, any adjustment must at least introduce a new interpretation into the work. <br /> <br /> And that's what this Macbeth does not do. This film still has no contemporary relevance. It's the same piece we've seen countless (too many!) Times. Except for weapons and in different outfits. Aside from the fundamental flaw (no other way) of maintaining the original Shakespeare dialogue, one of the film's more convulsive moments is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot towards the end, though I turned off completely even though I looked at the screen. I never thought I'd have a short attention span, but there it goes. <br /> <br /> I suppose the film succeeds alone, on very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce first-rate acting talents, filmmakers need to stop being proud of being successful on limited terms and actually set high standards to show that they respect the kind of acting talent they work with /> Too bad. An absolute shame.
