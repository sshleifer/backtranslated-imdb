I can not believe that I bought this movie on DVD. I do not remember that it was shown on TV last year. Why on earth could not they just have made a real sequel to one of the best Christmas movies of all time? Damn and Randy Quaid looks like he's been on the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I did not know anything about this movie until I bought it tonight and thought I would check it on IMDb and see how it was rated. Boy, I made a mistake. If you are reading this, be forewarned and stay the first Christmas holidays. At least I did not pay more than $ 10 for it. Maybe I can trade it and return half of it to Tower Records. Then again maybe not. PS: I still have not seen it, my dvd player played fritz tonight and saw another wonderful movie, The Chronicles of Riddick (Unrated Director's Cut) with a strange hoo.
