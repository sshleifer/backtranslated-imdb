Ego. It's the only reason why this movie was made. This film is so wrong in many ways that it is beneath its dignity to write much about it. Each character was only good at praising himself and starring (I use this term generously as the director) as a stone figure to call. The little story fails because of the basic aspects like logic, feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. gross mistakes are everywhere (characters are not defined, potential husbands are found overnight, broken car windows repair among others) <br /> <br /> Let's face it, Himesh can not act. Also it does not seem Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she is still a chubby kid who looks older than she is thanks to tons of make-up. Raj Babbar overreacts and makes his little presence as wrong as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a bit too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural talent. <br /> <br /> A few questions come to my mind: how can such a film cost 500,000,000 rupees? Where did the money go? Certainly that a chase was shot moderately well and Mallika Sherawat for 15 minutes and 2 songs an obscene Rs. But the sheer stupidity of the film makes the head overwhelmed. (including 3 Mumbai auto rickshaws popping up and jumping on a police car) <br /> <br /> The Good: Himesh shows courage by making fun of his nasal voice and his trademark "Topi". Let's give the devil his right: Himesh, as always, gives good music. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Direction, Story, Himesh's vocals are still hard to ignore <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Dialogs and everything else !!! <br /> <br /> Closing words: painful in the truest sense of the word! Watch this movie only if you love Subhash Ghais "Yaadein"
