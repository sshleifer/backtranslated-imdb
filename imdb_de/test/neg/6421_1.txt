Good Lord! This movie must have a new classification on the cover: "Only see if you have absolutely nothing else to do!". I'm disappointed. I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend. I needed an adrenaline rush and that incredible tingling that went down my spine. But this movie did not do it. A pretty good story, but pretty horrible drama, dialogue and movie. It was disconnected and sometimes completely silly. We had actors who were looking in the wrong direction of the camera, people were talking loudly (of themselves) and telling what they feel and what's going to happen, shadows of equipment in some settings, stupid stereotypes like "I just need you to me hold on "in completely wrong places and situations. Thanks for letting me unload and I'm sorry if I insulted someone, but it was a waste of time and money.
