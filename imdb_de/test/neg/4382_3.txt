I bought this movie for $ 1.50 from the local Family Video, which was probably the first sign that it would not be good. I saw it with two friends and nobody wanted to finish it because the movie is so awful. Strangely, I could not stop looking at it. But this movie is definitely a textbook about not making a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough and sounds great: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he has placed behind bars. The serial killer flees and his nightmares become reality again. Serial murder, Norris, Roundhouse kicks ... that sounds like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And some of them are pretty good. The flashback scene in which a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene in which a van falls off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing - and I learned how to get out of jail with nothing As chapstick, gunpowder and dentist can break out flossing. But a lot is wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First: The editor is an idiot. When making an action or suspension movie, you need to keep the energy moving. There are far too many scenes that are not critical to the plot in this film, slowing it down and distracting it from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the stimulation had improved and the movie would be a little better. Two: The sound guy is an idiot. Apparently someone has tried to film most of this movie in an area where you do not get a decent sound. Therefore, most of the dialogue is finished, the stereo is destroyed and not lined up with the mouths. In addition, the music is far too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The casting director is an idiot. They occupy Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, the Hills Have Eyes and others) and would have made the right serial killer or some kind of rogue. His character is so vanilla that Drago's skills are wasted. Four: The writer is an idiot. There are two acts in this film - the hunt for a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw this woman on the screen, I wanted to scratch my eyes out. And really, she never got involved in the other plot and made her story completely pointless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever watch this again? Could be. But if you do not remaster this movie at least a dozen times, you should never do that. Not recommended.
