I decided to watch this movie because it was described as the "scariest movie of all time". I expected that. Unfortunately, I found out that the movie did not have a single scary moment (and I'm the guy that jumps very easily). The movie was nothing but horrible clich√©s and every time there was a bounce, it was incredibly obvious. The pros of this movie would be the music and the weird scene that was actually well recorded (like the last scene when she opens the door and you see Do doing in the mirror image and when she swings back to him, you see the ghost on his shoulders). Overall, the film did not add anything new to the J-horror genre and lacked creativity and fear.
