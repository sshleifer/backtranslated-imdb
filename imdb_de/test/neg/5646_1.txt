Have you ever noticed how many really bad movies attract so many 10/10 votes? It's not much of a mystery how that happens, but it's not a big movie. There are two ways to see it in the mail on Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can not complain too much. 2. It's free, so it can not be much. <br /> <br /> My voice is number 2. The free DVD in the Sunday papers is a current trend and some great old films have been awarded. They are the ones who have been out for ages, earning the most money they'll ever make. So it's anything but a bonus. It's the last stop for old movies, not the first for new ones. So you can guess how bad it must be to skip TV and DVD rental Derek Jacobi is as good as Dickens. The minuses are a longer list. Trying is not the same as success for poor Vinnie and Jacobi's other trampy character is talkative ham that's gone. The story is very weak. The story of Dickens has nothing to do with the murders of the movie and feels like another movie was being tapped into the screenplay to make people believe it was a British Dan Brown without religion. The cast is either there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave has to be really tough) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. It is also very, very long for what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, who carries his priceless Dickens story all over his jacket pocket, is good for a few laughs, but that's about it. Not funny and not for free.
