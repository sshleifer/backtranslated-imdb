This low-budget movie about a writer who works in a London casino has a horrible script, wood performances and not much to recommend. Of course it will appeal to highblowers for whom "mainstream" is a curse word, and who automatically add 20 IQ points if they hear a British accent (apologizes to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (did he still write a book or not?), clich√©s (relationship problems: she works days, he works nights), and gives as little insight into such basics as motivation the characters that it only requires a voice-over narrative to move down the story. <br /> <br /> To save the audience from falling asleep, it contains a street fighting scene that is as realistic as a high school production by Julius Caesar. <br /> <br /> If you have a dialogue with the sparkling dialogue like "I see your ten, and force you to do twenty," then RUN to see this movie. Otherwise you save your money. <br /> <br />
