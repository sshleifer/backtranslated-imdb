After his father's suicide, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray Boom Boom Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and travels with him to Las Vegas to become a boxer. In the street, they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals) while hitchhiking, they take her and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny to be Charlie's couch, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after battling him, becomes his manager, promoting Charlie's career. This movie is so boring that it does not deserve to spend a lot of time writing about it. I do not like boxing, but sometimes I watch an interesting movie about this topic. But that is terrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, with a terrible protagonist, a mere waste of time. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Corpo e Alma '(` Body and Soul')
