This movie was so bad that it was funny! For a while, I thought I was actually watching a spoof of a bad movie (a la "For Your Consideration"). The "cliffhanger" scene at the end made me laugh until my heart ached. The script was awful enough, but paired with Sean Young's dreadful acting - especially as she explains the entire plot in detail (including flashbacks) while hanging on a cliff - makes it a really classically bad movie that pays off see! In fact, the wrong shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can not believe how this thing was done. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star actors get connected? Were you at low career opportunities? Ask questions.
