This movie was not good at all. I could see it at a film festival and did not appreciate the content that I had to look at. It's a well shot film about the family that wants to reunite after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union). The movie stars Billy Dee Williams as the brother of Gabrielle's Union. Well, indeed, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the wife Billy Dee Williams was an older sister. That had to be Billy Dee Williams's worst performance in his career. He looked like he did not remember his lines in some scenes. He was an unlikely, barely sensitive character who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman he already had a daughter with. The two daughters are now older and while the daughter he had with the white wife (Lucy) tries to connect with him, his other daughter did not want to have anything to do with him. Billy Dee's character was so wretched that the only way to have him fly over to Paris for the funeral of his sister was to tell him that the funeral was over and that his deceased sister had left him in charge of the paperwork. Why did you have to fool him? Because he did not like to attend funerals. I know. They ask, "But he did not want to attend the funeral of his own sister?" Yes! He claims he does not like being the forced feelings of feelings shared by the people who pay their respects. He did not want to have anything to do with it. Now suppose we have to empathize with this hole? The rest of the film's performances were flat with equally flat characters. The director and the editor were not interested in taking the tempo of the film into account. The flashbacks were painful to look at. It was a bad movie. However, it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that celebrates the dependency of Afro-Americans on the Caucasians to find a love to settle with, even if it's a healthy relationship. When lame love stories such as these win the best among the festivals at the Schwarzfilmfestivals, I leave the verdict of the black people in the film in question. These festivals will only win films that feature educational films about African American culture and black movies directed by Caucasian directors. I'm not saying that there's something wrong with a white guy writing stories for colored people. The problem with these films is that they never argue from both sides, which is usually the movies that actually speak to the masses. These films are often one-sided forms of didactics. These films can not fully exploit the powers of both sides of the argument that the movie revolves around. The authors and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your conclusive statement with as much truth and energy as the ones that reinforce them. These films always tend to fight. What I mean by that is the people who run these black film festivals that judge a movie out of pure content, which for me means directing, acting, cinematography, editing, etc., or they are strictly filming the transmitted message about the African American Culture? Suppose a movie like Constellation in the world goes against movies like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways"? What happened when the movie is entertaining? By entertainment I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen and investing enormous concentration and energy in what one hopes to do to make a satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. Why can not these festivals appreciate films that convey their message without preaching? Why can these black film festivals recognize unrecognized films that are brutally honest and tell the truth? "I believe we are not responsible for curing social ills or renewing the belief in humanity, raising the spirits of society, or even expressing our inner self, we have only one responsibility: to tell the truth." - Robert McKee. I totally agree with that. The same black film festivals set "Hustle and Flo" like a terrible movie that stereotyped blacks. It is, however, an honest movie about a pimp with a dream. A pimp can not dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp, that he was human. And is not pimping and prostitution a harsh reality in our society, not just in the black community, but everywhere? The rulers in "black Hollywood" believe that movies like this make the African Americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others do not know that there are pimps in the hood. The truth is, until African Americans in the movie can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share them with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. This movie was awful. The best was the camera and Zoe.
