Great ensemble members, but unfortunately a number of undeveloped ideas that affect the film. In the end, you do not feel fulfilled after waiting for a kind of inference, closure, or at least an ironic twist. <br /> <br /> It felt like this familiar "curb" without daring me to say it exactly the opposite. The music was there, the "Show About Nothing" scenes appear, but without a common thread or occasion - it's a solo project that has run short of budget. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: The movie title speaks of cheese, but she prefers the rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers any junk food, regardless of the date of sale. Maybe I would like someone to eat "cheese dogs" or ice cream in a pirate suit, at least some scenes tied together. <br /> <br /> Marty: That's just not funny and over the top. People just do not care about a "show" within a show. A coffee table over coffee books was funnier. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of the cast, save time and eat some cheese. It does not even have to be with somebody.
