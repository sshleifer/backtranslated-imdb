This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This movie makes Friday the 13th look like a Best Picture nominee. Acting is crap. The special effects are crap. Nobody dies for about 40 minutes and all that people do is act badly. The only thing that saves it is the ability to make you laugh about the stupidity that is going on. The funniest part is seeing the heroine "fighting" the attacker. She is to be trained, but she fights like a 70-year-old. They spend mindless scenes with people who do not die, and no scenes with people who die so far that they do not even know why they are dying. I love Slashers, but that's just crap.
