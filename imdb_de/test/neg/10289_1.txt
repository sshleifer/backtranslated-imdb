This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked that it's even in the IMDb library. And Bill, Julia and all the other "professional" actors should be ashamed to be part of this medical film. I thought I would look at a somewhat classic horror movie with a creative ending that writers like to invent ... that usually makes no sense in writing a horror movie, but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand. This end was not creative. It was sick and has all the features of a snuff film. I am shocked that it has been edited to this end, and it is even more shocking that it will be released by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It's harmful to innocent minds on many levels ... look at the movie and the end, and you'll understand that statement. Also, in the plot is a sweet little girl "not yet 9", her character says. She's not at the snuff-end, but she's an integral part of the movie. Why do directors think they need to be shocked with a medical film in order to receive recognition? The director is in the wrong line when she thinks this is an art film.
