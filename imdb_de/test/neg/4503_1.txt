yeesh, talk about craptastic.this thing is brutal.horrible dubbing, even more terrible drama and no recognizable plot. Obviously there are some great chase scenes, but the problem is that you have to reach that point first, and I just could not. In the 20 or so minutes that I endured, I felt more like a root canal than in a movie. I suppose I could have fast-forwarded it, and I recommend that you do the same, unless you have extremely extreme pain tolerance or a masochist. I do not fall into any of the categories. I still have a migraine from this thing, so I'm about to do a dental surgery without anesthesia. Just experience the migraine.Bottom line, terrible. 0/10
