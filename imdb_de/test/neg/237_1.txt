The robot vs. The Aztec mummy was one of the stupidest and least credible movies I've ever seen. OK, I can buy that the woman in the movie is a reincarnation of a virgin sacrificed to an Aztec god. What I can not buy is the incredibly fake mummy and the even worse-looking robot. If you want to watch a movie like this, you want to see a lot of combat action. But the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute! The worst was probably the art of the Dia de los Muertos, which they had in the credits. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Avoid this if possible.
