With No Dead Heroes, you get dumb lines like this angry, heinous action movie to be seen. William Sanders is rescued by his buddy Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam, but is captured by the enemy. Ten years on and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian employee with a mind-control microchip in his brain. His new Russian boss is Ivan, who was played by Nick Nicholson to the obscene grip. I would like to add that he not only once tries to speak Russian accents, but rather resembles a tank warden in Kentucky with his blotchy teeth. Even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialogue coach for this film. Soon, William is recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry. He's working with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp, and they are soon blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so terribly awful that it's a miracle that this film has no cult incentives. One such scene is the sudden love play in the jungle of William and Barbara, accompanied by the most unsuitable background music I've ever heard. Who would be completely naked in the middle of the South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the ending theme of Blood on Satan's Claw. No Dead Heroes is the magical movie champion of all time, as one shot leads to several kills. In one scene, Harry hurls his rifle behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find movie that was recently covered by MGM with Full HD. Follow this movie and watch the sheer stupidity.
