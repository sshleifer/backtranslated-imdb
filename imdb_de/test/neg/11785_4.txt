I think Walter Pidgeon was a big failure in this movie. Just not credible to the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and played her role well enough. Nobody else was memorable. <br /> <br /> I remember the TV series that I had replaced as a small child from this movie. I even think I have a "Seaview" made of plastic, which was submerged and great for playing in the bathtub. A long time ago. <br /> <br /> Some other criticisms that I have read for this film: It is certainly unfair to judge special effects or scientific knowledge from 4 decades ago by today's standards. The effects were fine for 1961. Not great, but alright. As far as science is concerned, that was even ridiculous in 1961. There is no excuse. The submarine was also very spacious. I understand that the Navy did not refuse any help for this movie, so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie got bored. (And I'm a sci-fi fan.) Can not recommend this. Grade: D
