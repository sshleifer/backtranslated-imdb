I would have given this movie a 1, but I laughed so much that I had to give him some credit. In the off-the-off chance, the movie was probably funny. A movie so bad that you think chimpanzees wrote it. They wish chimpanzees wrote it. The dialogue is so potted that only he and the cockroaches will survive the coming atomic holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by inserting scenes from the original Carrie (a really good movie) into scenes from this film. Like scenes from the Taxi Driver in Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone, as you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone nearby to confirm the badness of your ad. The worst actress of the millennium goes to the poor, poor Amy Irving as a stone, monotonous, catastrophic school advisor made of wood. The hitherto worst movie of the year (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
