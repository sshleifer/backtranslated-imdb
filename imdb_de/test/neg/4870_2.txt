This movie is full of so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it was made at all. For example, they descend from the Capitol to the sewers, and while they are in the sewer, you can see signs pointing to different government buildings, and then they come in the middle of the road! I strongly doubt that government buildings would allow public access through the urban sewer system. Anyway, I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value. I laughed all the way over the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie.
