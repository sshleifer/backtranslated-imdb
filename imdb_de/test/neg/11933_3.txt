The series has finally reached the low point with this lousy fourth episode which (thank God) was the last. None of the three sequels did justice to the extremely entertaining original, but this movie is nothing more than a shameless attempt to use the name of the Magnificent Seven and Bernstein's intoxicating music theme. The production values ​​are similar to those of a TV movie and the characters are unforgettable and indistinguishable: in the parts "II" and "III" you can not remember their names, here you can not even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for Chris's role, but Yul Brynner would not have been able to replace anyone anyway. Do not waste your time.
