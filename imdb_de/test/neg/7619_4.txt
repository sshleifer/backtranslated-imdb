I saw this movie for the first time on Friday, 11-29-02, on NBC. It was a pretty good movie, but I do not think it would be the Muppet movie that Jim Henson would do. Above all, I mean that Pepe occasionally uses the word "sexy" and Pepe says "it would fuck?" And I definitely know that Jim Henson did not allow Kermit to scream "I wish I had never been born!" thirteen times a minute. This movie is just not like a classic Muppet movie. Sure, I can see Nicky Holiday stealing The Great Muppet Caper's baseball diamond, but a business lady cheating the Muppets in a theater for the theater to turn her into a smoker's nightclub. If Jim Henson were here today, he would hate this movie!
