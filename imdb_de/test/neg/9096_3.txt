Gordon exaggerates the typical full moon fashion, but that's to be expected. Combs is surprisingly cautious and keeps his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to. Also the usual "humorous" black humor of Stuart Gordon has disappeared. <br /> <br /> The film is very effective in showing Comb's decay and his latest exploit to save his wife and daughter. One actually feels sympathy for his character, despite his inadequacies. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the nudity and the sex scene on the border of porno porn, than the graphical violence of Non Classical Gordon, but certainly something that you could enjoy if you have his more famous Have seen movies.
