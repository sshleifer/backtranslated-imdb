This movie just did not do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies, but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and if they chop on one of their feet, it looks so spotty. The same applies to the other effects such as the tongue torture and the abdominal sex. You could have spent a bit more on the impact. <br /> <br /> With a lot of sex (with pixelation as in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like that. Although bloodier, it suits me for titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. In these movies, girls are eaten and played with every liquid that comes out of their bodies, bugs and fish eaten in a rough way, and sex with all sorts of strange animals, such as toads, eels, and ... horror fiends to look elsewhere. No horror here, only sick and degrading sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fans should avoid this and try Guinea Pig2: Flesh and Blood Flowers or even August Underground Murder. Although these are not great, they offer at least a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in this department.
