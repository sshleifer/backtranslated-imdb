When I saw the cover of it before I saw it, my expectations were not high, especially as those horrible horror movies were blockbuster (besides movies like Junior). <br /> <br /> Okay, not only the movie has the mindless, stereotypical characters (the rich shower bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the locator, who knows what's going wrong in the city, and so on), but He has such a terrible dialogue, acting, directing and CG effects. The Jeremiah Stone guy was hilarious. (* SPOILER *) I'll never understand why he bit his finger out of nowhere when he held the girl hostage. <br /> <br /> The premise for the movie is just as disgusting as the other mistakes. From what I could get, Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger during the Gold Rush and a notorious outlaw. He had a shit of gold (* SPOILER *) and cursed anyone who had sought his gold before being shot down by the locals after he killed a girl, but he not only survived, but bit his finger off and ran away , Today, a group of unsuspecting idiots learn of this gold mine and are of course warned by the locals before "The Curse of the Forty-Niner". And what do you do? As expected, he ignored the warnings and greedily searched for gold. They get the gold and all sorts of sex. Luckily (* SPOILER *) the bitch gets her head cut off. <br /> <br /> That's it. If you look at the cover of the movie, you can see what kind of movie it will be. It's so awful that it's weird. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 out of 5 stars.
