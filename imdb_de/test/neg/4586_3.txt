THE PLOT: A trucker (Kristofferson) battles a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine), causing his other truckers to form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon generates a national media frenzy. <br /> <br /> THE NEGATIVE: The setup of the movie is weak and the end even weaker. It has all the Good Ole Boy / Trucker clich√©s without adding anything new. In the end, SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT will be brilliant and inspired. Kristofferson is too loose for a leadership role and can not bear the picture. Borgnine's character is awkwardly portrayed. At the beginning, he looks like a real slob of a sheriff overreacting to a small device that makes the whole thing roll. Then, in the end, he's a little more sympathetic and even secretive on Kristofferson's side, which does not work at all. In both cases, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. The worst part of the film, however, are director Peckinpah's attempts to bring a "serious message" to this stupid action movie that does nothing but slow him down and bombard him. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only Good scene in the entire movie is the fight sequence in the Truckstop restaurant. Director Peckinpah brings his typical "slow motion" with a witty twist and the result is amusing. Unfortunately, he starts the whole action in slow motion until it gets exhausting. McGraw is always a pleasure, but unfortunately she has little to say or do. <br /> <br /> THE LOWDOWN: When you read the summary, you essentially "saw" the movie. The song this movie is based on is pretty good, but the movie does not add anything to it and should never have been done. This is all very uninspired for such an extravagant director. <br /> <br /> THE EVALUATION: 3 out of 10.
