Really awful nonsensical garbage. This movie does it all wrong, except that the runtime is less than an hour. The gore FX defies gravity and logic. There is no fear. The spectacle is miserable, everyone seems to read his lines. There is a surprising ending when we realize that things we have seen have not even happened. Boy, I hate cop endings! They fill this thing up with long, extended shots of people doing nothing interesting (such as make-up or something that seems forever). You need to design a movie that takes less than an hour? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty damn thin. I mean, it's just a variation of the APRIL FOOL'S DAY movie, if I remember that movie properly and the movie was not that great either. The only good thing I can say is that it was shot well. Too bad that nothing happens, which is very exciting.
