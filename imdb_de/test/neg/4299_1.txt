I found this movie at the flea market cheap. I was so crazy because I thought it was a skateboard movie. I came home, put it on, the previews rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the skateboard was fantastic. At that moment, I realized that it was a post-apocalyptic movie, but I still had high hopes. This movie was awful. A friend of mine was stoned out of his head when we saw it, and even he found it terrible and a waste of pride. I always fell asleep during the movie because it's so boring and the music is so terrible. I do not know if all the good music will be destroyed during the Apocalypse and the music that's just kind of crappy will be destroyed, and the memory of how it's played is completely erased. What was wrong with the TV studio? I can only assume that this movie was adapted from an old Greek play by name and title, but some plays are not meant to transform into a futuristic sci-fi setting. Or at least not by the people involved in the film. If you're forced to watch this movie, all I can suggest is to take a handgun and finish before the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself, everyone will understand why.
