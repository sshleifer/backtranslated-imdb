I did not expect much from this movie, but I wanted to try something that I thought was primarily a horror of the early '80s. Although three teenagers are a fairly critical act, it is by no means a teenage horror movie. <br /> <br /> 'The Power' is a small Aztec idol who, as the owner (who must be grown-up and therefore grown-up) exchanges many hands ('corrupts') to become the vessel for the release of the idols, and often with fatal consequences for the owner's victims, but also for the owner himself. After several struggles to control this thing, three teenagers find out and can not figure out what it is except that strange and dangerous things have gotten going since they found it. They offer to explain to a reporter the situation that does not get involved in the spiritual Bologna. Although it's her producer who wants to do more research, especially if he can take control of the idol (I suppose the teenagers are not even spoiled enough to feel the dangerous wishes the idol encourages). It's a story that has been told a thousand times, especially in the horror and science-fiction awards of the fifties and sixties. <br /> <br /> At least for me, it was able to arouse some interest. Although the budget was low, it was obviously not cheap or badly done, as many of the low budget horror films of the past decades (today they have the same cheesy qualities, but larger budgets). , We've had enough of it, at least to give ourselves the opportunity to spend a little bit of the eerie atmosphere and so on, despite a history of clich√©s. And not particularly bloody, the special effects were well done. <br /> <br /> It's routine horror again, especially with the end (which has become an overused device by today's standards), but one that is not so embarrassing. Maybe it's worth trying it out.
