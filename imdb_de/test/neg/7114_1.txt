When you sit down to watch this movie for the first time, remember that you'll see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie that has apparently spent INSANE money for explosions and not enough for acting or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing is that I've noticed that every character is completely over-subscribed, and it seems (most of the time anyway) that the movie was "sped up" to get the characters moving faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was also synced?) I understand that the cartoon had this, but it does not work for live action. It just looks weird ... like the camera crew decided to act because they could not afford proper actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is terribly synchronized and the words of the character do not suit the mouths at all. I would have preferred subtitles, but since this is a children's film and some children can not read well, I let it go. But this movie has something very strange. It's supposed to be a children's movie, but there's a lot of material on SEX, RAPE and STRIPPING that's not really suitable for young western viewers. (In the Orient they have different laws and sexuality is much more accepted in children's films). But parents are warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, several scenes where people say sex-maniac, and a scene where this insanely young Japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the sex maniacs and her breasts shows! For whom was this movie actually made? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are ridiculous. You can say the spaceship-like things that bombard the village, from cardboard cutouts (or animations, I was not sure), even for a child not convincing. The makers of this movie have eliminated many cool things from the cartoon simply because they could not budget the money they would need. I did not like how the names of all the characters were changed. I wondered if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie to anyone. Kids, adults or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a bad representation of the cartoon, and obviously you'll see that this movie was rash and did not get any attention. I will not even go to the camera ... Just wait for the credits of the freeze-frame that sits there for 2 minutes ... Most of the shots are NOT ALL properly framed and the movie seems to be made only by amateurs. Also granular film quality. <br /> <br /> Everything is awful !!!! <br /> <br />
