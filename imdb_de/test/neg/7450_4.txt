"Ernest Saves Christmas" is the Christmas movie by Ernest. In this movie, Ernest has to find a successor to Santa for Christmas to continue. Along the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and steals something very important from Santa's (I will not tell you what that is, as with most Ernest films, there's a lot of slapstick humor too.) <Br / > <br /> This movie is probably one of Ernest's best films, it's funny and there are some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not being afraid to show love, it's not the best Christmas movie, but it's good to get you in the mood for Christmas, it's a bit sad that the movie is now a bit dated.
