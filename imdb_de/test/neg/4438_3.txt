The things that irritate me on the screen, the things I bother with the people trying to watch movies are the moment when the author, director, set designer, screen caterer or whoever does not think it to the end and by a single omission act - or order - undoes all other work done by everyone else who worked on the film. That moment of "Wait a damn minute ... what happened just now?" this stops the story dead in its tracks. (Not that the narrative of this movie has had much to endure, because anyone who has ever seen it will know that Quintet's narrative drive is pretty much frozen before the end of the opening shot.) There are several of those moments in this film. And you will think about it for so long. The movie is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably covered five pages. There is a lot of time to think about the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in a frozen earth. Another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying. It is cold. Very cold. It is actually very cold on the screen. The film was filmed in Canada during the winter, and in every scene, icicles and real snow and people's breaths are gushing from their mouths. Again and again we are reminded how damn cold it is. People wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and waddle like overclad Weeble people. Must have been a terrible shot. My nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero checks in a hotel room. Woken up in the middle of the night by voices from the neighboring room, he hears a conversation of crucial importance for the barren plan by a large grill in the wall that separates the two rooms. I'm not wondering why there is a comfortable grill in the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the grill was not blocked by the long-term tenant with the loud visitor. If you're trying to stay warm, the last thing you need is a huge, gaping hole in your wall leading into an unoccupied, unheated room. Trust me. I live this way, I saw this movie sitting on my sofa in the living room under a duvet with a hot water bottle. My breath was just as foggy as the actors. If this beating hole were in my wall, I would block it with something. Maybe not the best choice for a movie in the middle of the winter months in an unheated room, but the boy made me realize the lousy isolation in the movie.
