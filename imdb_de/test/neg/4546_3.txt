I'm all dead about walking, but my mind is still unsure if walking is dead. Unfortunately THE CHILLING did not help me decide. This is really slow because nothing happened in the first 45 minutes and I have to click on the "Movie extension" button several times. When the well-designed zombies turn up, it's too late and the director (two should have been filmed) has no idea how to turn it. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all seem tired / embarrassed / recovering somehow. I'll credit the movie because it ended before T2 and villains were frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD features an extended promo roll of that time, which lasts 8 minutes, and I would recommend watching the movie in its entirety.
