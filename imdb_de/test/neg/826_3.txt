Ali G was funny at first. His interviews were fresh and original. The idea of ​​a Scheingangster wearing OTT clothing and using street slang language was initially appealing. <br /> <br /> But this movie is just a repetition of old jokes, the humor was mostly childish and mainly revolved around the male genital organ.

You could say that the film was Ali G's last bastion of comedy. After that, he ran out of steam.
