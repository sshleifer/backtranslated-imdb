What a pampering mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, but it is impossible to find a glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, ill-fated and ridiculously amateurish fiasco. In a way, you must admire the balls of a man With fierce determination and a very generous benefactor, he manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused workers and a criminal English lord. However, the sound is either so self-pitying or so domed that it is impossible to deal with characters or plot. The raw material may be great, but Roy does not seem to be able to pull out the kind of story that should grab you by the neck, and then stir you to tears. And it's a complete mystery why it was ever made to be shown as a triptych of images - presumably because a single image would have been too boring to watch. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see so many good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick and Lindsay Coulson - the worst performances of their careers.
