An interesting concept turned into a carnage ... <br /> <br /> My first interesting feature by Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper). When I first became interested in it, it seemed like an interesting concept at the time ... <br /> <br /> Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix, which turned into a catastrophic piece of Aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name ... <br /> Pros: -Interesting concept <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: - Waste of a good cast - Stuffed and stupid Action - Blurred camera angles - Not many different locations - Fast use of Shakespearian diologist> <br /> Overall: Australia's worst attempt at a Shakespear movie: Stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (ATTENTION: This movie is dangerous)
