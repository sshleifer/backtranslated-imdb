In the 1960s, those of us who were bad movie lovers thought that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst film ever made, and will remain so for all time. To put things in perspective, we also thought that $ 3,000 means a lot of money for a new car. As we got older, our innocence was gradually eroded as we were redefined in films like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank," completely re-defining the genre of "Bad Movie." In this context, my son and I have "Alien From L.A." last night. seen that pushed the envelope a generation ago on an extremely unimaginable picture. To call this film "bad" (or unhappy or disgusting) is completely ignored, as are all other labels available in the English language. Even if there were words that could accurately describe this film, it would be without consequence, since it would be banned in civilized society. <br /> <br /> The titled Alien is played by Kathy Ireland. Apparently, she took some time off to model sports Illustrated swimsuits to start her film career. Your casting may be a recommendation until you actually see the movie. The make-up artists have made their money by making Kathy so unassuming and unappetizing that you do not want to touch her with a broomstick - no trifle. In short, in this movie, she has a face that would freeze Medusa. Worse than her gaze, however, was her voice, which was so rough that at first I did not call it human. Throughout the movie, I longed for a blackboard that dragged my nails over to cover the screaming twang of their dialogue. At the end of the movie Kathy finally gets a new face and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit again. I suggested to my son that the film would have been better if he had put it in the bathing suit at the beginning of the film, so at least we would have seen something. My son pointed out that if the film had been removed and stuffed into his mouth, the film would have greatly improved the film in two ways. I stick to the sheer brilliance of his observation. If in doubt, compare this filth to "Barbarella," in which a skilled filmmaker shows how he can capitalize on the fortune of an ethereally beautiful leading actress in the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> From the plot itself There is little to comment on, as there was so little evidence. It is said that if one million monkeys have been typed continuously for millions of years, someday one will come up with "Hamlet". Through the exclusion process, they would find something for the rest of the time that approximates this script. Imagine a modern Alice falling into a hole and falling 500 feet onto a stone slab, whereupon she gets up, dusts herself, and searches for her long-lost father in the city of Atlantis. Once in Atlantis, she spends most of her time fighting or climbing stairs and ladders, basically trying to stay out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers for his bid and makes Tiny Tim look macho , This sum, as short as it looks, is likely to be longer than the script. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you revel in the production values ​​and all that you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and haze, you realize that this is a movie in which you are actually on can see the canvas where all 20 dollars of the budget went. <br /> <br /> The thought that went through my mind was that filmmakers should not be. I have access to drugs and alcohol while they are making a movie, or maybe before, when it comes to results like "Alien from LA ", even though I have to admit that I do not know if they were actually involved in substance abuse, or simply brain-dead at the beginning of the project.
