Spoilers abound. They were warned. <br /> <br /> I was completely disappointed. This was my first STREET FIGHTER movie I've seen (dare not approach the joke of 1994). In STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA), unlike most Japanese animations, your attention is very low. The battles are made fun of aboard (Shun vs. Zangief was a laugh) and the dramatization is far too moody, especially towards the end, when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The Main Street Fighter Ryu has weakened to a much darker version inside. Frustrations in controlling this darkness become even more complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A dodgy street fighting tournament is held with more than just fights in the spirit of the organizer. Any gut-drawn anime is impressive. The soft nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre too intelligent and puts much more emphasis on a character (Shun) who is not even a video game fighter! A character study of more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.
