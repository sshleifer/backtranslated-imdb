Anatomy is not very unique in the horror genre, in fact it's not scary at all. It reminds me of his American cousins, horror slashers. It's just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a German movie it's just too American without adding anything. <br /> <br /> Actually, anatomy is too predictable and boring, its plot is not intact and consistent. It has stupid scenes that do not even fit into a horror movie. Funny sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why do you need everything in just one movie? They should have turned instead a cheap German adult film. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone because it is just too boring.
