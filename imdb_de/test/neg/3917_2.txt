Dennis Hopper must have been really hungry to shoot this movie. Cruel special effects, very bad writing, cheesy dialogues, stupid-looking bio robots. Do not forget the obvious disregard of science. The awkward scene with the two young linen undresses. The best thing about this movie was the ripping cyber penis on the crazy cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because I am in a generous mood.
