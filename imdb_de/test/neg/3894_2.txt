I've seen this movie twice, once a few years ago in college and again this past weekend. Although I despised it the first time, I decided to give it another chance. Terrence Malick is clearly a respected director, and IMDb viewers seem to appreciate the movie at least. But unfortunately my taste does not seem to have changed. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? For one thing, Linda Manz's story is terrible. Her voice is so irritating with that awful New York accent (please do not try to convince me that the Chicago people talk like that - they do not). She admitted that she had just sat down and talked about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She does not even play! I came on IMDb and expected it to be torn apart as their performance is just so ridiculous, but people really seemed to like it! She's simply unappealing in every way - I always hoped Malick would kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were fine, but nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent part. Except the old man - he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, how could Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid? He bought the "brother and sister" portrayal because ... um, why would he buy that? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be picky, as if they did not know that their lives depended on being very platonic. It was just amazing. And finally, after a long time, the farmer suddenly realizes, "Oh my God, they are together!" Then he goes after Bill with a gun, but instead seems to fall into Bill's hand and ends with a mortal stab wound. <br /> <br /> When we talk about it, the fate of the characters was similarly stupid (and, dare I say lazy) Of course Bill has to die - it could be more boring than being shot by a pack of policemen in a pond become? Abby continues her happy life, getting on the train and feeling really happy with the way things are going. The annoying narrator happens to find his dead friend and they wander into the sunset. But it's alright, because Malick did not give me any reason to care about the characters anyway. <br /> <br /> As far as the storyline is concerned, this movie moves endlessly, with no real twists or developments. I can not believe that it only takes 94 minutes - I could have sworn that I was sitting in my seat for three hours. The sudden grasshopper catastrophe was like throwing the Bible in my face. I'm completely satisfied with metaphors and allusions, but that was completely overkill. The message was: "Do not marry for money or bad things will happen to you." Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Days of Heaven", like all Terrence Malick's films, should be a work of art. And I'm sure that the cinematography is just stunning and the magic hour recordings give the film a unique aura. But I need more than beautiful pictures to enjoy a movie, and it just did not do it for me.
