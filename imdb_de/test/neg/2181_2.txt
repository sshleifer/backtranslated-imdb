I bought this video at a disposable table in the video library and expected a good cast in an award-winning British sex comedy. I think I should have read the fine impression. I rarely write a panning review, but this is it. <br /> <br /> These actors in gay roles really play with your memories of many far more dignified movies. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theater crowd, and all the beautiful films that have contributed to their reputation 'other highly-personable characters on screen with this whimsical-trashy movie? Can the reference to the Austen classics "Pride and Prejudice" and "Meaning and Sensibility" be something else? How much was it a political statement to produce this melodrama with these stars? Should we consider it embarrassing that all actors are gay and that role play on the screen can influence our lifestyle, then they also accept their private homosexual actions in our faces? I'm sorry, but I do not think so. I say NO to this.
