One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the movie screams "AMATEUR". For a film from the 1800s, everyone speaks of the 1990s. Acting, especially the people who play white slave masters, is terrible. After about an hour in this movie, I went out. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better movie on this topic, see Steven Spielberg's far superior "Amistad".
