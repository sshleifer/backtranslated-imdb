I do not think that Shakespeare is in great danger with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has lost her rights. His things have been taken and that really makes him mad. He seems to know who does that, even though he is a dizzying, swarming entity. I loved the two blunt men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard, full of cheap crosses and other garbage. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can not begin to reproduce the stupidity of it, including a snake pit into which the good doctor is thrown (beside it is a door so he can crawl out), a mass of metal cans with a man in it. The dialogue is terrible. There are long pauses between the speeches, as if someone outside the stage feeds them with their lines. I love the scene where the two little kids blame their mother for going out at night (she goes into that zombie state or something). But if you're looking for a movie that you can laugh about and never take seriously, look at it. First have a few beers. Like a direct line from Mama's grave: "Watch out, and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." What else can I say?
