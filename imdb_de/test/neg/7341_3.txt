This film was filmed in 1968 in Randolph County, central North Carolina, when a film crew was rare in that state. The sites were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural landscape. It is not a very good movie. There was Merle Haggard and it brought a few minutes into the hinterland. <br /> <br /> The plot is a standard shootup. Cinematography is the blurry stuff of the late sixties and early seventies. The locals were excited to be part of the company. <br /> <br /> If viewers find it difficult to find a copy of this movie, a copy of the LP will be available in Asheboro, NC. <br /> <br /> Not credited actors are Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull and Bill Nunnery.
