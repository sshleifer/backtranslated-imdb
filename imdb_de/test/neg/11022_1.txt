After reading some of the opinions here, I wonder if I saw the same movie as the other reviewers, but after reviewing my facts, I am forced to the sad conclusion I have. <br /> <br /> This would not have been one of the longest 94 minutes I've ever spent without would-be screwball comedy and one of the most inglorious things I've seen in ages. Do not get me wrong, I love screwball comedies, but this boring, captive Drivel goes so far behind the dizzying heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that it's not worthy of thought (to mix my metaphors) of in the same breath with these sizes. The dialogue between author and director Charles Martin is neither funny nor subtle or interesting - and there is so much of it. He also does not know how to finish a scene, with some reckless cuts, especially of people leaving rooms and saying goodbye to each other, the tempo of the movie would have been increased and then the fact that the limited number of characters is stupid and motive things for no other reason, as if this was a comedy, would have been a little less obvious. The characters in this movie fall in love with each other and fall in love with one another at a particular time, just to move the little action forward. In a moment, people desperately long for one person, the next time they marry someone else - after being courted and courted, we do not know about it until one of the characters tells us, "Oh, they marry!" (Usually after someone made a faux pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). If we had known that these two characters were in love with each other or were getting engaged, we as viewers might have experienced watching someone fooling in front of them. Because the characters just look like selfish, eager idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action is limited to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play. The only moments of boredom are Keenan Wynn, who looks like he has wandered out of another movie and has decided to walk around and be a little funnier than all the annoying things that are going on around him. <br /> <br /> Highly preventable.
