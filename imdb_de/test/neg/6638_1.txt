"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid movie from the popular comic carrot top (also seen in the 1-800 COLLECT spots). He plays a surf inventor who meets a man who has a flat tire. Top helps him out and discovers a few days later that the guy has died and has given his escort to the comedian. Even if someone else plays Carrot Top, it would still have been bad. The jokes (which are constantly being manipulated) are terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "change of action" should have been rejected. DO NOT LOOK!!!
