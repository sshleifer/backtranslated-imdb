I'm sorry, but it really feels like a modern Apollo 13 knock-off. Absolutely implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book, that felt like a bad high school movie project). Acting was about as cliché as you can get, and ... landing a space shuttle on a LA freeway? Come on. Serious. Jerry, what did you think? And all the stereotypes: the wife of the pregnant astronaut, the curious reporter who gets in everyone's way, the staunch manager with "Go Fever". And it's one thing to change the laws of physics or politics or whatever, to make a fun story, but at least make it GOOD! Fact and science were completely slaughtered for it. The space shuttle has no fuel tanks in the wings, and even if he did, he could not steer by shifting fuel (and no DC-10 either). <br /> <br /> If you like bad acting, bad storytelling, little realism and cheesy clichés, you can not beat this!
