I liked the Takashi Miike movies I've seen so far, but I thought that was pretty disappointing. I had bought it, but I will not keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has only two episodes. In the first case, a murderer abducts women, cuts off the skullcap to expose the brain, plant it to the chin in the ground, and plant a flower in the brain. You can see this from the DVD box. In the film, the top of the head is digitally blurred by TV statics. If you had not seen the DVD box, the viewer would not know what people were looking at until a young cop later produced a small model of the body. Strangely, later there is also a flash of the woman's head, which is not censored. Besides, I'm not really sure what was going on. Some women receive phone calls and a sketchy animated character is in a hurry when that happens. Sometimes an animated character also appears on TV screens. It is unclear if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are slaughtered and their babies are missed. Again, a police officer produces a model of what the corpses look like, which is helpful as the body is censored again. There is also a natural birth in the movie, but strangely, even the baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions were not retained during the original creation. Maybe even if they did, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they did not show anything ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear that later episodes are better, maybe I'll look for them. As it is, I will not care.
