This is a classic example of what happens when a sitcom is on TV for far too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes are repeated over and over again. OK, from the beginning the first series were pretty good. They had an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel), followed by Ruth Madoc, his deputy, a cleaning lady who wanted to get a yellow coat, an alcoholic punch and judy man, a bent jockey, and a stand-up comedian. As I said, it started well, but went much too long. After Simon Cadel left, it went downhill fast, you got dark storylines and a new entertainment manager, on which Ruth Madoc (again) rushed. When a comedy is shot in one place, the number of jokes that can be cracked is limited. Unfortunately, it took until every joke was cracked three or four times. If this comedy had been stopped after two series, it would have gone down as a classic. As it is, it will be largely remembered for the dreadful final series.
