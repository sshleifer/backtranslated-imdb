What a mess - and I'm not referring to the "destruction" in the title. I could have checked on the choppy plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast that delivers the worst lines of their career, and leave it at that. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... need ten lines to publish this on IMDb. OK, I think a DVD release with outtakes could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal the favor he has had in this case. Maybe Dianne Weist will show us the wallet she needed for her participation. Maybe CBS executives apologize ...
