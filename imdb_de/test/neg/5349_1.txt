Regardless of whether the prevailing social message of this film - this vigilante justice is acceptable - is defensible, I was more offended by McConaughey's final statement. In a drama in the courtroom, the defense's closing statement is pretty much the core of the film, and if the problem is as hard to solve as it is, the message is shared with both the audience and the jury. In essence, this means that the public considers the rape of a white girl to be a more terrible crime than the rape of a black girl. I find that very offensive. Incidentally, I found the drama reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to play her usual bubbly self (does not really work in a court drama), but what's the point when the movie's message is as bad as this. It tells you that vigilante justice is right and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
