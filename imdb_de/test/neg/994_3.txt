This is a bad excuse for a movie. A film noir by Busbee Berkeley? You're welcome! First let's forget the plot, a really simple-minded version of a cynical, hard-headed man who became a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what makes her despise him, love him? Together with a group of others, he helps keep a child from drowning, as everyone is swimming in a water tower and trying to survive when the water is sucked off and they are stranded. It's not exactly heroic, but she's suddenly excited. It's really painful to watch Claude Rains try to portray a hard-nosed, hard-nosed, noir-style cop. A crooked grimace, along with a growling voice, is his main and rather pathetic instrument. Most of the energy seems to be in the attempt to hide the intelligence that radiates in all its other roles. I'll never understand how he was ever persuaded to take on this job. Enjoy it, if you know the old cars and gas pumps for a few period details, but do not expect a decent movie experience. It wasted for 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
