"On a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a new-age update of the story "Pygmalion" / "My Fair Lady": A professor tries to turn an ordinary girl into a woman of upper society , Instead of using language skills, the professor tries this time through hypnosis and regression in life. <br /> <br /> You know that a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and costumes before they mention the plot and the music. The songs are forgotten immediately. (No "Bring me to church in time," I fear.) And the conspiracy goes nowhere. To describe Gertrude Stein, there is no "there". The characters walk through history without ever going from point A to point B. Professor Chabot claims on several occasions that he gets to the root of Daisy's problems, but he never seems to do that. <br /> <br /> All significant conflict is avoided. For example, there is a time when the University of Chabot requires either the cessation of reincarnation research or resignation. Now there is a conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Oh! Nothing comes from this development. One or two scenes later, the university changes its mind and asks Chabot to continue his work. So much for conflicts. <br /> <br /> The talent was certainly put together for this film: Director: Vincente Minnelli. Partly written by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, with Barabara Striesand, who was almost at the top of her game at this point in her career. <br /> <br /> But everything is going smoothly. Learner's attempt to revive his greatest achievement, the aforementioned "My Fair Lady," is doomed to fail, as is Daisy's attempt to revive the grandeur of her own past. <br /> <br /> If you like movie musicals, there are far better choices than these.
