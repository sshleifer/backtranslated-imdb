Wynorski recalls Komodo's curse a second time, replacing the intriguing characters of the original with a few obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a cobra. Most of the film is spent listening to the self-righteous characters babbling about the evil capitalist pigs, while between these cavalry of condescension are flashbacks to what's happening on the island before they get there. DNA experiments were done, living beings began to grow, people talked to each other without calling themselves morally superior idiots. It would be needless to say that it would have been a much better movie if he had done the flashbacks of the movie and forgot the holy do-gooders. If I do not forget it, there are a few short scenes here and there, one by one, in which the more holistic than the other person is gradually absorbed, but they are likely to account for less than 2% of the film. The main event, in which our champions compete against each other, takes about a minute and is as exciting as watching the latest Dino Crisis video games. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad overall, even for this kind of movie. Half of the actors seem to be more interested in uttering every single syllable of each word than believing their dialogues credibly. <br /> <br /> I've actually made it to the end, but it's one of those films I would have wished I'd recorded and viewed later, because there are many parts that need to be fast-forwarded. Overall, I give this effort a star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B-movie funny. It is indeed a sad day to say with sincerity that the creators of this film have one or two things from Boa Vs. Python could learn.
