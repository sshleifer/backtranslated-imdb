The first 4 episodes of Season 6 are just tossing, predictable and the worst scenario I've ever seen. Not and hopefully I will not buy it. Also in the past seasons, these episodes about the space they were doing saw even more. All I want to say to the people doing this is: do not do the whole episode about space because they suck. The point is that season 6 sucks even more than in the previous seasons. It gets worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and frustrated when I saw the first 4 episodes of Season 6 that I just had to write that. Only people with brainwashing can watch this crap. It seems that the people who write the scenario come out of ideas for a long time. Think that my 2-year-old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people.
