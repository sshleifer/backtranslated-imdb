An American werewolf in London had some funny parts, but this is not so good. The computer werewolves are just terrible: the perspective is completely out of sight, as if they were seen through a distorted mirror. The authors kick many of their gags in the neck. The American boy tells Parisian girls: "Is there a caf√© here?" Instead of just leaving it at that, they have to let the girl sigh and answer, "This is Paris."
