If this movie is an accurate representation of J. Smits' acting abilities, I think he made a big mistake leaving TV. Did not he watch movies starring "David Caruso," especially "Cold around the Heart"? In terms of acting skills, Mary, Louise, has done a lot better. Yes, it's a terrible screenplay, inappropriately edited and without continuity, but capable actors can and have overcome similar obstacles. A very big disappointment.
