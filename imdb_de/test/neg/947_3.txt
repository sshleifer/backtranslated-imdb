The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal is in "My Giant" is to say that this film was part of his career as "Ishtar" to Warren Beaty's - he did not ruin it, but he slowed it down. ..a lot of. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) Never play against a child 2) Never play against an animal 3) Never play against someone who is almost three meters taller than you, as innocent as a child and "works" one animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but I did not laugh, except in the scenes where Crystal is alone and not burdened with his ex-wife (what's her role in this movie) or the aforementioned giant. Did I mention that there is a kid in this movie? Well, forget him. The son is brought in to regret Crystal, and we do it, but not for the actor, not for the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you do not believe me, look at him in old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live". Rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally". <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more of a bumblebee than a fairy-foo-fo-fum. <br /> <br />
