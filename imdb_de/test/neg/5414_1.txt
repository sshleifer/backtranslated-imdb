Where should one start? A guy has an Indian pot that he cleans, and suddenly Skeletor attacks. He hits a woman with an ax in the neck, she falls down, but then gets up and is apparently unhurt. She walks into the woods and it turns out that there is a mall out there in the basement. She meets again a worker and Skeletor attacks. Luckily, like any good worker, he has a gun and shoots at the guy. Does not work, everything starts in flames. <br /> <br /> Some people go through the forest. Although they have wandered together for some time, they get together and introduce themselves. Would they probably not have done that when they met for the first time? Anyway, they are "covert" Delta Team members (I assume they do not have to be paid for uniforms). The cute girls are different things like a sniper teacher and I can not remember the rest. It does not matter After all, they take out all their weapons and immediately aim at different things. ? In any case, they meet an old Indian who sits outside in the forest. He wants beans. Do you know how pork and beans? He mutters something, I can only assume that it is the premise of the film. I've relied on having heard the premise from the commercials because you can not really understand what he's saying. The entire dialogue is a load of quasi-military macho BS. I mean everything as in every single word. Like "This reminds me of our time in Kabul" or "This reminds me of our time in Laos". Skeletor attacks again. Let me give you an overview of a basic attack. One of the female figures squats behind a tree and she points her gun at the approaching man on the horse. For some reason she does not fire, but shouts for someone else several times. As Skeletor approaches, she jumps out from behind the tree so Skeletor can stick her with his spear. Then everyone starts shooting. Sparks fly from the trees through the bullets. Apparently, the people who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. They do not make sparks. <br /> <br /> Then Casper Van Diem suddenly drives a semi-trailer and tries to run over Skeletor. He misses and the truck slips off. Van Diem is injured, apparently slipping over the seat and bumping the window crank or something so that he crawls out of the truck and explodes. Later he dies in the woods and everyone says some quasi-military Macho BS. They meet some guys in the woods and blow out their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army. They hit the boys for some reason, then they go away. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen, people mumble, the camera shakes, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it will come to an end someday. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the sci-fi channel is a little annoyed that everyone is turning their films upside down, so they all tell us how bad movies really are. You think our films are bad? Well, you have not seen bad. HERE IS BAD !!! Okay, now we've got that out of the way, the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Well, it's just a theory.
