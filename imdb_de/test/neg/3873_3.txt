The original title always seemed to me an exaggerated definition for a number of weapon-based seatposts. Still; Her screen presence has been underscored by at least one top-class group of actors supporting Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars for themselves. <br /> <br /> However; This first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group made up mainly of B and C list players, who were mediocre rather than great. It was a similar situation. Brynner's "Chris" had to recruit another team of saddle slammers to get a grip on the problems of the Mexican farmers. Another tyrant made them grief. <br /> <br /> With the originality and freshness of the first movie released, this remake had little else to offer. The budget was obviously very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the subordinate script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than the original by John Sturges. Nevertheless, we still had a repetition of torment and moralization that sometimes made even the first bit moody. Here, however, there was no decent acting, action or location work to make things right. The filming was less expansive. It was not possible to convey the wide range of landscapes that made up a large part of the original. <br /> <br /> General; it just lacked imagination. The first movie was a hit, and this pedestrian sequel was apparently put together as swiftly and cheaply as possible to cynically redeem its past success. And it shows. There is something like 'made for television'. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
