First of all, I want to say that I'm a fan of all the actors that appear in this movie, and at the time I rented it, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think that's good The main reason why I was so disappointed was that the outdoor box promised me an exciting thriller. In my view, a thrilling thriller for British movies is something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and leaves the viewer with an ending that probably will not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This movie started with the promising touch of being such a movie. We have our main character, who suspects a man he does not like, of being involved in a stroke in which the husband of one of his servants died, only comes to mind when she confesses to him that she is Was part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good suspense thriller existed here, but from there I felt that the movie took a different direction and became almost a kind of mild soap opera, who wants to be with whom and what the love of a real relationship is. The movie could have been fun if the outer box had spoken of a twisted lover's triangle and not been labeled a suspense thriller. This seemed more like a soap opera story, and the beginning seemed a slight distraction to the true content of the movie. I felt like this movie could have been a lot better than him. I had the feeling that it always led the viewer to a big event that never happened. So I have to give it a worse rating than I would have liked, and I say it did not meet my expectations.
