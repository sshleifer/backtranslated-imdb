The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessive horror scene of the '70s just before Halloween, ripped open the rulebook, lit it and pushed it screaming through a glass window. <br /> To put it briefly, a few enterprising Greek filmmakers assume that they have the chance to put together a new movie franchise that combines the unusual double act of finding women, clever talking of the American Investigator Milo and the stuffy but kind-hearted priest-father include Roche. An exiled nobleman gets mixed up in a satanic jiggery pokery - he offers tourists a very scary image of the Minotaur as a victim and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or something. <br /> <br /> However, the reality is terribly boring, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the young filmmakers spent most of the budget on board to get Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) on board, hoping that would be enough to get the crowd in the audience to influence English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> Is not. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with assured camera work and fantastic locations. Eno's score, though basically just a one-chord drone he's probably set off one afternoon, is moody and the movie is full of crisp '70s Crumpet, including the Austrailian strain of Fawlty Towers and the Hot actress Jane Lyle from Infamy. But that's where the positive ends. Sleepwalking through the room, he looks like he has a cob on his butt and Pleasance makes fun of doing his best, but never getting things right. To make matters worse, the character of Milo is frighteningly thin and unlikely. <br /> <br /> Okay, so it does not look so good. But from there, the movie simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an inkling that the indigenous villagers are obsessed, but to be fair, they never do anything other than mixing with glassy eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Only when you are certain that things are coming to a head, Milo and Roche ridicule the baron's satanic party with ridiculous ease and send him to his maker. The statue of the Minotaur dies away and he presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The lunatic optimism that The Devil's Men might be the first in a series of films is boosted by Father Roche's last line just a few seconds before the ridiculously rushing end. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I can call you again to defeat the Antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll make that call every day now, Donald.
