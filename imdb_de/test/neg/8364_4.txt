Last night I saw an early Prozac Nation preview screener. Because I love everything that Christina Ricci does, I was very excited at first, but as the movie continued, I began to wonder where he was going. Based on a true story, it is simply the character of Christina Ricci and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family, as you can probably see in the title. In my opinion, this movie moved too fast and it was way too dramatic. I would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie was moving through her life extremely fast, leaving us no room to connect with Christina Ricci's character. Christina Ricci's performance has been fantastic, as always, but Jessica Lange has been outstanding throughout the film, and I think the film's success will be all because of her and Christina Ricci. I would rate this 4 out of 10 and I would suggest that you rent these or read the books by Elizabeth Wurtzel. They are good and definitely worth a visit.
