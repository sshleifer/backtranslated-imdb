Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original caddy's hack. But there are legitimate reasons for that. (1) Rodney Dangerfield should be the Ace of this movie, BUT he did not like the script, wanted to change it, his request was declined, so he did not do the film. (2) The budget was low, Bill Murray was superstar status. Ted Knight died in 1986, and Chevy Chase, the so-called "ace" of the first movie (though it was Rodney), could not take more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him. BUT they had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all viable substitutes, none of whom showed his best performances.
