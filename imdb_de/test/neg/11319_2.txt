This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. However, you see things like PCs, e-mails, faxes, etc. that are used in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. <br /> <br /> So, when should this guy tell this story - in 2020. I wonder how advanced we are then. How about if you tell us that? <br /> <br /> There are also several legal issues that also make no sense. In the court scene, the story falls into the usual cases of surprise evidence that is inadmissible in a real court in this country. In addition, in most states, grandma would be missing at least seven years to be officially declared dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Elmo Shropshire. They are now officially a SALE.
