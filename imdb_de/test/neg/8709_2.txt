I had high hopes in this movie. I even spent a night watching Stargate for this movie. I found that it had a quick feeling, and many of the key biblical moments and facts were missing. For the 1956 version, I could be a bit flat and spoiled, as I've watched them every year for about 20 years. I doubt that this year will make it into the area of ​​the annual classic, like the other. If you have not seen the 19546 version yet, you might like this version, but I seriously doubt it and ask you to skip this version and rent or buy the classic one. This has a few nice special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I'm telling a movie like the Ten Commandments. I somehow watched them tell the story, and the authors did not do a good job with this story.
