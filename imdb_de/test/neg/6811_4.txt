I admit it this way: I have not stopped watching, and it's not a corporate, which is kind of cool. But my internal critic cut it to pieces - I see too many films. Wooden writing, the slang claps out of her mouth, without any flow. The aforementioned editing is a hit. Sometimes it does make for a good ghetto feel, but mostly it's irritating - jerky, quirky angles and really boring facial close-ups. The actors were marginal, though Letisha had their moments. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the audience should be interested in Curtis. The direction does not make you love or even hate him; I just wanted him to shut up and get shot. I did not care about his impotent revenge when it turned around. The completely predictable end is not believable at all. I am not sure why we should believe that some of his former successful traders are dumb enough to plunge into his little scams. "Oh, you just got out of jail and you're on probation - there are thousands of dollars of cocaine here - go around the corner for me, now do not steal me, etc." A good sex scene gave me hope in the beginning, but in the end she was disappointed. The handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-like, if only slightly interesting. There are better films in this genre that will not offend your intelligence by trying to find a kind of authentic ghetto realism more akin to a film school offer. 4/10, a F.
