The characters were so unoriginal that it hurts. The small, slender dorky computer geek, the funny African American with stupid clich√© punk, cool white guy with pity for cars and the pretty leader who finds the pretty girl in the end. The actors are mediocre at best. Ecsept from Norton, who does a pretty good job as a villain. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. All in all, it's a group of spoiled boys who use the world as a playground, where every safe in a big house keeps them on the table with food. I mean, why work when you can rob people? <br /> <br /> AND, ... who is making the traffic light in a European metropolis?!? And in the middle of FRIGGIN-day!? Think of all the damage and not deaths among innocent civilians. What about all the ambulances and fire trucks? <br /> <br /> I have NOT created sympathy for the main characters, and if Mr. Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, I could not fart less.
