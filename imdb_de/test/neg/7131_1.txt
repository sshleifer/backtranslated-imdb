That was a waste of $ 9. The movie was awful. All "scary" parts were useless and repeated sadly. Apparently, all the tense parts could be completely predicted and seemed to have no public attention. Also, the plot line did not progress at all throughout the movie, and it was all just a big shot for the grudge 3. If it seemed like the movie had a big plot progression, it was just a pointless scene. These directors must follow Hitchcock's example: Every scene has a purpose. Porbable 90% of the scenes in this movie could have been left out without changing the storyline. Final opinion: Do not waste time, energy or money !!!
