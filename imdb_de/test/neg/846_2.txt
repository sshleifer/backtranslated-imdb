I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came with his first lines, I thought he was just kidding. Cage as Italian ?? I'm sorry, but a very wrong actor who is also acting is bad, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very casual, it could have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other scripts. The camera is great, photography too, but why the hell did you choose Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role? Please do not get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, he has some really great movies, but obviously he is not for every role. It is a pity that the cast was not bettered because the story has potential.
