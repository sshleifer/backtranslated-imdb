This comic movie from Texas is about Fallon, a dilettante-rich boy from the late 1800s (though he looks like a 60s C & W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship is on an island called Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd ) collapses Captain. The count fears pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage, and tortures the captain as well. In the meantime, the creepy former nurse Cassandra Fallon tells the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and has gone crazy! Fallon is trapped, but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist cartoon slave. Fallon is thrown into the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it is her wedding day. The leper bride is horny, but Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra escape the castle, but the Earl and his slave chase them with dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love over the next year, but when the supply ship comes, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they are both leprosy patients. They live in the castle for years ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra falls to her knees. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our story of love and leprosy ends. <br /> <br /> It's bizarre, it can be seen and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.
