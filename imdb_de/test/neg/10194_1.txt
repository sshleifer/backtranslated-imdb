This movie was poorly designed, poorly written and poorly played. All characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur experiment. The film was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are more sacred than you, and they have no trace of compassion for the skeptics or the undecided. The film was a real "gotcha" for both the skeptical character and for me as a spectator, which brought us into a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and got a free passport for another movie. I remember another movie on a similar theme, "The Rapture" with Mimi Rogers, who was made much better and more professional. I think I will see "The Rapture" again. If you visit Unidentified and do not like it, do not say I did not warn you.
