After seeing Shootfighter 1 and the buckets of blood they had spilled, I was ready for another rousing excursion of open-hearted cardiac massage with chiropractors in a cage. But no, that was like the Barney version of the first movie, with this lamer from the karate kid. At least Bolo Yeung is still kneeling, though he has to do more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
