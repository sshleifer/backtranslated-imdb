I have to say that this is better than most SyFy trips, but that does not say much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game made out of the bones and skin of a witch's dead witch Spanish Inquisition (and no one ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway when the friend who participated in the beer race is killed in a way that predicted the game br /> What follows is a series of kills for a movie like this or one of the final destination movies are typical. It has the mystery at the end and the interesting subplot with the policeman who wants the game to bring his family back ... but otherwise it's just a mess.
