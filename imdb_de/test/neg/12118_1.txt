Friday Night With Jonathan Ross, those responsible for Ross must rub the sweaty little palm trees together. You know that the BBC lacks the imagination when it comes to talk shows. So if you have Jonathan Ross at your disposal, you can sit back and have a half joke on this primetime slot. Ross spends most of the show, which used his ego and smiled at how much the BBC pays him. The show is a complete copy of many US chat shows - Leno, Letterman, Conan O'Brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen that the mass work can be done for the stupid masses in the UK as well /> <br /> The unfortunate situation - he has no competition? Parkinson has gone through reality, he has never really had much to do except cultivate the celebrity ego. Can not we have someone funnier and slimmer on British Screens instead of Jonathan Ross? Once Ross builds up his ego enough, he'll move on to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room - so try to get along. If an A-Lister is present (which is so common these days - since there are no other chat shows he can turn to - to promote his latest movie), he will either flirt with them for the next hour or try to be your best friend in the universe. Sqeamish, when he had Ringo Starr - a man who does not care to lick his ass -, Ross really begged for his cell phone number (as usual policy on this show is that Jonathan Ross gets all the numbers to be in the right one Society is seen if not working). Ringo, of course, said what it is - and just said no, I do not like you - dead pig. <br /> <br /> Ross has to be rejected by all awards and TV shows - the masses will get over it.
