Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a police detective who used to pick up criminals, is recruited to an elite LAPD intelligence unit. This does not go well with Jeff's newspaper reporter friend Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a story in the squad. Jeff's conscience can soon prevail, bringing him into conflict with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, "The Hunt for the Red October" & "Backdraft"), the leader of the unit. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty routine thing, dare I say, mundane, cop-action / drama that has no surprises thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that runs from point A to point B only This is not really a reason to watch the movie. A sad sight, as the six previous films by Mark L. Lester directed just before this film (from Class of 1984 to Showdown in Little Tokyo), all very entertaining vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Chelsea Field turns short topless <br /> <br /> My Rating: D +
