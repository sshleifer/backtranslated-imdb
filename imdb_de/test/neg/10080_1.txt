They could have brought the characters to the island for some reason and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and at the end (hopefully) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been completely bypassed. Drop people on an island of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about everything that belonged to it. The special effects were decent, but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount theater near you, wait until it pays off for you. I would not even rent it. That would be too much money for this captivating thriller.
