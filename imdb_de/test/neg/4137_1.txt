A vacation on a boat, a married couple, a disgruntled waiter and a shipwreck are the reasons that these films begin. <br /> <br /> I like breasts. No question about it. However, when the main character allies himself with the one who has the most fish, mostly sex with them, and plays the role of the constant victim, my anger takes to a whole new level. Take two men (a husband and another man), put a pure bomb woman in the middle, create a deserted island, pull off all their moral questions, add a whole series of moral questions to the men and mix them she'll come up with a big bowl of arguments, fish and a Zippo lighter, and you'll come up with a piece of junk movie like this. <br /> <br /> Acting is, I would say, good. There are some Bloopers, but not many, as far as I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to their lack of moral values. The man with the most fish gets their attention. Although one of them is her husband, she sees no problem in being unfaithful with (Manuel) the other man because "I have to do it to survive". How can you justify sex with another man for fish if your husband is 30 yards away? And he will not even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no trouble justifying anything she does. If she does not get permission for her actions, she is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to watch this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make pretty much everything you see this year a pleasant movie experience.
