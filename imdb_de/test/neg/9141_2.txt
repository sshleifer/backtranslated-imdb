This is a failure that makes me so angry that it annoys me. <br /> <br /> All subtleties and structures of Reggio's early films are gone and there's nothing left but a mess of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be Bad Things People Do How can Star Trek similar wormhole graphics, slo-mo colored seascapes, manifolds of obviously fake computer icons, and recordings of athletic contests, which by the way show that no one ever beat Leni Riefenstahl Rotating bodies in motion, along with a superimposition of video colonization involving a "Dr. Who "producer of the 1980s would have rejected as" too cheesy ", results in a polemic against" civilized violence "? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these Reggio-assembled and mutated images and far too many digital-effects artists and the cautious story that I thought they wanted to produce. With all the "dramaturgical advisors," nobody seems to have torn their heads out of the feeling that they have something important to say and to consider that they all fail to say something new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much TV could make such a movie and believe that it makes sense. This is the kindergarten Stan Brakhage, who in the end is relentless in his relentless obviousness. The only irony and tension evident here (unlike "Koyaanisqatsi", where the relentless beauty and strangeness of the temporally altered ordinary images forced them to think about their meaning) was when the DVD I was watching jammed and was skipped. This is MTV for the Noam Chomsky crowd, which is based on reflection rather than reflection and means nothing. Two stars for the music, which is in Glass's best Pomo Cesar Franck style and offers a passionate cello by Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope for his sake that he did not have to record his parts for movie playback, there are some things you do not even have to do for a paycheck.)
