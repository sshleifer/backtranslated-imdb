This movie is hilarious, what's better than seeing two creatures fighting each other? HUGE CGI versions of these beasts fighting! However, I need one of the weapons used in the movie. Because they seem to use cheats. Count how many shots they use before they ... oh, it's right that they never have to reload. Regardless of the number of shots ... it's funny. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the movie for the Komodo vary from tiger to elephant. Oh, and did I forget to mention that these GIANT Komodo dragons are apparently stealthy? For even if the actors look in the direction of the beast, they are surprised when it appears. <br /> <br /> If someone dies, you can say that he's coming because he's all up in the air and crossing them to save himself ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The last gem is that these script writers are just a gland full of knowledge. With "facts" like these two creatures amphibious of comments like "helpless animals," they're just full of funny facts.
