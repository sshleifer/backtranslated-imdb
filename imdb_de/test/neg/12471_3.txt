"Tart" is a good example of the old Yogi Berra and says, "If you do not know where you're going, you're probably going to land somewhere else." Author / director Christina Waye (in her first feature film) has managed to shoot a $ 3 million film that ends up in a different location. "Tart" is either a coming story without characters that a sensible person can connect to, a black comedy without humor or a sexploitation movie without being particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the standard Swain movie, "Tart" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to deliver two extremely beautiful shots: the scene where Swain and Barton put together a bubble bath, and the scene of Swain in the park - with a beautiful montage of the sculpture "Alice in Wonderland". The symbolism contained in these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of sound) actually has a visionary talent and aspirations to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It's even possible that Waye sought a fusion of the somewhat expressionist "Metropolitan" and the camp's classic "Cruel Intentions," which also grapples with the Manhattaner upper class. There are many camera images framed by windows and doors, but few faces and eyes. The first technique pointed to symbolism and the latter to a deliberate distancing of the characters and their motivations. "Tart" seemed to invade the camp at least twice and would be well advised to continue in that direction. First, there was the scene where they try to throw the seemingly dead Swain into the garbage chute. Then there's the whole thing about the fact that her father is Jewish (played as extreme as Joel Gray, who dances with the Jewish guerilla in "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In her other films, Swain's acting technique overwhelms every scene she appears in (scene chewing here), but in "Tart" she actually shows the ability to hold herself back. This is the best performance of her career. There is also some evidence of her worsening from "willowy super cute" in "Girl" to hobbling lumpy faces in "Pumpkin". This transformation was about half completed at the time she made "Tart"; So goes the tooth of time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense", I feel better, girl) and Lacey Chabet are excellent supporting roles. The rest of the cast is just awful, though part of the blame is on Waye's writing and directing.
