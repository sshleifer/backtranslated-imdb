Occasionally there is an interesting debate in a talk show that produces some interesting opinions from the audience. Unfortunately, there are always desperately sad people looking for acceptance, who immediately stop any interesting debate by getting up and saying, "Everyone should get along and love each other." As you know, they will be guaranteed applause and confirmation as nobody would dare. <br /> <br /> Well, it's the same people who called this movie good. Why did you do that? UNCERTAINTY. Anyway, that's all I'm going to say. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off somewhat interesting, so you're hoping it will build, and if you've settled in with wine and some cheese like you do, give it an even bigger one Chance, just because you do not have to bother to move. But then you dream, you wander, your mind drifts on to other things, why? because the director did it too! He took his foot off the gas and realized he was honking, but then he drifts again, and again you do, the story slows down, the action gets thinner and almost disappears, you even wonder, 'So, what happened again?' If you think about it, your screen will show Nick Nolte walking around with a purported purpose, but you'll have taken care of what he does long ago, and he's nothing more than a screensaver in the background of your daydreaming. <br /> <br /> Michael Moriarty, who plays John Converse, has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or his face, something like a ventriloquist. He must have gone to the Nicolas Cage School of Faceless Faceplay or he was attacked by the Phantom Botox Injector. <br /> <br /> Tuesday Weld was to play Marge Converse, instead she played Mia Farrow to perfection. <br /> <br /> There are a total of hundreds of thousands of films to be seen. Leave this one to the last, you see, I've just spent an evening looking at it, if I could have seen or done something else, learned through my mistake Relaxing nights are precious, so do not waste one if you see this boring story, do anything else, dust off the old game of Cluedo, practice Gurni If you decide to go out for the evening or quarrel with a loved one, cut it Your nose hairs off, remove unused files on our laptop. It will be time whatever you need.
