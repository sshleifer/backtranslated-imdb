I love sci-fi and I'm ready to endure a lot. Sci-fi movies / TV are usually under-funded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I've tried to like that, I've really done it, but it's about a good TV science fiction like Babylon 5 to Star Trek (the original). Stupid prosthetics, cheap carton sets, stilted dialogues, non-background CG, and painfully one-dimensional characters can not be overcome with a "sci-fi" setting. (I'm sure there are those of you who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi television, which is not the case, it's clich√©d and uninspiring.) While US viewers like emotions and character development, Sci -Fi a genre that does not take it seriously (see Star Trek). It can handle important topics, but not a serious philosophy. It's really hard to take care of the characters, because they are not just dumb, they miss a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to look at. The creators of Earth know it's garbage because they always have to say "Gene Roddenberry's Earth ..." otherwise people would not be watching anymore. Roddenberry's ashes must be in orbit as this boring, cheap, poorly edited movie (without bringing commercial breaks home) trots the Trabant out of show wood into space. Spoiler. So, kill a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas again.
