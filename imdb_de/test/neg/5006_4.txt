It's very sad to see someone of the caliber of George C Scott in a low-budget thriller that would have been better if the original novel were written by Graham Greene and directed by someone with some more experience in the genre. NOT TO APPRECIATE A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. There are so many missed opportunities when the scenery and the carnival are glossed over instead of locating the film firmly in the exotic setting of the novel. Elsewhere in the comments of the viewer on this page, a very attentive observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. Since seeing George C. Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I have prayed that I will NEVER again accept a role that compels him to accept a British accent. Only now and then could he possibly fit for British or a very British-sounding South African, who was obviously played by an American actor. I can defy Meryl Streep's exceptionally hard-hitting accents (both British and Australian) - at least she's right, though every time she says she's wondering about her abilities. Well, I'm sorry that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and that only destroys the illusion - as if one had tortured Michele Yeoh to speak Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger, and so on. Peterson is no different than what we see on CSI. Only he is still very pretty in this film and more or less slim. He is the Harrison Ford of television. The same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. No second thought, Ford has two - perplexed / painful and happy. I have never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
