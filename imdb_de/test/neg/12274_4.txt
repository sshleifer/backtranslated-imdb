I expected a lot more from this movie than I actually got. Acting was terrible of everyone and the story was anything but impressive. I needed a lot that I could not track because it was so nervous. An example of acting is when Paxton's character annoys Vann the South Vietnamese colonel, so he throws some sand off the "sand card". It was impossible to get a picture of what he felt and his actions were robots. To top it all, I have no idea how to feel at Vann. He is obviously being presented as a protagonist, but as soon as he comes to Vietnam, he begins an affair with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the movie had was that it was not very boring. I give 4 out of 10 stars.
