OK, this movie seems to have been covered pretty well by previous comments, but there are a few things I want to add. The mad scientist uses the blood of a caged animal to produce a serum to turn a man into a werewolf. If we put our unbelief to the point where we can get involved, it's good. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would be an Arecoyote. In 1942, did not the spectators know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to distinguish. That is weak. <br /> <br /> Second, this movie was featured in the third episode of MST3k (Comedy Channel). Joel and the bots needed several episodes to get the full riffing dynamic, and they were not at the top yet. They added enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end, but it was not one of their better episodes. They never mentioned that a real wolf was so blatantly missed, and that joke hung in the air, waiting to be hit.
