Bad, bad, movie, so bad that it's worth seeing. As long as you watch this movie and know it's bad, and you spend two hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look spotty and the acting is bad, but seeing the faces of the actors when they try to look scared is just very funny. If your sister is being eaten by a huge komodo dragon, would not you try a little bit to save her? If she was eaten, would not you fall on your knees and cry your heart? This guy just sat on a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climatic is that? Maybe he should be in shock or something. He joins his sister in the belly of the komodo - oh, I did not mean to ruin it for you.
