Man, these movies are shit. It seemed as if seven different actions had taken place all at once, and all made little or no sense. The special effects, costumes and all the stuff were terrible. Acting was particularly bad. Everything seemed so forced, especially the lines of the woman with the big eyes and the little kid (his "noooooo" as he buries himself is so unenthusiastic that he is ridiculous). A good part of this movie is pretty funny anyway. The death of one woman, stabbing a knife into a toaster, electrocuting her, and magically transforming herself into the shabbiest skeleton dummy in the world had made my friends and I laugh for a good ten minutes. If you really want to see horrible movies, choose this one. If not, run for your life.
