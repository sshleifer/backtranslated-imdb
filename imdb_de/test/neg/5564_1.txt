I hate this movie !!!!!! I have never seen such a complete garbage in my life !!! I live in France, so it turned out that I was in the front row to watch this horrible movie. In the beginning, it seemed cool, something like a cursed forest where people are humming. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something completely different: a good start with a girl meeting a guy, and so on, then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of ravens trapped in her bathroom (ridiculous) and continuing to slip The movie goes downhill very fast, with a lot of frantic thrashing. The film ends in abundance with sacrificial druids and ancient ugly, smelly creatures that return from the past to kill a few people. At that point, many questions were rushing around my head: Why the hell did they bring back this terrible monster? Do druids look like maniacs in bed sheets? Why did you even bother to shoot this movie? The "climax" of the movie was so stupid that I laughed through and through: The "terrible" stinky monster battles with the two young women (who seem to be kung fu masters), and the professor gets in half cut. What surprised me was that the monster was so slow and indecent in combat, should not it be a god of war or something else? Anyway, the movie was a pathetic sight in his death throws. A brief summary of the content of this movie: Kung Fu Chaos + Druid Stones + Mysterious Murders "A Thriller" + Ancient Prophecies + Shabby Raven + Old Clumsy War God + Nutty Professor = Complete And Outspoken, Sick, Boneless Worm, GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM, RECYCLING, FAKE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: - Old war gods are sick at Kung Fu. -All young women studying archeology at the University of France are kung fu experts. Professors are so resilient that they can survive if they are cut in half without injury by a saw-mass Whatchamacallit.
