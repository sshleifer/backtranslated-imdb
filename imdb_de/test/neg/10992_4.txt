You know, this is one of those "Emperor's New Clothes" movies. It's like off the wall and weird that it's SUPPORTED to like it when you're really into film. Well, I think that's a lot of Bologna. Movies like these, hiding under the cloak of Dada or Surrealism, drive me crazy. Someone has this bad dream that may be caused by eating the above-mentioned Bologna just before bedtime. He (unfortunately) remembers most of it and then puts it on film. Sometimes I also have bizarre dreams that make absolutely no sense, but I do not feel the need to film them, exposing everyone else to them and calling art. Craziness does not mean that something is interesting. Real dada or surrealist expression has some intentions and intellectual thoughts behind it. If other people do not understand it, it does not make it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. Bizarre for the sake of Bizarrin is not good for me, let alone great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" to "Delicatesen" is like comparing "The Godfather I & II" to "The Godfather III" - the same genre NOT in the same league.
