This is a comedy / romantic movie by Andy Tennant starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. It is a professional dating doctor - Will Smith - known as "Hitch", who helps men meet with the women they are interested in. He is currently helping a shapely, awkward Albert, owned by a very powerful, famous and wealthy woman named Allegra. At the same time, Hitch is interested in a gossip columnist Sara, Eva Mendes, who was hired to write about Allegra. When Sara's best friend has a love disillusionment with a man Sara considers a client of Hitch, she plans a revenge on Hitch, and the misunderstanding leads the two couples into a conflictive situation. This movie is not meant for men. It has a lot of male fighting and both subtle and gross male hatred. There is also double standards that you have to see blind to avoid detection. Hitch and Sara are both very much protected from the opposite sex, Hitch still likes women despite his burns in the past and teaches men to make them happy. But, of course, Sara is a sexist fanatic who often makes sexist comments like "men want sex with everything that goes". She is selfish and knows that she looks like a goddess and knows that there are no 'real men' there. What annoyed me most was the "bad guy" who wanted a quick fumble with Sara's best friend, the classic example of a defenseless "victim" and even after being physically rejected by Hitch as a hit on the pills from Sara, whereupon she says, "Now I am satisfied." In addition, the "women are still oppressed" - sentiment that you get from Allegra. You must not spend your own money after asking for permission from a table of men. Despite all the garbage assumptions and generalizations - women can always say if you are not directly with them? - This movie has the point that love just does not exist in America. There are some fun parts in this movie, like Albert and his dance habits, but the movie is only slightly better than the horrible movie Honey.
