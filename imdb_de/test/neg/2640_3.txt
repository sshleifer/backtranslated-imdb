In a quiet town, a few girls witness the murder of one of their friends on a strange boy named Milo, who lives on the other side of the city. After the murder, his body is found in a river and declared dead. Sixteen years later, a wedding draws the girls back to their nanny town, and Claire, a schoolteacher, is obsessed that Milo has not died because she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying, and nobody believes her if she claims Milo is apart. Now she sets out to find out the terrible truth. <br /> <br /> I was quite skeptical when I came across this movie, especially if it had "From the creators of Anaconda" on the front cover. However, reading the weird little plot sketch on the back of the video case sounded good and refreshing , Guess what? I thought it was a good idea back then, but it was a completely different story when it came to watching the movie. It seemed hard to try to be smart and be very psychologic, but the latter element was not so good for me and it was basically an extended and mostly unconvincing thriller. Hey, I admit that it had its moments, but barely enough to neither cool it nor memorize it effectively. But a bravo for the filmmakers, at least the story is not a repeat of the Slasher imitators who followed "Scream" and shock horror. There is no self-referential humor. Actually, there is not even a hint of humor. Although it was perhaps too serious? Especially since the plot is quite absurd, but that's not the main problem. What a disjointed plot we get, I did not know so much about what was going on, as it seems to go over a lot of things in favor of some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. No! Rather like irrelevant scenes and yawning clich√©s that we occasionally see. You can also see some influences from some "good" horror movies of the 70s, including "Do not Look Now". This is when our main character sees the figure of their past flatter. The other would have to be one of my favorites "Alice, Sweet Alice," with the person causing the problems of wearing a yellow slicker and committing cruel deaths. Interesting idea, which seems quite flat and too many mistakes. I liked it more when the scenes dealt with the childhood of the character, because the performances and circumstances had something sinister about them, but when they lean into their adulthood, it is mostly tired and uneventful and the performances were not terrible, but incredibly banal and barely included is a good way to express it. In most conversations, I groaned in disbelief at how uncomplicated and awkward it was. They will scream "no duh!" on the screen because you just can not believe what you hear. The policeman gets the brunt of it! <br /> <br /> The quality is good - the movie is not bad, actually better than the usual direct video, I would say. Very nice stuff. With some imaginative and striking camera angles and a weak score that works reasonably well. Another factor that stood out and was key to building the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects, and the bicycle bell makes a ringing in the ears. The establishment of a quiet primary school was well done and the rest of the action takes place in a house. However, do not expect any real tension or surprise, as their execution does not exist. The deaths are not pleasant and they are slightly bloody and it is more like the after-effects of what happens to those bodies, which is trying to bother you. The villain in this piece, the malicious child Milo Jeeder, was slightly nervous, good that the voice and the yellow Slicker initially make an impression, but it seems to lose its effect when we come to the film conclusion. The cheesy tag lines in the video compare it to (move over) Jason, (beware) Freddy and (that's not child's play) Chucky, but you have to fool me! Law? He was called "the new face of evil", yes, sure. All he needs is to solve some manners and problems. Overall, the film left me with a sour taste, because I could have gone without him. I probably wish I had done it. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much in this blur of a movie. Or better yet, just skip it, as you will not miss much.
