This movie was absolutely terrible. Stupid premise and terrible spectacle of all. Who wrote this rubbish, should be hanged. Reminds me of a hamburger student movie, BUT BAD. Who produced that should give up now. I know that opinions are subjective and all, and some may think that this is "fantastic," as some think "Dune (1984)" was fantastic. OK, the drama was bearable, and with a better direction it could have been a lot better, but that was not the case. I do not know how much I can say more about this film waste than to completely reject it. Anyway, it was awful and I recommend avoiding it like the plague. If you come close to "Dreamland," lend the movie instead.
