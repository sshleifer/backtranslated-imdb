, , , and that's only if you like the sight of a beautiful woman with beautiful, jumping jugs running around in the so-called African jungle. Therefore, there are no problems for most men. <br /> <br /> I saw it as one of the packed packages. Forget about the storyline, which is essentially just a threadbare storyline, so that our heroine can light up her pitchers on the screen whenever she sees fit. Just to give you a feeling, our heroine swings from wine to wine on every occasion and climbs on the animals, with no reason to see their pitchers from all angles. Again no complaints. <br /> <br /> The "fight scenes" are ridiculous and borderline on pornography. Our heroine was caught in the movie at least five times by the bad guys. In certain situations in which she has to fight, "fighting" is to roll around in the dirt, not grun convincingly and basically fight like kittens. I am surprised that no hair train is involved in the hair. It got so bad that the chief had to remind the "combatants" that "I said the one who draws the first blood wins!" to avoid watching stupid battles anymore. <br /> <br /> The Witch Doctor Kuku was a damned explosion. Since he was a big, cuddly bear at first, his capture made him depressed and then a veritable psycho. He spent the whole movie with mumbling lines without insignificance. In addition to Liana (our heroine), who hopped up without it, you can see many other Amazonians as well as a woman who has decided to swim naked in the sea for no good reason. Yes, it is this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Liana in her bouncy glory. Although the film is more than 20 years old, the fascination of seeing blonde women with their beautiful jugs on the screen never gets old.
