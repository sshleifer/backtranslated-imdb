This vociferous, dizzying football movie by director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - at least except William H. Macy, who could have attacked the role of Mr. Stone, the team doctors, or the "fruitcake" selling muesli. If you're a fan of the fool, there are some great, profound, rundown, shattered phrases that you can try on two-faced friends and lovers of Way-Ward. The movie is sometimes good as a vivid background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; It even contains some MTV-designed music video scenes. <br /> <br /> ** Any Given Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone - Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
