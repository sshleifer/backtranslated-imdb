In "Red Letters", Coyote is in the vortex of a university professor writing to a female prison inmate and getting more than he expected. There are two reasons to watch this movie: Kinski is one and Piven the other, though it's hard to spot for their sparks in such a direct catastrophic event. With "Red Letters" everything is not right ... confused, lousy script, camera, editing and above all acting, which is inferior for Coyote is not worth the time
