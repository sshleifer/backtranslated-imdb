I like Arnold and I love the subject, but that was a very disappointing movie. When I saw the previews for the first time, they were dark and menacing, and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I recognized him, which made me believe that he was making a movie with a serious, exciting mood. That it was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (though I have to admit that most of them are pretty good!). So far he had avoided movies with a real religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. This is just another action, an explosion, a fire movie. And it is pretty bad.
