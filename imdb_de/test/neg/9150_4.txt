Yes, it is true that it was Jessica Alba who leads me to this film, because without her I should never have chosen him. <br /> <br /> But I find it long, boring and above all unoriginal. The whole time I thought that the story was full of clich√©s and directors very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and the author are the same person. I realize that I must not forget to avoid all his next films. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because there were all the good things nearby: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul, and For a while she has found a suitable film for it. Bob Hoskins has a great experience and he should have won a prize for this role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that this will allow me to open a world map to find this island, because if you suspect it will happen in South Asia, you do not know exactly where! Ah, the little airplane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie !!!
