This movie had potential. If it had been handled differently. What it took was another director. That's for sure And maybe another leading actress. I just can not understand the Minnie Driver character - or at least how she played it. She was absolutely incredible. I can not believe that she would have liked her appearance in this movie too. She was probably given up by the director or was unable to deliver what the director was trying to get her to do. I write this because I still see it. I think I hated to be in her shoes and "act" something I did not understand. Well, we just went to the thing that started with the son (I'm still watching). I'm starting to be deeply embarrassed for everyone involved in this business. If you like to watch movies that miss their tracks, then take a look at them.
