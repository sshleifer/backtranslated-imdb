I borrowed this movie from my local movie store and did not really expect anything to flash or fail. Because it's a "B" movie created on a very tight budget. The opening scenes of the film were quite original, and so was the storyline and that was why I rented out the movie. However, the movie gets boring and frustrating in some places. The story had many holes and the drama also had a lot of disappointments. At the end of the film, I prayed that a higher power would beat me down where I lay down, being extremely bored, but most of all frustrated with how the story went. I still do not understand what really happened and I do not particularly care. In conclusion, the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell (his domain) served as the basis for such a crappy movie.
