This P. von S. was highly recommended to me by two friends who have a great <br /> <br /> (similar to mine) taste in movies and more than anyone I know, I have no idea what they have seen in this movie. Sadistic, cruel, and repugnant is fine in an entertaining movie, but this is an effort trying to present itself as a highbrow lowbrow filmmaker redeeming social value. "Bill Pullman tries, maybe a little too hard, and apart from the child, the rest of the acting seems self-confident and somehow lame Blood "and" The Hitcher ". <br /> <br /> As someone said, this would never have been done if Jennifer Lynch had not been the overrated daughter of David Lynch.
