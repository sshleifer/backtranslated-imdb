Pooh. Even the ever-popular Diane Lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting thing about this movie was to see if Rourke's face would move. We heard so much "gossip" from his botched facelift, and so on, so we just had to slow down the wreck like a roadside accident. The action was thin. Here's a very professional mob-hit man who somehow joins a wild and uncontrollable punk / rogue, and we wonder in this movie why this guy stays with this idiot, not to mention the guy. Then the crime that was not committed, the pro has to persecute the witnesses. He would have popped her right there and there. But then we would not have had a movie, right? And why did the broker agree to the extortion at all? There were more holes in this strip than in my sieve. The acting was terrible, the whole movie was predictable to the minute and even the end. And so much could have been done to make this movie a much better movie. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and do not have to use brain cells, then this movie is exactly what the doctor ordered.
