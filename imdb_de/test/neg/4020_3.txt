This film earns its 3 for lousy writing, bad technical merits and continuity problems. Some people have given this movie a 10 - and maybe that's okay if you just score it for its fun factor. Technically, however, this is an inappropriate film series from beginning to end - produced by writers, actors and the crew. This was really the case for almost all series, as they were meant to be low-braow entertainment, especially aimed at the kids. And there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not "high art" !! Compared to other series, Spy Smasher scores below average, as it is of even lower quality and has major continuity issues - even for series. It was common for a series to have a "cliff hanger" - d. H. A moment at the end of the episode that looked like the Good One dies but miraculously survives when the next episode begins. BUT in this movie it is much funnier and ridiculous. You would literally SEE the hero dies in the last episode, but in the next scene, they re-shot the scene and showed that he actually DOES NOT REVERSE (though they clearly showed he bought the farm last time)! He always seems to die in SPY SMASHER, but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and he somehow avoided avoiding death - even if he fell 1500 feet into a river, into a circular saw or whatever fell. > <br /> Do not look at this movie because of its quality, but either to laugh or to see what it was like to go to the cinema on Saturday morning decades ago.
