"Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I looked at it with my friend and I still wish we'd seen "Because of Winn-Dixie" instead. I have to say that it is partly my fault when I agreed to see it with him. As a fan of the first "Mask" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious), I had hoped that it was not as bad as all the critics said it was for a disaster. Disgusting and senseless attempts to be funny made little seven- and eight-year-old kids scream with laughter, but the rest of us stared in disbelief at the screen. I was even startling for myself because I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman," two Films that many people I know were crude and offensive. But the thing is, "Son of the Mask" is not funny if you are not under the age of ten. <br /> <br /> The film contains a lot of CGI, but it can not save this piece of garbage. Anyone who allowed the film to get on the big screen probably thought it had potential, considering the success of its original. Unfortunately, it has not done anything to the laughter, the fun or the excitement of the first, which makes a mockery of the original movie. I recommend anyone who thinks about renting the original "mask". 1 out of 10 stars is generous for this terrible mess.
