I totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show. I'll admit that I saw 1 or 2 episodes last season and did not realize that everything was being replayed. But when I recently caught an episode, she suddenly jumped into BIG TIME and I instantly lost interest. Then I noticed the disclaimer at the beginning of a sequence. Did someone follow the show closely enough to tell me if they did deliberately make the "acting" and re-dating parts artificially artificial, or did not I notice that before? I'm usually pretty good at feeling that stuff, but the last episode was so obviously artificial that I practically tripped over it. Now I have absolutely no interest in watching and have given it up completely. It simply has no real value when it comes to scripts and actions. And at least lately it seems VERY poorly scripted and acted. The above comment says who cares if it is just about Nachstellungen. Without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened once". It's an info that's better read in a book.
