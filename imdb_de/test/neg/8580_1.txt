Admirable, but weak James Bond movie, mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) were a heavy failure. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. He looks and behaves more like the good-natured, but moronic buddy in a police action film. The director and writer try to prove his credibility, but his saying of lines like "Royal Baluga, North of the ..." can not establish him as a worldly and polite rogue. Savalas does not do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more like a gangster. The best-portrayed characters in the film are those of Tracy and her dad. But the performances of these actors, when they share the screen with Lazenby, only highlight his shortcomings as an actor. This movie is too long (140 minutes) for a Bond movie and does not excite up to Mount's escape to Bond where he starts to recover. This film is very hard, but falls short. Many Bondian elements are present and the climate fight is first class, but I always feel that something is missing when I look at this.
