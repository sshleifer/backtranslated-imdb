After the General, a movie that romanticizes the life of the Dublin gangster to such heroic proportions that he sickens the average Dublin person, Kevin and his attempted portrayal of Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, aka General, come to the acting so bad that This thriller is a comedy for the local dub and a tragedy for Kevin Spacey's fan. In short, the movie is worth a look ... No, unless you like bad acting with Irish 'real Irish accents', oh sure, to be sure'. The story was torn from the commercially successful 'The General', which, despite the glorification of a well-known Dublin animal in Martin Cahill, is still worth a look, domestically, because it shows the real Dublin of the working class, and on an international scale because of its true Irish drama and killer, including John Voight. All in all, "Ordinary Decent Criminal" is anything but a decent movie. Avoid.
