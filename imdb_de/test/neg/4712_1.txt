An annoying and talentless American documentary filmmaker learns of a legendary <br /> <br /> South African monster, the Half-Caste. Tradition says that it is a half-human, half-Leopard creature whose closest parallel is that of the werewolf of European tradition. Instead of focusing on the creature, the film follows the movements of the film crew. There is little action or suspense until late in the movie. This problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating characters that produce an incessant amount of even more irritating conversations. The basic premise is wasted as it is offset by the inexplicable focus on the documentation team. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Nevertheless, the film fails on most levels. Avoid at all costs.
