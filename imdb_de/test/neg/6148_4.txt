My general feeling in this film is that it was a slow, tedious, non-structured ramble through some of the truly unfortunate worlds of the world with a bit of salvation and an obvious message. For the most part, the film consists of rather uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits, with bad reenactments, all slowly superimposed at a snail's pace and with depressing music. Sure, some of the materials and interviews contain captivating stories, but unlike the description given on the back, not the story of the victim was told, but that of the director, Mr. Ripper, and he does not say it well This movie would have been longer and could include better interviews with the people themselves so that they could tell their stories. Instead, Mr. Ripper indulgently pulls the story down on himself and makes it a kind of personal journey, and unfortunately, in the end, it's not much of one. I have never really experienced a sense of growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what made the subject matter at all. He simply drags us from one place to another, easily stroking the situation and the characters, hanging around, showing too many uneventful slow-motion shots of people walking through the streets, and then driving to his next destination. He does this over and over again and again without real development. I felt that this movie could have been reduced to 45 minutes, but it retires to almost two devastatingly slow hours. We feel morally obligated to deal with the issue, but the director's director's complacent, unyielding and uninspired delivery will leave you numb after a while.
