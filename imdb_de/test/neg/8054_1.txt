Terrible is really everything you need to know. First think of all the things that could be bad about a movie. And then try to make a movie that's bad in all these ways. You have made "Vacationland". The state of Maine should feel insulted: it's too beautiful a place to serve as the backdrop to such a banal, thoughtless, boring punch. I'm a romantic, and I always want two people to succeed, and I've strived to find the good in this film. It was hard; very brave. I could not find a hint of emotional connection between the characters in this exercise in dull Tristesse. Except maybe in one or two of the bad guys. Maine IS a good vacation country; This movie is not.
