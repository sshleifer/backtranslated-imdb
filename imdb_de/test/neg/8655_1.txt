I would give this movie a 1/10. This film does not contain any common cinematic substance and focuses too much on the current "skin trend" in Bollywood films. I would definitely not recommend teens to watch this movie. What makes me really depressed is how such an impressive banner as Yash Chopra Films could ever succumb to such a dreadful production. You may have forgotten to keep in mind that there is a larger audience than the "adult" audience, which, when exposed to such crude films, can ruin their growing awareness and succumb to things that are meaningless and unappreciated. <Br /> <br /> All in all, watching movies does not just have to be entertaining, it also makes sense. Of course, this movie is a big disappointment for the fans of Yash Chopra, especially for myself. I'm really disappointed with the plot, the acting and everything else. Why can not people bring in a substance that you can keep in the movies at least once in the movie? The point is clear. I would like to briefly summarize my opinion: "Terrible - Disappointment - Ample Material for Adults - Lack of Reasonable" Substance "- Lack of Normal Psyche - Worthless - Could Take Cornetto or Temptation Chocolate Instead"
