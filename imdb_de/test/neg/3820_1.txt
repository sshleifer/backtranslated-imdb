This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. The plot has a potential that is never realized. The actors are a bad choice, but given the screenwriting, their talent is not wasted. I really wanted everyone to die as soon as possible so I could see something else. Unfortunately I stayed until the end and laughed at the murmur of the people groaning about how shitty this is. It was not drilled, after all, this is England, just a faint moan about how crap that was. Then I look at IMDb and see that 288 people have awarded 10 out of 10 points. I just can not see how these people can score that score. You must be a PR company that works with the distributor. Towards the end of the film, there is a funny set-problem. If you look in the graveyard and in the hick attacks at the shady scenery that rocks when touched (supposedly a brick wall) - the blood effects are waaaay OTT - the movie feels like everyone is making a parody of horror except the director.
