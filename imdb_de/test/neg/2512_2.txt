This is a pretty pointless remake. Starting with the opening track recordings of the original was a real mistake, as it reminds the viewer what a great bit chiller this period was. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays a "City Boy" photographer returning to a deserted desert town populated by scattered, underdeveloped, clichéd characters: the lollipop Daby-Doll Lolita, the old gold-tube explorer, the crippled veterinarian and his Asian wife, etc. Kerwin's character experiences "something" being plunged into a hill and soon after strange things begin to happen when strange blue rocks are scattered around. The temperature rises, all the water in the area disappears, people start to act strangely, things explode. Kerwin's character gets in and out of his car more often than is possible in a movie. The film develops no sense of place, no character development, no humor, no tension. Everything that made the original of Jack Arnold an eerie, little paranoia classic of the Cold War was abandoned. It only runs through its minimal tires and then ends easily. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not special - the interior of the ship looks like a piece of staple film wrapped around some ropes, which then dangle the front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and cumbersome cable work ever were brought to the screen. The script repeats itself - everyone says everything at least twice, Kerwin says at least three times during the movie, twice in a scene. Many things remain unexplained in the end - why, for example, do the aliens need all the heat and water? - not that someone who is watching would take care of it; If the filmmakers did not care, why should we do that? <br /> <br /> The drama is appropriate - better than the script, which sometimes has an under-sampled improvisation quality. Although the actors often seem to want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible, a notable example is that Elizabeth Peña registers the briefest moment of "frustrated desperation of the hands to gesture" before she takes her son Stevie outside watching as he makes "angry, crazy teenager, smashed something off a table" gesture. <br /> <br /> Continuity flaws include the (GB) sticker on the back of Kerwin's Jeep, which pops up and disappears, a double effect of the gas in the exploding car, with a city man in two places at once - once in the Alien Stevies POV shot in a reaction shot immediately afterwards, Elizabeth Peña seemed to close the car door twice ... you can say that I was packed, right? The film commits the biggest mistakes. It is boring.
