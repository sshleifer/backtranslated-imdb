I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this disgusting bitch. The acting was exaggerated. The direction was cheesy and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked like a person who has never had a high school football game, let alone a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to be an actor in this movie? He was terrible and played the most unrealistic announcer of all time. He could not even be hired for professional wrestling competitions. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl. But he's a bit more athletic than old Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to direct this movie with ADD at 16-year-old men. That's why we hear loud music, fast cuts and a lot of editing. It just became a bad MTV video. Too bad for Al Pacino for this crap. Cameron Diaz? Heck, the no-talent takes on any role that comes down the pike. If Lawrence Taylor is the best actor, you've started. Well, your movie is shit! And you do that.
