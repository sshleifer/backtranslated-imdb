It is a film that sheds light on begging the Palestinian fight against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but it does not show the real feelings of the people then and how they were led to believe that they could return home soon. It does not mention the massacres of Jews like The Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of a Palestinian freedom fighter. It lacks the credibility of the genuine Palestinian struggle and everything that concerns Palestinians, even if it has something to do with the suffering. Palestinian citizens who end up as refugees in nearby Arab countries focus on the story of the man in the coma he is is in the present, and through his story we see the movie. The film only tells a person's life and has some nudity scenes that are irrelevant to the story.
