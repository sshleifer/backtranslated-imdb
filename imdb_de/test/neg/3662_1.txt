This movie looked like it had been shot on a videophone, it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The film never really got together or made a lot of sense, and for a movie like this, there were of course some unnecessary fools. The director obviously tried to make the film subjective and different, but he never gave enough information about what was going on, even in the end I had a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion from the lack of conspiracy and annoyance because I wanted to get back my two dollars from the blockbuster and 1.5 hours of my life. You should have a payment program for people who rent this movie by mistake.
