There is not much to add to what others have already commented on, the film fails hard where it should not, it has no depth in the planning of the robbery and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me think, though the rest of the gang is trying to remove the pins from the doors of an armored lorry, because there's supposed to be no other way to easily carry the guy in the truck He manages to remove the bottom of the truck, which happens to have a hole so he can get out and get in again without being noticed by anyone, because no one else could think he could get out of there, or even better, that they could have gotten in from there. <br /> <br /> Promising, but not quite there.
