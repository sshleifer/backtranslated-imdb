Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a sympathetic ex-convict who has just been released from prison and helps federal agencies find a corrupt small-town sheriff. Relaxed Reynolds has often been accused by critics of simply calling these "good old" boy appearances; True, he is throughout the autopilot. But in his day, Reynolds knew how to make an unobtrusive effort for himself. Amazing and pretty, Reynolds comes as close to the audience as he can without breaking. he seems to know these backwoods as well as all movie stars, while director Joesph Sargent offers a light pace and a sweaty ambience that brings the South to life. Unfortunately, the story is not much and supportive actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins exaggerate (as usual). Diane Ladd is doing well in a small area, and the real daughter Laura Dern can be seen in the background. Reynolds returned to "Gator" for 1976. * 1/2 of ****
