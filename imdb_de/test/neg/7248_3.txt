Yes, Edward G. gives us a look back at the world of criminal defense. First, he's an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong guy to the chair (passionately played, if briefly by DeForrest Kelly), then he's so full of remorse that his only consolation is the bottle. Throw a dull romance, a really quick descent into the penalty and no scruples about who he defends, and next you know - Shazam! Black Leg Lawyer (God, I love that phrase). He sees the light just in time to rescue his beloved lover from the chair. Yawning. <br /> <br /> But in reality, the courtroom is pure melodrama. Watch him utter a witness, he sees poison drinking, see him arguing passionately while he grabs a bullet hole in his chest. Be prepared for melodrama. <br /> <br /> The Hoot of the movie, however, is Jayne Russell. With curves defying the laws of gravity and an IQ approaching absolute zero, it is something to see. Even sings a bit.
