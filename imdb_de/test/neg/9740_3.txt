That's a stupid movie. When I saw it in a movie theater, more than half of the audience left before it was half past. I stayed until the bitter end. Show steadfastness? I caught it on TV again and it was much funnier. Not a classic or even weird, but the family has grown on me somehow. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better to do, it's free at t.v. They could make things worse.
