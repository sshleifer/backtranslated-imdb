I was more entertaining when I saw my wife almost frustratedly pulling her hair through the whole movie. I thought something that held everything together would be right around the corner of the barn every minute. So I cheated, grabbed the remote and was relieved to find out that it ends in just 20 minutes. I should have turned the channel. Sweet, it had potential, but Yuck!
