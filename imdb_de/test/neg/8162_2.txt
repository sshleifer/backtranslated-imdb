There's stuff here for a decent, if routine, SF story. It is affected by several factors. First, the actor is just terrible. Even the competent actors are terrible. The dialogue is made of wood and stilted. The plot is predictable. This seems less like a finished movie than actors going through a run. Very disappointing.
