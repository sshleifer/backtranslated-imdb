What a waste of talent - though it looks like Crudup in real life is more like the sombre, selfish, characterless character he portrays in this disappointing movie. Sometimes in art The empty spaces show more than just the painted or created content. What this film reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory / competing, unresolved impulses / awareness of the film's director / author. It unintentionally shows the lacuna of consciousness that a truly developed, deeply conscious character should and should be tormented to earn the audience's empathy or sympathy, or whose lack serves to be a warning story to the audience. However, this film fails in every respect in this regard. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the main character (very an antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), is not sensitive to anyone, especially those who earn the most (which does NOT include him), and that he has such overblown, legitimate, self-pitying, whining sympathies only for himself, combined with the trademark lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others - all converge in this film to make him the epitome of self-implicated, Somehow, this is now the gold standard for men in film and in the world at this time and time. <br /> <br /> One of his opponents (James LeGros) says with a laser-like flash: "I bet you did not do any good in life - and I bet you will not." It captures the absolute essence of the Cal character. Something that the other characters he overruns in the movie seem to realize rather quickly, though the director has stacked the deck to manipulate the compassion for Cal. This is a testament to the talent and skills of the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Cal 'last "return" has nothing to do with character development, transformation or consciousness development. It has only to do with the ultimate surrender that, until something better comes to pass, he can again be in his comfortable, comfortable status quo of justifiable empowerment, where life is easy and no one will demand that he grow up - something he is intentionally incapable and uninterested. </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film could have been purposeful to show the traps and tragedies - the devastating effects of such a lack of conscience / consciousness, but he apologizes and instead glorifies it - in fact, it rages in self-pity, along with the arrogant, selfish, emotionally stunted protagonist. <br /> <br /> (and looking back on the recent revelations, it has certainly given me a shiver over convicted killer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup in its most nuanced and full of exciting potential, which in my opinion has never really been realized, read the underrated "Inventing the Abbotts". ...
