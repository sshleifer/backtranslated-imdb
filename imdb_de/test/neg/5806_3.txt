Whatever was expected of any comedy produced by Adam Sandler, Grandma's boy is predictable and so stupid that he'll get sick. Allen Covert starred as Alex in the film, a 35-year-old comb who works as a video game reviewer and had to move in with his grandmother and two roommates after losing his apartment. There are some common twists: he's having trouble adapting to his new living situation, which in turn causes problems at work, which is particularly bad because he's trying to pin down one of the office's new consultants. Throw a weird boss, an almost alien star, a really nerdy best friend, a couple of scenes with burned-out pot dealers, a really big party scene, and an original video game that Alex tries to put into the mix you have granny boy In its entirety. Allen Covert makes a marginally good track, Linda Cardellini is sweet enough for her role as Samantha Office Clerk, who is just one of the nerds, and a few scenes manage to spew out a giggle or two, but none of this makes Granny's boy a lot of time for everyone. Most of the supposedly funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them are nothing but "humor" that would make anyone at National Lampoons feel embarrassed. Joel Moore is incredibly irritated in his role as video game mastermind JP. and the whole movie actually manages to be boring and not funny or substantial. At least, Omas Boy did something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to earn a couple of paychecks with his work colleagues David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
