2/3 of this film is recycled footage from previous films, a fact that is regrettable even to someone who has not seen the original films. And somehow it feels like a rip off, even though I have not seen the stuff yet. It's like every episode of a TV show where the characters are sitting around a photo album or something similar, and you're just seeing recycled material from other episodes. I've seen a few producers make extensive montages of recycled footage, but never more than five minutes. For the most part, this movie is about things that have already been seen by the audience. So you could make the case that this is one of the biggest rip-offs the movie audience ever forced. <br /> <br /> I saw the theater in a 16 mm print, which is good enough, I think, considering how rare this material has to be in the film these days. I give some credit for the semi-convincing gothic atmosphere and unintentional humor, but that's about it. The aztec mummy monster looks good, even has some agility on his face, which is better than most movie monsters of the time. But the robot is pathetic, though it's interesting that they made the human face completely visible. It's a "robot man" or something similar, as explained in the film. I think that's an Android. Technically, this movie should be called "Android vs. the Aztec Mummy", but I doubt that anyone here was more concerned about the technical characteristics than the quality. In fact, the film is so sloppily put together that the television looks good. Even the synchronization from Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example, at some point the hero says, "I might as well start at the beginning ..." What kind of translation is that? Could not they at least let him say "in the beginning" so that it does not sound repetitive? An editor of a high school newspaper could have repaired the film's script. It is the epitome of useful filmmaking. There is absolutely nothing in this film that does not have to be present for the commercial purpose of the film. They did not go any further than necessary, and considering the extensive recycled footage, I doubt they actually spent more than a week making that movie. I'll stop posting about it now The principle that I do not want to invest more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually spent during the creation.
