I remember when "The Love Machine" came out for the first time. I was only 13 years old, too young to see the movie with a lot of cluttered movies, but not too old to bring my mom's paperback copy of Jacqueline Susann's novel to school and about my "schoolfellows" with my schoolmates horse riding. <br /> I'm not sure what my problem was at such a young age, but I was very interested in the book. I bought and wore an "Ankh" ring, just like on the paperback cover, and I remember the ads for the perfume "Xanadu," which was cross-promoted and awkward in the movie. Despite this interest, I did not see the movie until a few years later. I should have left things as they were. <br /> <br /> "The Love Machine" is undoubtedly the worst of the many bad movies adapted from Susann's novels ... which, of course, is the most fun to watch. His mistakes are numerous: from his hopscotching script, which jumps from one incident to the next, without a connecting thread; his dated, horny (brass, I mean) score by Bacharach; the flat first-take performances; The boring sexuality - I've never seen bathrobes so prominently in a movie before. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex, nakedness or something bad is asked, someone steps into a blue robe! Very strange, that; and certainly the circus train from terrible 70's that are endlessly presented. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is not much of a blur anyway, but overcomes the rest of the cast) is constantly undermined by the stunning cover-up she has to wear. The film's main liability, however, is the stoic, stone-like John Philip Law as (appropriately) Robin Stone, the subject of every girl's affection (and one of the overpowering male photographers). <br /> <br The law is just awful and looks like it's being pulled off the street, hurriedly handed over the script pages, and made a cold reading on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that, he seems desperate for a blood transfusion or something like that. He looks thoroughly ill and is a few pounds smaller than most of his female costumes. Robin Stone should be a guy, not a Hanky. <br /> <br /> For those who find it hard to find the film (it's rather slow by today's standards), I ask you to stay in the club for the "fight scene". Here, Ms. Cannon (23 pounds of swollen hair) finally leaves her hitherto starchy acting style and lets go with her contagious, raucous laughter, setting in motion a truly memorable event for those who have become a movie clip highlight , sets in motion. "The Love Machine" is trying to get involved with "Valley of the Dolls" in the notorious WC scene, which is finally correct. Jacqueline Susann's unique type of waste is painfully missed. Maybe someone out there has the rights to Rona Barrett's "The Lovomaniacs" and will revive the genre.
