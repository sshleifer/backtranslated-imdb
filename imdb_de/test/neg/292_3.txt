Conclusion: Simon leads a small team of special agents who specialize in finding and returning missing persons, despite all the contradictions. Her last mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of hers. She seems to have been trapped in the net of a particularly brutal criminal, and all who sought her have disappeared. But now the librarians are on the case. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is pure B action, through and through. The key to this is the unlimited supply. The ammunition is unlimited, they do not even have to be loaded. There are countless bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many naked, and a futile (and failed as always) attempt to distract oneself from the action holes. And there's an unlimited supply of bad acting (it's almost as if Erika Eleniak's performance is expressed in it, what about it?) And actors who do not seem to care more about the paycheck (and why should they, if nobody else seems to?). <br /> <br /> And like most B-Action movies, there are an unlimited number of bad shootings. But these seem almost ridiculously bad. I think I saw more realistic shootings when I played cowboy as a child. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, I did not really expect much, how could I get from an action movie called The Librarians? And it actually delivers what was expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots together. However, I am not sure if I can describe it as entertaining, it did not arouse my interest very long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
