This movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline ... a lot of blood, but without meaning and most of the time without originality. The film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring are fighting against a demon, but nothing connects the three stories seriously. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, he's just a boring villain who kidnaps kids and kills birds, and the worse ... he talks too much. One thing I really did not understand is why the dog is out of hell ????? He can not be a Cenobit because he had nothing human. Why can the dog be killed by pressure if the other creature from hell can easily pick up bullets ????? Bloodline is in many ways incoherent with the film series. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are an old friend in this movie, but it's impossible that Pinhead met Angelique because Pinhead is just a World War I soldier and Angelique is an old demon and she's been living in Paris for about 200 years.
