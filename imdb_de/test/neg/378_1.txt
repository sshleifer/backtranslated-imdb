I love the first and third animal master, but this was an abomination. For the same reasons it was almost as horrible as "The Never Ending Story 3". They took with them a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, farming villages, witches, supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics with a pyramid; and thought it would be fun to blend into our materialistic pop culture world of rock & roll, sushi (I think that was it) and eye-catching sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I do not want some old barbarian-looking people dancing to rock songs in the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but that's just stupid. This is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Do not give up, the eye of Braxus is much, much better. I gave one a 10 to the one. I give this portal of time 1. Believe me, I do not always give such extremely high or low ratings. I only tend to comment on such films only.
