This thing, directed by the French feeling Patrick Sebastien, is worse than any turkey you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, the Patriot, etc. ... You get a picture, this one is the pit. Sebastien is a TV star in France (if you need an equivalent device, say, he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first movie, let's hope it's the last one. I hope Troma or somebody would sell this movie in the States, so you can experience the French stench in the worst case. In short, this is the masterpiece of S ** t.
