Never before have so many ugly people gathered to make an equally ugly movie. <br /> <br /> In the waters off the coast of Florida, something huge and terrible is going on, something that leaves half-chewed bodies on its trail Bob thinks he has recorded the thing's "evil voice" on tape. Bob's assistant, the astonishingly unattractive and painlessly thin Stella, decides to seek the help of the slimy lady-man Peter, an electrician whose equipment may help them find the mysterious creature. However, those who are too far into the mystery will appear dead, killed by a baboon, exposed to a hitman with a bad perm. What's the terrible secret behind the Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Ugly scientists have fierce affairs, intrepid policemen and doctors puzzle over the increasing number of bodies. Stella and Peter spread out on the beach and characters we do not care about get killed or eaten. The Sea Killer, a comical combination of an octopus, a shark and a large bit, never seems to be as threatening as it should be. The conspiracy behind the creation of the monster makes no sense at all. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic, and those who may be are killed instantly. This is a poorly shot, poorly synchronized plan that is less messy. The whole thing is so scary and stinking that I longed for a hot bath. I had sushi plates more frightening than this movie. Avoid it, unless it's the MST3K version.
