Although I've (luckily) seen this movie alone, I felt embarrassed watching it. I was tempted to borrow it from the reviews on the front page, and the bloody / grainy cameras on the back - which led me to believe that it was some sort of documentary. These actors are ridiculous throughout the movie and do not convince. The story is about an Italian Australian gang (?) Who only fights against other gangs and then runs, fights and repeats. Supposedly, they train extremely hard, which makes them much better than other gangs. For some reason, I do not think they could actually beat some of those other guys that are twice the size. I could be wrong ... no, I'm not mistaken, this movie is not fun at any level. The prison assembly looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a sausage party of horrible actors just hanging out laughing and trying to look tough. This movie is not worth your time, save your money or throw it in the bin, just do not waste it on this movie.
