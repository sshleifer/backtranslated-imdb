Although he made his debut film only in Australia and went to the UK and then to America to continue his career, the Australians will tell you that Errol Flynn was the biggest movie star they have ever produced. I'm not sure if he ever returned to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. I still attribute this film to the well-known Aussie disrespect because it has corrupted the reputation of one of its own. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he correctly narrated enough big stories in his life until the end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that much of the film was based on that and reading between the lines of this book. The infidelity of his mother to his father was not written, but could have been suspected when reading My Wicked Crazy Ways. He did not like the woman very much, as some sources say. <br /> <br /> I wish the film had been more about his New Guinea adventures, which for me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways. As far as his street fighting in depression is concerned, I tend not to believe it. Even if he had succeeded, I guarantee that enough of it ruined his look and he never had a career as a leading man. <br /> <br /> Still, people seem to think so. The atmosphere of Sydney during the Depression was well captured and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. The American public knows him best as the upright but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential, who appeared in the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better movie.
