I am not a fan of the original book, but I expected a better adaptation than the movie Natalie Portman, which I found horrible. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, Ms. Gregory's book contains very little in this script. The entire subplot of George Boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated, and in this version George is merely an unpredictable shift between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the King. I thought the title of the book referred to Mary as the lesser known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. Second, the script has the characters that address the audience regularly when confessed. Apparently, this should give a little background story and explain their motives, but it's amateurish in execution. <br /> <br /> Besides the bad script, the direction is surprisingly bad. There are too many shots taken with a circling camera, which is not very stable at best and in the worst case it is almost shaky. Some of the lectures are held provisionally as in a first rehearsal. The production values ​​for Heinrich's extravagant yard are minimal. The costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are from the feverish imagination of some costume designers. And the king, the source of all power and favors, is often shown ALONE. No moody courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all the people? I'm used to Hollywood turning history into fantasy, but I expected something better from a BBC production. Even because of a faulty book, this production is bad.
