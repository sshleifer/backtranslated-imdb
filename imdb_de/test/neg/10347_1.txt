Hard to believe - but it is so! I should not be surprised. Advertising shows how unique and "funny" a show can be. But not only the commercials announcing this new show did not have the slightest humor, nor did I speak to someone who found the commercials amusing. <br /> <br /> I do not remember seeing a pilot who has no wisdom, cuteness or humor. The characters were for the most part unbearable. Especially with Selma Blair (which is amazing that she would be willing to be in a stool sample of such a show). The few moments in which the characters were easily redeemable were considerably obstructive and banal. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show that has absolutely no redeemable qualities. And that is not one of them. Kath and Kim have exactly ONE redeeming quality - and that's Selma Blair. Although she has worn outrageous outfits and acts like a pathetic, whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who looks like a mix of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to look at. <br /> <br /> But if you want to watch Selma, rent Hellboy. At least they maintain a certain amount of respect for them instead of burning that vile character in your brain to connect with it. All in all, Kath and Kim are a waste and the worst thing that is really the worst TV is or has been. It sets a new low.
