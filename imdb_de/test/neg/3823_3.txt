Some of the reviewers to this film were extremely commendable. Personally, I was disappointed, because of these reviews, I was optimistic when the opening credits began to roll. <br /> <br /> The well-known story goes this way: Deformed Boy and his father live in Louisiana Swamp. Local boys mock and torture him. Local boys start with Gruesome, oh sorry, I mean, Victor Crowley's hut burns with him in it. Dad tries to save his son, who used to be known as Eddie Munster, and meets the Elephant Man. Instead, he accidentally puts a hatchet through the child's head. Victor becomes a murderous ghost, following the unfortunate ones who enter his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing I appreciated about Hatchet was that it never took it seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh. The thing is, I'm tired of the Hollywood-polished B-horror slap sticks. I like to laugh and enjoy good fear, but this film did not deliver a solid dose. Crowley is the next Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
