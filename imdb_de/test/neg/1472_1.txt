I usually like underground movies and antiheroes, but that's a bad joke. I wonder how to call that a movie. All these people are losers, and the filmmaker does not even manage to make them interesting. They are not funny, not tragic, but just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but I will not look again to see what happens. Anyone who has a camcorder can do it better ... <br /> <br /> I give him a 1 for the originality. The rest is crap.
