Okay, this movie might have been good if there had been a conspiracy behind it. the title did not even fit in after the first ten minutes. The wind did not have much to do with the rest of the movie. The drama was below average and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book with scary stories. <br /> <br /> As far as horror movies are concerned, this should not even be classified as one. This was a shame for horror and thriller fans everywhere. I hate to be so tough, but I feel like I want to have the time I saw this movie. I hope there will be no follow-up. This film should be locked in a vault and never made available to the public for viewing.
