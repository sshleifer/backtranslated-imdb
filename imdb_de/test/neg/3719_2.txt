When this movie becomes a holiday tradition, I have to hide at Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you even think about comparing it to 'A Wonderful Life'! It was absolutely terrible! The singing boy made my toes curl. And what was the deal with his hair? Emmy worthy performance ?! You're welcome. Granted, Lucci was fine, but an Emmy ????? I think this movie is a waste of money. The fact that they were so close to the original story as if it gave a modern and retro touch made them even worse. There was a lack of enthusiasm and perseverance in all areas. Lighting, wardrobe, makeup, it seemed like everyone wanted to go home. Only a big NO from me.
