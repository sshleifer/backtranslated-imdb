If you've ever bought from Wal-Mart, you probably know about the $ 5 DVD container set up by the electronics department. Well, I found this movie. I was tricked though! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock and even her name listed as a "headliner". I picked it up and thought, "Wow, I did not know that Sandra Bullock made this movie?!?!" So I was pumped home to watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie. To my surprise, Mrs. Bullock had a small role ... very small role. She plays the girlfriend of the son of the CIA agent. Talk about the support of the actress. She may not have more than two lines in the movie. Apart from being fooled by this bullock movie, I stopped by and continued to watch an action-packed movie. Negative! Once a weapon was glued to the camera for special effects. You have to watch it to laugh at what is really horrible.
