I saw this movie at the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared to Sideways in the EIFF program - which I liked - so I was really looking forward to this movie. I also liked Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite etc ... so lately I've had good experiences with some funny American Indy movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I've found that Puffy Chair does not compare to any of those movies. <br/> <br/> I sat for 35 minutes, waiting for something amusing, funny, insightful or even something to happen Interesting happened. It did not - and the shaky video camera made me sick - so I left. <br /> <br /> This is just the second movie I ever went out of (the first was "showgirls"), which is a bit disappointing. I probably would not have lasted that long if the shaky picture was not disgusting - but within the first 35 minutes I did not feel I was missing anything. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
