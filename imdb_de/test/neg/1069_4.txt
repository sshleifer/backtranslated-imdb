I'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some kind of personal connection to the characters and the story, but from an unbiased point of view it's not very well done. The film revolves around atypical angst-ridden teens, each playing a different stereotype that makes us think it's like being a teenager. We learn a bit about the lifestyle of each teenager, but the whole project was just presumptuous to me, be it the constant shooting of tree branches in the wind or the black and white "interviews" with the students. There was nothing new or original in this movie and nothing I had to see. Yes, it is a strong subject material, and the dramatic scenes are well played and played, but the entire project seems unnecessary, especially if it is almost an exact replica of Van Sant "Elephant" (one with suicide, the other with Suicide) seems to shoot a school). As I said, some people will probably enjoy this movie, and the director / writer obviously had an inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a nearby movie. So it's nice that the movie was made with a bit of heart, but I find it unbelievably ineffective and when dealing with material that can easily become clich√©d to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
