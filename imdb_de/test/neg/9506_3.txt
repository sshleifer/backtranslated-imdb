I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partly" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this film falls into the later category. <br /> <br /> This film has the same basic problems as Miyazaki's last movie "Howl's Moving Castle". It sets up a fascinating premise, which is then reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world in which the story takes place and actually looks like a very interesting story unfolds. From then on it goes downhill. The middle part of the film is mainly thinly veiled eco-propaganda, and the end is greatly affected by reliance on impenetrable spiritism that ruins a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie feels like someone tore every other page out of the script before passing it on to the animators. What's left is something that is visually stunning (though the version I saw was sad, a copy of the nth generation with bad color - leading to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom while flying) but that does not make much sense ultimately got me confused.
