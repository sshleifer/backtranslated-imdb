This movie is really so bad, and I'm usually a fan of bad movies, but that was too much. This is like OD'ing with pure SUCK. Now you may think you have seen the bottom of the barrel. They may have waded through all the titles of Full Moon and Troma, all Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun, and straight to DVD flicks of faded men of the action. You may have even seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake, and a variety of films that MST3K covered, but in their original form. But you do not know any really horrible filmmaking until you've seen Darkhunters. And if not, you should not. Do not bother. This film was not only amazingly poorly written, staged, filmed, edited, played and splashed in coarse, cheap aftermath. First of all, it's a presumptuous mess. But not good, in the Greenaway or Lynch style presumptuous or weirdly chaotic Ittenbach or early Waters kind. It's the kind of presumption that comes from thinking someone incredibly stupid that he's found something incredibly clever. A bit like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only this man seems to be a crazy Messiah when compared to this train accident (and that comes from a wild Shaymalan hater). It is also boring. Not too boring, which is fine if the movie lends your patience. Darkhunters does not do that. It's boring in a "Oh my foot (King God, if I see another shot of a cat being set to an unpleasant soundtrack I'll go (King kills me!") - somehow. <br /> < Anyone who claims to like this movie is a brave liar, and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows how his mother looks in bed.
