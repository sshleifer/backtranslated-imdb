A feminist treatise in which the onlooker believes that: Wildlife is rarely tamed by singing, instead attacking, killing, and eating (the line that Grizzlys never attack if not provoked was a hoot - unless " provoked "means she sees flesh); (ii) Homosexuality is per se immoral - and its acceptance throughout history is almost always associated with signs of dissolution and disintegration of a society. iii) Few women are bisexual (in this case, virtually every woman is preferred to not favor either men or women). iv) Divorce is far worse than infidelity. v) Land is there for people to use, develop and enjoy. vi) It is also up to a mother of an adult son to stay in touch as with the son. vii) A mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child. viii) Worshiping a parent for rewarding ideals is a good and healthy thing. The adults continue to be responsible for their sexual behavior, regardless of their age and the duty to engage in this most intimate and bestowing act only within the most intimate and openly devoted relationships: Marriage - believe me, you will NOT like this movie! In essence, it is a Howard star guy who is overthrown by a Jane Fonda woman (think of The Electric Horseman). It's ugly stuff because the values, the ideals of the script are all so damaging. <br /> <br /> I share the other objections about the strange things in Scripture: a) Why should this man lose every friend he has? - because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral meant that he could not hold appointments with them? It's a mystery why he always says "it was personal" when faced with angry and disappointed women. HUH? <br /> <br /> b) There is a tremendous inconsistency (ie the scriptwriter wants to have it both ways), telling us that the mother of the protagonist loved the father with everything she had, and that we were told later was just a great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) The underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. It has never been known that the person entitled to enforcement has the right to live on the property - he only has to determine the time of the sole heir and the right to occupy the property. But somehow the film makes it appear that the executor is the rightful resident - which is crazy. (Think of an executor who uses the deceased's property before the will of the will is fulfilled - that does not happen.) D) In ​​this film, it is assumed that women are equally drawn to men and women - it is simply absurd. So it says: i) Penelope Ann Miller's character goes out with other men at the end of the film - after having been with the deceased for five years - and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist, ii) the protagonist's housekeeper after she was dedicated to her benevolent husband throughout her adult life - now another woman is dating. iii) That a friend angry with the protagonist now "would like to try a woman". iv) A male transsexual strives to update the protagonist; v) that Mary Kay Place's character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back," she says with a stupid triumphal flip on her head ). <br /> <br /> That's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to hold it to maximum volume and rewind again and again to understand names, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a film by someone who really despises the traditional exploits of a man and hates the idea that a man is needed to educate a child, loathing the notion that marriage and sex are a necessary connection consists. The film wants to preach - and this kind of propaganda of false messages is not going well.
