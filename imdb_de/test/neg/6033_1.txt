This has some of the dumbest fight scenes of all time. If I was a veteran of a war, I would cry if I saw this movie, not because I remember being in Vietnam, but because it is a poor representative of a veteran of this war. Although the troops carry M16, the film does not remind of Vietnam. The Viet Cong uniforms look like old Japanese uniforms from a World War II movie. The setting is obviously a bit crappy Hollywood lot. The worst scene involves a US soldier fighting hand in hand, like a bad martial arts movie. After dispatching several opposing troops, he says, "Come here and let's kick our butts!" to a helicopter in the air. Then he is shot. This movie is garbage.
