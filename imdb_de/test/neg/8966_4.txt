**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> The mountain king Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious back wash woman. "Let's go 18", she begins to attract male attention and reacts by throwing stones. The arrival of a dam construction crew triggers romance in Mrs. Hepburn. She quickly aroused the coveted engineer Robert Young (as John Stafford), who flirts his marital status. Surveillance engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for a variety of reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ whom Hepburn adores. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn uses the power of prayer to heal a child, neighbors in the neighborhood suspect she is a witch. > If it were not so serious, Spitfire could be more fun; it is an untypical and totally inappropriate vehicle for its star, which absolutely does not convince. Of the leads, Mr. Bellamy is best. The best characterization is, however, by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), which appeared together with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson) in the stage version of George Cukor published. Will Geer (as West Fry), "Grandpa Walton" in the 70s, plays a small role. An unexpected end helps.
