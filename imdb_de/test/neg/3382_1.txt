Okay, when a friend of mine told me to run MM2 and MM3, I thought, damn it, I was allowed to visit Monster Man and see what it's like, maybe I can get some of it, but when I popped put it in my DVD player and tried to stifle the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, I mean, terribly annoying, bad comedy of that fat ass that's funny, not to mention how long the Director has spent on the pointless desert road. I came to the conclusion that these guys had no idea what they were doing and missed the boat a lot. The story was different from the usual BS seen on the blockbuster / Hollywood video shelf featured by Lions Gate, but they've certainly confused this. Why invest so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad plays and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more of the action in the film. Myabe's writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the film, or maybe the director did not get enough of the horror and blood so they had to find pens to make the usual 84 minutes. All in all, and I'm just here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald-headed Redneck in the bar scene where the skull is squeezed into the road as the three lanes follow. I'm going to give him at least one star try, and the gore / kill scenes were not that bad, they tried. Too bad, Lions Gate could have made this idea a cool franchise, but failed. I do not recommend paying, maybe you can find a reduced version in which the movie starts from the tramp scene. CRAP!
