Okay, sure, this movie will never win an Oscar. Citizen Cane is not this movie ... BUT why does every movie have to be scrutinized? When was the last time you saw a movie that was funny, not because it was good, but because it was stupid? Can anyone remember Roger Corman, the king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> I had fun. I liked the cheese. Just do not think and get ready to throw popcorn on the screen.
