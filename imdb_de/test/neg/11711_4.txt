I was fortunate to have read the book before, and I know a little about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> The scripting and editing of this TV movie was for the most part really awful. I felt like I was seeing a really bad drama documentary about the Rater of the time and then a movie. At first there were too many intermediate cuts between important parts. Eliminating important events that were taking place at the time, Henry breaks out with Henry for wanting to divorce Katherine of Aragon, which resulted in England abandoning Rome and founding his own church. They barely kept the book. I'm all for creative freedom, but to a limit, especially if you're dealing with a well-written book as a starting point. In the book in which Mary first gave birth to the young Katharina, the young Henry is born. Both, her father, are the eight of Henry. In the movie, they first show Harry and then Catherine. And suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the movie to write them all. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone are the portrayal because the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book and you do not know anything about Hennry's 8-Court, I suggest you stay away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the movie will annoy you because of the lack of details and important actions.
