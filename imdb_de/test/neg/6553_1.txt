Sherman Hemsley was great in the Jeffersons and especially in All in the Family. He was also very good in Amen, why would he make this movie? This movie has a horrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does his best, but that's terrible. This movie was the beginning of bankruptcy for Sherman Hemsley. I think he is very funny, but this is a terrible, terrible, meaningless ghost story. Stay with Ghostbusters.
