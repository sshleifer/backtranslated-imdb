This film must be one of the absolute low points in his generally noteworthy career by Michael J. Fox. I should have known how awful this movie was when I rented it and he only saw the movie halfway and did not rewind from the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays an adult kid star who is now an agent for other show business kids. His character is misleading, as he still believes everyone should love him as Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not likeable at all. In fact, Cyndi Lauper is the only sympathetic figure in the Brooklyn accent for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to stick a sticky note in the box to warn others not to waste their time!
