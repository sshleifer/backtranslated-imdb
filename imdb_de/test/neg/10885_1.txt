The only good thing about this movie is that I now have a movie on the worst list. Pause Stop being at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the horrible movies. Really, this movie is the worst plot, the worst director, while I wanted the whole movie about everything I wanted, is to tear my hair out and kick the author and anyone who made this movie possible. I'm a soldier on duty and spend my precious downtime watching movies like this. These people should feel terrible, they had to watch this before it came out, and they must have been lazy lounging to repeat it after they realized it was sucking hell. I'm so astonished that this big land of them makes them do another. Honestly, this is the first time I've commented on a movie. I had to let the world know, not waste their time. Delete this movie from the face of this planet. It makes us people look left behind.
