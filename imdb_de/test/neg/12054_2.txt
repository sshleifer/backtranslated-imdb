Well, what can I say. WHAT IS THE F ** K? There really is not much to say about that. The only way you would want to do that would be if you, like me, like a bad horror that you should laugh at. <br /> <br /> Acting- VERY UNCONDITIONAL! Just look at the last scene while the leading ladies are running! Rip Off of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just terrible! <br /> <br /> Gore- Really not believable. In one scene, they use one of these knives to cut a piece that fits over a body part, etc. By using this red ketchup, its supposed appearance looks real, though it's really not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> Killer Quality - scary mask if you're scared of clowns, somehow It's hard to believe someone would choose this as a costume. The director obviously realized that all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror camp films. <br/> <br/> TOTAL- 3/10 * / ***** ps stay away from CAMP BLOOD II, which made this look like the LORD OF THE RINGS.
