* POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD * <br /> <br /> I'm just going to say what has not been said here (and I will continue this for the rest of my WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you want to have a women's title match, make it at least interesting, rather than just a squash for the current champion. I think Moolah could not stand an intense match, but they wanted to have the legend in a WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought the killer bees were wasted in WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair left and Jim Brunzell became a screen back. So I did not know for a while that this was a top-notch team, even top candidates. <br /> <br /> But I loved seeing Bill Fralic at the Battle Royal. He got along very well here by creating a cocky heel character in an interview before the game and even quitting the Battle Royal. Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he's the only professional athlete of my generation who has respect for wrestling (can anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). And what about the ridiculous green tights of the Hart Foundation?
