I became a big fan of the Carpenters, and I did not really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that he is too focused on her anorexia and does not let her true personality show through. I did not like Cynthia Gibb very much; especially knowing that she thought Karen's anorexia was suicide, which it obviously was not. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, I thought the film was horrible for Agnes (her mother). <br /> <br /> I found some scenes that shake in a way, such as where she was, finds herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I found the metaphor (sort of) pretty effective. When the family plays billiards and talks about their divorce, she collapses and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels that her fragile body is quite moving (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> All in all I think they had to produce their bubbly, quirky side - their sincere personality. Even at the heart of the movie, there was really no point in understanding what it would lead to anorexia (though, of course, no one really knows) and made it look almost unfounded. The movie was, in my opinion, rather a poor singer with anorexia than the story of Karen Carpenter. I would assume that they changed their husband's name / profession and anything because they could not get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms), but this whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. In this context, I can not remember the movie that produced her yearning for a family and children who made a strong impact in her life, explaining her whirlwind romance and her swift marriage to her husband. <br /> <br /> On the whole The film is a low-budget movie that was made for television. It's just not very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan hoping to look beyond Karen's illness. I believe such a legend deserves / deserves a better movie as a tribute to an amazing person and a great voice.
