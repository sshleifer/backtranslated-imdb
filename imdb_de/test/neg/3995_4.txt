The master of Italian horror Dario Argento is described by non-fans as bad. And deserves absolutely nothing from the backlash. Every time I hear something bad about Argento- I think they are really talking about Michele Soavi. He just does not get that much attention because his films have never been as successful as in cinemas. In fact, his best film - 1994 Cemetery Man - was probably the least successful. Or he simply did not get the attention he deserved, because then he left the movie and went on TV. He never went back. People really do not know how inferior his other films are, because once they've seen them, they're already fans of Italian horror aesthetics. This means that you have to accept that they are almost pointless and are usually very unattractive films. Here the church stands out from the pack. Because it looks so cheap and ancient, you can smell the dust. But it also has its charm, though there are only a few. The camera work is really impressive and the music is very elaborate and great. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is the reason people saw Soavi's work, I do not know anybody who caught The Church from Argentos Suspiria and deep red. Soavi is a bit hack. A bit like an Italian Mick Garris - the ultimate example of a director who prefers style rather than substance. The shortcomings of the church are constant and abundant. The film opens with a slightly interesting prologue featuring knights on white horses storming through a farming village and resembling those you see in a Robin Hood adaptation in a century ago. These scenes are intense enough, energetic and get to the point quickly. Then we move on to the present, where the style of the film occurs. Yes, the movie is alright. For about 35 minutes in the current '80s, Italy is simply interesting enough to bring us to the slowly revealing horror elements. Now we know that the purpose of the film is to build its horror. And it's for the most part a decent build. But as the film approaches half way, we realize that the movie is passing, and ... nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. In my opinion. Two persons who work in one church, one as catalogers of books and the other as restorers of the wall art of the building, discover a scroll that the man believes will lead them to a buried treasure or an invaluable artifact that he can sell and get rich from. So he just follows his 'card' to discover a power under the church that hallucinates him as he slowly becomes a demon that makes everyone else hallucinate. As he performs his demonic work, somebody to whom he has given the troop kills himself in a way that captures everyone in the church, while the demon 'contagious' spreads to everyone, leaving a black preacher and the little girl behind the church clubbing every night as the only two people who can prevent the plague from spreading beyond the church walls. This probably sounds action packed and the style of Soavi is far more lethargic than Argento. However, I have never seen an attempted surrealistic movie that is so painfully boring. That's no joke. Nothing happens in the whole movie! I have already seen Expressionist (or Impressionist, I'm not a super graduate of film school) movies, but most of them actually show events (John Carpenter's Halloween). <br /> <br /> It pretty much follows in the footsteps of Lamberto Bavas Demon's films (co-produced since Argento). We are led to a place where a group of people gather, one becomes a demon, all others are isolated, that person infects everyone except a few survivors, then the demons either infect the world or the survivors, if the demons are dying. This movie brings all these elements together. In contrast to Argento's work, nothing happens. Okay, a few things happen. But only a bizarre sequence has the fun of Lambertos much more fun on Demons films. The neck of an arbitrary woman is impaled by a demon with a fence section that he tears from the ground. What's bizarre about that? That happens in front of about two dozen people. What do you do? Nothing. She dies, her head runs blood in close-up. But all these people do not even notice, even though it is in the open air and not less than 8 feet away from them. Maybe 4 people notice that the demon has hit him when he can run towards them, and they get out of the way. She is killed and in the shot, after she dies, everyone just sits around and is silent while a boy plays a saxophone. That's no joke. That's what happens. This is more than logically incoherent - it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene implies that the woman just disappeared and nobody saw her death. They are all just up and forgetting it. And this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie. I'm not saying that it's the only violence, blood or murder we see. It is not. It's just the only thing we can say. In one scene, for example, a beautiful woman in a mirror sees herself as old and ugly. She scratches the skin on her face, but if she reappears minutes later, no scratches. People are consumed by fish and their faces are squeezed by subway cars. Later, however, they emerge as totally intact members of an obsessive cult, in a scene that celebrates the ultimate horror - a famous scene from Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, the biggest horror movie ever made. Even if Argento did that, I would be angry!
