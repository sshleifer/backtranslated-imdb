Of course, Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen, it's such a shit and bullshow. I found none of the jokes funny or clever, they were all terrible jokes. <br /> <br /> Acting is shitty, many of the characters who suffer from acting, Charlotte Charlotte (Sadie) is such a horrible actor, the other characters also suck (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative and the show is so predictable. This is one of the worst shows ever. It should not even have been done. The idiots responsible for writing this garbage should be fired (if this was not already the case) season was just a disaster, it's too hard to see this show, it's beyond terrible.
