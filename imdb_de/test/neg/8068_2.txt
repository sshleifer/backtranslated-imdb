So if a guy meets you and he says, "I want you to look at my erection!" Do not be alarmed, maybe he would like you to watch the movie he made about how his house should be built. Yes! That's the only thing that happens in this movie! It's like the worst Warholian I've ever seen! It's like filming the inside of the toilet before you flush it. In fact, it's less interesting than that. <br /> <br /> But if you look at Lennon's erection, be warned he has a lot of background noise in it too. I mean, it's like the building was attacked by space mutants out of hell or something! In the meantime, the building being built is growing, just as an erection can (in almost 20 minutes, what a performance). So if someone asks you to watch his erection, be sure to record everything on video.
