I loved the first third of this movie and thought it was one of Truffaut's best movies. I loved the conspiracy where a pen pal marries a man halfway across the world - unseen. Especially if this woman turned out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal, she could take her place! She then cleared out the man's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really addicted and wanted to see more ... <br /> <br /> And then the movie fell apart and just got stupid! Although she comes from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), he comes across her almost immediately when she travels to southern France. Hmm, ... chances are 187 million to 1, but he finds them. Then, instead of either killing her or handing it over to the police, he forgives her - even if she recognizes what she's done. Okay - that's hard to believe, but okay, but then he helps to hide her from a private investigator by killing him !!!! Nobody is so stupid! Yeah, the character that Catherine Deneuve plays is pretty nice, but come on people - that's just stupid. If he just wanted her as a sex object, why would he do it for a woman who is often cool and completely selfish and evil. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve such high ratings due to its ridiculous plot! If you're not a die-hard Truffaut fan, try another movie - even one by Truffauts - but NOT this one.
