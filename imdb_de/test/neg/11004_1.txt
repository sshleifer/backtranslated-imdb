Yes, it's a SBIF classic (So Bad It's Funny). With a budget of tens of thousands of dollars, some of the most heinous acting you've ever seen, and absolutely NO faintest, fearsome moments - not even a nanosecond! The camera work took place at the elementary school level - one who was shot in front of a house, was obviously in the hand and jerked crazy. Blood looked like watered-down Kirschkoolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher's shop for the "human" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask Wal-Mart could provide at the last cut and realize what a mess that was? Most names in the credits have to be pseudonyms, it would be suicide in your career if you have THIS on your CV. Do yourself a favor and watch instead Eberts video of his colonoscopy!
