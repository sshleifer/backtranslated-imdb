Oh yes, I admit, I was guilty of the crime of having seen this garbage. I can not say that I was forced by aliens who aimed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes, and then made that terrible apology for a movie. No, I did it with my free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here, people. - Acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if any) is ridiculous. - Character Development Is Terrible - The characters that appear in the movie are so clich√©d that you would recognize them in your average comic book. - The editing is sloppy and unimaginative. - The camera work is quiet. - Dialogue is simply the worst in film history. - The Director: Well, let's just say, I bet it was not Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Then, to add these facts, absolutely no talent was involved. The director now has to smoke crack to forgive himself for inflicting this poison on the world. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Passport to Paris is one of the worst movies ever made. PERMANENT!
