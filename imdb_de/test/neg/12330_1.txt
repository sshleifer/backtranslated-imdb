There is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole Christmas. Let's get this part out of the way. First of all, I would like to say that I believe that Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was ... well, just awful. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey has been cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and is fearlessly committed to exaggerated, outrageous characters. Mike Myers has retired to his old bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers? The kids could care less, and the demographics of Austin Powers will not spy on this movie. So, what did the studio think? <br /> <br /> The Cat was apparently also related to Linda Richmond. Can we speak? Why a New York accent? Not quite consistent with something Dr. Seuss ever wrote. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish stuff. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio have tried to work out before just giving in and saying, "Unless you say 'fahklempt' you can keep the accents." Meyers never seemed to find any comfort, be it with the costume, make-up or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The jokes, the few that exist, were rude and unworthy of age. When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers it to the camera: "dirty ho", everything was missing but the edge shot, and even that would not have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who created 'Whoville' were clearly involved in creating the city and the houses in 'Cat'. The sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from bad writing, directing and the Myers. <br /> <br /> There was some fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware that he was in a dr. Seuss Classic based film and remained true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat should be castrated and must never multiply again. Please, please, no continuation.
