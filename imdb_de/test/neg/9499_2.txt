I do not know where to start. Maybe the whole idea of ​​this movie was just a catastrophe just waiting for it. A kidnapping has nothing humorous. I do not know what was more offensive - the theme or "performance" of David Arquette. It was like watching a bull cut his penis, though I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers should find something different about Sinatra than kidnapping his son (as I do not know his TALENT AS A SINGER !!!!) His family should not have to relive this horror, thank God it was only shown on HBO and not in Please do not pay attention if you have respect.
