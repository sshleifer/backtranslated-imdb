I can not believe that I actually set up a "Season Pass" for my TiVo, apparently they had a good preview or something. I can not imagine that, though. After watching for about 5 minutes, I thought to myself .. why am I looking at this ... It's definitely not the reality and some of the worst drama I've ever seen on TV .. I'm totally addicted to reality TV and nothing real about it. THE ACTING .. (if you can call it that) is terrible .. The only ones who are nearly 5% decent are the girls who are supposed to pull viewers into the show .. though they would have to be a lot prettier to save this one Train wreck .. if they had more lines, they would probably change my mind because they probably have no talent either. This is obviously a production with a very small budget and apparently very cheap "actors". There is no way they could get another job. Someone needs to get these people to a job in the hospitality industry. Maybe they could do that. Incidentally, Parco P.I. does not occupy space on the season ticket list of my TiVo or TiVo. Definitely the worst show I have ever seen.
