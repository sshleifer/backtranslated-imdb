The most generic surface-level biography you could hope for. Busey's impersonation of Holly is correct - but who wants Gary Busey to sing "Maybe Baby"? Normally, the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith or Stroud), rather than as humans or even as characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old, Jewish-looking guys say he uses the same techniques as Mozart. It is precisely this sassy statement that makes biopic biographies like this (and "Amadeus" about the above-mentioned Mozart) so worthless. Some conversations can be deduced from Holly's excellent styles and songs in B-Variation.
