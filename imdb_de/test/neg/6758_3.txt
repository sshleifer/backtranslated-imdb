Remains of a raided army unit join a group of cowboys to fight on the warpath by Indians. Sounds like an exciting western, but this one is boring, boring and boring. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are uninspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography is not very good. In a very early role, Eastwood plays a former Confederation that does not like fighting on the same side as Yankees. This is the only remotely interesting situation in the entire movie, but Eastwood was not an experienced actor to try, and his character looks more bitter than angry or bitter. An ordinary Western. Actually a very unusual western. Worth a look if you're a diehard Eastwood fan and want to see him at the beginning of his career. Otherwise, do not bother.
