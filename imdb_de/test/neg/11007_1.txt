John Madden's filmic interpretation of Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton does not do justice to a great literary work. While the story is maintained, the elements that give the novel its soul are impaled and all in all lost in the film. Madden can not convey the innocence and tragedy of the relationship between Ethan and Mattie, rather than turn them into a moral story. The marker is missed and the point is lost through added details and bad dialogues. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the least likable character of the book, where she can be almost pathetic in the film, though it's a stretch in which to look bad for that sick woman who is being cheated feels. The book describes in more detail how Zeena controls the tyrannical control of the house and of Ethan. The movie just left me. The addition of the fox was pointless, as was the scene in which Mattie tried to kill herself. It was poorly interpreted and executed. Film Errors: Ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with Denis Eady, addition of love scene, Fox scene, store scene, stating his plans, absence of Ethan's inner feelings and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of a nameless engineer, let too much know that Zeena knows about the growing relationship in which the reader never knows what Zeena thinks or is aware of. Just too many shortcomings and bad direction decisions.
