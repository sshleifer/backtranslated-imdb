A co-worker told me to watch this movie because he considered this movie one of the best movies ever. So I saw it. First, I have to admit that I do not like mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning. <br /> <br /> And that's the point why I do not like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, entertaining, absurd and exciting pieces. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller (as the German packaging reads), but the movie was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may be able to create a combination of different images, but the composition tastes as bad as a combination of milk and beer. Both are pretty good for themselves, but together?
