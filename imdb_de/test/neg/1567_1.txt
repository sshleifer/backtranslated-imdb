G & M started a few couples in Man About the House and made the nation amused in their own sitcom. The transmission of G & M to the big screen was just as horrible as Morcombe and Wise of Genuis and countless good TV shows. <br/> <br /> Unfunny. Unsatisfactory and with a sick Yootha Joyce, who died before the movie was released.
