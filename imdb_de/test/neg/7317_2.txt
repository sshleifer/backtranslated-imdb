This is a typical college comedy and very average. The story is okay, but not very entertaining. It's about an unfortunate guy named Reno, who loses his job, his car is torn off and his uncle dies in a groin. He did get a girlfriend (a nice, by the way. :-). Anyway, this uncle gives him his villa in LA and Mercedes as his heir and soon Reno and his girlfriend move to LA in this new house. The problem is that they would need some roommates to pay the high rent for this house and the movie can unfold. The movie suddenly turns to hell ... the end is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything about the movie. You'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
