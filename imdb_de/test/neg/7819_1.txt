Ever wanted to know how deep a movie could sink? Well, do not look any further! This movie has everything! <br /> <br /> Racism Jokes, Disabled Jokes, Overweight Jokes, Suicide Jokes, Murder Jokes, Drug Jokes, Animal Abuse Jokes, Eating Dirt Jokes, Old Man Young Wife Jokes, Cancer Jokes, Gay Jokes, Dung Jokes Falling joke on face, jokes about blood, joke, rape, shit, alcohol abuse, anal rashes, a lot of people who wake up their coffee, nudity jokes, see who can say the most curse words in a scene jokes, lesbian jokes, abuse Jokes of girlfriends, and the list goes on and on people! <br /> <br /> The worst thing is: none of it is funny! (Not that anyone would find most of them funny in the beginning.) It just does not seem like it will lead to a completely new expectation at the worst, as it always seems to find another that makes the viewer feel worse. There was a scene where I almost vomited and was almost completely depressed. I do not think I have to point out which ones. But on the other hand, I'm sure there are other scenes that will give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie there was a moment A film that made sense and was a bit realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled up with the worst remnants of a garbage bag and several feet on the floor Just threw some beer bottles in his head. All this probably when he has least earned it. All thoughts of another 1-point salvation were quickly considered. This is indeed a horrible movie. This is one that has to be studied in a film school and divided into small parts to teach the students what they should not do.
