<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K and member of MFT3K) I have to say that I have seen my share. But my goodness! Even the worst I've ever seen had at least one soundtrack. George Lazenby wanders stiffly through Hong Kong and does who knows what, and you can guarantee that you will not be distracted by the background music that fills today's cinema. Or any music that fills elevators. I do not think anyone in this movie is even buzzing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not entirely true - there is a soundtrack. If you listen carefully, you will hear the ringing about half a dozen times in the course of the movie. Of course, the timing is completely inappropriate and does not take a long time, but something that could be classified as "music" occurs. Your best bet, however, is to sit your toddler in front of the TV with a wooden spoon and a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and the river would be better than anything the movie offers. Keep an eye on Sammo Hung as a little villager in this movie. Are not we all happy that he found Jackie Chan?
