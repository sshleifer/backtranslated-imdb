"The Love Letter" is one of those films that could have been really smart, but they wereted it. The film focuses on a letter that has caused havoc in a small town and has a star star that has nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had recently starred in the super-cool "In & Out" (also because of an upset in a small town) where they were both great, but here they look like they're getting drugs everywhere. I can not say what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if at all), but they certainly have not achieved anything. How tragic that a possible laughter uprising was so sadly wasted.
