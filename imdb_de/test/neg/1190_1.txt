In the first 25 minutes, it became clear that the writers really wanted to do a full-length movie, and they probably enjoyed the whole process, but then she seemed to forget the fact that she needed a decent storyline! If the best they could do was bring three of the most boring characters into the real world and have "all sorts of amusing capers," then they should have been fine alone! I did not even laugh and the whole "Adventures of Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" in the middle was very, very poor! Convaluted, invented and very loose. It seemed like a whistle-stop tour of anything that they believed could work just to make it a feature. <br /> <br /> Full of Holes, To save her, Jeff managed to place himself in the history of William and Mary and the era. If he could, why not just write Royston himself - you? And the audition by Mr. Lipp? What was that for? I mean, what was the point? He did it, and we did not hear anything else about it? <br /> <br /> My main point is that although the series was loved by me, it was a poorly thought-out, seemingly rushed project. To put it like this, the plot was so bad that if we did not already know the characters (and as a fan had some loyalty to keep going) and we relied solely on the story itself, that would be flat on the face! It would have gone straight to the video, and in the worst case it would not have been done at all! Or should that be the other way around? Really terrible ....
