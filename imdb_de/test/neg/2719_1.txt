Radio is possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the worst. It made me laugh in places where you should cry and made me scream at moments when you should laugh. it lacked any kind of character development that is normally crucial to a sentimental movie. Some questions about why Ed Harris's character took radio under his wing were not properly explained, and I am sure that their relationship (which is the main aspect of the film) is the most meaningless if it has ever been seen. <br /> <He is a crap actor and should be harassed until he takes up another line of work. <br /> <br /> When it comes to true stories, this is not so interesting. The reason I said it's one of the best movies I've ever seen is because, despite all the paper, I still enjoyed it. Laugh at the script and most of the monologues that are really the work of either an idiot or someone who is very smart and tries to show how easy it is to release a shitty movie about a retard that becomes everyone's favorite joke. The fact is, Cuba's character is a comedy food for the people watching the football matches.
