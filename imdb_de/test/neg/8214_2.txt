My bad movie guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) incited us last week. There was no denying the insanity in his eyes as he pulled him out of his brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "The Most Dangerous Game," with a budget of $ 2.95 was filmed. <br /> <Of course, $ 2.95 went much further in 1962, but still ... <br /> There's a lot of dislike for this movie anyway. It's full of serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the "repeating musket" which was fired twice in two minutes without reloading required). The hero is a dizziness who stands by while his wounded friend fights against the henchman and is killed. <br /> <br /> More? OK - The plot is a confusion with no continuity to talk about. The film wastes five minutes with a "special guest star", the physical embodiment of madness and the paranoia of the villain, but never shows him again. The hero is suffocated unconscious by the henchman, but does not mention it when he wakes up and meets his host first. The mute servant girl is captured, put on the shelf ... and then the movie (and the hero who puts her in this predicament) just gets sort of "forgotten" about her. <br /> <br /> More? Well, the sets are cheap and the special effects are cheaper (make-up is an exception). Much of the storyline is carried by the narrator's monotone-sounding voice, which has less dramatic effects than Denny's Menu Concert. Most dialogues are just ridiculous and stilts, as if translated from Japanese. ("I demand that our conversation be pleasant !!!") and the color values ​​tended to shift sharply from image to image, as if cheap footage and problematic lighting devices were commonplace. (Note - the latter was possibly the fault of a faulty expression and not the camera crews). <br /> <br /> But there were some nice moments here and there. The make-up effects were surprisingly good, unlike the rest of the movie, the actors were very interesting, especially the mute servant and the countess. And despite everything, there was a definitely scary atmosphere, very uncomfortable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So, what was the deal with this movie? I thought about it a bit and found that director / writer Pat Boyette was basically trying to put a story out of the old "EC" horror comics into movie. That would explain the stilted dialogue, the sketchy character development (in a comic, physiognomy = character even more so than in the movie), the inner logic of the story ("EC" horror stories went all out to trap a nasty) shock "and ended was not exactly psychologically realistic), the excessive reliance on the narrative voice (which is part of captions on the panels) and the interesting make-up effects that mimic the gruesome images that made the old EC artists so good If I were to bet that Boyette, seeing his lead man during the casting, immediately realized that the guy was almost the equivalent of the lanky, confusing characters and sank into faces that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis were real people were drawn and could still exist in the real world, emphasizing the carton-like aspect of the visuals with costumes d light effects and transformed everyone into living EC comic characters. (See: the stark beauty of the leading actress, the Count's strong bony features, strange bronze skin and sharp chin, the platinum on the big, bony black henchman, etc.). <br /> <br /> This would explain the film Failure Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but he did not know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette could tell a scary story in a comic book page, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. Of course he would not be the first person to deal with this problem - look at what Joel Schumacher did to Batman. But he did not have a big budget to hide behind it. In any case, I imagine Boyette has moved away from this train wreck and probably less thought about "Dungeon of Harrow" the people posting on the message boards of this movie. He has done what he set out to do within certain vague limits and you must respect him for it ... even if you are not interested in "Harrow".
