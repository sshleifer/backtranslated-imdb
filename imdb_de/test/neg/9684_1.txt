How offensive! Those who liked this movie probably never opened a Bible. I can imagine the ones at NBC saying, "OK, let's make a movie to appease these annoying Christians, but they'll never know the difference if we have no factual or chronological order." Well, they were wrong. Anyone involved in this atrocity must find a church and repent if he is involved in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I could not give it a 0.
