The title does not make much sense to me. I am not sure which door in the movie should not be opened. <br /> <br /> The film begins without incident with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly decorated railroad car, complete with the sound of the train. In fact, the man's house is a wagon, and he has a cassette with train noises. The woman goes and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her friend, a doctor, that she has learned that her grandmother is ill and that she has to return to her hometown. She has not been there for thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Flash thirteen years ago. A shadowy figure enters a house. He strokes a sleeping young girl, then goes to another room and pricks the girl's mother. The girl wakes up, enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife. She screams, and one arm comes out of nowhere and claps her hand over her mouth. She looks up in fear. This early scene in the movie, where the killer curbs her scream, and the girl's look is one of the few effective shots in the movie. <br /> <br /> The visual department does not have much to offer. It happens occasionally that the sound is used strangely, and in a mansard scene where many of the glass panes are red and blue, there is strange lighting. <br /> <br /> Back to the present. The young woman arrives at her grandmother's house. There is an old doctor whom she does not trust, together with the man from the opening scene "Richter" and Kearn, the city's museum operator. She does not trust any of them and it is true that they do not inspire confidence. She's pretty grumpy throughout the movie. She wants to take her grandmother to a hospital. The men in the city want their house, and the museum owner wants the things in it (his museum is already filled with many things of the grandmother). For some unexplainable reason, the woman wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman gets calls from a man who speaks in a eerie whisper. He makes various threats and wants her to do something to excite him. Such scenes are often repeated. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the film that the possibilities of who it could be are limited. Worse, we see from the beginning who is on the phone. So while the young woman does not know (though the caller occasionally falls into his normal voice), the audience always knows: no tension. Every call rattles her more and more. <br /> <br /> The end was unexpected for me, so maybe there are some points that are not obvious, but I'm not sure I'm interested.
