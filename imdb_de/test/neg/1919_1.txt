Where do I start, where do I start ... hmmm ... well, how about some of the stiffest, most unnatural, unbelievable and most popular performances imaginable? How about stereotypical "characters", situations and places? Or how about a manipulative, annoying and extremely miserable script? I can not imagine any element in this film that is original, worth seeing or interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to all Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski fans - enjoy their fifteen minutes together, people, because they will not be famous for much longer ...
