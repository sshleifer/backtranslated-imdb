This movie is not worth the time to put it in the VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two love bounty hunters, but they are total opposites. She is ambitious and organized while being relaxed and totally immersive. <br /> <br /> In this movie, bad guys chase Jersey Bellini (Dudikoff's character). This opens the door to bad sponsor imprints, ridiculous fight scenes, and Tony Curtis, who plays the most-looking mob boss I've ever seen! The end must be the most incredible scene I've seen in a movie for quite some time. I think the Terminator, even the Matrix, has a better chance of possibly being true than this end! This movie only stinks of cheapness. The script must have taken someone as totally ridiculous. Nevertheless, the green light was given that this bitch was made and released by an unsuspecting audience. I saw this movie with several other people who all agreed we were cheated. No one in the group could say anything good about the movie except that it was over.
