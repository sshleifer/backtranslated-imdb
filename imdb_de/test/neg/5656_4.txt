First of all ... I have to say that acting is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but honestly not such a good actress. Spencer, her brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite, because he's probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly, on the other hand, tries to play her heart, but ... I'm sorry, it's just not good. Sam does not even get credit, I mean, come on ... ICARLY ... pretty self-centered, right? Freddy is not bad, I have no comment. I have to add that Carly and her doll Sam change their mind when filming a webcast. They call out all their lines. It's a vicious influence because Carly has a web show and when kids copy this maybe they give their own information and that's not very safe. <br /> <br /> The only nice things are that it has some fun parts of the show that make it entertaining. At least this show is not boring, she has nice acts, pretty strong. Many children will like this because they are not looking for mistakes. Overall this is a bad show, but it is not boring.
