Typically Steven Seagal fare: That's crap. The plot is based on a series of incredibly unlikely coincidences; There is a tremendous dose of conspiracy theory that would be much tastier if we did not know that Seagal takes it all literally; And once again, multi-millionaire Seagal tells from a bad movie about the ills of The Rich. The survival of Seagal depends, as usual, on the fact that Bad Guys never fire their weapons from poor arms and always like to make a small "I'll kill you" speech before a man's head is blown away. <br /> <br /> Watch this right after the even worse * Fire Down Below * and notice how The carpet in Keenen Ivory Wayans' apartment is more flammable than a big gasoline pool. Oh, and watch the latest fight scene for the Incredible Disappearing Forehead Wound, which is probably the most entertaining movie.
