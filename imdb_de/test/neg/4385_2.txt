I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free nudity. Why did not I like this movie? No film like this should put the plot itself in the least confusion. Who is who, where is the money, it is not SE7EN, just makes me laugh. Maybe I am, but I never felt frustrated watching American Pie movies or other modern National Lampoon films. This movie has no flow that makes me smile and waits for what comes next. Instead, I keep thinking, "Why did you keep this scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you expect Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I had watching this movie was guessing which movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generous.
