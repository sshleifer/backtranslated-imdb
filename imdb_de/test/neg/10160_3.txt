I had seen this movie when I was a boy (before World War II) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. I saw it again after about sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not an "A" movie. No editing, bad script, weak acting and not much directing. Should not even be as high as a "B". Had a laugh about how dull I got. It seems to me that it was good when I originally saw it.
