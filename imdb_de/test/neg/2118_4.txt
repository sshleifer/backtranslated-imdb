This is a perfect example of the mainstream horror crap of the 90s. Nothing is scary and the movie is almost bloodless. Yes, there is violence, but everything is politically correct as in a TV movie. This is not a completely bad picture, I can say with certainty that I found it quite pleasant. However, a lack of originality really hurts "voodoo". All in all, if you're a part of the mainstream crowd, and pseudo horror movies like "Scream" are your favorite I love "Voodoo," but if you want something very cruel, avoid this movie.
