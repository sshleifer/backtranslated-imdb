Simply put, Mind of Mencia is the worst, most unruly show on Comedy Central and possibly the entire TV ... at all. I love Comedy Central and watch a lot of shows and movies all the time, but every time the intro for this show starts after a good comedy, I can not find the remote quickly enough. Mencia tells used, worn-out racist jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, then point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say, "They liked it, so it pleases all their races and me too" . Give me a break Mencia, I do not know if these people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and pick him up after one of your ridiculous jokes does not mean he thinks you're funny. it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do to beat you on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep and meaningful, and that they give some food for thought, as shown in his commercials, but if you look at the show, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you do not have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that, maybe you have to finish the 3rd grade Carlos. The guy goes on to say that he says what others think, but I think if anyone thinks about what he's saying, they've found out for themselves that it's ridiculous, and that's why they never said it in the first place. <br /> <br /> All in all, look at 1 episode and be done with it when you have to, because after you've seen 1 episode, you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central is constantly renewing this terrible show is a mystery to me. If you're looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere, as you'll find very little of it here.
