I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I saw this show a few years ago on A & E. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave her a chance because I liked these actresses. This must be one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I would not look at it again and definitely not waste money buying the video. The story of this TV version is ridiculous and just stupid! The "kicker" (pun intended) comes when Ruth is operated on her leg bones. This nonsense belongs in James Bond and sci-fi movies. If this version matches the book, I will not check the book out of my local library! The American version appeared several years after I saw this original. To my surprise, the Americans got it right this time because their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is played for fun and is pretty funny. When playing for laughter, the action works.
