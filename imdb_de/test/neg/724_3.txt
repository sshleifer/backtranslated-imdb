This is one of four films by television author Lane Slate in the 1970s about sensational murders in small towns. They show sympathetic TV personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as regulars in the city, including easy-hearted love interests. The others are: They only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl in the Empty Tomb and the Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). Ala's is located near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); the others in California, Garner's by the sea ("Eden Landing") and Griffith's in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everybody tries to capture the feeling of a small town, to move between comfortable characters in a relaxed pace and to tell a secret with at least complicated turn or to turn. At this level, they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often repeated themselves, indicating their attraction). However, they generally suffer from thin stories and dialogues, slow tempo, bland settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and repulsive, forced attempts (often youthful or crude) in color or humor. <br /> <br /> Aldas and Garners are the most serious about story, characters, step and tone. They have the best supporting casts, though Aldas is better used; the Griffith is pale in comparison. Alda's has the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" has surprise and drama. The method of the killer is inventive. The tone is more balanced and the dialogue more natural than Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like the others in smug city transplants, or under hokey, exaggerated local characters who both act as characters of a Hollywood scriptwriter, not so real (the worst culprit is the pipsqueak from Griffith movies) mumbling idiot "Whit "who, we are told, has been trying to tie a jeep to a trailer that serves as a temporary bank branch, pulling away the dock for the police boat, tomatoes from a farm trailer just steals nothing for them and filled $ 11 on the payout slip from "Spiro T. Babylis", which was only discovered by the cashier. Mercifully absent is the cumbersome dialogue with the repetitive hands from the Griffith movies ("Are you going for lunch?" "I'm going to get the boat out." "You'll take the boat for lunch?" "Me, I'm not going for lunch. "" You will not go by boat for lunch? ";" There is no fish in this lake, why are you fishing here? "" It is illegal in Horse Mountain. "It is also here, you are breaking the law." There are no fish in this lake. "" Then why are you fishing here? "" I told you it's illegal in Horse Mountain. ";" Please call me Lloyd, my name is Lloyd. "" Okay Lloyd ... "" Call me Lloyd, that's my name, my name is Lloyd. ") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low, key and unimpressive to be taken seriously even as a small sheriff, certainly not a fervent lawyer in demand from a rival city, Slate allows the character so much if he comes late due to an accidental name recognition to a hitherto obvious clue. Instead of recognizing or investigating, Barnes blindly suggests emotional denial. His secretary Lasser gives him a key note ("Why did not I think about it," he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene and a conspiracy formula lead to another clue. Worse, Barnes is more interested in taunting the military helmets of county police that come to his aid (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military, as she or his own men effectively He allows a late murder by guarding a known target incompetently Barnes allows his car to be rammed repeatedly by the killer who has fled a crime scene without pulling his weapon or trying to control himself Again, it is ineffective and almost dead in the climate scene, due to several errors that are only partially corrected inadvertently, and the unpredictable northeastern accent influenced by Alda does not contribute to its credibility. <br /> <br /> There are plotting holes, why should the killer strike after all these years, and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible, but they are nothing compared to later: a couple together, a shopkeeper in his shop during office hours, a fully-dressed deputy sitting in his office, and, unbelievably, his dog! <br /> <br /> Allah's film also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all films. Barnes first appears in the bed of a motel employee. Then he treats her roughly and offended at every opportunity and tries to avoid her children. This and the conversation about the doctor smells of a coarse, mean pattern (Garner's film was labeled as "dirty"), including a scene in which he and a deputy laugh at how a girl in the backseat of a car laughs with it on the street hit a part of her anatomy that a man in the car had bitten off with her. Griffith's function and a substitute for Roper's routine in which the woman embarrassingly tries to lure the man into the "supply cabinet"; Replacing a room type with a substitute in the discussion about a young woman's car crash ("Did you take her out?" "I took her in once."); pointing out the bank employee "Bernice" as "swollen in places" and "putting a needle in her" and "hating" and shooting secretary "Maude" because she was "too hairy"; a description of the doctor's practice as "two stirrup tables and a flashlight"; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan suggests Griffith offer "something of his own," and an insulting subplot in which a proxy persecuted wife plays Ed like a drunken buffoon seems to "sleep around"). <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film has a bleak, bleached, colorless, lifeless look and feel. Only Louise Lasser adds sparks. At least the other films had mind, scenery and pleasant music; Griffiths climbed the mountainside, the lake, and even the big city. They feel that Master or Empty Grave is shocking.
