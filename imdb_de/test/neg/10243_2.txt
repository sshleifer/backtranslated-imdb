This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not feel like I wanted to forcibly remove my eyeballs after seeing Galaxina. It's just not good. The jokes are almost funny, but fail. All of them. The few gags approaching are repulsed by repeating them over and over again. The production values ​​are not available. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad ... it just seems cheap; overly so. The dialogue ... well, often he lacks - many unpleasant silence; They all just hang around and it seems someone should say something. The film even seems to be ambiguous about what it wants to be - it's not always clear that it was meant to be a comedy - like maybe the one that emerged after the shoot. It feels like someone threw a movie project the night before, when it was due, and if they had spent two weeks it could have been good. <br /> <br /> And I'm easy to please. I thought "Mom and Dad save the world" would be a shout. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is close to a classic. This turkey just does not do it. "Space Truckers" was more believable. <br /> <br /> Avery writer, who can be very funny, tries too much. His role calls for a straightman, and he plays it in the direction of sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is fine in her role, but not particularly notable. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the "My clock is always slow". Line was funny. I give this movie all the kudos he can get, he needs them. The spacecraft models are not bad, but there are few and are not used effectively. The space scenes are vague. No extended passes, no detailed fly-bys, not even suitable action scenes when docking. (The Infinity lands very strange at one point.) The flight dynamics are terrible; Worse than anything you have seen, they are jerky and not smooth. The first fight is stilted and static; Although the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in a jerky manner, they swap (slow) shots up close in a way more reminiscent of a 16th-century naval battle, unless they are not exciting. <br /> <The aliens - imagine if Star Wars was the Cantina scene. That many rubber masks could dull pretty quickly, no? Some are used as visual gazes that are okay the first time, but not the fifth. If you try to observe Galaxina, you will probably fall asleep trying to observe Galaxina. (I was busy with something else and missed the last ten minutes, and I did not feel like it was worth repeating.) If that's not "shit," I do not know what it does.) Unfortunately, there is a lot of potential and that could have been a good movie. It would be easy to do it again and have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
