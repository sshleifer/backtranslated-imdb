I had high hopes for this David Lynch, which I really like, but the very bad acting of all except Naomi Watts was the first indication that this was a wasted effort. Some Twin Peaks characters are recycled in this movie, but it was not scary, it was not interesting (except the topless Watts scenes) and the quirks were poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I'll probably give Lynch another chance, but the hype surrounding this movie just does not end, especially for those of us fans who saw Eraserhead when he first came out.
