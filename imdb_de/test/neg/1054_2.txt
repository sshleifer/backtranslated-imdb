This is your typical junk comedy. <br /> <br /> There are almost no laughs. No real moments. No memorable lines. No scenes in which you think to yourself, "that was wise". Nothing. The plot is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to look at and boring as hell! There is no substance here. This movie has nothing. It does not matter if Farely was there or not. A crap movie is a crap movie, no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> Also David Spade is a terribly listless comedian who plays the same lousy character in every movie / TV series he's in. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. No fun. No Intelligence There are many other "stupid" comedies that are more enjoyable than these. This movie is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
