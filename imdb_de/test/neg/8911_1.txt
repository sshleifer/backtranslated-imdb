Stephen Seagal plays the role of a guy who is persuaded to drive an armored car into a bank and drives into everything that gets in his way. However, the police appear to have appeared at the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat notifying the police in advance. The story comes in many turns, and the money from the robbery is gone, and nobody knows his new owner. Poor Seagal gets a little bit into this situation and, of course, is looking for the person or persons trying to put it away for a long time. In this movie, Seagal tries to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately this is not a great movie and rather boring and too long.
