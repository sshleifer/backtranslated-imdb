This film was a grim attempt to recreate a crucial time in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the war is only marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was gone. This film implies that the war was started because of religious differences, but the civil war was in no way Catholic against Protestantism: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill and he never "saved the day". The royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "five members" to be removed from the house and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was decent. The producers tried WAY too hard and it was not that great. <br /> <br /> could definitely have been better.
