This film starts with a man who seems to be a kind of sportsman. He meets a gang that contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who turns between the three. The group, which is referred to as Satan's angel, wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no and then says yes, after the authorities have made him a spy to check them. They rob a gun shop in a ridiculously missing scene. In the scene, the woman with long hair and big round glasses goes to the store. She says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how to do it. She then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him. The other three in the gang (except Rod) run into the store. They take everything off the walls and then play with it as if children were getting their toys on Christmas day. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly does not waste precious screen time on an action.
