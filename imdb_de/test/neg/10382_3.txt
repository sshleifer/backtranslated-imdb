This movie just seemed to lose direction. The plot developed so many twists in such a short time that it seemed to lose the semblance of real action. There were many wasted dialogues, and it seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering. The exorcism scenes and the ownership story fell into the background of the character's back stories (which were a bit weak at first). All in all, I would say skip it if you do not rent the rest of the horror section in your local video store, and you have a Jones for a movie you have not seen. It's much better to just look at the exorcist or exorcism of Emily Rose.
