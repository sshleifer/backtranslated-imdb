I debated between this film and 2012, but chose Inglourious Basterds for its amazingly high IMDb rating. I have to say, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of violence, but also a funny dialogue. I got a big dose of the former, but not nearly enough. I felt shortened. The relationship between violence and action is very important and I think that this film is completely wrong. And the action? It's believable or really so entertaining. Save time and money. I can not believe what this review testifies to the bloody and violent taste of the modern masses.
