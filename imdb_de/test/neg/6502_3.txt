Let me start by saying that I am not a very artistic person and do not "understand" a new art. That being said, this movie is absolutely crazy and in my opinion not very crazy. Avida is a movie that is completely shot in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories. It's a movie for anyone who can look at modern art and say, "Wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting." The only reason I give this movie a 3 out of 10 rating is because I actually managed to laugh at some parts, even though I was mainly laughing at the madness of the movie. Two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn do not know what these characters are supposed to do. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
