(The beginning could be a spoiler ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is the sequel to "The Eye". It's about a pregnant woman who can see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects scared me for a moment. Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeat themselves, so the chilling effects are certainly chilled. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a pretty scary and indelible look, while "The Eye 2" is an unforgettable horror drama movie. Do not let that happen. To see "The Eye" is good enough.
