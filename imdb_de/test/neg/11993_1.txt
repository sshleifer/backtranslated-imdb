I was a "chosen one" to see this movie in a preview. <br /> <br /> First, you should know that this movie is based on the video game "Far Cry", a game that was really good for its time (2004). Second, you should know that the director of this strip is the great Uwe Boll. This is a man who takes video games (Dungeon Siege, Bloodrayne, Mail, etc.) and makes movies out of it (VERY terrible ...). I still remember when I saw Boll's "Swords of the King: a Dungeon Siege Tail". There were so terrible mistakes in this movie (like playing 3 scenes at the same time, 2 during the day and somehow at night .....) <br /> <br /> so we come "screaming wide". "If you expect cool action, forget it really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far from real action.If you expect a cool story, forget it.This film orients itself to the not so bad history of the game and is a laugh funny in many moments, but in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I had a chance to watch this movie for free, so do not make a mistake and pay this garbage, it's one of my favorite flicks for the bottom 100th !!!!
