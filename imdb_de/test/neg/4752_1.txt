The production value of AvP2 can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous even in the fictitious field of AvP: What are the Facehuggers on the Predator ship? Why does the Predator clean out any signs of its influence and wasting valuable time escaping and even presenting the body of a minor human policeman? Why is the Predator alone? Why is the Predator only outfitting on Earth, but on its home planet? Why does the Predator make his job so restless that he chases the aliens and does not bomb the whole country, as people do in the end? Why does the Predator discard more and more of its few weapons instead of collecting them to keep them together after use? In the end, he even puts down his armor before fighting the Predalien in hand-to-hand combat: what a plagiarious plagiarism in the first bout of the first predators between Arny and the Predator. The Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he moves more like a Japanese sumo than a highly skilled alien safari hunter. As you can see right away, the whole story is a mess. But it gets even worse because this botched job is filled with boring patchworks of pointless interludes like a long pizza ordering episode or some detailed information about the two brothers' criminal past (Dallas & Ricky). Of course, the sheriff is the friend of these two criminals, whom he regularly puts behind bars. (not convincing and absolutely superfluous for the plot). <br /> <br /> In addition, the cast of actors is terrible. Compared to the high class of directors and actors of the former aliens or Predator movies, AvP2 is an awfully bad crap. <br /> <br /> Finally the action of the movie is really bad. There is not a single action fight scene in which the audience can see the entire set. Each fight is filmed in short and shaky outbursts with close-ups in almost full darkness. This leads to a terrible experience for the audience, as you usually only see a dark, wobbly screen. <br /> <br /> I suggest to the two directors Strause to buy a Steadycam and to get a lesson in modern CG the next film contains visible actions of visible characters and may not need his bad director skills this way disguise. <br /> <br /> I would advise anyone (including hardened AvP fans) not to watch this movie the first or the original aliens or the original Predator movie, but avoid disappointing themselves by wasting your precious time with this failure.
