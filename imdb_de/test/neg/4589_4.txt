Another horrible movie about hockey. If I had never seen hockey and seen Hollywood's version, I would hate the game. This movie does not make Canada look that great either. I can laugh about it and not take it too seriously. Still, this movie is awful, with everything you can put in a movie from the 80's. In the end, you will not even watch it on TV. 4.10
