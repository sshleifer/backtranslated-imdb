I found "Shuttle" an incredibly frustrating movie. It starts off pretty well and moves swiftly to the first "injury" (which is a doozy). After that, it becomes very lazy and signed as a story. It was the case of the plot that controls the characters, not the characters controlling the story. If you hate a movie where you can not understand why characters do what they do, you detest 'shuttle'. In particular, the last act is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. In the end, one of the characters confessed her friend a past offense rather than sympathizing with the audience. Most people started to giggle. This was probably because the "heroines" of the story were a complete idiot. Finally, there is an end that seems to be "shocking" and from the horror cop-out school of "People are bad, audience, so just accept it without explanation". <br /> Shuttle is neither good nor bad, but mediocre. And annoying.
