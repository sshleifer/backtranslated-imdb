The (DVD) movie "The Tempest" directed by Jack Bender was released in 2001. He did not come to German cinemas, and neither the director nor an actor could get an important prize for this film. The film refers to the Shakespeare play "The Tempest", which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create a modern version of this piece, but failed. At the beginning of the film, the plantation owner Prosper comes into conflict with his brother Antonio over the treatment of their slaves. Antonio takes his brother on a journey and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch Prosper can flee and flees with his daughter and a slave named Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi. For over twelve years he lives isolated on this island, until he can take revenge on his brother. If Prosper Can Be Lucky You Must Find It On My Opinion, this movie is really a poor attempt to create a modern version of the original by William Shakespeare. The story of the movie is as confusing as the characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as in the storm ..... END OF PART I
