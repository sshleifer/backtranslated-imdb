"De Dominee" is based on the life of a true Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I doubt that the events presented in the film have something to do with what really happened! But that does not matter! Because it did not catch my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! There is a lack of substance and style! The substance part could have been awarded if the drama was good and the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you have to bring at least some style or decent action! Do not we have to be entertained? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster films! It is obvious that he did not! Otherwise he would not have done that as he did! This movie was heavily spread by a minor scandal involving Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie! Without them, "De Dominee" would never have been successful! I am sure!
