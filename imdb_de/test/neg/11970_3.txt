Jerk Hazer Mike (David Zelina, who plays this college mate as a big bastard you want to see killed right away) and his college friends let hypoglycemic diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) hang out with this scarecrow, which is a legendary ghost story , They get PO from Sam, who essentially gets into a shock and hits a sweeping blow at Mike, who instead meets his girlfriend Patty (Kristina Sheldon). So it's his punishment to let the poor hang. Somehow, Sam's soul emerges with the inanimate scarecrow coming from the cross to destroy anyone who has left the poor guy there to rot. Mike and the gang send the inexperienced dorks back to topple Sam, but they're the first to get a swinging blade over their necks. Mike and his crew make their way to the beach to drink alcohol, play volleyball and defend themselves until the scarecrow comes to end their little soiree. Sam's replacement brother Jack (Matthew Linhardt) is to take care of him, but decides to sleep with the new, loving Beth (Samantha Aisling). So when he gets a cell phone message from Mike that they let Sam hang on the cross while they were on the beach and saw sun and sand, Jack is terrified of dread. Beth's estranged father is a doctor and agrees to see Sam after his condition after cutting off the nearly dead young man who has taken him to an emergency hospital. When he returns to the beach to confront Mike for his negligence (not to mention Jack's promise to train Ramsey hosted by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, since they are not rogues), Jack and Beth are getting full of straw Assassins are standing, rebounding the others. Coach Ramsey, who has been involved in an amazing incident in the past that has led to a killer scarecrow mischief, faces some demons while informing the group's survivors of what they have in front of them. <br /> <br /> Babes, boobs and blood ... this strip follows the basic slasher guidelines. However, this film also carries the typical slasher qualities of insane people, actors, dialogues and overall plot. The streak shows signs of his low budget, especially in the violence, as most of the actual actions take place off screen, rather than showing that they are nearby, close and personal. What appears on the screen is mostly the result of the murderer's revenge: one man holding his guts, another with a stake (holding the group's volleyball net) being pushed through his chest, spattering blood after a woman presumably Rock was hit over the head, a chick is dead after the scarecrow hit her with the SUV, etc. There are also some synchronization problems where it is clear that the voices of her voices often do not agree with the movements of her lips. In particular, the unintentionally funny sequence in which Ed (Travis Parker), MÃ¶chtabe-Rockstar, sings a dreadful song to his buddies, with which they all seem to be impressed.
