All I can say is that this movie was made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which means no fixed characters, no particular style, weak play style, all sorts of sex, but no boobs and bumps (because boy, that would not catapult the movie into the depths of sleaze?) but the heavily simulated sex, well, that's fine. <br /> <br /> When watching these movies, I have to wonder when these types of TV channels and their advertisers will ever grow up. I think these companies are actually far behind the times. They really have no idea what the younger generation is in tune with, and if they knew they would demand that we change. The point of many American television stations like this one usually seems to be dissolving the same cleaned-up, blurred garbage over and over again, like a conventional film-montage line. I think it works for you ... or at least it worked. Not sure about the future. <br /> <br /> Do not be bored to death like me. Look for real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, and so on. Any channel that struggles with its work and does not have to ask a priest what he or she can show.
