Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments obviously came from people who were either involved in the film or had friends / family involved in the film, and that's fine - if I had made a movie Everything from my family and my friends would compliment it. To be honest, there are some good things in this film besides the bad things. Unfortunately, the bad things outweigh the good ones. Good: The plot was interesting overall. The music was pretty good overall. Some of the songs (if you could hear them) were actually pretty cool. The only musical problems I had were: # 1) the first suspense scene with a kind of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to take away the tension), # 2) the song that was played as the main characters to an outdoor 3) The songs were too quiet, especially when a Heavy Metal song was played in the background while Danny Trejo hung a man (sounded like a pretty cool song) but should surprise the scene when Danny Trejo became froggy). Now for the completely bad stuff: The script was cruel. I mean, terrible. I've seen smoother dialogues in a Star Wars movie. Advice to the author of a part-time author and full-time movie artist: When writing dialogues, ask yourself, "Is that something people would actually say?" Honestly, the script was ridiculous. I want to hit acting, but with this type of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. The slightly interesting conspiracy was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue. I know that the budget was low, but words do not cost money. If you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can do it. This movie did not seem to have it, but hopefully the director gets a second chance to make a better movie.
