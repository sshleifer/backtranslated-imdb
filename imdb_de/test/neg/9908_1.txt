What I hate the most in this trash is the arrogant attitude of the filmmakers and the network managers, who impose this nonsense on the public, because they really think the audience is stupid, so undeserved and so tasteless that it deserves such disadvantages. There is an inherent entertainment program that involves seeing disaster films, and with the magic of today's CGI effects, artists get powerful tools to explore what they've been denied. With this fascination we sat to observe some chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos we saw was in the commercials for the episode next Wednesday. What a disappointment! But wait, there was even a bigger one. The script itself was the bigger catastrophe! And then there was the direction and the slack behavior of all involved in this turkey. But we knew that already correctly? We knew effects alone would not make conversation, but the network of Bozo Okayed did not care about this TV movie did not care, because in his mantra the eternal line "never underestimated how stupid the audience is." These guys really have to live by that motto, and I'm sick of it. No wonder the audience has left the US drama in droves and set up camp in reality shows. At least in these programs, nobody tries to make it look something different than it is: intellectual pornography. Well, category 6 is worse than that because it turns out to be different and "original". Yes, that was a disaster movie, but the catastrophes are not what they advertised!
