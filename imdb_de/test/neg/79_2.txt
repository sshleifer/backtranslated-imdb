No, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is not a movie, this is an excuse to show people dancing. That's just not good. Even dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre "Dirty Dancing", let alone another good dance movie. <br /> <br /> Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? It's not that this movie is a bit of everything, but that this movie fails in everything it tries to be. The film proves to be even more meaningless in the course of the film. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible from all angles, the script definitely tries to tell us something about the relationship, but fails miserably WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the movie might be better when it lightens the boring atmosphere. For a second.
