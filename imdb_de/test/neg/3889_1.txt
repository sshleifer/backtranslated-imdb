Days of Heaven is one of the most painful and boring movies I've ever seen. In no way, in shape or form, would I recommend it to anyone ... unless you try to put your children to sleep, or, God allows you to give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do something, I would set the rollers on fire before they were sent to the theaters. Why? The plot of Days of Heaven is simple but extremely vague. Long, dialog-free sequences make up a large part of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to refer to. The culmination of the story does not touch you: at that point, your brain has worked so hard to discover the conspiracy and order of the hidden metaphors that your thinking ability has disappeared. The only things that work are your eyes and, unfortunately, your ears that need to hear the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story who talks like a man. I'm stupid to have seen this movie now. Do not let it happen to you.
