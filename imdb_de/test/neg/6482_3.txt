The role reversal remake of "The Major and the Minor" from 1942 has made Jerry Lewis into the role of Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately, this anemic outing lacks more than just Ginger. Lewis tries to pass when passing a train for a child; He succeeds, but the delusion leads to a series of strange and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the script and threw in musical moments for Dean Martin (another in his stable of second banana stalls) and a jewel robbery plot (which is bleak). Diana Lynn, who played the crafty teen in the original movie, plays Lewis' love interest here. She is sweet; Jerry is not * 1/2 of ****
