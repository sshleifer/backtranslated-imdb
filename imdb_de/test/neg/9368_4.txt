Or has anyone else noticed the fact that the first episodes of the 90s were too much inspired by the 90s? I mean seriously, a woman who tries to get someone to murder his rich husband so she can claim his fortune. Medical students temporarily stopping their hearts to achieve memories that have been lost; Flatliner. A lot of college boards getting together to remember the old days, but they do not feel completely well because they've done something in the past. Very bad things? Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies of all time. Unfortunately, the writing stick behind his shit is a bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts. Noble idea that is completely dreaded in its execution.
