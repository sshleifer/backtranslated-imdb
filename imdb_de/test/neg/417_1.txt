The implausibility of the conspiracy was noted by several commentators, notably the immense inconvenience Ms. McKenna had to make, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he needed to do, including the fact that Langdon was about to decipher every clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; He gives orders a few seconds later, and a few minutes later he walks around (literally) and directs the operations - in real life he would be shocked. And as is usual with thrillers, the assassin does not kill the heroes and states as the only lame explanation that they were not on the kill list, as if every other innocent bystander he shot was. I've always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a really terrible movie (US President is commanding a jet and suggesting aliens, ha ha), and that effort brings it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who did not knowingly laugh when the Volkswagen assassin got his reward? I wanted to scream, "You'll be blown up." Who did not know that the heroine would find a body in the lab? Who has not seen the evil? Technically, the movie was terrible too. The dialogue was more unreadable than unambiguous, while the races over Rome to the nearest church were accompanied by deafening music. In addition, many scenes looked like mud. The only redeemer was the recordings of Rome and what looked like the Vatican - an accomplishment, because I'm sure the Vatican officials would not have wanted that slag in and around St. Peter's - and convinced the interior. Rome is a magical place, and I enjoyed watching it fleetingly.
