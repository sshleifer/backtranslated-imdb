This is one of the worse movies I have ever seen. You have to take something from Truffaut seriously; It's not just some B-movie emanating from Hacks. <br /> <br /> Truffaut apparently could not decide if he was making a noir or a sentimental chick movie. and even Deneuve, whose dozen (?) flip-flops are not unbelievable, is not even unbelievable. just not acted. Like a woman as beautiful as Deneuve, a person like Julie / Marion could be, among other things, simply impossible to suspend the unbelief. The role absolutely demands someone who is not so beautiful. Belmondo's play also suffers, though imho his character is not quite as incredible as that of Deneuve. The end of the clich√© (which I can not describe) is unfortunately too fitting for this complete mistake.
