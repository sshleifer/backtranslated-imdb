There were nice characters, played by good-looking actors and actresses, there was a famous band and some famous dancers ... but the movie just did not work. When this was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was stupid, the humor (mainly Milton Berles) was just stupid and the music just was not in my lane. <br /> <br /> I've never been a bigband fan anyway and when I hear that "In The Mood" once again I'm going to puke. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous skater actress Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost a part of the problem, at least in humor, is that it's so outdated it's not funny anymore. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, The Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello, etc. were hilarious in the 40s and 50s, but the humor changed, and what was funny then is not the case today.
