The filming of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a film and as a representation of the classic story of Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br /> There are some small differences between book and film, but this is expected in every book-to-film transition. Kurtz dies in another place; the manager does not accompany Marlow on his journey; Kurtz's lover spends much more time with him than in the story. The real problem is the amount of footage that is inserted into the film, but has no basis in the actual story. For some reason, the director has to "spice things up" some scenes, add dramas or actions that rarely make sense and are always unimportant to the story. Some examples that come to my mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who hits Marlow over the head and pulls him down. Nothing happens while he is unconscious and Marlow did not even provoke the attack. A few hours pass and he wakes up: a total waste of time. Kurtz has an animal monkey, which he kills for some reason on a whim. When Marlow leaves Kurtz's station, he makes the "noble" decision to leave behind all the precious ivory he had received without really having a reason. Another mistake is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a dreadful choice to play the man who is described as great and inspiring: a man with a commanding presence. He whispers virtually all of his lines, which could be very thoughtful in the hands of a more capable actor. I can not remove the image of John Malkovich, who plays a mentally handicapped farm laborer in Of Mice and Men, as I watch him play the role of Kurtz. Overall, I would rate the movie with 3 out of 10 stars. It's a good movie if you've read the book and you want to watch it in movie form, maybe to help you visualize the scenes, but as a source of entertainment I would never recommend it.
