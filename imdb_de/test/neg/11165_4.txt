I recently found this movie on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank version he uses to record material from television). The movie looks like it was last shown in the 1980s and I can not remember seeing it since. It has (to my knowledge) not been released on DVD or VHS, although I will rummage for a copy. The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the verge of puberty and the other much younger and a little boy who lives with his mother's mother and his young, dumb Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The Uncle of the Children is a nasty control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar while watching a puppet show that he and his brothers put down in his toy store. The oldest girl and one of the Irish (the younger ones) love each other while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the shop while her brother helps his uncle to make things in the shop. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements in the movie. There is the uncle who sees his wife as a kind of stupid (literally) possession (illustrated by the collar), while the Irish dance, drink and treat some forbidden love. Interestingly, though, I have seen far more explicit topics in other films shot in Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> You wonder if the British film industry and the BBC have some sort of hidden agenda. <Despite the fact that this is not a children's film, there are many playful, magical moments, and one Irishman makes some beautiful pictures.
