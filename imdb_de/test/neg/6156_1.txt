The quote above says it all about "slipstream". I should have gotten out of this movie after the first half hour, but decided fair and give him a chance. I will not look at it again. So, if someone who's prone to do so can come up with the number of clich√©s in the movie, I'm sure they'll set a record. <br /> <br /> Some otherwise good and talented actors mingled with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character has kidnapped Hamill's captive, an android bearing his name from poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with an arrow that contains a tracking device so that he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep an eye on the couple. The real question, however, is why he did not just fire the device at Byron to turn off the middleman. <br /> <br /> If you play scene by scene with incoherent scenes with boring characterization and artful fart, then I suppose, you 'll find something interesting here. But you can not convince me that the movie makes sense on every level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make room for high-society snobbery, but the culmination of the bad taste is attained when Paxton's character is shown up in the torso after a night of hooligans with hickeys. If someone thinks there is a hidden meaning here, you really stretch. <br /> <br /> Patient waiting for the frame proclaiming "The End" is unfortunately in sight. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then understanding too. this film had neither. Still, there was one salvation function as the final credits ran-a fantastic look at half a dozen hot-air balloons. Apparently the movie kept her afloat.
