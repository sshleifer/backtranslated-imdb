New Year 2006, and I'll be watching Glimmer Man again. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal's films amusing. How many comments, good fighting sequences - I especially liked that he answered the phone in the restaurant and said how long it would be closed for the restoration. A bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in the earlier action films - though that was more ironic. <br /> <br /> But I like Brian Cox here. One of the most versatile actors. Pity about his hand and his foot, but so much for standing up to a long interrogation - this class must have failed the "farm". <br /> <br /> As the films progressed, I wonder how the ever-widening extent of Seagal has affected his movement? Anyway, it's entertainment!
