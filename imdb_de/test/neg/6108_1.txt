As a writer and dilapidated Orthodox Jewish woman, I was enormously disappointed with this film. The dialogue is abominable and wasteful, and the characters, who are too much concerned with lines ranging from prosaic prose to the breathtaking melodrama, must not expand into truly textured individuals. The one-trick music score seeks to balance the remoteness by throwing the viewer and script out of the lengthy catatonia into the silence. <br /> <br /> Like a youthful revolutionary on a self-righteous tirade: This film is overwhelmed by the wisdom of its revelation - the patriarchy is wrong - and wastes its energies thoroughly and pounding on this point. The resulting artistic crime is a total lack of imaginative development; The moral crime is the reduction of man to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.
