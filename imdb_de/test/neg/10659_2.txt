The tempo of this movie is pretty slow. It takes about 70 minutes to bring Katie to China (which we know she will do) and leaves 30 minutes to get things together. The story is so predictable that you will know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess the movie is a movie that grows up, but the movie is full of stereotypes that are pretty over the top: <br /> <br /> Katie - A beauty who realizes she looks, boys and shopping are not everything. She realizes that she can "feel" and "see" the real world. Touch. <br /> <br /> The mother - high-strung, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative), who has to look after a strong man. <br /> <br /> The father - patient and always understanding and taking care of the incompetent woman. <br /> <br /> The friend who just wants to pants. <br /> <br /> The Chinese comedian clown who does not speak English properly and made a laughing stock. I think Hollywood dropped those characters in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse, who sometimes knows everything, how to move around in China, the next moment is a copy of the mother, ie a woman who can not handle this situation or knows something. <br /> <br /> The deformed Chinese girl, who gets Western help with the help of us and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country) there is nothing and therefore needs our charity. Gah, wake up and smell what you shovel. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is some poverty in China, but the portrayal of help from western countries (see USA) is so superficial and a happy ending is sad and repugnant. Shanghai (where the movie plays) is currently the most expanding and developing city in the world. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father is so kind and kindhearted that in the end a wish exists ... Be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> The teacher (Sean Astin) has this truly heartbreaking story (not) that he tells without feeling. Why Sean? WHY !? <br /> <br /> etc. etc. It is difficult to actually find a "real" person in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a good movie for Americans aged 15. If you want to know something about the world clock, just take Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or a movie that grows up, I suggest you check out the Italian "Cinema Paradiso", which received the best award for foreign film schools a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing in the movie was the small cityscapes that capture some (not all) of China's beautiful scenery. I was there and saw some of them.
