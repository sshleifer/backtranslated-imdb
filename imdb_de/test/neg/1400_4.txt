The stylized Hollywood Westerns with their well-known conventions seem to have an eternal life, and this is an avatar. Everything in it seemed to have been torn from the back of a 1939 drawer, a larger budget was applied, and this production was an expense. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played this role dozens of times - the displaced Southerners, fast on the draw and stuck with honor, if somewhat loose. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas to find the gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a suede shirt and grabs two ivory shooters. He speaks with a rural accent - "A forger could get hurt." (See "Sergeant York"). The gang is headed by Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, mostly by sneaky means whenever possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran, who can not play a Westerner, although he generally handles garbage bags very well. The necessary woman is Ruth Roman, daughter of the Mexican plantation owner, who looks and looks like a Boston Brown Betty. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm too busy with the plot. Undoubtedly, someone has studied it extensively, and there is not much else to mention. As in every western of 1939, it is a labyrinth. All but Cooper and his friends are inferior and there are several duplicate crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, the dialogue, the wardrobe, even the music. The score is by Warner's brave Max Steiner. He is the guy who scored "King Kong". That was 1932. This movie was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cooper 's name, by the way - "Blaye Hollister" - prompted me to review the records of the RACA - the Real American Cowboy Associaton - to see if this name had appeared in their archives from the beginning of the It was dated to February 4, 1911, when the last Real Cowboy died due to an unfortunate encounter with a troubled peccary. There has never been a real cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there are no records of a real cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The best-known names for real cowboys were in descending order of frequency Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebuchadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. If this movie had been released in 1939, he would have done this routine. In 1950, it is a catastrophic monument in the history of human recycling.
