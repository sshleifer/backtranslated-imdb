This is one of the few movies where you should watch popcorn with a bottle of vodka instead of a bowl. To be completely honest, we are a group of people who actually know the man Mo Ogrodnik and decide to dumb to this movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematic aspect of photography by Wolfgang Something seems to leave out both close-ups and breasts. The collaboration between Mo and Wolfgang showed the passion of the two actresses, Plastic Peens Holding Passion. There are also bugs to beat. Violet would have put it this way: "This (plastic jet) is going up your butt." The rat porn and the subsequent rat decay are great. <br /> <br /> Okay. So if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU, and we are a group of her students who, when she completed film lessons with her, decided to go to the cinema and make the directorial debut here. She also wrote uptown girls. I can not tell you how much was hammered in our skulls. So this movie is the experience. At the end of this post you will find a drinking game that we have created for this film. <br /> <br /> After about 13 minutes none of us could see directly. The sheer amount of didos in the first thirty minutes gave enough reason to reassure an elephant. It was something secretly pleasing when two underage girls found Kurt Cobain's Lookalike unconnected, apart from his mysterious scene at the grocery store where he, of course, read a local paper. Because we all do that. The heart-shaped glasses were derived from Lolita gorgeous. Something about this provocative scene of the naked Chin-up boy hints at the story of the director of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we were fun. <br /> <br /> Enough intellectual contemplation. ON THE DRINKING GAME! This ensures that the viewing experience is positive. It is very simple and it is very likely that at least one member of your group will be sent for immediate care. <br /> <br /> The Mo Ogrodnik / Mature Drinking Game: 1. Every time you're into pornography take a drink. 2. Every time you see the name of the author Mo Ogrodnik, drink something. 3rd sex. 4. (plastic cone) require two drinks. 5. Whenever someone directs a weapon at another character, you drink something. At this point, you probably need to refill / piss the remaining sobriety out of your body. 6. Whenever there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), take a sip! 7. The unused hula hoop girl needs a drink every second. 8. To use the "magic black man", a drink is required. 9. If you can not find the passage, KEEP DRINK, Beyotch. 10. Whenever you can predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /> <br /> That's it, internet! Keep drinking and do not try to mature. <br /> Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
