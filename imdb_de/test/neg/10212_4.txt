As a wrestling fan, films about wrestling generally shit (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story), but this is not the worst thing I've ever seen. Yes, it's bad, but it's better than some of the others I've mentioned. <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan essentially plays himself and for some reason a rival network wants him beaten because he does not want to be in this network. Let me explain it so that everyone can understand it. Picture USA Network with Rip ... and TNT will do anything to get him. <br /> <br /> Makes the point ... no? Do not feel bad, because it makes no sense. It also makes no sense to have a real ex-opponent with Rip at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> No movie makes sense, but compared to other wrestling films and later Hogan movies Not so bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
