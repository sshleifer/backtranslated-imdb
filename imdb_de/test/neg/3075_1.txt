Years ago, I made a pretty well-done TV movie called "Linda". It was made in 1973 and starred with Stella Stevens in the title role of femme fatale. Imagine my surprise when I saw the same story on late-night TV more than ten years later. However, it was this version of 1993 with Virginia Madsen. Do not get me wrong, I can do remakes, even if they are not clear. But this poorly written and badly filmed retread made me feel sorry for Madsen as well as co-star Richard Thomas. In contrast to the original, the dialogue here is a clich√©, and I ask myself: "Why did you bother to rewrite it?" Second, the camera work is very cumbersome and the stock of films is bad. At times I felt reminded of the student film contest at the beginning of "The Big Picture" by Christopher Guest. Finally, the cast looks either bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, Ted McGinley is the only one who really enjoys the work. With his perfectly peeled hair and clipped teeth, of course, he stretches from his previous work on "The Love Boat". Conclusion to borrow a review from Opus the Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This movie makes for the movie what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
