Misguided, failed, deceptive, endless madness in the face of the high-gloss MGM A-budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who suspects that her rich, handsome husband (Robert Taylor) is not a dreamer she married, but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt at a Hitchcockian thriller is from the beginning a crude, jumbled-up, ridiculous script and the idiotic cast of Hepburn as a vulnerable woman who fears for her life (who could ever fear Hepburn?) Forget to tell Vincent Minnelli that he was conducting a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassed. Only Robert Mitchum, also a good guy, is a good guy and retains his dignity in a quiet, restrained performance. Karl Freund's fascinating cinematography creates images of uncanny beauty - and was wasted with the wrong film. Final result: Metro "Parnell" of the 1940s.
