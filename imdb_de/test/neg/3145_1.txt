I was a little too old for this show when I first came out. When I was a kid, there were a few children's shows on Sesame Street that I looked at and learned from, but otherwise there was not much else. My cousins ​​were all born a few years after me. 7 years were the first more. Barney was a big part of what they were watching. When I saw this show for the first time, I told my grandmother that she did not teach anything, just used magic to fix everything. I was 9 years old then, how many 9 years old, what's really going on with a television program. The more I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were, the more I told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is that my parents had a small child in the mid to late 80s, which incidentally was me. They agreed and said the same as me. The sad part is my cousins, who are already 13 years old, and still agree with what they have seen. It's not scam, it's not creative, it's not right to think differently from what someone tells you. It is OK to steal if the person does not find out or does not know that it has disappeared. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney is out to make money and teach children nothing. The more conspicuous the program, the more inclined children will be to see it. Children are stupid, not because they are not trained, they just do not know it better. Second, Barney showed a show and parents bought it. I never thought that television could affect people the way Barney does. When you read a young child, watch a show that teaches you numbers, do not let them introduce you to this show. Barney is like smoking, smoking too much, smoking a few, and being addicted to letting your kid see this show, they're addicted and one day their kids will see the same crap and buy the same crap they bought to have
