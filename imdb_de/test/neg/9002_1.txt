That's not "that bad, it's good" - it's "so bad, it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment"! Only by reading the synopsis can you even find out the "conspiracy" of this "direct to video" catastrophe. It's a mix of grainy footage, along with some of the worst performances of all time you've ever seen. Comparing this incompetent, stubborn, humorless mess with "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid" is like saying "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". The talentless performers are clad in cheap dresses by J.C. Penney's "Goin 'to Church," and there's not the slightest attempt to make hairstyles or make-up from the past. If you really want to know how this kind of "homage" can work, check out "Cadavra's Lost Skeleton". Look for the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose sci-fi short film "The Attack of the 70-foot Lady" leaves this movie in the dust. The people in terror in the tropics look and sound as if they have been dragged off the streets and given their scripts to read. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney and all the other people involved in the films they can not do for this Schlock Festival! Money is not the problem - much can be achieved at very low cost. A good script, decent actors, and Z-grade costumes and production design should have been a matter of course before the so-called director produced that smelly bunch of cinematic offal. Let's hope the "promise" of a sequel does not come true - that was by far the scariest thing to have been shown throughout the movie !!
