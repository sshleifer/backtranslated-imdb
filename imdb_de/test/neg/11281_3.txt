This very informal retelling of Carmen starts off with a smoldering, sexually righteous dance between Senagle captive "Karmen" and her female prison guard, but the vivid opening minutes never ignite into a coherent film. In a minute Karmen becomes a sexual predator, in the next she dances in protest of her unfair government, and suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film earns Kudos because he postulates the first carnivorous bisexual "Karmen" The broad strokes he paints are so vignette-like and are supported by no narrative coherence that the film appears as a schizophrenic, undisciplined blend of "Basic Instinct" and "Bound" with an African version of a Bollywood musical.
