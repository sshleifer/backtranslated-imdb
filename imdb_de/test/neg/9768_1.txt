This movie is absolutely terrible! I thought because it had good actors like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long and continues with a documentary style that shows Gabrielle Union, who died in the film, how she talks about her family. Which, incidentally, is a confusing family because you never know who is who and who is related to whom. I would not recommend this movie to anybody, and I wish I could take him back to where I got him. I fell asleep from time to time because of boredom. Do not waste time and money on this movie. It could have been more lifelike with more drama and less boredom.
