Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to see! While none of the other reviews mentioned this, the public domain version I looked at was seriously flawed. The soundtrack was off for about 10 seconds - meaning that dialogue and action never matched. So you would hear something long before you saw it - a very confusing proposition! The worst thing is when you shoot a gun and only later the guy is hit in a taxi and killed. - and also showed the serious shortcomings. The dialogue was just awful - often with almost no flexion or emotion. As it was said in a review, it was like playing a high school. Part of it is understandable, since the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue of this film was bad even compared to other 1929 films - really bad. And like many of these early sound films, the movie was just too talkative - with juicy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. And with a title like "The Racketeer" you think there would be action !! However, it is really a juicy romance - with very little action. <br /> <br /> The film finds Carol Lombard being sat by an alcoholic musician. She steals herself to take care of him - and rogue Robert Armstrong comes to her aid. When Armstrong catches her cheating on cards, he covers them and then helps the drunken brother to get to his feet - and of course he falls in love with her. The problem is that once the drunken sobs get up, he too wants Lombard and she has to choose between them. Wow ... a restful drunk or a gangster ... talk about some great views! All in all, it's a bit difficult to judge, considering the lousy pressure I've seen. Even if you ignore this, however, the film has many problems, because it uses the dialogue little and is overly talkative. And ... it was juicy to boot.
