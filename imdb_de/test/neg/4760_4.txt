Susan Slept Here turned out to be Dick Powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen. Of course, he still made a few films and appeared on television until his death often. It is a pity he did not perform with "The Bad and the Beautiful". Frank Tashlin has done so many better movies, I'm still not sure whatever he has for this movie. The premise is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a scriptwriter who is looking for more serious things than the fluff he has written. He had an idea for a movie about juvenile delinquency. Two friendly policemen in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds on his doorstep. She is not a really bad kid and she does not want to put her in the system. So give them to Dick Powell for Christmas. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone out there who sees no problem? The term Jailbait immediately comes to my mind. In addition, Powell has a girlfriend, the young and sexy Anne Francis. I do not care why Debbie Reynolds is not a competitor here. <br /> <br /> Susan Slept Here received an Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand sung by Don Cornell in the background was nominated for the best song, but lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some fun moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell's factotum and Les Tremayne as his lawyer laugh too. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough.
