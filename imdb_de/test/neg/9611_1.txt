What happened to shows with unified parents? The parents in this show are almost as irresponsible as the kids. Instead of punishing the youngest child for manipulation, they let it go with murder. They can never agree on a course of action when dealing with children, and instead they do nothing. Yes, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they are "sweet". This show tells the already manipulative Preteens who observe that the "sharing and conquering" technique is the best way to get their parents to "cave". The oldest children run amok constantly and get into all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yes, great TV.
