This is really one of the most terrible films of all time. It's boring, cumbersome, poorly played, and the teeth crabby overbearing. <br /> <br /> I waited for about an hour until some kind of drama unfolded before I realized there was none. Especially painful was the shot on a shoe string. This is the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from space. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can hardly be saved is the ridiculous "demons" wandering through the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I liked the moggies that were used as extras, I think they are least cheap. Although it seemed obvious that they had been lured into the camera by the cautious placement of some tunas, this movie is so horrible that it should have a public health warning. When I took it back, there was a queue in my local video store. People demanded their money back. That's no joke!
