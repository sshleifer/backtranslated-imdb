Obviously influenced by the success of Pal's "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", this model does not make the cut. Limited special effects, a thin plot lead to a production that even the semi-decent cast can not save. No credibility here. Nobody seems to be surprised to meet Martians, much like Earthlings etc. etc. Share!
