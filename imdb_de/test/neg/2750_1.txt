This movie is anything but the true story of Phoolan Devi. Director Shekhar Kapoor's allegations are counteracted by the fact that he made the entire film without even meeting Phoolan Devi, on whose life this film was based! The excuse that this meeting of the woman would have disturbed the idea of ​​the director's story! The film wastes the opportunity to sensitize society to the plight of low-caste women in Indian society and ends up as a stereotype portraying Phoolan Devi as an angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder this film by Shekhar Kapoor in the West was successful because it was tuned to the taste of non-Bollywood!
