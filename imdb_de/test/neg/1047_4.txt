I have seen this episode with great hopes after seeing her on the list of "favorite episodes" of many people. I do not boast in any way, but from the beginning I realized that they were in a kind of toy box, with their big eyes on them, on the nature of the characters. Although throughout the episode the questions "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What's outside?" If you're wearing the suspense of the episode (which I already found out), I have to say that different types of characters and the interaction between them made the episode interesting enough. Although the twist of the story might be harder to guess if ALL of them were (toy) soldiers.
