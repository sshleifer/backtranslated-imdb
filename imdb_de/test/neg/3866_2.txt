BLONDE VENUS, the fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, is a film that looks good but does not impress the viewer. The harsh plot in which Dietrich is torn between two men, becomes a huge cabaret star and struggles to get custody of her child, gets mixed up and often feels like a bit of three separate films stuck together. Dietrich is put into a rather passive, reactive role for much of the film, and her character stays away from viewers, while Herbert Marshal is not convinced as her ill-tempered husband and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a polite fanatic rushing in and out from the picture. The film contains some intriguing set pieces (the "Hot Voodoo" number is the climax), which are impressively surrealistic for this era in Hollywood, even though they are unsuccessful in such a boring, incoherent movie.
