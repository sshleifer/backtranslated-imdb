I do not understand why so many comments seem here that this is acceptable conversation. The overwhelming horror of this cinematic monstrosity can not be overstated. My girlfriend and I saw it together and I'm not sure if we'll ever have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the scrawny, unattractive cast, their highly unphotogenic genitals, the rancid attempts at humor, the screeching sounds that claimed to be songs ... No, I know what was worst of all , The girls in the green jerseys licked Alice with a green face to dry them off, suggesting in broken childish speech that they suck milk from her breasts. That was the worst. <br /> <br /> And what about the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vagina? Why are all male actors gay? Why is Humpty Dumpty shaking a dildo in the air and pretending it's his penis? Why did my eyes have to see that? There are no words for this.
