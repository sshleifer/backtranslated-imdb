I accidentally came across this movie while watching for something I could see during lunch. I actually contacted the WE Network because it said it was the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of "sticking" to a gymnastics team - I found cheesy kindness. Well, I'm cheesy okay. <br /> <br /> First I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, most of it was recapitulated pretty quickly, especially in the bedroom scene, where Crystal admits she felt responsible for the death of her rapist. I love Jenny Garth and will see her in almost everything. She's just so pretty and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as it always does. She looks great in this movie and does not really age for more than a decade. Overall, I felt bad for the actors when I saw this movie. Everyone was trying to sell their parts, but all were written so poorly that it was a constant struggle. Honestly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's father of Dharma & Greg). <br /> <br /> But writing was not the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end of her death, her mother dies, and when they show the grave stone, the date of death is 1979. After I had missed the beginning, I had the impression from the wardrobe that this took place in the 80s. No leisure suit or bubble cap in sight. Shame on the person who made the wardrobe for this movie! Do not get me wrong - all the outfits in this movie were beautiful, but for the time they were totally wrong. I almost wonder when they told the cloakroom attendant that it was a historical piece. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - good for a laugh or to feed a Jennie Garth fix. :)
