If you liked William Hickey in "Prizzi's Honor", he awakens his character as Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". This is a very weak "godfather" satire with few laughs. Stuart Whitman is amazed at what he does on this hitfest. Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the film, and that alone is not a sure sign. Eddie Deezen wavers between "Three Stooges" slapstick and a bad Woody Allen imitation. "Mob Boss" is deadly flawed and so prevalent that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and tugs the film with chases, hidden weapons in a bathroom of the restaurant and numerous other nonsense. - MERK
