The film has disappointed me for several reasons: First, the presentation of a future that seemed realistic to me at first, was well built, but had only a marginal role. Then the story itself was a faint copy of Lost in Translation. In the Middle East, husband and family meet new girls overseas, karaoke bar, camera movements and pictures - all this was a very poor imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation, which was also credible. This film tries to be something brilliant and cultural: not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even considered this movie !? The leading actress is terrible - did she play the Precog in the Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in Translation did not have to show excessive love scenes. R-rated just for that? This movie is not worth watching from a video gate.
