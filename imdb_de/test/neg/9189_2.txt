First of all, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in a kind of paraf control (the guys who are called when an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR) But I have no real life experience. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are a few things that you find absolutely unbelievable. I can understand that they have removed the mouth / nose parts of the masks and that there is not enough smoke because the public would not see anything else. But some things resist logic: <br /> <br /> - No second mask attached to oxygen. How the hell do you want to save people without smoke through the smoke? <br /> <br /> - Rappel people. No, it is not done that way. I would also scream if someone wrapped me in a rope and hung me up from a building. If I could scream, and not out of lack of air, because the rope pushes my lungs. The second time they rappel, it's better, but funny. <br /> <br /> - "Aim high". No, you do not fucking damn it. You always fight fire from as low as possible. They do not fight flames, they want to extinguish the fire, and that's under the flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They walk around like chicken. And they are screaming all the time, instead of using radio and discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactic. Why do not you work in at least two teams? You can still be separated, but it takes a lot more than just whirling around in search of victims. <br /> <br /> - Are you really entering buildings without bringing water? In Europe, firefighters would never enter without a burning building. <br /> <br /> - Firefighters on the roof. WTF do you think they are there without safety lines or water? - Exploding rooms. Wood and bricks do not explode "suddenly". <br /> <br /> The better points are actually fellowship and the other non-firefighting parts of the movie. It's a lot of kitsch, but that's fine. I will give a point for that.
