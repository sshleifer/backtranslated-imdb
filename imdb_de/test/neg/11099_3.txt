The film is apparently based on a popular French horror novel by Arthur Bernède from 1927. Not that I had heard of it before, but Belphégor was previously a popular subject for movies and mini-series. The first film was published in 1927 simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who simultaneously wrote and produced films and novels. The character Belphégor is one of his most famous creations. <br /> <br /> Sophie Marceau was once a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. However, she has fallen back to movies like this one. There is nothing wrong with playing in French quality films, because it is the country from which it comes, but this film is just ridicule. <br /> <br /> The problem most of the time is that the movie needs its special effects to make the movie good and scary. Well, horror and special effects have never really been a good combination, with some exceptions here and there. It's not that the special effects are bad in this case. It's just great, especially for a European movie, but it's just out of place, because the film has made it feel like it could easily have worked without its impact. It would have made the movie a better and scary one, which was certainly the case. <br /> <br /> The film is not always tense or captivating, also because the film has difficulty choosing the right approach. Sometimes the film chooses a lighter and less serious approach, while in other cases it clearly tries to be a good horror movie. This is usually the reason why the movie does not work on any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. At the end it will definitely get worse. After a while, you just stop worrying about this movie and its story, and you wish you had looked at something else instead. <br /> <br /> The editing seems totally over. It uses too fast cuts without much style, while the quick cut was obviously meant to give the film a good, modern style. Also, the timeline is sometimes confused, as if some sequences were edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The music score is also really annoying and sometimes does not sound right fitting film, as if everything had been achieved long before the end of the movie. I can not believe that the composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar-nominated composer. The music score is almost as annoying as the movie its sound effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with many characters that you are no less interested in. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever be interested in a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The film also includes Julie Christie, which is nice but does not add much to the movie. <br /> <br /> A terrible clock. <br /> <br /> 3/10
