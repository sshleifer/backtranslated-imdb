I got this thing from the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first series as a child. I had rented the second and it was a decent "B" sci-fi. This one was really uncomfortable. The "special" effects on the cars looked like my 4-year-old cousin could have done something. The two assistant cyborgs were so horrible that I literally writhed every time they came to the screen. The conspiracy left something to be desired that made me sick. I do not know what anyone thought when he agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure it would have been better to leave him with two films. The films of this series are going from good over neat to terrible. I just hope that no terrorist groups have access to this film because it is an excellent torture device.
