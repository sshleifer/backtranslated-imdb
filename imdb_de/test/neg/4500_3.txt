Gamera vs Viras was made sluggish and suffers from it. Space aliens try to conquer the earth and are stopped by Gamera. So they send another ship that kidnaps two boys. The aliens then take control of Gamera and cause him to attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First I have to say that I really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big octopus with a beak. He has no energy-Weopons and does not emit any rays, but he can close the hanging blades on his head to create a sharp, sharp Weopon. So overall this is not a bad monster for Gamera and is decent. Viras really hurt Gamera by sticking his pointy head into the underside of his shell, and I'm surprised that Gamera survived. Unfortunately, Gamera vs Viras decided to use footage from earlier Gamera films to fill the time for this film. They show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos as the aliens watch gangs pass battles. However, when they show gaats battles with gaos, they first show the fight between Gamera and gaos in the city, then they show the final fight between the two. After showing reused shots of the last fight between Gamera and Gaos, they show the FIRST fight between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing the battles in non-chronological order. They did not even need to show the first battle they had just had to stop after showing the final battle between the two. Another problem is that they decide to re-shoot Gamera, attacking the alien cities, ordering him to attack Tokyo. So they show the scene from "Gamera vs Barugon", where he destroyed the dam. After the show scenes of "Gamera The Invincible" this is a big topic for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in BLACK AND WHITE !!!! Using footage from a black and white film in a COLOR movie is really lazy and that's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Also the synchronization is bad again. The two little kids are not that annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that did not involve any kids. <br /> <br /> Excessive use of footage from other Gamera films is therefore a deterrent to this film. The last fight is great, so I basically recommend skipping the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has been seen before.
