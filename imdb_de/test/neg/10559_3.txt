"Shade" is trying hard to be another "sting" who replaces poker with horse racing to defeat an opponent, but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> I looked at the whole thing but I still could not understand why the boy wanted to cross his partner twice. Was it because his partner stole his girl? Is there a woman in the world worthy of so much trouble? If so, it certainly was not like that. She had no salvation qualities at all, and had she really set up a special room where a surgeon could remove the kidney from the one who was going to pick it up in a bar? Dina Merrill makes a brief appearance as a wealthy woman who runs poker parties in her palatial home. And then players say things like, "I'll see your thousand and raise another five thousand." Give me a break. You can not call ("see") and increase, you do one or the other. Every child playing nickel and dimes at the kitchen table knows that; You'd think adult men playing for high stakes - or at least the Knuckleheads who wrote the script - would know it too. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned that there is no high-limit poker game I allow players to spend their own cards. They do not put two of the best-known car cheats in a game where the buy-in is $ 250,000, and then let them deal with each other. This is not poker. that's just to see what you can cheat better. And I would like to know which person would buy in a game that features two of the most popular card cheats, and expects that he may have a chance to win? And most importantly, which mafia boss would play such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith appeared on the screen, I was so fascinated by those gigantic, fluorescent red lips that I had completely lost the plot, and seeing her and Stallone together was more like a public announcement for a plastic malfunction Surgery as a love affair. Stallone mentions that she used to be a breeder before she bought the restaurant she runs now, but we do not know what kind of sorcery she was, and we never see her with Stallone in her younger days, so we get together ask if we are even so interested. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the movie, but he's killed right away and we have cardboard cutouts that all sound like her. 'They read their lines from a teleprompter in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The end does not make sense either. The boy gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? The mafia does not watch every move he makes? All others just shrug their shoulders and accept the loss of millions of dollars without trying to get any of it back. I do not believe that. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this film does great injustice to professional poker players around the world by suggesting that the only way to win is to grab cards and play with "juiced" decks And why do they always attack kings and aces? Sometimes you need a three or nine to fill a straight or full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the entire movie are the tricks of the tricksters at the beginning and end at the end of the credits, everything in between is ridiculous.
