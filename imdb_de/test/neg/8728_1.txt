In many parts, I agree with the rather thorough review that has already been published on miniseries, and I agree that it has its merits, not just its disadvantages. For example, the original film manages to cut through much of the middle and final section of the novel in a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani, who are a travesty when reading the novel, probably born from the studio that shenanigens cuts from which the other reviewer writes. This was one of the original film's big failings, and the miniseries, after being recognized, contain many of the original storylines that were cut from the Lynch movie because of the expansive nature of the Herbert novel. <br /> However, this is in itself a double-edged one Sword. Instead of completing a text-celluloid transmission of the novel, the makers of the miniseries were tempted to create their own storylines that were not included in the original novel. While this is certainly a "more complete" account of the history of Dune, it is also a break with the original heart and soul and the main vision - the prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writings, and show what the many different characters think, without having to suddenly change perspective, or need to expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues? Path. So much of the original torment of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the decision to fulfill or deviate from the prophecy, is surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one that intrigues people far away from Science fiction fans are missing). <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of Dune without prophecy? It's just an educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad that this is all that is provided to us. Lynch's film was flawed, yes. A flawed film, however, could lead to a correction by another filmmaker, picking up on some of the best spots in lynch filmmaking and rejecting some of the more superfluous aspects of the style while restoring the storyline. Now this story will probably never be translated into a movie again, and I find that exciting.
