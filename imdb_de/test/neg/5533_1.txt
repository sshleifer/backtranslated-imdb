Wakayama Tomisaburo's portrayal of the fugitive ex-kaishakunin Ogami Itto felt completely natural. His appearance, his voice, his appearance - everything spoke for a shift. When he entered a field, I, like figures on the screen, could feel that he did not belong there and that his determination to be there caused trouble. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama actually took Kendo (Japanese Swordfighting) training and that would explain his well-being with the Katana, which was splendid in every Cutfest. When you watch the movies, from the moment he moves until he sheathes the sword, you feel like you're witnessing an inevitable ugly thing. He would even turn the katana fast to separate the blood before wrapping it, and this would happen in an effortless moment. <br /> <br /> Nakamura Kinnosukes presentation appears as a rendition. It feels like he's trying too hard to be someone else or to tell someone's story. As a result, every time I tried to get involved, I lost the grip because he did not seem to have a firm grip on the role itself. As if it would be uncomfortable for him. <br /> <br /> The swordsmanship of the television series was also quite old-fashioned Hollyweird. Camera clipping to mask Mr. Nakamura's awkwardness with the katana, slow actions, stagnant targets, etc. Extremely bad, from the perspective of the viewer. There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack when Mr. Nakamura drew his sword like a child. It was embarrasing. He treated it like it was hard! I almost fell off the chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be honest: The story is about an excellent swordsman. Period. Sword art is an issue. <br /> <br /> However, realism is not the case: the swordplay in the movies was excellent and mangaish, as it was intended, I'm sure. (The baby carriage was equipped with a group of automatic rapid-fire muskets operated by a 3-year-old girl ... yes ... in manga style.) In this way, the historical cultural accuracy is seamlessly integrated into the superhero fantasy films fascinating , (Read Yoshikawa Eijis Musashi [% historical legend]%!) I really could not sit through the series of the TV series. They just felt cheap. First, watch the movies and you know what I'm talking about.
