This film is about a group of people infected by a strong human-made virus. They are persecuted by government men in the desert. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is quite interesting, but hampered by the fact that delivery is extremely boring. At no point does the film at any level engage with the viewer. Granted, the tiny budget is a problem, but not the reason for the film's failure. Much more to blame is the very packaged delivery. There is a lot of narration, but unfortunately the narrator has an annoyingly overdramatic voice. With these people, very little seems to happen, and long before you look for the government men, you will kill the protagonist the earlier the movie ends. A much better title for this film would have been that four people in the desert walk around with some stock footage of a helicopter. All in all, very boring.
