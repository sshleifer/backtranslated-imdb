In British horror films from the 70s, I've noticed that they do not resist the repeated consideration. THEATER OF BLOOD is an example like all these Amicus anthology films. Add THE BEAST IN CELLAR to the list <br /> <br /> Much of the drama in this film is about building an action that reveals an action in the end. Once you know what the revelation is, this becomes a rather shallow movie. It opens with a pretty good hook, but after that we have long boring sequences of two old ladies talking. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people watch a horror movie and expect some old ladies to talk. The only interest you can find at THE BEAST IN CELLAR is the anti-smoking attitude. Some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military movie, but watch out for it, and you'll see that every time a squad lights up, it suffers a flypuff that gets killed. Strange, considering the attitude towards smoking, they were not nearly as hysterical as they are today
