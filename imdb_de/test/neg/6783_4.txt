I saw this movie with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival, and nobody had a good word for it. <br /> <br /> I love bluegrass and country music, so it's not as if I'm disapproving of the subject. But the problem is that it's basically a very conservative movie - little more than a filmed Mills and Boon story. A bodymaker of the simplest and most sloppy kind. <br /> <br /> It's not just the love story in the heart, but also that between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than a little bit unbelievable. (Why a man from the nostril, the flaring man who devours Lily, feels attracted to me is a mystery to me, and frankly, Mike Harding as Reece just seems to go through the motions.) <br /> <br /> Film is too tame and good-natured for itself. There is hardly any danger, dirt or drama. Sure, there's a moment of "excitement" with a school run by Lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is funnier than dramatic (she's just so poorly written and played). And the film reveals its conservative agenda in the way this subplot is dissolved. <br /> <br /> As for the good old Reece Kinkaid (what's wrong with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?) I ask you! Is the end of this movie believable? Fitting the figure that this movie had previously designed? I do not think so...
