Saw the movie at its premiere in Lawrence, Kansas. This wavering story about a group of angry high schoolers who killed the competition for the Queen of the Ball was terrible. This fails for many reasons - bad action, bad script, no clear point. But mostly, it just felt like the filmmakers were saying, "Hey, I have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really rethinking it. Most indie films that fail to do so suffer from this mentality. They just do not seem to realize that it costs more than money to make a good movie ... or even a monitorable one in this case. I'm not ashamed to say that if I did not know some of the crew, I would have gone out. As simple as that.
