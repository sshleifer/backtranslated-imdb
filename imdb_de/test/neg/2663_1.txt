A friend gave me this movie because he liked it. I decided to finally see it. It was sooooooo long. I've always waited for the tension, but it never happened. I've always been waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes, and it never did. I stopped the movie and came back later. I have actually forced myself to see the rest and hope it will get better. It got worse. I've always wondered, who are these people? Do you have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I did not pay to see or rent it to rent it. The end would have been better if Dutch had died from the gunshot wound. At least we would have a certain emotion from the audience. Or maybe not.
