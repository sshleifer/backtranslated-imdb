Three young college women, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic), take an adventure canoe through the Kolpa in this Slovenian film by Maya Weiss (2002), who separates Slovenia from neighboring Croatia , What could have been an Eastern European version of the well-known and exciting 1972 "Liberation" of 1972 proved to me to be utterly uninspired, with flat character depictions that rejected sympathetic identification with the characters. Alja and Zana do not convince as students at all, although Alja expresses the desire to be a writer, and both use what seems to me to be an overly bad language. Alja is bored with her boyfriend and just seems to be drifting in life. Zana, even less learned, is a selfish adventurer who attracts other women. I had some sympathy for the relatively innocent Simona, conservative and starry-eyed. The idea that these three travel together does not work for me. The contempt that Zana and Alja show towards Simona makes no sense - why choose them as escorts to be sure they need to know for sure how they behave and how they behave? <br /> <br /> The three begin a carefree journey of the river on two canoes, untouched by news of the disappearance of a woman by the river. Somewhat gloomier is the mysterious, sometimes real and sometimes hallucinatory look of a rabid conservative fisherman politician (Jonas Znidarsic). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the scenes on the river and the small villages that visit the trio. There may be a lack of cultural understanding, but the movie did not move me otherwise. I was surprised to see that the film has won some awards.
