Well ..... horror is not that, but ....... !!! ??? A horrible low-budget backwood-flick of the worst kind, AND ... so pretty charming and funny to watch ... at least on my TV !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... tell me ... damn, I give up ... I can not imagine any "nicer" resemblance to this trashy movie. Everything is soooo wrong that I only have it together with .... Death in Venice ..... Necromancy ..... Blue Velvet and The Good, Bad, Ugly ... must enter correctly in my film collection. ?? People with a little talent for adding bloody shots or sexy happenings to film that they are bought by other people should pick up this movie right away.
