The show is at least partially fake (so it's not reality, it just pretends to be reality), which makes me believe that at least anyone who does not blur a face is a fake episode. <br /> <br /> Evidence in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There's already a camera crew on the boat before he gets there, you can see his boat approaching Definitely wrapped, so that they work on what would never happen in reality. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not drive to the emergency exit (which makes no sense unless it's a fake and they would not be allowed to go there)
