a dull moral story about a high school kid who's pretty much the now stereotyped nerd. He is smart, but has no friends, no social skills, and a lazy loser of a father borrowing from HIM. A pretty girl hits him (he should have known that she wanted something - he should be smart, right?). She manipulates the poor desperate fool to write her homework on Shakespeare, whom the teacher knows instantly she could not write. He loses the girl's trust (not that he ever really had it) and his college scholarship, all in one fell swoop. Marv is so stupid and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin traders, who lead the stuff through the warehouse where he works. Then maybe the trashy little slut will be impressed and want to marry him. Sad, really sad. Marv is such a miserable fool (and pretty mindless for a supposedly smart guy, I mean robbing drug dealers, did that boy loosen a screw?) That you stop regretting him and getting the terrible urge to kick him instead in the butt. <br /> <br /> Of course, the girl tells her friend about the robbery that Marv has boasted about, and persuades him and his cronies to steal the money from Marv and his company. They try and manage to shoot several people. The police arrive at the same time, and the idiot Marv is dragged away, a total shame forever. I know that this thing was aimed at getting teens to face the consequences of bad behavior, but all they really showed was the result of stupid behavior. Of course this is the premature end of your film career. Goodbye, Marv, we never really knew you. And thank God for that.
