I have not seen any other Antonioni films, and the people who have seen him with me agree that he shares themes and images with the rest of the work. If I had seen any other stuff from him, I would have enjoyed it and knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> I thought it was an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First, the film presents interesting, profound questions about social relationships, feelings, the reality between reality and fiction. However, this often happens in a clumsy way that makes the characters speak as if they were talking, spreading, declarations instead of dialogues. The scriptwriters seem so concerned that we do not get the point they'd rather tell than show. <br /> <br /> Second, the film has no rhythm, especially in the first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of tempo and rhythm (Victor Victor's El Sur or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but to do that it is necessary that we find the characters so captivating History so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems endless and the relationship between John Malkovich's "reality" and the love stories "fiction" is sometimes fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.
