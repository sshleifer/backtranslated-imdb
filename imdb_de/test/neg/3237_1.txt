It's hard to believe everyone could take such a great book and make such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine that King Kong would be recast as a monkey of an organ grinder and Fay Wray's role is played by a little boy. How about Elton John as Rambo !!!! This movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the Hunter. <br /> <br /> With the title Watchers and Dean Koontz, the creators of this film should name the titles. Scammers are being sued by readers of the book who expected a fairly accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I have never spoken to someone who does not like it. Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi.
