This entry does not contain a spoiler. That does not have to be. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the first Alien films was the tension that could happen. This was the case in the first two Predator films, though less common. Requiem has completely removed the element of tension and replaced it with blood and blood. You know people are going to die (well, it's an AvsP movie) but you know who's going to die and when they're going to die and where they're going to die before it happens. The directors should take a lesson from Hitchcock who said, "Suspense is not a time-bomb going under a table, Suspense is a bomb that DOES NOT run under the table." What's the point of going to a movie if you know exactly what happens when? If you really want to see this movie, wait until it appears on video and then RENT IT, but I would not buy it in any case.
