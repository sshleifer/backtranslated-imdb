PERHAPS SPOILER !! Well, I've seen it at the Cologne Film Festival and have to say it's ridiculous ... Sorry, author and writer and ... whatever, but it's the worst attempt to make a good movie I ever did you have 5000 times the opportunity to free yourself from your enemy, and you do not ... it gets boring ... There are scenes in the film that give the impression that they are forgotten, for example, a scene before a security camera, they ask for help and someone sees it and calls the police ... then there is a cut and .... NOTHING ?? !!! ... the killer gets a shot in the head and 50 seconds later he behaves as if nothing happened ... no, it's not a zombie movie ... and finally the conclusion ... the BIG END, the we were promised .... hmmmm, let's take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best parts of the story so that everything goes awry. I will not vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ...;)
