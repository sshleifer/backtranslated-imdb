This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene where we saw Mel Torme as a big, bad Jaguar muffin gang leader (and that's himself a giggle-fest), to the final image of Mamie Van Doren, who is now a rehabilitated angelic teenager When you walk out of jail (um ... loving girl, led by iron fistfurs), you can not stop shaking your head. The cast of this film is a cheesy list from Mel and Mamie to the talentless Paul Anka (all I wanted in this movie was just SINGING STOP!) And Dick Contino, the king of forty-something teenagers. Playing Gloria Talbot, a humorless teenage girl with more than a few thugs (judo, not acting), I finally saw in the terrible misogynist of the fifties the Leech Woman, whose hairstyle looked so bad that it looked like a dead woodchuck, that had been squeezed by a Mac truck. <br /> <br /> Mamie is a bad, bad girl - she smokes, swears, runs wild, beats teachers and runs around with group leaders. She lets her idiot Jaguar fall as a friend of Chip (whom we see in the first scene as he tries to rape a blonde girl before he falls off a cliff-friendly guy) and instead deals with Dick Contino. Whether this is a step up for them can not be said. Mel turns up at a party where she's traveling with her new boyfriend, accusing her of knocking the nasty chip off the cliff. I'm sure she would have liked to, but she was not there. This is followed by a stupid battle scene between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz freaks with some exciting moves on both sides. <br /> <br /> Mamie is finally sent to Girls Town, a reform school, ..errr. ..living home for lost girls ... run by Sister Iron Pants and her sisters for correction. She annoys the nuns (and us) by chatting, dismissing annoying one-liners and generally showing how bad she is. She quickly encounters Gloria Talbot and plays one of the girls who misbehave, who gives her a racket to help her know her place. She meets a saggy noodle of a girl obsessed by Paul Anka's character (why?). This little drop becomes her "stooge". <br /> <br /> There is a long movie in which not much happens, except St. Paul of Anka keeps showing how holy he is. He sings way too much in this break until you want to beat him into his huge Snozz just to calm him down! And Mamie's little sister, played by Princess of Father Know's Best Fame, calls her to tell her she's in trouble. It turned out that it was sis who ran out with the Chipster, and now Mel blackmails her for finding out. The girls break out to rescue them, with a hysterical fight between the girls and Mel and his boys. This is after a race between Mel and Dick, which is just so stupid that it overstrains the mind. The superhuman teenagers in this insane movie have a fabulous time romping through a basically stupid, poorly written and morally preaching movie that has no purpose if its goals are - unless it wanted to make you laugh.
