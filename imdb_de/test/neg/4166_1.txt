This movie was released in all major cinemas in Australia. I saw the movie on the weekend of the 7th of August and thought that was absolute nonsense (and I use that word extremely literally). As it was published in every major cinema, no idea. The conspiracy seemed simple, as the world was divided into subclasses and people needed identity cards. The actor Tim Robbins played an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate an employee who has stolen identity theft. > <br /> You mean from this summary, the rest of the story should be intertyne, but it does not just confuse the audience with another unrelated act. <br /> <br /> If you think about it If you watch this movie, I can spare you the trouble. DO NOT GET THIS FILM.
