I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with the case after not only reading Mark Fuhrman's book but also the far superior book, "A Fortune of Evil: The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America's Richest Community," by Timothy Dumas. Anyone watching MURDER IN GREENWICH should know that he sees the story of Mark Fuhrman and not the story of Martha Moxley. This movie is nothing but an ego trip for Fuhrman. Just watch how his character strives around, as if he were the second coming (yes, even abused by women). The actors who play the kids look far too old for their roles, and the flashbacks to the '70s are totally unconvincing. If there's a hero in this story, it's Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman went in to make a name for himself. She and Martha deserve to be told the true story.
