OK. I've really tried to tap into the (so-called) stupid and surreal humor this movie is meant to be. I was told that the Japanese version of this movie is much shorter than the one sent to America (see picture!) And has less political references. Apart from all this, I found this sexual / political farce as boring and meaningless as standard pornos. The central female guidance protects the eyes and could actually work. I would love to see her in a non-pink movie where she could actually play her acting muscles (not the ones you're thinking of). It is obvious that Japan can produce as much manure as other countries. I can not recommend it to anyone with the possibility that someone has a Jones for Asian porn. Watch a real Japanese movie.
