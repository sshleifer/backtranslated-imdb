Some people say that this show was good in the early years! I do not agree with everyone. The show is just stupid and pathetic. My mother hates it, I hate it, my father hates it, I do not know about my sister, but oh well. Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. THE CHARACTERS: Babies who are used as adult characters are stupid. The babies are only precocious and annoying. The adults and adults are stupid and unappetizing. The worst character is Angelica Pickles (she really does it for her drums when you've had a long, hard and miserable day in the office) and also the late Kimi Finster; She is too optimistic and painful in the butt. She can not decide where she is French or Japanese: you are an American citizen and you know that! Oh, what am I talking about, all characters from this show are shit! <br /> <br /> 2. THE STORIES: The stories are unoriginal and stupid. They make it as if the babies are going on a great adventure, yes in the backyard. In one episode, this little silly brat, Tommy Pickles broke the leader into the control room of a TV and literally destroyed him. Do not give children any idea of ​​smashing the TV room's normal control rooms (in real life, they pay a lot of money for it). I can imagine how the broadcasters must have aired this episode, they're probably going to stare at their machines all day and are worried that a baby is slowing down. Sad! OVER RATED !: The show has been going on for years and people are still inventing stories and new series and spin-offs. Get out! The Simpsons have been traveling almost as long as these, but they are much better and funnier than babies. The show is simply overrated! Guys, where is your common sense? Anyway, I'm surprised that TV stations around the world even want to broadcast this series today. The show is absolutely minor and should never have been produced. The two films for these cartoons sucked the same! 2.10
