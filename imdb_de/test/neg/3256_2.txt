When a hard-working entrepreneur is rejected by a respected country club, he begins a fight between members and eventually buys him from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns him into a theme park / golf course, where everyone can participate. <br /> This is by no means a good movie, but it is sometimes a bit amusing. Almost all comedies are cheap slapstick and bad jokes except Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of his biggest roles as Ty Webb for the second time and does it great. Not only is he the funniest character in the movie, he's also the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd does not bring humor to this film, which wants to be a great sequel to a classic comedy, but is in ruins with other debris on Comedy Central. The movie might have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had had a bigger role, but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became Jackie Mason (Who ??) right way! This is a perfect example of what you should not do if you are making a sequel to an already great movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is humorous, but a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie.
