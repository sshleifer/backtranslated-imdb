This must be one of the worst movies by MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. A funny musical comedy that fails in almost every way. Silly Plot has tried to persuade SINATRA to continue his father's call as KISSING BANDIT. He is not a bandit and does not kiss !! He plays the "nerdy" character and could be expected due to the dialogue he has to speak. The scene stealers are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad that they did not have more scenes together. I gave the movie two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is Where You Find It" is sensational. Could have had a repir of it. Also a comic dance number from RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER is fun. It is therefore only for these and only for these reasons to observe. KISSING BANDIT is part of the Frank Sinatra Early Years collection.
