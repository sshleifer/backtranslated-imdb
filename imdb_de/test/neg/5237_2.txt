Christophe Lambert once said he still makes films just to make good and easy money. When I see his latest releases, I believe that. Beowulf is, after all, in the "good" part of the crap films: There are really some exciting scenes. The actors themselves are not that bad. But the plot is stupid, the "Mortal Kombat" -like music has nothing to do here, the end is really crazy ... <br /> <br /> Really, the only good thing is that I and my friends laugh about it could be how uninteresting it was. I even wish I was wasting my money on something else. <br /> <br />
