Why a filmmaker with a track record like Wes Craven wants to give his name to a boring collection of such clichés, one can only guess. And if he did not raise any money - all £ 50, judging by the looks - he would have slammed a refund on the director's door the minute the movie was released. There are many "alien" rip-offs and that's one of the worst. Even the faithful Lance Henriksen, who is so stupid with a character that his children can wander around a dangerous government lab, can not save it. As a cure for insomnia this is considered 10+. Make a film as a quality piece - forget it.
