Well, I remember when the studio dismissed Schrader and hired Harlin to re-film the movie, they were right. Dominion: Prequel for the exorcist is just a bad movie, it's boring, it's really. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to think that the studio has put aside a psychological masterpiece and that those who used such grand words to condemn Harlin's version and vowed to Schraders, even if nobody had ever seen it, were right had. <br /> <br /> But they were not. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie is supposed to be, and he shows it a long way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, unintentionally funny in the wrong places and bad supporting role. <br /> <br /> Save money and nerves, do not see it.
