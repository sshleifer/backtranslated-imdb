I'm so glad I only got this movie for $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt. I have had my eye on this product for a while and eventually sold it. I immediately grabbed it and took it home just to hang my head up disappointed. This movie is shit. I've heard people talk about how bloody and violent this movie is. It really is not that bloody or violent. I've seen it three times and think I've wasted enough of my life on it. The demons have the point that they are unique and sometimes cool. The sex gets a point because it is almost without interruption. The horny old man gets half a point that he is horny and still has the sex drive. And the main character (whose name I deleted from my head) gets half a point for the cool design of his weapon. I've seen important connections between this movie and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style animation, which is obviously due to the director, both have lame soundtracks that suck like the Antichrist, and both have terrible ends. Avoid this movie if you do not like sex with anime.
