New Year. The day after a few too many vodka martinis and cosmopolitan drinks were drunk at midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable company is offering the special digital channels for January for free. We had the choice - are we using the freebie channels or are we watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD we received from our daughter for Christmas? <br /> <br /> We chose Digital Freebie Because the DVDs go nowhere and we need about ten twelve-hour days to see all X-Files from start to finish. The Drive-In channel featured a horror classic three-in-a-half marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well overworked here and the pit and the pendulum were too late for us to see which means that we really can only be critical of House of the Damned. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we tried. Be serious about the movie because its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's overwritten Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch baby, that could act despite the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, we soon broke into a giggle under the influence of a small dog's head as we spawned the names of the films this dog borrowed from: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hellhouse, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> The acting, especially of Evigan's real daughter, was not bad given the stupid scripts they had to work with. The CGI for 1996 was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene, when it was supposed to be the most terrifying thing, it was so bad that my wife and I broke up in laughter. <br /> <br /> Overall: Acting 4/5, script 2/5, SFX 0/5
