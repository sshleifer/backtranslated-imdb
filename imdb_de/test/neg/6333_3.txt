The awkward "Home Invasion" genre is traced back to Wes Craven's early Sleazefest "Last House On The Left", with nasty off-shoots like "I Spit On Your Grave", "Wrong Way" and "The Visitors" this movie. In this Italian offer, offered at the beginning of the 80s, the same conspiracy is reawakened, with the phrase that it is a continental move. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express"? It starts surprisingly well, but after about twenty minutes, it takes a turn for the worse, since the sex scenes have priority over the more serious action and tension. David, Phil and Ernie, three wealthy teens terrorizing and humiliating each other aboard a transcontinental express in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including the prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio), who frequently travels and contracts with one of the porters, acting as a kind of pimp and encouraging male passengers to withdraw from their money spend a night full of passion in their sleeping compartment. The three Cretins are quick to annoy the passengers with their aggressive, drunken behavior, but it gets more serious when they take control of a whole car in the Express and lock themselves from the rest of the turn. Pretty soon they enjoy their temporary control. a young woman (Zora Kerova) is raped by two teenagers in a close compartment; Juliette herself is subjected to a long sexual assault; and later the vile trio forces the male passengers to roll a dice to decide which one 16-year-old maiden traveling with their parents will rape the game). The only passenger ready to fight is a convict who is being brought to Germany. But what hope does a man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto has a decent start. Various fascinating characters are introduced, and the three crooks have a really unsettling influence on the travelers. Although history is clearly the stuff of exploitation, the opening scenes are carefully constructed, and the film seems to rise above the usual gutter level of its genre. In a terrible scene, in which Kerova is being jammed into a toilet by two of the thugs in a toilet room, things are falling apart. The scene is filmed cheerfully, and the effect does not seem to be in creating sympathy for the victim or hatred against the perpetrators. Instead, we are asked to feel energized. That's sensationalism in its worst form. More humiliating rapes follow, but the rape sequences involve too much camera work on oral sex and female genitalia. A sequence with the 16-year-old girl wobbles on the edge of the hard core and feels particularly "wrong". At the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto, it's easy to forget that it was meant to be a thriller, because the last hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense. Lovers of Sleaze will revel in it; others might want to look elsewhere.
