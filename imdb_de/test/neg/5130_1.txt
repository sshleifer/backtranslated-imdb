I have registered with IMDb.com to comment on this movie. My God, what a steaming heap of horse shit that was! It should not even be touted as a real movie, it is very deceptive. this is a film project of the 15 year best case. The spectacle is terrible. But even good actors could not save that. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the hell wrote that crap? And this constant joke from the chubby lesbian that Kaye is a "girl in need" quickly got old. God, I'd rather have a camel with a wet hole in my ear than to see that crap again. Do not borrow this movie. If you received the movie for free, do not look at it. smash it with a hammer. Even if you lost your Hollywood video or blockbuster video account by smashing this video, it would be worth it. That's an abomination. I suppose I said everything I can without being superfluous. any questions .... email me.
