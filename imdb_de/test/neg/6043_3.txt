OK, we have 4 electricians in town who find a mini-nuke reactor, turn it on and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen, also from a parallel universe that has made it to some of her relatives to conquer the earth, but unfortunately she is the only one left? If so, why did not the rest of humanity come together and chase them down? Even what happened to the military could not have consumed more than a billion rounds of ammunition and why hide in a cellar when there were many more defenses available. Nor were they looking for city workers, but how did they know what a mini-nuclear reactor looked like and how, if they did not have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the gap? I'm sorry, but there was nothing sympathetic about the movie
