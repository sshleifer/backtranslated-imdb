A commentator said if you like Austin Powers, you'll like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The movie works hard, maybe too hard for laughter. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie screamed as if the screaming was funny in itself. I understand where they wanted to go with this movie. A cross between Zorro and Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just does not work. Austin Powers, albeit stupid but intelligent, lacks the talent of Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin for Zorro the Gay Blade. <br /> <br /> I was always waiting for a laugh and during the wait I was amazed that someone was paying the script. Also my 15 year old daughter thought the movie was flat. My 17-year-old, who picked this strip for the title, left after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people on IMDb liked this movie, but I did not have the good timing or good jokes of a good comedy.
