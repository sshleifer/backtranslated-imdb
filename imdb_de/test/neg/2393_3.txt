Comic romance of the comedy with a great cast and a less than outstanding screenplay. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character "Betty," a woman caught in a loveless marriage to a man who apparently has an affair with his beautiful blond secretary. Guess who plays this subordinate role, yup! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") has to take on this project before her superstar status is insured with the blockbuster thriller "The Ring". On the masculine side of the cast list is the miserably mean Alfred Molina ("Frida"), an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his wishes for "Betty," who have been slumbering for decades. Maybe Miramax hopes Molina will be on the line in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2". This little piece of jewelery, which is on the DVD Leihregal, could arouse interest. <br /> <br /> But the wildest and most unforgiving performance goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch Me If You Can"), who as a "modern" undertaker is completely overwhelmed with his Vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town. His character must have fallen into the village because there is no reason why he should exist in this script. <br /> <br /> That is, if you want some first-class actors to talk with humor then this is for you, and if this is not your cup of tea, hire "Harold and Maude" ultimate funeral movie that is still fun today.
