The first half of the movie is not that bad. Although the characters are not really too deep, the story is somehow funny and generally okay, with the potential to get better, which is not the case. <br /> <br /> In the second half, things start to deteriorate, not just for the characters in the movie, but also for the viewer, who is basically waiting for the story to come to an obvious end. <br /> <br /> The previous user commentary mentioned: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of errors, a movie from the 80's, and most of all a movie by Jonathan Demme." <br /> < Well, please let me put it another way: "It's a boy girl story, they happen to drive around in cars, the thrill is gone, because it's all too clear how things are going to turn out This movie, where you could laugh out loud, it has a few 80s feel and yes, Jonathan Demme was really the director.
