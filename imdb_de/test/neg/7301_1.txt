I knew that I would not see a quality movie when this title was recorded in a B-Video night with friends. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised how bad this movie was. It was fortunate that many of us were there to share the pain ... The film tries to tell the story of a dark future in which Hawk (a guy from Mad Max) sets out to save one Virgin in distress. In fact, the conspiracy is a thinly veiled apology for the producers to promote their own life philosophies. The movie often lacks direction, and its characters do not evolve in any measure. What's worse is the editing of this movie. The movie repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think this was an attempt to imitate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's fighting sequences, but when that happens, it fails completely. The movie would probably be about a third of its length if we did not have to see the main character go half a dozen times before the setting sun (yes, that happens in this repeated scene). I give this movie my "worst movie I have ever seen". I doubt that it will be crowned in the foreseeable future.
