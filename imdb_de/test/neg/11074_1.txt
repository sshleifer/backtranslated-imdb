The person who wrote the summary and the rave reviews for this movie is either an idiot or an avid fan of crappy movies. From the beginning this was just cheap ass from "The Descent", a far superior movie that definitely does NOT get started. <br /> <br /> Already in the first moments of "The Cavern" I was amazed at how bad it was, how unimaginative and unoriginal it was, how poorly written, badly traded and badly managed. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. That says a lot, considering I recently suffered from "Pulse". I can not believe that this garbage piece has actually won prizes, which shows that the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs in Australia and other countries is much better than in the US group runs out of the "creature" poorly managed, especially the backward "upside-down camera" that is supposed to show disorientation, but only turns out to be a cheap effect for which a first year film student would be adequately acclaimed by her teacher. Unfortunately, this "director" is likely to make more films, probably of the same low quality as this "movie", as he certainly has not learned his mistakes, which were exaggerated in this picture. <br /> <br /> If it were up to me, the entire cast and the entire crew would be sent up the river without parole. This movie is a crime against humanity.
