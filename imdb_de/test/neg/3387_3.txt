Last night I sit in my TV room, beer in hand, a bowl of pretzels on the tray and I decide to put the movie "Monster Man" in my reliable VCR. Expect a fun, bloody, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. What do I get instead? One of the stupidest, stupidest, most upbeat and predictable movies I've ever had when I felt uncomfortable. And even worse, all during the (& I use this next sentence loosely) "sex scene", the girl stops all his clothes! I summarize this summary sweetly: Mix "Dude Where's My Car" (a good half of the movie) with a very watered-down "hitcher", add a redneck version of the antagonist from "I Madman" to the primary villain and finally an incoherent black magic hocus-pocus, and you get an indication of how lazy this movie is. It is also absolutely predictable. The only notable feature of this horrible movie is that some moments between the two guys (even if the "hero" is a MAJOR annoying geek and the other is a Jack Black clone) are somehow funny (only moderately funny ie like most SNL skits). Otherwise "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (I'll hand this out at Halloween time - just hope if the person sees it, I will not get my house upset or worse)
