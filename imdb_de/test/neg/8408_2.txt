The first movie is a bit good for me, I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought it was really nothing special. However, compared to this mess it looks a lot better. Why they felt the need to shoot the film is a mystery to me, but they should have known that they could not agree with the acting of the first film when they could only get Ruth Gordon to repeat their role. The story follows Rosemary's baby and all that, but in reality it's kind of a mess, it does not help that the movie is a TV movie and the TV look shines through very well. It also has more of a comedy tone that hampers it very much, if they really felt the need to make a sequel, if they were to do an R-rated movie that had some nudity and gore. I'm sure it would still have been pretty bad, but at least it would be better to see and be funny, which is not what this movie is, even though it tries to be funny. I saw this on monstrous vision and Joe Bob had nothing really good to say in the intro, and I do not have much to say. I must say, it was a sequel that should never have seen the light of day.
