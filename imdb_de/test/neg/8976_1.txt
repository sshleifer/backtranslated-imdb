To be honest, with regard to the death penalty, I could take or leave her. The problem I have with this documentary is that it is a perfect love affair for the killer, without any sympathy for the family. The execution of Wanda Jean, with her completely one-sided view, only supported my view that she should be executed for her crimes. An attempt was made to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported this view. She looked uneducated, but her whole family too, but that does not mean they were all left behind. I can fully understand if anyone is against the death penalty, but ignoring the crime completely as if it had not happened, and trying to put Wanda on a moral mountaintop is insulting and that is not the side of the problem with I would be connected.
