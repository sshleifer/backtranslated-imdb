This attempt of a "thriller" would have no substance! Some may say that this movie has "everything?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, a bag full of money, throats cut, murder, blood, a snub-nosed revolver, teeth clenched, breasts (different definitions can be used), big flashlights, tribal people, a brother duo trying "Stupid and Dumber ", white wolves, battle scenes reminiscent of" happy slapping ", snowmobiles, a large tracked vehicle and a motel being refurbished? All this, with an "Enyanesque" melody towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my rating is a bit tough, but one consideration is certainly enough for the healthy Cinemaphile that has nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
