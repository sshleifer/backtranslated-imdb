A four and a half hour O'Neill game is reduced to just under two, and much of this runtime is dedicated to actors with a frozen face expression as they read their characters' thoughts in the voice-over. It can work on stage, but it looks strangely stilted out of this soap opera adaptation that softens the heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so fascinated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, who behave ridiculously, are outdone by a naturalistic Clark Gable - he's the only one who gets the Frozen Face technique working. It gets even funnier when Shearer's and Gable's son, a grumpy moppet, makes the cold effect. There is also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as an unsuccessful worshiper who calls "poor Charlie!" over and over again and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they appear, the voice-overs have largely been abandoned and it acts like a ripe soap with a sentimental fade that actually plays "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is persistent and he shows few opportunities to curb hyperactive actors. It's definitely entertaining - there's nothing like it, except counting Groucho's satirical parody of "Animal Crackers" or an old Mad Magazine satire that made Shirley Booth's sitcom "Hazel" the "Strange Interlude." But it is not good
