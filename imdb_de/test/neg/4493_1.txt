The action scenes were pretty good. But the plot of the movie, I would have to give it a grade of 1 in 10. It seems that the producers and directors of this film did not think about it carefully. It gives its viewers much value and values ​​except violence. The whole story was about revenge. A boy who witnesses a rape and a murder. I would even recommend it to be banned. Those who saw it have only lost some money. If you think about it, look at something else. I would ask for a refund if I was in a movie theater. So for you and girls out there reading this article. Please do not waste time.
