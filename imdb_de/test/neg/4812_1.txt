Why? Why? Why on earth does not anyone tell the truth about this horrible, terrible movie? I still wake up in the morning and ask God why he did not stop me from seeing this rousing "comedy." I can not believe I'm PAID to see this insult to my cinematographic tastes. I'm starting to believe that the 5 stars due to Martha Higaredas nudity and all the men who can not buy porn and do not see, that's ... I'll call it "Ding" because it's film insulting the Mexican film industry , The characters are a huge clich√©, acting makes you laugh involuntarily, and the script is ... Well, I can not believe a human wrote this. And when you thought you had enough torture ... The last half hour is so painful that I wanted to open my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this monster is that it only takes 90 minutes (that would feel like centuries, but still). Really, avoid the pain !!!
