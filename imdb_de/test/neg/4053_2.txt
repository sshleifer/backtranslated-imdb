The NSW office for film and television declined to finance the film. The producers had a big stench and brought their production to Victoria. Apart from the lost work for technicians, NSW was fortunate not to have been involved ... <br /> <br /> The film fails on almost every level. Postmodernism fails, the casting fails (what is Rose Byrne talking about, what one-dimensional growl had Hugo Weaving Channel, what is Pia Miranda doing?), And the story is a clich√© of contradictions. In fact, the story is more like a torn foreplay than a complete plotline. <br /> <br /> It might have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style had been better thought out and executed. If the casting was a bit stranger, if the style was less serious ... if everything was different. <br /> <br /> Apart from the usual excellence in costume, design and cinematography (as in most Australian films), the movie is just a total mistake. <br /> <br /> With a budget of more than $ 7 million, "The Tender Hook" is a symptom of the discomfort of the Australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are being funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (below $ 2 million) or "Cedar Boys" (below $ 1 million) and you'll get the idea. The hard, interesting films fight for funding, and the floppy, overgrown projects with name assignments receive the money. <br /> <br /> The funders who have invested in this project deserve to follow the same path as Hugo Weaving's character at the end of the film.
