What is really scary is that the filmmakers believed that they made something smart and sexy. Instead, they probably made the stupidest horror picture of the year! <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a bunch of art nob friends in a gallery. This trashy European spinner approaches the main character and speaks as if he had just come out of an episode of Dark Shadows. Then he offers her a stick to smoke (yes, a crazy stick), to which she eagerly agrees! He takes some red rubbish and puts it in a spoon to free it! If this ever happens to you in real life, do not do it! <br /> <br /> She's put into a weird wannabe world of Jean Rollin, who's supposed to be sexy, but not where it looks like a rotten creature from the Black Lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon she will transform all her artistic sleazeball friends into her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how much these idiots go out and turn blue, they can not go to hell. Eventually, she even makes out with the lazy creature! <br /> <br /> After the last battle and the stupid woman or whatever, the so-called hero is left alone to pack up his copy of Michael Moore's Dude Where's My Land and can not resist this stick again to smoke to try to save his idiot girlfriend. What an idiot. <br /> <br /> rated four stars for sheer unintentional humor.
