I saw this movie last month at the Sitges Festival. If there is a chance to "film" a movie to avoid its existence, this should be the first in the list. María Lidón is not a director, she's just a stupid woman pretending to hold a camera and calling "action" makes her a professional filmmaker. What a mistake! The movie itself is meaningless and a total waste of good actors who could do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but put his face in front of the camera. His character has no specific weight in the film. The same can be said about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It's a shame how Rade Serbedzija's character was written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of his time alone in the tunnels and talks to himself in style. Now I turn to the left, now I turn to the right ...) just to the audience to give a clear idea of ​​his actions. This is just nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director. END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of rubbish in the audience was that the title of the film itself was indicative of the rating everyone should give: zero
