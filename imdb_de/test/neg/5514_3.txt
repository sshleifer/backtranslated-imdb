Since several posters have "hinted", this is a sad "Star Wars" rip-off. If you want to tear down "Star Wars", at least do it right. "Battlestar Galactica" did, and there were a few other space operas that did not do a bad job, but this is definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall, the youthful lead, is not so bad at all, although he always goes beyond the "cute" factor. Vince Edwards has not improved significantly as an actor since his "Ben Casey" days; If anything, he is even more wood than he was ten years old. The other performances are nothing special either. Even worse are the special effects; The best you can say about them is that they are lousy. It's obvious that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a bit of foam or latex on them, and the "battle" scenes between Edwards' attackers and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot. A very weak effort by Roger Corman. Skip it.
