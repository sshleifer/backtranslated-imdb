I got this movie on DVD titled Evil Never Sleeps, Carrie Ann Moss gets a track statement, but she plays such a minor character that I did not really see her in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. The dialogue was stilted and the wooden delivery, I found the acting separated from the plot. Graham's performance for me was someone wondering if she gave gas at home. <br /> <br /> All in all, both my wife and I found this movie painful and it's not valuable to me. If you let your fingernails out for 90 minutes, this would probably be a better option To spend time.
