All the ambiguities about Michael Myers have disappeared thanks to the series' chronic habit of walking around with their continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere. In this post, the Potty Angle is introduced that he is not just a psycho killer, but is actually controlled by runes that appear as a constellation of stars for Halloween. After a while, I lost track. The credibility of the film bleeding is so great that in the end it has no more drops. Why is Michael putting the clothes of a victim in a washing machine? Why does an otherwise empty hallway have a deadly peak jutting out of the wall? Does an electric shock really make your head explode? And so on. It is up to Donald Pleasence, in his penultimate film role, to produce wonderful little moments from the pile of terrible dialogues he has given.
