I laughed twice when I saw this movie, and if you wondered, I did not have a bad day and otherwise was not subject to anything else that would have distorted my mind when watching these cinematic stools. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and just could not. With all this talent, you would think that this was at least observable, right? Not correct. <br /> <br /> Let's play suck and not suck! John Travolta - Very sympathetic. Although obviously buried under too much make-up, I found it pleasant to watch him. Not sucked. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman- After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this abominably written character. The big moment of this character showed someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn- The white-haired guy who thinks he's black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered funny? I love the guy, but I want to see him in something better. It felt like he was slumbering. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Cedric the Entertainer- This guy is good. He makes a great monologue after being labeled as a racist slur (you may guess what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and has really enhanced the material he just received with his presence. Did not suck. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel sucked for a phoned performance. <br /> <br /> James Woods sucked but was not to blame. Yes, that was it. For some reason, reminded me of his role in the casino. I do not like manic James Woods, I burn James Woods slowly. Victim of bad writing maybe? Andre 3000- sucked, but he swung down. I think he has potential as long as he is not driven by a hack on his next picture. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian: She is absolutely beautiful and obviously talented, but this movie will not make her a star. Did not suck, but needs a better vehicle for their talents, which is not controlled by a hack. <br /> <br /> The Rock- This should have been the role that catapulted him into a movie star, but F. Gary Gray is sadly mistreated. In this movie, the rock projects this charisma that makes it so sympathetic that I apologized. He is very hard-working and although he does not quite succeed, he gets an A + from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and stand completely against the guy by playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on Star. I really want him to make it big. He has what he needs, as long as he is not guided by a hack. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to what I consider the weak link in this production. I might as well come out and say it, right? The direction of F. Gary Gray was about as solid as the diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the good idea to leave this guy directly? The negotiator was good, but what else in his CV did the people convince him that he was the man for this job? Between his guidance and the cruel writing, I am ready to intervene for both guilty parties in order to bring a beautiful lead salad to its knees. Do you want to see John and Uma dance? Maybe I could imagine another movie with the two of them, which I could recommend to watch instead. Not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents, it cost me to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been fine and it was not even "just okay". <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: * from *****. <br /> <br /> PS Worth mentioning is Fergie by Black Eyed Peas.
