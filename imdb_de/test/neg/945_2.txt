This movie was terrible. Most comedic scenes look stale and banal, and perhaps the funniest scene in the movie has already been given away in the previews. The entire premise of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that it's hard to really get involved in it. The actors themselves show the most unrealistic characters. It's not just the fact that the movies are so hard to swallow, but also how they're constantly stuffing your neck and expecting you to be stupid and accept it. The plot itself is so shallow and easily predictable. The boy somehow gets rejected by every school he applied for (I think he totally forgot about visiting the community college) and decides to set up his own school for fellow combatants. Everything is going well until the validity of his school comes into question. Meanwhile, the dorky character manages to entice his beautiful neighbor with his witty sarcasm, which is apparently a skill only he possesses. then comes the final fight with the students, who are somehow connected and fighting for the survival of the school. Of course, the main character then persuades the state education authority to let their school live with an "inspirational" speech. This movie would have been more fun if I was under 16 years old and still have no idea about college affairs and issues.
