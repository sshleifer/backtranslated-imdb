I have no idea how commentators might view this as a decent B Western. Or, as one commentator said, the conspiracy is more coherent than most. Nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is a huge non-sequitur! It is an insult to the noble B-Western movies of the 30s. I've seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> The villain is known as The Shadow - because he screams out loud! Initially, The Shadows Scheme maintains open stage cars. At the same time his gang roars all cattle in the territory. Then they decide on a bank robbery. They have to shoot through the city with a machine gun - no explanation why this is necessary or how he got this cute toy! <br /> <br /> Not a single scheme is so detailed that there is a hint plot here. The shadow is obviously just a generally malicious type with all sorts of generally evil schemes. <br /> <br /> He gives his instructions through a counterfeit wall safe. (Knock-knock, who's there?) He seems to be clairvoyant, because when his henchmen have to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can only imagine that he met her in person and said, "I have some secret, shameful instructions to give you about our next evil deed - hit me at the wall vault and I'll give them to you.") Why the Shadow requires the safe to communicate with its army of outlaws is never explained, like most elements of that mess. <br /> <br /> He has a nice tunnel to the old hollow stump across the street, from where he carries out various assassinations. He also has a hidden record that is NOT in his secret shelter behind the wrong vault, but outside in the main room. When he's not behind the safe, he hangs around his cow-less ranch and disguises himself as a rancher Matlock. We learn he murdered the true owners of the ranch-two brothers-and assumed the identity of one. The dead brother's daughter recently arrived in New York from the 1930s (judging by her wardrobe), and she apparently never met her uncle because he cheated on her also wore black hats and good men's white hats, you have to do this See movie. Here, the good ones all have their hats on the white headbands that look as if they had suffered head injuries before any shots were fired! It's like a game of pick-up basketball - only Wayne lets them tie bandanas around their heads instead of just taking their shirts off. <br /> <br /> Maybe the end is the strangest of all. Immediately after subduing the Shadow and his gang, we leap far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the first-time niece) on the porch of their home. (Remember, there was not much romance.) There, Yak plays with Wayne's 3-4-year-old son dressed in Injun! (Hiyoo, Skookum fun!) No, thanks to this nonsense, Wayne became the screen legend. Only a superstar (packer or not!) Could overcome this entry in a movie resume. Long live the duke!
