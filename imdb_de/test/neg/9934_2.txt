I've been a rabid Star Trek fan since 1966. I learned from Star Trek that the special effects are subordinate to the characters. Encounter At Farpoint fails on his mission. <br /> <br /> Produced excellently. <br /> <br /> BAD led, written, traded. D.C. Fontana really really blew it away. This episode is so embarrassing that the master tape should be burned. <br /> <br /> The first half of season one was not much better.
