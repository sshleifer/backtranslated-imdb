This Howler from the 50s is so bad that he is unintentionally funny. Tom Conway portrays Dr. Gerard, a scientist who transforms Voodoo natives into a monster. His poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is held captive by her shaky husband, who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves. Marla English is a greedy murderer who has already killed a man to find a treasure in the jungle. Her idiot, portrayed by Lance Fuller, is on the safari. They provide "Touch" Connors (later in Mike Connors, who became famous for Mannix) as a guide. English is a terrible actress, but hey, nobody in the cast was shot in Academy Award winning performances. "Touch" (I'm sorry, I can not even enter the name without cracking, I mean, what the ...) gave the only reasonably decent performance of the group and that says a lot. The monster is seen only briefly, and the end is predictable to say the least. I would say that this movie falls into the category "It's so bad, almost good". It's good on a rainy night when nothing else is in the subway.
