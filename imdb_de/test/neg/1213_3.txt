I was pleasantly surprised by this. It is actually very interesting and captivating. The cast is strong, including Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields has become an actress. Black and white must really have freed her, because I've never seen her playing a conventional character. If marketed properly, this could be a medium sized hit.
