This is one of the dumbest films of all time, not the stupidest mind, but one of the dumbest. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep-inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie is the best and funniest part, but it's not worth it to go through the whole movie. On the other hand, if you're a die-hard Jim Varney / Ernest fan, you'll need to add this movie to your collection like me. There are short, rare moments of humor, though there are only a few. The mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collector's item and a must-have for your serious collection. I was fortunate enough to find this movie online a few years ago at a bargain price. I think I paid 1.99 euros for it. And it was the only copy I could find anywhere. Although this is a really all-around awful movie, it's still a must if you're a Jim Varney fan and an Ernest movie collector like me. I've never seen a 1;)
