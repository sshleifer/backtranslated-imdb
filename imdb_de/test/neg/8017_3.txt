Do you remember the wooden, undramatic literary arrangements of the 1970s? You'll see it when you see this wide-looking, unintentionally funny piece of chocolate box matching. The most guilty of all is Catherine Z-J, who is undeniably good to the eye, but instead of a big dress looks and looks sultry to actually make a performance. With a face like a melodrama or Cold Comfort Farm played without jokes, this effort is not supported by a scriptwriter who has an ear for dialogues and who completely misses the novel's feel for irony or tragedy. Too bad, given the quality of acting talent - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner and Steven Macintosh - everything is better than that.
