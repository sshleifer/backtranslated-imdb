This film is about a couple who decide to spend a holiday in the Everglades together with another couple and the family dog. When they arrive there, they are not greeted by the neighboring gas guard, who warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the week. After bothering with the old man, three hillbillys are also happy about their arrival as they approach their car and threaten to leave. After asking some of the local dummies who can not speak or simply do not want to answer, they finally find the cabin. After settling in, strange things happen to visitors, including the discovery of dung on their car. The man who makes up the head of this journey is an idiot the end. Adding a church group did not improve the story. In the end, the idiot who survives the whole test goes through the city with a shotgun. Lame. That's what this movie is.
