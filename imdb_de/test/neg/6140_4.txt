I had the privilege of starring in this powerful Broadway play starring Kathy Bates. I just saw another piece in the 70s and 90s that had an emotional impact, like this piece. I was really looking forward to the movie being made into a movie, but I was very disappointed to learn that Kathy Bates would not repeat her role in the film - she was not well known to Broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted it Star Power I suppose and act instead Sissy Spacek. Sissy did a decent job in the lead role, but in no way matched Kathy Bates. I love Anne Bancroft, but she seemed too young for that role. The movie act corresponded to the play. Anyone who has ever thought about suicide should have seen this movie to see the devastation of the bereaved.
