Incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Everything is bad; really bad. From photography (many scenes without focus!) To acting (the young woman is terrible). And what can we say about helicopters from Paint Brush ...? Really amazing B, I mean Z movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, clich√© and poorly written. The basic amenities of the script seem to work. I can not even think that a young cinema student is making this movie. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not even see this movie. Sleeping or playing alone is the best option. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
