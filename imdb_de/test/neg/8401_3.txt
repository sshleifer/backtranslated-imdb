It's hard to decide who or what the target audience for this movie is. Jean-Pierre Limousin probably had a chance to seriously explore the problems of amnesia, and instead opted to use it as an excuse for a soft porn movie. I have seen, loved, respected, and respected the souvenir of belles, which explores the loss of memory - albeit as a result of Alzheimer's disease - in a deep and heartbreaking manner, not least in the light output of Isabelle Carre. I find Novo an insult to Se Souvenirs. I have no problem with soft porn in itself - and even if I did, I would practically have to give up seeing films that are so prevalent today - but I have a problem with them Authors / directors who try to respect them by deception as here under the guise of medical research. The sad thing is that fine actresses like Julie Gayet - so wonderful in Clara et Moi - and Anna Mouglalis - who seems to have fallen into a double match after Le Deluge last week - are wasting her time.
