This is a typical "perfect thriller". A perfect crime is executed and the investigator, who ignores all clues, immediately knows who is guilty. The audience has to wait around the movie until the culprits get caught. The result is like every single episode of "Columbo" or "Murder she wrote". The director himself refers to the history of Hackney by showing the policeman watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills 90 minutes, but the director insists on filling in every clich√© every 120 minutes in the book. Skip this, you will not miss anything.
