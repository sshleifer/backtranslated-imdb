Wow, just wow. There are already many reviews of this movie, but I wanted to add some own comments. I agree with most reviewers who have said that this movie has terrible acting, writing and directing - whoo boy always does. However, I believe that there are some other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is the Christian faith and the permission for extraterrestrial life to be mutually exclusive? The film looks like you can not be a Christian and allow the possibility? Why? They mention the film so briefly (eg, "The Bible does not say that there are aliens." "Well, the Bible does not say there are none.) But the actual refutation is never answered." The Bible really does not say That it is not so, so how about dealing with the question rather than dismissing it, or better yet, acknowledge that this is an infinite universe in which we live and when we reach an infinite God believe is the possibility that he has made another life somewhere and has his own plans for them. <br /> <br /> 2. How come the ONLY two explanations for the kidnappings that are valid for demons and jokes? What about sleep paralysis and quirks associated with kidnapping, what if it is something else? Too bad the filmmakers have already decided. <br /> <br /> 3. The filmmakers claim that all, the abduction experiences gem have eight I had relationships with the occult. That's a pretty big claim, with no evidence to prove it. I'm not a necessity I say that this is not the case, but if you want to say something, you should have the facts to support it. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the greasy blond guy, the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take someone seriously when he's playing billiards all the time. I wish this was an exploration of the Christian faith and the UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were too busy with their "Faith Message" to care much about making a movie thought-provoking As a Christian, I am sad.
