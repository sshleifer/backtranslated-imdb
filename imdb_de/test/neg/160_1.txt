God ... I have not seen such a horrible movie in a long time ... a long time ... I saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... Keira Knightley is really trying, but she can not dealing with it ... has chopped off her accent again and again and did not have the charisma to fill the role ... Acting by Siena Millers brings you to a point where you ask yourself: Did she ever have acting lessons? Judging by the edge of love, she was never in the acting class, but should consider in the near future ... Both look really pretty. Maybe that's what they should focus on in their future career. If they can be actresses anyone can!
