I come from very few film screenings and this film became a movie that I could no longer stand. The prices of the Turkish festivals are in my opinion not credible. My only explanation for the Queens Festival Award was to believe that some sort of comedy was "translated" because the subtitles helped to divert attention from the terrible performances. At the beginning of the film screening, I was present, the moderator spoke briefly about the history of Turkish cinema and mentioned at one point that the early Turkish cinema was appropriately called "stage cinema", as many of the filmmakers and actors involved were actors from the theater scene. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this movie falls into this category. English-speaking subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally loud language, and all the screaming words in the film are traced back to it, but attentive native commentators will immediately notice that all actors perform with exaggerated loud voices. One could attribute this to the amateur character of all performers, but the biggest source of the "screamed dialogue" is the main character played by the film's only professional actor. Not surprisingly is his background in the theater. My guess is that all the other lay actors have also raised their voices in response to his vociferous stagings, turning the entire movie into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> Put it all down A plot that develops at a snail's pace gets an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I also have a personal problem with Turkish films showing rural life with flat, uneducated characters. Since "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish films of all time, Turkish filmmakers do not seem to bypass the charm of the rural part of the country. This is interesting only in small doses and if it is so beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in Zugurt Aga. Mostly, however, it is extremely boring for native "city Turks" and frankly a bit embarrassing. Rural communities are a neglected, underdeveloped part of the country, and while this is a good material for the comedy, this is costly for Turkey's image. <br /> <br /> This movie will undoubtedly think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I wish the filmmakers would recognize this and give up their passion for the stories of the "husbandman" and remain loyal to the majority of the country, which lives in cities that embarrass metropolises in Europe.
