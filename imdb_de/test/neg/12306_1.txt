No redemptive features, this movie is garbage. His jokes do not start to be funny. The humor for children is pathetic, and the attempt to address adults adds just a little sticky fullness to the whole miserable package. Eating through with my kids just made me uncomfortable about what could come next. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my child, for whom the DVD was purchased, enjoyed the fact that it had a new DVD, neither they nor their sisters expressed much interest in seeing them again, unlike Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc . often queries for iterations.
