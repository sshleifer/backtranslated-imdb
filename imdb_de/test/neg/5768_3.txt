The story is a hunted jumper who made a deal with the devil to find gold and is forced to protect it forever. A few friends find the gold and are talked about by the old miner, and they have to blow up the gold to send it back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean, seriously ... how this movie won NOT the Oscar for the movie of the year? What a captivating story of late 20-year-olds who ran from a 19th-century jumper. I love how you can not kill the monster in other movies, but you can kick it out. In this movie, the monster is described as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie rips Nightmare off considerably from Elm Street Part 4, but what the hell, this movie was not necessarily a 5 star classic. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is when we are introduced to a girl who has never been to school and has never been outside the city, who has never learned to read or write ... and yet perfect English Speaks, smokes hot and wears the latest fashion. How did the Oscar miss that? <br /> <br /> OK, I'm done with the bad jokes, this movie is crap and look only when you have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are already in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points
