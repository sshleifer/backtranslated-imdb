There are so many things in this movie that I do not know where to start. The story is not coherent at all. I guarantee that the average viewer scratched his head in confusion after five minutes. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember before I lost consciousness: A quasi-abusive dad hunts some teenage sisters through a house, but does not turn out to be so insulting. In the next scene, the girls are about 15 years old. They drive with their parents and beat a deer. The deer must have been explosive because his car blew up, one sister pulls the other out of the burning wreckage. Then the girls float in a boat on a lake and make a big plan to drive to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the next scene, the girls hitchhike to a military base. And what kind of military base? Actually, it's more like a pig that has been rebuilt to look like a military base, with many confused extras playing "soldiers." The base commander's office is particularly impressive because random things like an AK-47 hang on the wall and a sergeant with drill bits mounted on a plaque (????), so that the audience is sure that this is a military office acts. Then a random guy pushes a motorcycle, and the base commander tells him to "go to town" to buy porn magazines and to make sure the soldiers do not believe he's in the "pink team". So our character picks up a pickup truck that looks like an army truck "into town" and loads a box from a nondescript "bookstore" with a pompous doll on the front door. The girls hide in the guy's truck as he stops for gas and look through the porn stash to find items like the "anal intruder." I think that's enough of the conspiracy to scare away most people. The sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy symbolic attempts, like a radio talker talking about forbidden fruits in the scene where the "nasty" sister meets the main character for the first time or how the camera lingers too long to try to convey a "message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever, stay away. In both cases, it is not worth the money.
