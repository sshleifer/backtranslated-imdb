This must be one of the weakest acts in a movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, this is not all that this movie lacks. This movie has the worst drama, writing, directing, special effects, you name it - it's the worst thing ever. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest you spend your time with rewarding movies and do not waste your time with trash. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier post that the "women" were definitely men who dressed in drag and that made me laugh. I keep trying to figure out if they were obvious or if they were actually trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is not much that is worth to be seen anyway. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: terrible drama, terrible screenplay, terrible idea for a movie. One and a half hours of my life I want to go back NOW !!
