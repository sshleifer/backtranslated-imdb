Normally, a film that starts poorly stays bad in a monotonically descending pattern. This bad movie seemed to get better before making a steep dive. The acting, apart from the male opponent, was terrible. The plot was essentially a take for the final main scene, which is probably good as a performance art, but was wasted in this movie. Not sure why this movie was made.
