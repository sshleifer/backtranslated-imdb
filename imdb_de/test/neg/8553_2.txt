An ugly female movie from the Cellblock films rips through the bottom of the midnight movie barrel, combining mushy sleaze with the weirdest girl-in-the-shower clich√©s. Linda Blair plays an innocent prisoner who is sent to jail (we learn she ran a guy over her car) and faces a hard time in the Big House, with some of the worst characters on this side of Russ Meyer. Blair is constantly being beaten, beaten, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is a four-letter word that is disgusting, and the movie does not cause violence and stupidity. Nevertheless, some viewers see this as a camp classic, even if the tongue is perhaps not far enough. * from ****
