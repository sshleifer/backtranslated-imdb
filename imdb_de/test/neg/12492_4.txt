I expected a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role as SARKAR, but I'm disappointed. As a director of Ram Gopal Vera I was not ready for such a movie. Sarkar is said to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others. In Tamil, there is a movie called Nayakan based on GOD FATHER. Kamala Hassan played the lead role. The film is well directed, and the power to the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of making a difference. The film does not show the strong influence of God the Father.
