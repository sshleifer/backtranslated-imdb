I've been a classic horror fan all my life. Many nights stretched into the wee hours of the morning and saw universal films about "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night." Unfortunately I saw this movie in the early evening, but it almost got me to sleep. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen a "horror" image that was taken for granted. Dr. Nobleman does not seem to believe in the supernatural, but soon he treats Dracula medically and watches as Larry Talbot transforms into Wolfman, barely blinking an eye. He and Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster as something everyday. Nobleman is eager to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza, and Nina protested, he is like "Aww, you're right, no big deal." After realizing Dracula's betrayal, he opens the Count of Sunlight and POOF! Coffin, he's just gone. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not seem to be on the phone in her ranks was Jane Adams Nina. Her reward is carved in the pit by the Frankenstein Monster at the end of the movie from the hump in the back ... and nobody tries to save her! You, Dr. Nobleman and the monster are all lost, while Talbot and Miliza leave the castle by chance. <br /> <br /> Definitely the low point for Universal during his classic horror years.
