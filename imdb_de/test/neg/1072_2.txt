Honestly, Mr. Thalluri ... if you make a drama movie in a high school scene after a bunch of teenagers through the school day and if you jumble the timeframe and jump back and forth when you do that means you can not use the same visual narrator from Elephant, which uses a camera that moves from one character to the next, showing scenes three times from different angles. They just can not do that, because this is such a dull rip-off. It's hard to believe that anyone rated this as more than 5. Where "Elephant" (released 3 years before this movie) uses shootouts from school (or more specifically, shooting with Columbine) as the center of the screenplay. 2:37 uses suicide of teenagers. It's the same slow storytelling, a lot of dramatic piano music, all leading to a finale that you know from the beginning. At least the characters look like they're trying to be different in this department. So you have an untypical gay guy who looks like a stoner / skater, a good-natured lover boy who can not handle his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family, both of whom have their own problems and here comes the Dive nose. <br /> <br /> You also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ludicrous characters of all time ... a man with discomfort who gets his pants down because of "2-urethral syndrome" and who never actually heard of the invention has diapers piss but rather in the pants in the classroom and then put on new clothes and do EVERY DAY! WOW, as much as this movie tries to be realistic, that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is beaten up in the bathroom and is obviously ashamed of it, but does not wipe the blood from his nose when he walks through the whole school with wet pants and bleeding nose. The realism of the new age leads directly to "the turn" and the final character that turns out to be a suicide victim ... <br /> <br /> After watching the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day including incest) have - rape, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for classes and looks and the aforementioned gay topic, a kind of "very realistic" daily soap ... that seems to be hard). We are watching a girl we met in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason for the guy she had a crush on to leave the room when she spoke to him (in a thoughtful piano performance, by the way) has seen somewhere before ??). And it gets even better ... before she slits her wrist in a painful long scene with "yes" and "no", she asks a 2-sphincter guy if he's alright, smiling all the time, and then she cuts in a school her wrist with scissors toilet. <br /> <br /> Now that you've got a movie that's a total rip-off from Elephant, you're failing with really sloppy storytelling (the whole rape incest thing was unbelievable, by the way) and people call this a shock. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on ?? Is all you need to take some pseudo-dramatic music, tell boring stories and add a shock theme, and people think there is a deep message here? I think Elephant is already overrated, but the movie was the original, while this is an obvious rip-off on many other levels. I've never seen a brash stealing of a whole movie concept in my life ... and believe me, I've seen hundreds of horror movies, so I know how deep you can get there. This is a total disappointment in all departments ... it's neither realistic nor stolen, it's damn slow and in any case I wonder what's more pointless ... another romantic suicide (many give this movie the point, who asks me if you're watching Romeo + Juliet all day just because there are dozens of films that deal with the subject in a non-romantic and realistic way) or this ridiculous attitude ... Come on! I'm still trying to figure out if 2-urethra or suicide is unrealistic and ridiculous.
