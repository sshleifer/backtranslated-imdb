It's a mystery to me how this shit of a movie ever got into distribution. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's horror and there is a good amount of nudity, but with God the production value is the lowest I've ever seen. The equipment used is worse than the standard equipment for the home, everything is overlapping and gives everything an amateurish look. America's worst home video or whatever that show was called. <br /> <br /> Please, people, is it too much to ask that you really try to waste 90 minutes of human life if you observe this? You should have done a few short projects first, because it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs! 1.10
