Why???? What a disgusting joke of a supposed movie ... on the poster it looked like a sweet movie. What a disappointment ... who the hell is the male lead actor? He looks like an old retarded police detective ... I'm a cop and I can say ... the man can not act ... go back and become a cop ... no screen presence ... why did they just show him? It's like he's Mel Gibson. Hell, the filmmaker has no business. He does not make a movie. I seriously doubt that women or gay men find him attractive ... whoever Cast is. The film is a no-talent hack that does not play talent hacks in the lead role. It's great that we white men always get the Asian women, but why an ugly white, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as a white friend Asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what I see ??? Do not understand ... must be low self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl to star in the movie was Kate Holliday. Why was there just a hot white woman among the rest of the ugly Asian chicks who think they are hot and can act? <br /> <br /> Only two actors in this movie, the Host of the Poetry at the end of the movie, and one hot white chick in the massage house .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the main characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Asian figure looked ridiculous, as if she was trying hard to be a ghetto / sexy black girl ... Keyword here is "trying on" .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. You can not act and you are not physically hot enough for this type of role. You have to play character roles and be more humble your self-portrayal .. <br /> <br /> I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I looked her up in the IMDb and she's a great Asian actress. If so, I do not want to see what the bad Asian American actresses are. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood does not have Asian American actors !!! if that's the best, they've got !!! You allegedly won an Asian Film Award? give me a break ... it looked like they just made a movie to put some Asian girls in them ... they're not even hot ... Gina ... you're not hot ... Stop playing character roles and improve your acting ... You are not a leading female type ... <br /> <br /> If these films cause pigs to fly pigs ... do me sorry that they are so dull, but I feel that these actors / actresses you must either get better or work on their craft. Apart from the two actors that I said should have starred, I say they fell in love with the movie for all the Asian lead girls. Please do what your parents say and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and act on the site for fun ... hopefully you do that now ... I'm not trying to be mean, but I hope that this is read and forces you to do better or do another business. There was not even an ethical message in this film. <br /> <br /> I would not be surprised if "Soap Girls" by members of the Ku Klux Kl secretly funded a special section of the clan's American American hate propaganda .. Otherwise, they will have to the Asians hate themselves. This movie makes me grateful as a spectator that I'm not Asian .. They are pathetic. Have some respect for you Asian people.
