This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic clich√©s that never look as if they themselves believe it. Are white people such monsters that in their twenties they will continue to call two white rapists "good guys" and have to be convinced that this could be a source of provocation? Are black people universally inspiring? Does the Ku Klux Klan really stand in court and shoot at lawyers without anyone intervening? Do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted if the jury outside hears a mob calling "kill him"? Are blacks really standing shoulder to shoulder while the clan waits to hear the verdict? In fact, do women take several months to realize that their husband could defend a man from unfair hanging because he knew he could have done the same? Do the juries actually get people for murder because they feel sorry for them? Do attorneys really use a defense of reason to convince people that their client was temporarily crazy? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the high-minded principles of this film were lost through the exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to thrill the audience. Was the issue of rape, let alone rape of children, really in competent hands? Is it really an issue that belongs in Hollywood's hands? And if so, why the unintentional kidnapping and kidnapping of Sandra Bullock? And the completely senseless rape of a witness? Seems like the director did not really feel that strongly about sex crimes. <br /> <br /> This took the excellent action of To Kill a Mockingbird and made it a blatant, flat, tasteless money nut. Shame on you.
