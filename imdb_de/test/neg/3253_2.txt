Have you heard the theory of clone redundancy, where a copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of this. They try to copy everything from the first movie on. In some cases this works. Robert Stack is actually a bit better than Ted Knight if they essentially play the same character. Actually, I like Randy Quaid, who in the original is no more or less offensive than Bill Murray. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worse, C2 has proven once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. I hardly like him, and C2 has nailed the casket of his "comedic" career for me. He seems to feel the same, he sticks more to Tuffy like Driving Miss Daisy and hosts Psi-Factor. Apart from that, it's usually "been there" for Caddyshack 2. Look at the original twice instead of just once, and you'll get more for your rental money.
