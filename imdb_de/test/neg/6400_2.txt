This takes place in the 70s on Fire Island. A pair of Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) are celebrating a party in their home in July. Unfortunately their relationship breaks down and they have to prepare for a house with very strange guests. The rest of the film describes the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay man, but I was 8 when that was done. If this is a true view of gay life in the 70s, I'm glad I was not there. From the enigmatic credo that shows children in the sand (???), this film slowly slips into disaster. There is a guru (Robert Case) who constantly talks about nothing important. I wanted to gag the guy midway in his first LONG speech. There's the boy Danny, who's here for the first time. There's the lesbian couple (that does not do anything except one for no reason). There is the leather queen. Worst of all is the male man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We are introduced to him and his friend (whose name I never got) when they get a flat tire. They scream and scream for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix an apartment. I know some people find this funny, but I found it offensive and rather sad. The party itself is full of people you never want to know. It's like being in a party full of vicious actors playing hideous people. Nobody can trade with the sole exception of Dudley. <br /> <br /> This may be valuable as a portrait of Fire Island in the 70's ... but it's pretty boring. This gets only a 2 for the frequent male nudity of some very beautiful bodies.
