This is my first Almodavar movie. I must confess that we chose the election because we knew that this was the enticing prospect of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. I consider myself a pretty demanding spectator, I like European movies, "art" films, and I can generally recognize a quality movie, even if it does not suit my taste a complete blank for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a "comic comedy," but I did not even laugh. Loosely and awkwardly built, with many meaningless dialogues. I do not understand that at all - it seems like an amateurish effort. Can someone enlighten me?
