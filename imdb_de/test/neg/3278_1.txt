1 Bolo Yeung is in the film for a total of ten minutes, even though he serves ice cream to his boss. A lot of street thugs, who look like junkyard owners, are immediately overpowered by the Asian superhero, who speaks like an illegal alien right behind a manure cart. 3 (bat) let me off the shirt, gay model like muscle heee-haaw! heeheeew! all good! - He's dead on the floor, his neck, his elbow, his chin or his balls are broken. - 4 cheap semi-sexual scenes in which the white broad comes out of nowhere, digs the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (former C-Action movie star) poses as an eccentric, trendy gun smuggler looking for a handpicked white sloppy girl in a nightclub, who willingly follows an idiot posing as a millionaire who puts her on 6 yes, the local police - captain is involved and yes, the first butchered cop is the superhero's former patrol teammate (yaawn!). 7 action scenes are wrong, like A) hee-haw! Chinese tries a spinning kick B) A thin leg of the Chinese up to the neck of the Negro bat C) Death ends in his head too much, as in Walker Texas Ranger Fake Action 8 final titles finally the total garbage. These people are only good enough to stand or double in other C films, and they are at least referred to as the County Prison Stunt Crew.
