This film is to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house on which it is based, as well as the person. As you can see at the end of the film, she was killed in the World Trade Center incident. I know that because I was one of the policemen who helped identify their remains. (She was the only one who got lost in our area). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I'm not proud, but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without actually showing it. This film has a bad taste and I can not see how their family would bless it. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
