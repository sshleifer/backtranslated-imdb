Okay, I just had to complain with that sound ... Like a monstrous mental gimp, I've been through this movie in its entirety. <br /> <br /> You'll find that the trivia of IMDB indicates that parts of the 747 increase were "borrowed" from the 1977 airport. This really does not scratch the surface ... Virtually all of the exterior shots of the aircraft that flood, land, sink, and even sink the ocean - and restraints are borrowed from '77. All "uplifting" shots date from '77, including most of the inner flooding clips, with the exception of drowning Dennis Weaver. I could not help wondering if Olivia Dehavilland could swim past any moment or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-catcher: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, which compensates for the fact that the plane from Airport '77 is owned by the Stevens Corporation (under the direction of Jimmie Stewart, of course). <br /> <br /> This is a true calvacade of actors who have not worked much or at least have not worked for a while, which may have been the first clue that it would be a real stinker. <br /> <br /> I rated this film 2 - it's definitely worth a "1", but if this movie can not offer any other redeeming quality, at least someone has Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver Helped to pay their car costs for it! Month!
