I enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan strange before. RH3, however, was a remake of the first two without charm and humor. I think I laughed once - and that was during the NGs. Tucker was extremely annoying in this film, and his character seemed to have no other purpose than to beat everything in as irritating a way as possible. Chan is always sympathetic, but he seemed tired in this movie. I could predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was (SPOILER ALERT), who became the good guy who became the bad guy, etc. I hope to see more of Tucker and Chan's films in their own efforts but not in Rush Hour sequels anymore. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental, but no purchase.
