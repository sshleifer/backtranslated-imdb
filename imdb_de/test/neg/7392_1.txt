I visited "TKIA" with high expectations, which could influence my opinion. I've seen all the Dogme movies, and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story combines with themes from Shakespeare's drama: King Lear, but never succeeds in capturing and caring for the audience. The directing of the actors is very easy even for movies in the dogmatic style and leads to bad undefinable actors. The story lacks any dynamics, and I quickly lost interest. There are some scenes in the movie that shock the viewer, but I do not think they enriched the story in the first place. Mifunes sidste sang and festivals are both Dogmefilms, which have proved to be well-directed and had good storylines. I'm looking forward to better Dogmefilms in the future. Maybe Aake Sandgren's "An Invisible Man-Dogme 6" will improve the quality again. Because he is like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is an experienced and trained director.
