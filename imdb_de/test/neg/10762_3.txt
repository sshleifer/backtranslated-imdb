Although better than most TV movies, "Buried Alive" is nothing more than an ordinary revenge story. There are so many holes in it that one wonders why the scriptwriters did not go through a series of rewrites. The end has a nice twist, but it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The acting of Jennifer Jason Leigh is as always terrific, but Tim Matheson brings it with cheesy Einleinerern that remember Jack Nicholson in "The Shining". Do not bother with this.
