I came out of this movie and did it only once before with the Australian movie Sweetie almost 20 years ago. After about three minutes I felt like killing the cameraman, and I just could not believe that this movie actually showed anywhere and whatever - was nominated for two independent Spirit Awards. What???? Regardless of how realistic the dialogue could be (I'll NEVER use the word "buddy" again!) - who wants to hear these conversations? I do not go to the movies to get angry, but that's all I have. The only good thing that came to my mind was the realization that anyone, if this film can make it to Sundance and other festivals, can do it all. Well, wait, that may not be a good thing ...
