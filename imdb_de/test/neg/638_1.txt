What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin on a train with a bad toupee and an alien? You get a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail", which would be more entertaining on Comedy Central's old series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". They call it, this terrible movie suffered in areas like drama, plot, storyline, and special effects. In fact, the exterior shots of the passenger trains looked as if the production workers had used a standard HO model against a painted background! The rest of the special effects go downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable and is similar to the two 70s horror express movies and the catastrophe movie "The Cassandra Crossing". At least "The Cassandra Crossing" had a better cast, a captivating storyline and real train scenes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good laugh and a movie on a "B Movie" party, take a look at this; Otherwise derailed "Alien Express" long before leaving the station!
