One of the most pleasant surprises of these early 3-stripe shorts by Technicolor was that a ballet dancer who appears here was called Maria Gambarelli! I was half wondering if Blake Edwards named the character played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this now-forgotten actor (though the surname of the Summer character was actually Gambrelli). I saw this mainly on YouTube to see an early appearance by Judy Garland when we saw her in profile with her two older sisters singing "La Cucaracha". That was the highlight for me, which otherwise showed some dances (like that of Mrs. Gambarelli) that were fun, and a lame comedy between Andy Devine as a great bullfighter (yeah, right!) And Buster Keaton as a bull owner, who makes sure of that who is obviously a man in animal costume. The only fun part of the two is when they cry - Buster offers a handkerchief for the "bull" - while the sad part of "La Cucaracha". It was also lame to see Ted Healy without his henchmen dealing with a Crasher who always confused Healy with other movie stars. (Healy himself did not know that Zeppo had left The Marx Brothers since he put "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!) Speaking of a Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig, even though he had one Hat wore to hide his bald head. It was also interesting to see Ida Lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning, though I also recognized Toby Wing from her role in Murder at the Vanities last year (at least when Pete Smith's spokesman identified her). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny with his story. Other famous stars you may not know are also in cameos and not all are M-G-M contract players! With everything said, La fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth a look for anyone interested in Judy Garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3-Stripes Technicolor.
