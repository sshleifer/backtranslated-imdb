I have a tendency to these twists to British social norms and it is rare that one loses me. But our betters have lost me a bit. It's a story about social climbers and their joy of breaking the rules, but personally I found it a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I liked the Duchess, though she whines a little too much and Constance Bennett lovingly occupies the role of Lady Greyston, a role that Bette Davis could have played backwards. But the movie comes alive in the third act when Ernest joins the party. He is so lively and funny (and in truth he probably wears more makeup than Lady Greyston). He gets the last line of the movie and it's a gas!
