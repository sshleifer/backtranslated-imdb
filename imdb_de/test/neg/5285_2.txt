Probably one of the best, most horrible movies ever, because it's so bad and random, it's kind of weird and I do not know how to feel about it. I remember making Cabin Fever on the veranda karate and screaming "pancakes" that's intriguing. Since many people have already sketched the plot and all I will do is to summarize the quality of the movie with a quote: "I am the park ranger who will fuck you". said enough? If you are looking for quality or a really scary movie, I can not recommend it. But if you like these kinds of movies, you probably would enjoy it. I do not know how, but some people would do it.
