Let me say at the beginning, I love horror movies. Big budget, low budget, big actors, no names, it does not matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I'm very forgiving. This movie is pretty bad though. <br /> <br /> The actors show little or no emotion as they deliver their lines, and the drama is worse than many of the lower budget horror movies I've ever seen. If the actors are killed, they might be less important. There's little gore (I have no idea which movie other reviewers have looked at when they say there's good gore in this movie because there's none) and the special effects are at best below average. They steal so much from so many better horror movies (Jeepers Creepers, Friday, the 13th, Leprechaun) and it still does not help. Luckily I saw that on Showtime and did not really have to pay any extra money to see it or wasting a spot on my Netflix queue. There are so many better horror films, and I recommend seeing them instead of the big withdrawal.
