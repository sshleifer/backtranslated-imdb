This movie has amazed me. I could not handle it. I thought I could miss something. I'm glad to see that most of me agree with me. This is not always the case (see my last review of RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> If you explain the mistakes of this film in more detail, this would be a glorious waste of time ... so I will do it. They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? No? I do not get it ??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! That's how it was presented. I have not seen that yet. I hope you have done a good job. <br /> <br /> You did not do it! They tried to create an iconic character that would produce a series. They did not do it. <br /> <br /> You've tried to make an Australian indie zombie strip on the caliber (and maybe on the rock tails) of the well-made "UNDEAD". That was not the case. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe they just wanted to create a confusing, disjointed mess of movie salad that could eventually be edited into something observable. They have not! This is the new number 2 on my list of the worst zombie movies ever. There is really only the two so far, "DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM" is the first (not to be confused with "DAY OF THE DEAD", one of my favorite zombie films ever). If you're doing a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie filmmaker, I'm just a connoisseur), make a good movie. Flight of the Living Dead is a great example of decent zombie filmmaking. For your information. <br /> <br /> If you really give in, you may think, have not you at least put something in it to make us feel like we do not want our money back? Guess what ... YOU DO NOT!
