Where do I start with the killing mind before mentioning the good? This film is about a young psychological profile of the FBI woman or something that for some reason works for the LAPD for a short time. There are some identifiable faces, such as Wayne's World's "I love you, man", who plays a cop (and a nice beard too!), And two guys who seem to always play cops ... they guessed it bulls One of them was one of the police officers at Gross Point Blank, who followed John Cusack over the place, and the other is the FBI guy with specifications in Final Destination, who is also another policeman in the Fugitive. I know that the FBI, the US Marshalls, the CIA, etc. are not cops, but they are all the same. They enforce the law to a degree, which makes them policemen in my book. Feel free to disagree with a police officer's definition as you wish. They are still seen as the ones trying to suppress the bad guys. Everyone, I digress. The woman works with these policemen, who just seem to be sitting in a library in the basement, and decides, for some unknown reason, to resume a case that was not sought after by Yonks. She saw the body as a child, so of course she decided to resume the case because she was personally involved with it! I also like how the person who experienced the psychological state of other people as a child experienced a murder site. Surely that's the kind of thing that can be screwed to someone's head ?! She begins to ask questions to a journalist who told the story when she was open, even though he seems to be the same age as the woman. Presumably, he either wrote at ten for a newspaper or wrote some school reports. She then decided that he was the best person to ask for it. <br /> <br /> We see then that she has not only reopened 25 years ago murder cases, but also deals with the small theft A really inconspicuous guy sprints with a balaclava through a busy street. Way to mix, idiot! Anyway, she and the policemen she eats with ice cream in the park chase after him, and as they cross a bridge where a woman and a child are standing, the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws it into her River. If you have not guessed, this is the best part of the movie. I'm not sadistic and do not hate babies or anything, but the scene just looks so stupid. I promise you will wet your pants when watching this movie. It gets better when the final destination officer & the fugitive jumps in to save the baby, and then his friend, "It's a baby!" How did he not know that before he jumped in, I'm a mystery. Anyway, she chases after the thief, but loses it. Later, she remembers that a random dog did not bark at the thief, so he assumed it was his and decided to find the thief through the dog. The dog had no markings or anything on it, so he knew where to find the dog, so finding the thief is another question I will not go into. Shortly after, I stopped looking. The story was moving very slowly, and after I stopped laughing at the baby's bit, I somehow lost interest and missed what was being said. <br /> <br /> If I say that, I'll continue that the killer was the journalist because he was a bit outlandish and she spent a lot of time with him, and anyone watching Columbo knows the person is out of the police who spends most of her time with the investigator, is your bad guy. Also, other people's reviews say the killer is pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> All in all, a trouser film, but it's worth it, just for this a glorious scene to look.
