and nothing else. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the problem Child Tantrum Pack (contains the first two "problem kids" on a disc) and we decided to watch the sequel because it was "funnier". <br /> <br /> There were a lot of funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all I have to say), Nippy, the dog, after eating CHOW DOWN, and many others. The movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it's weird. Apart from the funny moments, however, this film has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter annoys the crap because he sounds like he's reading from a book. The man can not act in this matter, sorry. <br /> <br /> Although I can not say if I would find this movie funny ... (we were thrilled when we saw him), he is perfect movie for a rainy day ... but then nothing. Do not expect Oscar material here, guys.
