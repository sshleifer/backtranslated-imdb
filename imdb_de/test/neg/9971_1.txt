One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Three immature teenagers have sex and talk very little except that they "love each other." They do not seem to care much, only for themselves and only passively. I felt excluded. Most outdoor scenes take place at night, so you can not even enjoy the well-lit sights of Paris! After an hour and ten minutes, I gave up.
