This is the worst movie I have ever seen and the worst I'll probably ever see. I see no need to warm up what everyone else said before, just beforehand ... <br /> <br /> This is NOT one of the bad movies you think you want to see because you want to make fun of it, it's just bad bad bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is the equivalent of having a "pet rock" as a friend. They wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait until something happens. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a Pet Rock did you know what you are getting involved with. Lion's Gate is completely deceiving about this bomb ... No ... that's a disaster. After watching this movie, you'd swear George W. Bush had his hands on the movie ... yes, that's so idiotic. <br /> <br /> Stay away, unless you just want to watch the movie's worst movie ever. It was probably how Lion's Gate assumed it would make money with this piece of tripe.
