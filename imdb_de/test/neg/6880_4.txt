I would not say that this is a good movie, in fact it could even be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least two good reasons to keep watching this movie, these are the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), both of whom are solid performers. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the cast, which are pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in the "Suburban kids goes to hood" drama HAVOC, but here she is not in a good mood and annoying. <br /> <br /> THE STORY is decent, but nothing special, BUT it would have been much better, since it happens in LOUSIANNA that all children have indeed incorporated a south-facing accent, but they do not do it (!) , <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie "the monster" is so deeply involved in the Lousianna folklore, with Voodoo and so it is just stupidity not to include this accent in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only one who makes w That rapper METHOD MAN, he plays Deputy Turner and puts in his few scenes a pretty good accent, and if a rapper is able to, then the "professional" Actors that can not do the same? Mr. Tical aka Meth is very gratifying in his VERY small role. Who knows that the Ticallion stallion would ever be a cop? Even if only on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Besides that, it's a pretty stupid but pretty entertaining Slasher movie, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young cast, it could have been bad, luckily they're good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent, BUT there are hundreds of better Slasher movies.
