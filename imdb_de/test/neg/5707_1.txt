The main character is a tiny, irresponsible study of how to throw a pity party. She loses it right away, looks pathetic, schizophrenic and leaves me wondering why she does not understand on Earth why her "friends" have not called her for three years. (Get a hint, sister - you're a teenage mess!) I could not stand her or her friends. I never felt connected to the characters. To make the whole movie even more unbearable, someone has gone to great lengths to film the most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted caps in the world for eternity (this alone should allow someone to be put to the test for a decade on a locker !) <br /> <br /> The acting was not terrible, but not really credible, and in the end I was only interested in the two hours I will never get back. Do not waste time - look for an appointment for a dentist instead!
