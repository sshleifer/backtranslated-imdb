Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that are not quite successful in what they are trying to do. The film is a 76-minute, extremely slow, questionably effective and irritating experience that seeks to present a fascinating philosophy about the creation of the Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> It opens with God being presented as a chair-bound psychopath Man tearing his stomach with a knife. Out of the entrails, blood and human waste, Mother Nature emerges. She continues to impregnate herself with the seed of the dead god. Later, she gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A retard that is constantly abusing a group of cannibalists whom I believe to be the representative of humanity. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" casts a twisted and disturbing look at the origin of life. Demonstration of the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed, which have become a hallmark of humanity. The problem in the movie comes from two points. For one thing, the film is just too slow in its exhibition. What we get is a good thirty minutes to show how the Earth's son is constantly shaking naked on the ground while being harassed and tortured by humanity. Such a tasteless extension quickly becomes boring and they lack the punch to strike the viewer's senses. <br /> <br /> Another point is "Beggotens" optics and sound. The grainy, inverted, black and white low-frame cinematography enchants the disruptive factor of the plot, but such novelties often only appear in short periods of time. Then you gradually lose their effect, as the audience gets used to the look. The audio suffers from the same problems. It's constantly repetitive and similar sounds get so annoying so fast that I had the urge to turn off the volume. "Congenital" loses its charm shortly after the beginning. It tries to be original and creative, but it can not broaden the ideas suggested by the vague story, but repeats the same scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "begging" gets stuck in a moment. Even though it tries to move forward in terms of plot, picture and sound remain the same everywhere. Show the same action a little differently, but with a slightly different sound. A gimmick can not do a movie alone. It also needs speed and variety, something that Merhige seems to have forgotten.
