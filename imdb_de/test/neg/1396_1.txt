I have not seen this show for months, but for a while I had to watch it every day because I had a roommate who liked them. Perhaps it has undergone some significant improvements all the time, although IMDb's advertising and 4.2 rating are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's show. Even Mencia says so. And though I was not even a big fan of Chappelle's show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far more edgy than Mencia ever was). Mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and outdated. If you can not see that, there is probably no hope for you. But to be fair, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> - Kencia seems to be taking off from Lily's sketch of Chapelle. Take it easy. <br /> <br /> - "South Park" is doing an episode about Scientology. A week later, Mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to Scientologists. Remember, the joke is NOT about Scientologists, but about how much he insulted them in his show. He has never made a single Scientology joke by that time. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two AP photos go through the internet showing a black man "looting" food and a white woman "finding" her. WEEKS later, after millions of people have already seen this, Mencia presents it on his show as if he has discovered it and it is shown for the first time (the Daily Show would have been one day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than joke-stealing is the way Carlos applied for his show, claiming it breaks some kind of PC barrier (whatever) and if you do not laugh. You must be a weak prude who can not handle jokes about race. Yes, Carlos, it is not because you are not funny, but because we are all too offended to laugh (if that was true, why was the Chappelle show so popular?). He constantly scolds his audience for "not understanding" when he does not laugh enough, often repeating his jokes and explaining this, a technique that most comedians stop using until they are 14 years old. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that Mencia does not seem very smart. It's kind of tragic that there are dozens of funnier, more insightful comedians trying to make it while this guy makes money. His show is supposedly the third highest rating from Comedy Central, which is amazing (again, it has a rating of 4.2 on this page). Where the hell do you get those numbers? Comedy Central tries to call itself a "nervous" station, but as long as it tries to address the dumbest audience, this will never be the case.
