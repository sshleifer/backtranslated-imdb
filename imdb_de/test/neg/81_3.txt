Okay, so it would never change the world and bombarded the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those movies I fell in love with as a kid (the BBC did it in the 80s and showed me a few times) VHS tape in the machine - luckily!) And watched endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and unfortunately the time was not good for this blockbuster. Either that or I've just outgrown a broad, stupid sense of humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughter, he gives us novelties of underpants with "amusing" slogans. What can you say about the cast or the script? <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's ambitious, interesting, unusual and extended, but it's never a weird laugh. I would describe it as a children's movie with "adult" overtones - you can safely watch your children despite the 15-year certificate. You do not get drug references, so do not worry. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized that I had forgotten how catchy both the title song and Trucker's song "Everybody's Going Faster, Faster" were, not to mention the patriotic anthem of the city of Ticlaw. The whole cast offers remarkable performances, the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the different places perfectly, and there is a real-time capsule feeling in terms of fashion, the cars, the gadgets (especially the on-dash drum machine), the Interior and Interior The Pop Culture References - I was more than a little surprised when the crazy butt in the bank told everyone, "I'm OJ Simpson!", Especially now that Simpson's legal involvement overshadowed his athletic accomplishments. The catch is, there's almost no plot to talk about, it's far too obvious to be funny and not funny enough to provoke many real laughs. I wish I had left these as a pleasant memory.
