The movie starts promisingly, the use of pictures and simple short clips conveys the bigger story, which usually takes a much bigger budget than what's needed here. It disturbed me, however, as it went on. Combined with another overly hoarse Max Payne guy talking about the movie, it did not look that good anymore. I hoped it was just the introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really got me and took me to this movie. The idea that a researcher has developed a virus that actually protects the infected cells from other infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then, when the subjects who had the most bizarre perturbations visited the scientist and offered to be his human experiments, it made me think that this could be a very good little movie. The introduction, however, did not go well. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be a change in tempo as the film switched to recorded interviews with the film's four main characters, the subjects. Although the drama was not great, there seemed to be a lot of room for character development throughout the movie, and the recordings were done quite well with a diverse mix of characters. These, however, faded through the film. They were not used after a few short clips, and I felt that there was a missed opportunity to offer great character development by being reflected on them, but not. <br /> <br /> The visual language is increasingly divorced from history, often repeating itself to represent something that is still happening. This separation and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting comments. It began to recite words one after the other. Short, meaningless sentences and the recitation of not too relevant or interesting scientific phrases. If there was something to describe, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looped, ... you have the idea. <br /> <br /> Now this could happen. To reproduce the confusion and the character, he slowly got lost in his own thoughts and walked for lack of food and water. What I actually did was rely completely on the voice, and when I found out at the end of the film, I realized that I had not heard some of the shakings. <br /> <br /> Several times When an event occurs, the camera sequentially displays all signs of their reaction, which seems to be between confused and thoughtful. There are repeated transitions from the same scene to the same scene, e.g. For example, when a sleeping character turns black and then re-enters the sleeping character. Look, we know the character is sleeping, we know the time has passed, please move on. Overall, there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots to fill the time. <br /> <br /> The drama was not bad and the characters were okay, but not exploited and developed. When they got in touch with each other, there were some really curvy moments. For example, if one of them asks if he is hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to a group shot. They pause, look at each other, return to the camera and slowly say "no". It raised one or two cautions. Their dialogue was slow and shiny and either they were completely missing or completely unnecessary. There seemed to be no middle ground on which the dialogue met with pinpoint accuracy. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find unless you looked at them in isolation, and that's what this movie almost looks like. The film was considered a series of scenes rather than a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this more visible than in the main story. The characters are infected with the virus that killed the animals that was developed for them. We are told that this is gradually becoming something dramatic, and that is what we expect. What we get are the characters who eat a lot together, throw everyone up, pour water out of their mouths in unconvincing streams, then they all fall asleep. These are the stages that all occur very early in the movie. Then they all say "good" when asked how they are doing and that's it. The virus is ready, otherwise nothing happens. <br /> <br /> So much more could have been done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus and protected from all possible damage. It could have fathomed a serious change in these characters as it infected and adopted them, it could have developed these characters, showed them how to make decisions, and do things that relate to their character, which is shown in flashbacks to the interviews The end is not even confusing, intriguing, or thought-provoking. It just shows something that happens, and it did, albeit in a long, drawn-out style with the irritating voice above it. I've really struggled with this movie and seen some of the press members come out (including a famous television critic who went in the first twenty minutes). I stayed, but I regretted the lost time.
