I LOVE Sandra Bullock - She's one of my favorite actresses of all time - but this is a movie she would have had to pay long ago to be thrown into the trash. I know it's almost 20 years old - but my dead grandmother can do better than these people. Watch out, it's not even worth the $ 5.50 Walmart rack ... you know, when the show stinks so badly that it's not even worth a few dollars - the sound quality is appalling? and it looks like it was shot on a budget of $ 1.98. I thought I would like to see Sandra in an early role to see how she developed as an actress - but YIKES is too nice to use ...
