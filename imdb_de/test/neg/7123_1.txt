The Grudge 2 is one of the movies I wish there were more synonyms for "awful" in the English language. With an action that has more holes in it than in a trawler's net, this movie can not make a compelling view on a fan of even the craziest films I am. I felt compelled to stay in the cinema until I won Â£ 5.70 worth of entertainment, though I was afraid that I would be there for a few years. A better movie could be made from the first footage of The Grudge, though I am not sure that this is not the result of such an exercise. As you might expect, what in this awful example of wasted celluloid is considered a conspiracy, without any dissolution, so that producers have the opportunity to attribute "The Grudge 3" to the public when they have another fit of true hatred the civilization.
