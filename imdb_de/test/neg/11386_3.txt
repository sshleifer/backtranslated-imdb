Somehow, this documentary about Miles creates very little music and no complete pieces. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other than Miles. There are big chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his child prodigy, his drug addiction) are skipped or passed over, and you will learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. Skip it.
