I had the dubious opportunity to watch this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a horrible script and make it one of the worst movies ever made. The drama is not only bad and the consequences are terrible, the film has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported Swiss cheese which director should not be used in one of them. <br /> <br /> I turned off the TV during the last ten awful minutes of the show. To call "pathetic" is a gross understatement.
