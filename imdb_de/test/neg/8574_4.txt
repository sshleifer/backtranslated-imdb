The main flaw in this Spanish slasher / shocker lies in his script. For the first half hour it is a tidy effort to build tension and an atmosphere of fear and anxiety. We even get some nice murders! Then it goes completely downhill and becomes a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clich√©s". I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. The last thirty minutes consist of a few murders and a lot of walking around in an abandoned monastery. It should have been so much better (though the last scenes in the flooded room are okay)! <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the dialogue. Most of the time it's awful (there was a good deal of giggling here and there when I saw it) and elsewhere only appropriately. It is barely audible during many scenes and drowns under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (which may not be so bad given the stupid lines we need to listen to!). There is a line throughout the movie that refers to the "I know what you did last summer" movies, suggesting that the filmmakers have written it all as a big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> And the end ... well, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me that was usually a matter of the former, because the final turn comes from nowhere! If the audience had received some clues about the girls' mental status, I might have thought otherwise. It also throws all the logic out the window because the killer could never have been for some of the killings! But as an avid horror fan, I've learned to live with these disagreements in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But everything is not bad. The film has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes of yesteryear seem to really shine here), the tight cut and an atmospheric soundtrack. Although most actors are pretty bad, Anita Briem is an exception and makes the most of what she needs to work with. Real screen presence! <br /> <br /> And as I mentioned before, the murders are bloody enough for the fans of such things and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects that include water imprints (but the "water theme") tends to occur on the To end this review, it's a movie that's pretty funny in a way that "so bad that's good" and it's also so enjoyable for that But do not expect too much, as it's not going to work the way you think it should, according to trailer and plot descriptions.
