This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can get for the good reviews is that they were written by people in the cast. It was really painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (6-13 years old) could not bear to see it. As far as I know, this movie has never come to the theater for good reasons. It's like some people sit over a beer and say, "Hey, let's make a movie, who wants to be there?" It is so bad. Apart from Luke Perry, who only plays in a small part of the movie, I did not recognize a single actor. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case. I like Sandlot (I) and I generally like stupid and stupid movies, but this movie does not have a single quality of redemption. The people who wrote it have no idea how children think, talk or act, and the movie is a disjointed mess of dumb lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but this is the worst movie I've seen since Man's Best Friend, and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you rent it, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people actually rated this movie as good is a sad comment on their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerating.
