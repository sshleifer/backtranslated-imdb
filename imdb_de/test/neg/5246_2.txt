Christopher Lambert attracted me to this movie. What a waste! The plot has more holes than my string vest, the special effects were not very good, it did not take much to find out who the creature's mother was and the creature was more than a little blame to Predator. Anti-climatic, this movie could have been done much better. However, there is an interesting point. When will Hollywood discover the rich vein of European folklore just waiting to be mined?
