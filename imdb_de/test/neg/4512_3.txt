I saw the original from 1959, in which the stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins are black and white, and no matter how many times I look at it, I can not help but cry) a set like it was in 1959, but there were so many mistakes in the layout. Spiral staircase? Articles that did not exist at that time were included in the film. Doris Roberts, sad to say she can NOT play drama, she's a comedian and that will not change. James Coco was a terrible Mr. Van Daan, and Mr. Dussel looked like one of my college professors, not the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original film, Anne took the "glove" to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a minute. It took her less than 10 seconds to do that shitty remake. The first reviewer was right ... This remake is just that, a remake. What did the director who played comedy actor in such a role think? I'm sorry, but James Coco can not play drama. Max. Schell was better at Deep Impact than this movie. Crazy Mrs. Frank was so crazy, I did not like her. I refer to the 1959 version and I like it better. She did better to be the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars I give this remake 3. Do not waste time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
