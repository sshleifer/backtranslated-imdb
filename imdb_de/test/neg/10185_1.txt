My mother and I rented this movie. I mean, we love this kind of sci-fi movies, no matter if it's big Hollywood or Indy movies. <br /> <br /> But oh, we were fooled !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO kidnapping in a small town in Texas. Halfway, all sudden things will come to us. My mother and I believe in God and Jesus and the devil, but the way this movie preached made it annoying. All I really have to say is that we are Christians, but even we enjoy it. So do not blame the Christians as a whole, but blame only the Christians who have to filter out the fun of this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the attitude of the directors on UFOs, and that is he thinks everything is demonic. Now I could say a few words, but I will not do it. I'll just say that you WATCH this movie, unless you want to be preached. In fact, it is often said that we must be perfect to enter Heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on the cross.
