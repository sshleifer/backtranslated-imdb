I jumped when I heard the first trace of laughter in the first few seconds of the show, but I gave it a shot. You KNOW, if someone offers a line that's just a little amusing, and you hear an obviously wrong laugh piece explode in a startling laugh, that it's a show aimed at idiots who need to be told, "Yes 'It's funny, keep going and laugh' /> Ugh. I could not stand this show as it showed. I can not speak for everyone - after all, some people like the IDIOTIC show "Stacked" (which makes me vomit). I can imagine that those who like "stacked" might also like this drivel. Some people still get a kick out of the old "Pull my finger" gag. For me, this show is just as funny - and just as original. <br /> <br /> The topics were old and tired. The jokes were lame and cheated. The characters were the ones we've seen everywhere - and the worst you can imagine. <br /> <br /> So if you like things like burps and neighbors saying, "Pull my finger" .. you might actually like this show. Otherwise ... pass by. It's stupid - and not in a clever or original way. This is about as old and tired as any show was at its premiere.
