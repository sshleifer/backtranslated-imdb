Some changes for the better (the special effects are more sophisticated), others for the worse (Scott Grimes, a sympathetic boy in the original, has become a clumsy teenager), but in general, this sequel is about the same as the original, which does not say much. The PG-13 rating is questionable. Although the movie is not scary at all, there is a short but fairly explicit blood and a different nudity. (* 1/2)
