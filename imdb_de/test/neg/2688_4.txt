This movie is really amazing, over the years I've been interested in Japanese monster movies and know that early examples of this genre may be bad. This, however, reaches a new low as it follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (?), A little boy who controls a giant robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seem to have endless supplies of terrible giant monsters disposing of them.
