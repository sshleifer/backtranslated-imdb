Very poor quality and the acting is just as bad. This film is a prime example of today's England and thinking. There is no mention of Jesus in this film, and the film does not contain any Scripture-Christianity, as most people know. <br /> <br /> I'm also very surprised, because this movie is a BBC program and the BBC is known for its quality programming, but it looks like the BBC's attempt with the Hollywood psycho / drama films compete completely failed. Bad action, bad conspiracy, bad culture that seems to be without religion. I would not even bother to buy it, but better try to rent it or buy it when it goes into the $ 2 container.
