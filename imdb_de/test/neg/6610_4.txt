First of all, I have to say that here in Russia a legend of Geralt of Rivia is known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski - a gifted writer or even a genius - created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and kindly fantasy worlds in literary history. And if such amazing material comes into the right hands, read the RPG game "Witcher" and you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Vedmak \ Wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite result. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget. Lack of direction Lack of good script. <br /> <br /> These three whales of disgusting filmmaking have sunk this movie, they have eaten it alive. Acting is good, sometimes more than good, but for God's sake it can not save this project. <br /> <br /> I still have some confidence. I still hope that someday a new Vedmak movie will be made and the whole world will experience an impressive and breathtaking splendor in Sapkowski's books. P.S. But first a Uwe Boll has to be eliminated. Just in case, you know
