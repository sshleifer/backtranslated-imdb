Comparing the movie with something from Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best I can say is that it desperately tries to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The script is awesome, the characters are one-dimensional and the performances are of the quality of a high school drama (with the exception of Marcia Gay Hardens, which is pretty good given the material she has to work with). In addition, the camera does absolutely nothing to convey the bizarre beauty of Gaudi's architecture or the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you like the sand, the pathos and the dark, quirky comedy of Almodovar's films, you will not find any here. Spend your money on something other than this celluloid waste.
