A cheap and cheeky raiding film with bad characteristics, a lot of stoic emotions (like Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) in a sub-biting style and a few cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory, ready for some poorly executed John Woo flyers. Even the squibs look awful. At no point in the negotiation does it look like America. Three shaky old cars do not make land. The Mustang even has a shaky right front wheel. The act as it is is so distracted and predictable that the end is like a mercy killing. It could not come soon enough. Even the jewelry of the robbery looks like the cheapest junk jewelry. The terrible dialogue and the hopeless negotiation of anyone being shot is a real waste of time and space. Worth seeing, if you want to know how you can not make a clichéd low-budget movie.
