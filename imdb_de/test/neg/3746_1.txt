I went out of the cinema after having suffered this movie after 30 minutes. I left two friends of a big, fat guy who had to endure the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film's opening sequence unfolded, I sensed that something was wrong, and it was not long before I stopped. I hide under my seat and am scared. I'm not the one who comes out of movies, even if he's bad, because he usually has something redeeming, but this one suffered from a catalog of bad directing and bad acting (Bar 'Bruno's character & the impeccable Jean Rochefort - according to my friends ) terrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), horrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to evoke an art that put the false peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was his general drowsiness and unbelievability (a result of the above cruelties). Why was it so awful? I do not want to waste any more time explaining. I would go and see for myself, but I do not want to fill the coffers of this project more than necessary. Oh, the show had a redemptive function: my friend was hovering over the rows of seats with his umbrella as he tried to calm down - more pathos, excitement and entertainment in those few moments than the 125 minutes of this sad effort.
