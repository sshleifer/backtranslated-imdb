Unfortunately, this is not one of those films that will make you laugh, at least about their incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value at all. It's just shit. I do not know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me. I think what really needs the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. It sounds like someone took a simple beat and then ran a 5 year old kid with a synth for the rest and recorded it. It is really so terrible and as if that was not enough, there is not a single scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie, you are either deaf or have your ears cut off earlier. Which would at least keep you from falling asleep, because nothing happens in the movie to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad acting, a few cheap and unconvincing killings, no story (it only jumps from one scene to another and you as a spectator can try to make sense of it) and in the last 30 minutes or so can witness the worst " Special effects "that ever existed. It is extremely boring. Do not look at this movie! You could do something more entertaining, like staring at a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack sucked?
