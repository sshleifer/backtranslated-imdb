I was one of the many fools who were paid in the theater to pay for it, even though I paid $ 4 for the price of the matinee (before 6pm). <br /> <br /> The story of the remake was ho-hum CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were rastafarians to mimic today's fads (no, I do not think the chick was hot), the killing of the Hero's girlfriend was a bit cruel and a sad, bad remake. <br /> <br /> I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena and the fat, glowing Surfer Morlocks over this trash at any time. I appreciate that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which is not responsible for either the good taste or the true value of the old classics that are largely unappreciated by today's confused and increasingly coveted youth. <br /> <br /> When the 60's came out (I first saw it for the summer fun in the 70's), it was damn impressive and still holds. You do not have to have too much CGI in a movie to be better. Too much of it looks wrong. I can not say enough how disappointing the Morlocks looked, and they ran and jumped like a kid's video game. 3 out of 10 stars.
