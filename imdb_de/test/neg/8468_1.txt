It is utter nonsense. I studied National Socialism and read many of the manuscripts of the day - the "parallels" use most of the classic, rundown, apocryphal myths of National Socialism and then compare them to complete considerations of what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It was designed for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency that is heavily fed with spoons, terribly elaborate arguments, irrational conclusions, deceptive ideas and nonsensical logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this hit for peace? Easy. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done; Que Bono? Who benefits from it in the long run? <br /> <br /> You do not do it. They sacrifice money and rights. Muslims do not, they get our bombs. Try again. Answer this question and you have unlocked a big door.
