Honestly, after Cotton Club and Unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to see Lane and Gere in this movie because it's BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogues were extremely flat and insincere. It turned well, but on the other hand, it's a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a chick movie. I even knew from the beginning that in the end he would die, the only thing I did not know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing worthwhile was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. But if you want, look at National Geographic. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in such a lousy movie. As for Gere, he's a good actor, but he had movies like this, so I'm not surprised. I wish I could return one and a half hours.
