It starts off with some disgusting sex comedy gags, but it soon reveals its true colors: it wants to be a clone of "Death Wish." I say "will" because the script gets so ridiculous by the minute that it looks like an absurd "Death Wish" counterfeit! From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles, to "heroes" who disguise themselves as commandos and wave their machine guns, not paying attention to themselves (!), To bad guys driving around the city Want to be a black van, long after he was recognized as a vehicle, this film has too many ridiculous points to fit into a list. The other big problem is that you can not distinguish most characters from each other. Of course you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in different scenes, and you would not know the difference.
