This movie is the last straw. As two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy, this movie has finally shown us that since Love Actually, nothing good has come from this genre. There was nothing good about the movie at all. It was an affront to love, death and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This film has sparked Nicholas sparks. Diane Lane can not act to save her life. She could not convince in her laughter, weeping and dancing. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
