I have never seen the other two "Ninja" movies, and for all I know, there are well-known films, but for some reason, I've looked at this. This starts pretty quickly, as this Ninja makes a super-Mordrausch. He is almost unstoppable, because it takes a lot of bullets to tear him down. He is not meant to be counted because he ends up owning a woman and then continuing his killing methods using them as his tool. Another ninja enters the fight, and apparently the only way to kill a ninja is with another ninja, so he volunteers. This leads to a great fight in the end, when the dead ninja returns to his body and they have waged it in a total war. Sounds better than it actually was, but it was not boring.
