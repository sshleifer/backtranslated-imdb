Zero stars out of **** <br /> <br /> Endless Descent has absolutely no redeeming values, be it the ridiculously bad acting, the ridiculously horrible special effects, the incompetent direction, the stupid script or the crackling annoying musical result. It's the kind of pathetic production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could have the slightest consideration, if it's even lit by a studio. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll do that unless you are a group of people trapped underwater who have to kill a lot of fake-looking creatures , <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate on what's so horrible about this movie. At first, the drama is just terrible. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, an achievement that's hard enough to reach. The fringe benefits are not really better. And what about the actor Luis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a high voice and an accent that sounds like a comedy, not a sci-fi horror movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are even worse. The creatures range from strange-looking eels to giant starfish and "mustquitos". The effects look like something you would see in a Muppet movie, and I do not think I need to go into the bottom of this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has achieved a slight cult status due to the terrible movies. I'm sure some will enjoy Endless Descent in some sort of Ed Wood, but I do not think it's that good. Everything he does is bad, especially the camera work. The man can not stage a film, that's all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> This was the last of four underwater films and it does Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad movies in their movie) I have the right to look masterful by comparison. However, just stay with The Abyss.
