Although I'm not a big Coen Brothers fanatic, I admire their dark humor films like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing'. I was much less impressed with her other comic book mode, the Dumb Camp (or is the Camp Doofy?). Unfortunately, "Oh brother, where are you?" falls into the latter category and is not even as good as "The Big Lebowski" or "The Hudsucker Proxy". <br /> <br /> "O Brother" is basically an episodic series of jokes without much sense. and not so much humor or wisdom. As most reviewers have stated, is the plot of the movie very casual? and as far as I could tell, quite arbitrarily? based on The Odyssey. His protagonist, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" like his Homeric namesake and has a "real" goal of returning home to prevent his wife Penny from marrying a worshiper. Of course, we do not realize that this is really the character of Clooney / Ulysses long after we cease to be interested. And what does Homer have to do with "Cool Hand Luke" chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan meetings at "Indiana Jones" gathering, an incorrigible vocabulary for lawyers, a talent for country country vocals, a connection with Baby Face Nelson, a hairdo by Clark Gable and other random and different characters and encounters? I leave that to others. <br /> <br /> The allusion to Preston Sturge's 'Sullivan's Travels' in the title 'O Brother' is equally pointless. Yes, viewers familiar with the Sturges classic under the thumbscrew fists may find it rewarding to acknowledge the title of the social-conscious depression film that Sullivan Hollywood and comedy give up in hopes. You may even be a little amused by a few shot / scene riffs (for example, bouncing of freight cars, and the chain gang mingles with a movie). So what? The Coen brothers seem to have nothing to add to artistic art as opposed to the morally high level of seriousness debate about the function of art. They obviously fall into the former school, but that does not seem to motivate the reference in the least. Is it a tribute? If so, why are we doing it? I like postmodern pop culture references and text games as much as the next person, but it's much nicer when it's at least something tonic, if not thematic, consistent. and not just an arbitrary preparation. <br /> <br /> This script is just a stupid mess. The only consistent and thoroughly enjoyable element is the folk / country music soundtrack. It does not have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the movie, that's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I would recommend using the ticket price for the soundtrack CD.
