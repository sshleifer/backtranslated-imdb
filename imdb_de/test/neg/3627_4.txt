Actually, I'm part of the demographic goal that Zoey 101 is targeting, so I can see that as much as she tries to relate to people my age, the premise is just too ridiculous for an average person to be could start. The show revolves around the most prosperous boarding school available, and the lovely, incredibly brown, attractive group of one-sided characters who inhabit it. As is customary in the children's networks, the cast consists of a series of thin white children, the black guy is of course to see. <br /> <br /> The storylines are all about Zoey and her group of friends, who created a kind of minor dilemma over or stumbling, for example because she does not want to attend a gym class, which causes Zoey to enter Program designed to save the day for all her friends. It is usually a B-line, either a one-sided guest character or placed around supportive characters in completely unrealistic situations, eg. For example, if there is a wasp swarm in a dormitory and nobody notices it. These actions often play stereotypes, such as any character who achieves good grades in math, by default has no social skills. The majority of episodes have the uninterrupted and overused will - they will not - they are Chase-Zoey-dynamic. The characters are unfortunately all incredibly one-sided; Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution for literally everything, Chase, the constant heartbroken, but still the best friend, Michael, the black guy (Kudos to Christopher Massey, who manages some really funny singles), Lola, the theater chicks (what means she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of fame, though she never does anything in the theater itself), Logan, the narcissist, Dustin, the little brother, and Quinn, the science freak. The few words I've spent on each of these characters summarize each character. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 sometimes manages to be entertaining, but the grave flaws in the value system he promotes are a great aversion. Zoey, who is set up as an obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and superficially portrayed as flawless, still resolves major character weaknesses. When, for example, Lola was introduced for the first time, it was assumed that she was a Goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to throw her out of her shared dorm to "crazy." <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it is clear that Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role because of her name, not because of talent. Although she has definitely improved over time, it is obvious that she is not a born actress, which greatly influences the quality of the show, as most of the plotlines are about her character. The supporting model is surprisingly good, especially when it comes to the material they need to work with. They provide quite a few good one-liners for the comic relief, if the plot has not yet fallen into the dark. <br /> <br /> All in all, Zoey 101 is a bad sight in high school life and for anyone who is up to something. Your limited too long years should not expect much from it.
