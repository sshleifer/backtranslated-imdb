This movie was terrible! Ashley Rose Orr, a talented tap dancer and singer (actually a bit better than Temple relative to the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as Shirley, whom we have seen in her films on the screen, regardless of whether she plays on the screen or on the screen. So what we get is an overly cute and totally unrealistic (let alone uninteresting) portrait. If you want to see this side of her, you can just borrow one of her films. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's depiction of the Gertrude Temple. I do not think it was very realistic, but at least it played well. Save yourself the trouble and rent The Poor Little Rich Girl.
