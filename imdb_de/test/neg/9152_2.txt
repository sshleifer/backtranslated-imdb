Based on a rather bland "bestseller," like most other Lifetime movies, this movie is more like a reenactment than an actual movie. The only difference was that Meredith Baxter was not there. The women in this field do not even age more than 20 years and acting is generally pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The characters were all clich√©d and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I would not recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who love the book and people who constantly watch the network think are great. I only looked at it because my friend wanted to see it so she would not have to read the book her sister had given her. It was not for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little in the end, so she did not find it as horrible as me.
