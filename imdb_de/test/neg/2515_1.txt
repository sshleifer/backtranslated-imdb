How dare you? Adam Low, without obvious shame, gives his name to this false tribute. It's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary on Visconti's work. Yes, it is long and brave, yes, we have some wonderful excerpts from the films that most people have already been interested in. But what sounds the longest and leaves the most lasting impression is the gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a third German actor who rages and rages. The appropriately named Mr. Low had given the instruction in the hope that I could imagine getting better ratings than his previous ones. Well, I have news for you, Mr. Low and your cohorts. You missed a great opportunity and I will not give you another one.
