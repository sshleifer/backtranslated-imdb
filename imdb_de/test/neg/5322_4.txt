An endlessly boring mystery thriller, which theoretically sounds pretty, but plays very badly. The ridiculous script is full of (MINOR SPOILER) people who die and then come back to life when the plot requires it, and the director does not seem to build up any energy and tension. The sticky sequence that somehow "explains" the movie's title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiring movie. (* 1/2)
