I received this little piece of Scuzz on the DVD label "Tales of Voodoo" by VideoAsia. Where the voodoo should actually fit, I do not know. In fact, I would not associate Voodoo with Indonesia anyway (let alone with WIPs). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I have seen most of them. I therefore could not resist this little-known gem from the description on the envelope. <br /> <br /> It's CALLING. You can not have a WIP movie when women stop their clothes (even in the shower!). Wip without nudity is similar to the exploitation genre, but is like a Big Mac without cattle. <br /> <br /> As my physical education teacher always said, by and large, I prefer to be in the disco ....
