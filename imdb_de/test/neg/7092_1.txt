Last time, when I checked, the Nazis did not win World War II - not that you would notice. After all, the Third Reich was pretty big at giving orders and demanding cold, robotic obedience from the people, and that's what we're dealing with today. But the way orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked through a megaphone with a German accent, they are disguised as worried advice, hovering under your nose every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper self-improvement, whispering in the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much, you eat the wrong things, you drink, you smoke, you do not get enough exercise, you probably can not even. * Beep * right, you'll die if you do you do not change your health will suffer do not you have self-esteem look at you make me sick I'm sorry for you I hate you we all hate you God hate you do not you understand it's so sad What you do to yourself, it's so damn sad. "That's the mantra. It goes without saying that the people who recite it are regularly portrayed as saints. Last year, the media fell to their knees and sent Jamie Oliver to a collective strike as part of his School Dinners series, in which he sat on the school menus for healthier food. Given the response to the slaps, it would be impossible for you to believe that he personally saved 5,000 children from the clutches of a slavish pedophile. <br /> <br /> The series was certainly a great success. In fact, there was only one downside to television: it was not repayable. Once you've saved every child in the nation from certain death, you can not really do it a second time.
