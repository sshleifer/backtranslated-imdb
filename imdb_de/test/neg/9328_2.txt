Well, after seeing "Start," I thought why the hell they burned Schrader's version and made them poor. But now, after seeing Dominion, I understand that decision deeply. Even they are not much better off. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story and some big storylines kill this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the exorcist story has a lot and in a prequel you can build on it a lot and give references that the audience will like to see. But there is so much of that in the movie. The effects are really bad - not even TV standard.
