Seagal was completely wrong with this movie. I'm a fan of him, expecting cool fight scenes and sharp interludes, but this movie had none of that, instead there were injections and cheesy music. Even if you're a fan of him, I strongly recommend that you stay away from this movie and watch under siege or even deadly ground.
