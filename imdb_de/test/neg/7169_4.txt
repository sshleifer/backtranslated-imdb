George Burns returns as the Almighty after being labeled "Oh, God!" In 1977 Had a great success. This positive fantasy was made successful by a sudden need in the 70s to switch from devil-controlled thrillers to comic redemptions (though they did make money) The original was more like the "topper" comedies of the 1930s than the return to a religious feel-good cinema Here, God appears to a young girl (Louanne, who had previously starred in a stage production of "Annie") and asks her to spread his divine word, which only causes her trouble for the grownups.A peculiar, family-oriented film seems warm enough and Burns can snap in with a wet, dry joke of jibes, but the writing is half slapstick and half serious, and the adults of the play are considering little Louanne All this makes God appear more like a troublemaker than an older friend. Louanne is another problem: a naughty kid with crazy little eyes she is not trained for screen acting and occasionally seems awkward. The medium-budget production has a dazzling TV movie appearance with few graceful accents. The last scene mimics the climax of the first "Oh, God!" This gives the mix a wistful feeling, which is welcomed. It's the subtlest moment in the movie. ** from ****
