[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is a very depressing affair, but unfortunately not in the manner intended by the filmmakers. Now everyone knows how it was slaughtered and published in such a sloppy, incoherent form. The second half, in particular, makes little or no sense, as plot elements seemingly be arbitrarily inserted and omitted. In the end, I scratched my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? That's what you get when you blame a shameless hack on a movie. It is not a nice sight. <br /> <br /> This is the graphically heaviest entry in the series. I have no problem with Gore when it's in the right place, but this movie takes it to absurd levels. The notorious exploding head must be a new low for the series. Michael himself even seems to enjoy the act of murdering another human being, in contradiction to his efficient, methodical approach in the John Carpenter original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who was responsible. Director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. It would be a great pleasure for me to apologize to all involved if they just released the legendary "Producers' Cut," a more complete version of the film, which is a tremendous improvement in every way. As far as I know, it's like a completely different movie. I offer to pay the full price for the purchase of the DVD when Miramax comes to its senses and publishes it. <br /> <br /> But there are a handful of good elements. The idea that Michael is controlled by the Druids is fascinating. Paul Rudd is solid like Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is well connected to the original. The smooth visuals help to observe the process a bit more. However, these meager offers are overshadowed by the overload of the tug we have to endure. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is the last film by Donald Pleasance. Many of his scenes were excluded from the final setting, and when he appears he appears frail and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, a blatant (if unintentional insult), if ever there was one. The fact that a talented performer should end his career like that is too depressing to even think about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (by ****) <br /> <br /> Published by Dimension Films
