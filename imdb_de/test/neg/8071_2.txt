I live in Rome where the Turkish director of this movie lives and works. I have heard a lot of good things about his films from my Italian friends. After seeing the preview, I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly unlikely and naive films. I love film, but this movie is really hard and bad. The main character is really crazy and should be locked up in a madhouse ... I was sympathetic to the negative character of an aunt who runs a dirty business that just wants to make money ... and I consider myself an anti-capitalist .. . so bad !!!
