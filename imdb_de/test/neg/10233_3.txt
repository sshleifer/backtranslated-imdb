I think my summary says it all. This MTV-like response to the classic Candid Camera TV series shows a Gen X-type (or this Gen Y-type) that wears fake choppers and wears different caps, wigs, and glasses, and puts people in rather fancy, often not very interesting Setting up situations. Example: Kennedy has a husband who invites his parents to his "wedding". Kennedy is the bride, dressed in a full bridal gown and a long wig. The "joke" is that the parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "trifles". The problem is that this lock takes way too long, obviously to save time. And Kennedy is as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have gone through three or four scenarios in the time Kennys needed, running around, constantly asking, "Do I look fat?" I know that the show was not made for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think that JACKASS is the highlight of the comedy today. So let her laugh. Luckily the show was short lived.
