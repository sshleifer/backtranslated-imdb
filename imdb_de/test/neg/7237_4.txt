I hated that the first movie is really boring and we only see the Octopus at the end. <br /> <br /> The plot Corpses are found in New York Harbor. The police have no clues or suspects until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuse to believe Nick's story, and soon the port will be filled with boats for the July 4th festivities Octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for the time. <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad the movie, but not great, but okay and shootable. <br /> <br /> There are really some cheese scenes that you can film, but if you pass them by, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
