How does a film become a biblical epic? Just quote a few scriptures and use some biblical names for your characters? The only thing biblical about this epic was the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot that the three kingdoms were also used by Israel, Egypt and Sheba. Where did King Vidor get the rest of his story from? It certainly was not from the Bible. It was complete and total nonsense. If you want to read about Solomon's reign as king in Israel, read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even meet Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 & 2. The Queen of Sheba (who is King of King Solomon after about 20 years, which by the way was long after Adonijah & Joab) was dead) can be found in 1 Kings 10 & 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things that Solomon does is one Affinity with Pharaoh by taking his daughter. Yes, King Solomon has dealt with the matter worship of false gods & for that reason the kingdom was split after his death and not the temple was destroyed by lightning. I also believe that Solomon was too busy marrying the false gods of his 700 wives and putting them at his temples and fighting his 300 concubines to fight Egypt, not to mention a dead brother was utter nonsense , If you do not use the story in the Bible, call it something else. That could have been called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
