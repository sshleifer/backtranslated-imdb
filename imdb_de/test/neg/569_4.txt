I liked most of the dialogues, I liked the cast, I found it well played. I especially liked Ellen DeGeneres' perfect total performance. <br /> <br /> What did not work for me was: (1) the lengthy affair with the younger man (too long, seemingly uncharacteristic for Helen)), (2) the seemingly endless cinematic clich√©s that are mostly visual but also endlessly read readings of the love letter itself (the contents should have a secret); (3) a young feminist scholar and, ironically, a firework scene (no wonder that reminded me of this dreadful "How to Make an American Quilt" movie); (4) the clumsy "Gotcha" police who smell "dope" everywhere (no stereotype there!); and (5) an intrusively romanticized small town setting. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred if the film explored (or even glorified) the source of Helen's bitterness more convincingly, containing much more of DeGeneres' character, eliminating or reducing the generations between generations, and to make life in small towns a little less critical. <br /> <br /> If the game had initially been developed as a game, perhaps one could have addressed this criticism before devoting itself to the material of this film, which unfortunately is extremely mediocre.
