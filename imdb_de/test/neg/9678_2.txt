Recently, I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie that took me three sessions over three days. This is another comment in preparation. <br /> <br /> However, what I wanted to comment on first was the negligence in the peculiarities of the DVD. It contained a memory game that prompts the player / viewer to pair pairs of animals so they can board the ark. Each time the selected animal becomes visible, the screen prompts the player to find "it's partner" (or congratulates the player to find). This is a spelling mistake, as it should be "its partner" as a possessive pronoun and not a contraction for "it is". It is an annoying mistake to be repeated 16 or more times to finish a game. Of course it's really a kid's activity, but it teaches children the wrong spelling. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, the game never changes. It is the same game with the same places of the same animals every time. Also, it does not hold any points like the number of moves required to solve the game. So there is no lasting value or challenge. It's just a feature that should be listed on the packaging. <br /> <br /> Put simply, there could have been more thought and care in this "special" function, just as there was more thought and care in this matter of confused film.
