This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA with Cliff Robertson. You owe it to invest a few hours and see the original. I found that this is incoherent and difficult to follow, with many scenes that do not make much sense. I'm not against film violence, but the whole thing seemed like an excuse to blow one person after another, many of whom were only marginally involved in the plot. While everyone else was killed, I wondered throughout the movie why Frank Johnny's brain was not just bleeding. He certainly could have done it and Johnny did not behave like someone you could trust. Another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; Why do these people have sex with their clothes? Should that appeal to us? Surely they did not believe that they had fired on a PG rating. Nothing in this movie, of course, seemed to play out. as if you were watching people in real life, instead, it got cumbersome and shallow.
