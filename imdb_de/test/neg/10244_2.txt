I'm not a movie snob. I liked a lot of movies that critics hate, and I hated films that critics love. However, I have to agree with critics here - "Galaxina" is just inferior. Clearly meant as a comedy, it has only a few isolated laughs. Galaxina has bad photography; it has bad special effects; it looks pretty bad; and the production values ​​... Well, the sets could just as well be made of cardboard. <br /> <br /> "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "The Blue Star." After a long journey (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew reaches their destination, a kind of wild Western alien world There is a painlessly listless Cantina scene (clearly designed as a parody of the famous "Star Wars" scene), a pursuit of space bikers, and a final outing. <br /> <br /> The Cast is trying but it can not breathe life into this turkey Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done a better job in other films James David Hinton is pretty good as a member of the starship crew The late Dorothy Stratten plays the lead role as a title robot and although she looks great, she does not give her much of a chance to act. <br /> <br /> Maybe you see Dorothy Stratten in this movie, but if you're looking for a good movie, sol You probably wanted to skip this movie.
