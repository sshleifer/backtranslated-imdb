I have read the 28 most recent comments from various people on this film and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with the "missing eyelids" turns the camera away from her face. flashes Yes, blind! I recorded it the way it appeared on HBO last weekend, and when I saw it, I literally had to repeat it several times, focusing on just one eye to make sure I did not see anything! After that, of course, it was difficult to take the movie seriously, although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give a 4, mostly due to the fact that the first victim in one of the last pictures flashes while the camera moves away from the body / face. Too bad.
