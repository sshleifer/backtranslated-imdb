... I can not believe that there are actually people who recommend this film ... This is such a slow POS that goes absolutely nowhere. Oh yes, OK, it goes somewhere, but you can see that from afar. Acting: Really bad, maybe the bartender was alright somehow. Edit: bad! I suppose the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes" because half of all the scenes could have gone to the bin. Music: Do not let me start, the thousandth score I've ever heard. Who is singing this in the last scene because he screamed loudly? Director: Oh my God, IMNSHO David Lynch is shit, but someone who tries to copy him is even harder. Skip this.
