Oh boy. Where do I start with this piece of mucus? This is one of the few real high budget movies on my list that I've actually rated for a rating of 1, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. This film has absolutely no respect for the account in the Bible and treats the whole story as a ridiculous fantasy. I could not recommend it to anybody except to see how low we've become as a company ... For the first, Noah was not absolutely friends with Lot. Anyone who actually read Genesis could tell you that Abram was the one they had thought of. The authors just tried to refresh the story with the whole Sodom / Gommorah subplot, and it seems inappropriate because it is them. Noah is treated like a prudish goofball ("They kissed, they kissed each other!"), But it's at least a step forward when Voight's comic action took place in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> However, these offenses are pale compared to the heresy treatment of God in this film. God is presented as an insignificant, incomprehensible being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("I am an eternal perfector, but I can be wrong") What? Where do you get that from? This kind of God ... No one should ever pay attention to anything, let alone worship, praise or love. What the director says, I do not claim to know. All I know is that a responsible treatment of Noah's Ark should not be so easy. Shame on these people.
