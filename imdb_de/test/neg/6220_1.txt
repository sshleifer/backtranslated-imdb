After completing this movie, I decided it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I knew it the moment I was exposed to three screaming and overreacted teenagers, when they saw each other again (OMG!) And then they saw the same thing, only women old enough to be my mother. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh Here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + ridiculous dance moves, complete with hip joints and superior costumes = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing out of a paper bag. Virtually no one in this kothaufen could do this too. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were involuntarily thrown into the incredibly fictional and stupid conspiracy. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I either huddled or sneered during the movie. And I usually like musicals. Of course they are a bit crazy ... but that was ridiculous. What a talent waste. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie ... I'm ashamed that this is part of their career now. I regret wasting my money and time on this crap.
