I saw this movie when I surfed television at two o'clock in the morning through infomercials and late-night 80s sitcoms on television. I have to say, I did not expect much and did not get much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performances and other performers' performance were, to say the least, not Oscar-worthy. This movie has its ups and downs and ends up with some nice twists, but honestly it was awful. Not even a typical Slasher movie. No blood, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad acting. I would give it 3 out of 10.
