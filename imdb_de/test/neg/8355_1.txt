This movie is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I am not referring to acting, but to the premise of both films trying to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Also, it bothers me when respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles because their status tends to reinforce the director's intention to raise the subject of the film, a social outcast. > I was in middle school in the last years of Caryl Chessman, and his death sentences and books were very much in the news. I remember the basic assumption that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Get people under control. Read the story. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. At night he drove through the streets of LA with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside, under the pretext of a traffic arrest; then the women abduct and rap. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can endure, and many victims say they prefer death to their terror and humiliation. Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it only lasted a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here.
