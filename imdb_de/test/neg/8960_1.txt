This movie is awful, I'm sad. I bought it to get Star Worms and I expected it to get better after being disappointed when I was in Star Worms. Oh, just a joke, it turns out this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Acting is garbage, not that there really are, and the main character is a big dumb box that gets attacked by likes, stuff or something. I can not really say it. The special effects are so bad that you can not even see the warlike dinosaurs, who incidentally do not wage war, but only stand and move their mouths or whatever those things are. The movie is a headache. It is obvious that the director is trying to create a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Really, this movie is just abhorrent, even for Troma's standards. The only good thing I can say is that it has a Lloyd Kaufman intro as it gets us to see something that is not fit for consumption.
