I've been in the entertainment industry for the past 5 years and most recently working for the company that made this movie, which is a shame because I like these people like that? !!!! That was crap from every angle. From cinematography to dialogue, acting, costumes and production design, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in the film looked as if they had been abducted directly by a porno filmed in the San Fernando Valley and had a set with an even less talented crew. <br /> <br /> I just can not overcome the fact that I'm sitting on the best material I've ever read, and contacts in the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and all roadblocks made possible? But the people behind this drama of a movie have no trouble matching it up and sleeping well after it's released. <br /> <br /> Life, what a journey!
