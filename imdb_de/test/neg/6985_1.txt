First of all, the initial concept of a lost fortune in bullion discovered in a New Zealand lake in a run-down World War II plane is a grand opening. What follows is nothing more than a cartoon print. Men chasing men, cars chasing men, helicopters chasing men, helicopters chasing boats, boats chasing boats, most of the time, the most boring nonsense, with no progress. Particularly noteworthy is the editing of the Chop-Shop, because many scenes were put together in random order. The actions of all involved are embarrassing. One last thing, the picture and sound quality on this DVD is so bad that you'll be horrified. - MERK
