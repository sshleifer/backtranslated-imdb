Robert Downey Jr. in a 17th century wig and gown was enough to make me shudder, but I could not believe that a great actor like Sam Neill was actually involved in the film. The whole thing was incredible. I especially like Merivel's "cure" for the crazy ones. They dance ... and hey presto! Everyone is happy and everyone is better! I guess I just did not like the character Merivel so much. So it was grueling to watch an entire movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon to a great doctor. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure, but I do not think the plague and the famous fire of London took place at the same time.
