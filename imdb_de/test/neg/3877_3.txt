I have nothing against sequels; Sometimes they are better than the original. Often, however, the originals are best left alone, especially if you can not duplicate the cast. One of the main reasons that "The Magnificent Seven" was such a hit was the very popular cast. <br /> <br /> This is hardly the "Magnificent Seven" if only Yul Brynner returns as one of the members of this famous man group in "The Magnificent Seven". Since six of the seven men were absent and were replaced by lesser-known actors, this quickly loses its charm. In other words, apart from Brynner, these guys have no charisma! It's like a championship sports team setting up all the proxy except one. <br /> <br /> Brynner is once again good: fun to watch, fun to hear with that unmistakable deep voice from him, but the story, not just the rest of the crew is lame. This movie should never have been done. In the original we took care of the "seven"; we do not care about it in here.
