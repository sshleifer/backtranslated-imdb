I'm in a film class and I know that I do not know anything about film, but honestly, this is one of the worst, dumbest, late and wasteful times. Movies I've ever seen and NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. both are equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting happens in the film, it's not really a heartwarming story and Pat Conroy does not get over it! I'm not saying that there should be fights and crap, but that would enliven this movie more than a bland movie. The children they would like to play in this movie may have been the right children from Yammacraux Island. They sounded stupid and could not act that far, which was a stupid idea for a book to me, and an even worse idea for a movie. I do not know why this movie was even made, unlike the five worst movies ever.
