In Los Angeles, alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a variety of unqualified functions just to get enough money to drink and play in horse racing. His primary and only goal is writing and having sex with dirty women. <br /> <br /> "Factotum" is an uninteresting, pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible, drunken tramp who, for a few days or weeks, will work enough money to buy ghosts and gambling because of his ruthless behavior was fired immediately. According to IMDb, this character would be the fictional alter ego of author Charles Bukowski, and based on that story I'll certainly never read one of his novels. If the viewer likes the subject of alcoholic couples, it's better to watch the touching and heartbreaking Hector Babenco's "Ironweed" or Marco Ferreri's "Storie di Ordinaria Follia" based on the same author's life. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum Sem Destino" ("Factotum Without Fate")
