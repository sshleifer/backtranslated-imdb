This movie had some funny moments. Louie, the main character, was well staffed along with a few other decent minor characters. The film's first shot set the tone, but the direction and story went down from there. Apart from a twist in the end (interesting and fun too), I wish that this film had a better direction and a more developed story. Without giving up the action, the idea is better! I just wish it had been done better in this short film. The potential was there, but the goods just were not delivered.
