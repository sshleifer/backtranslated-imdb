My age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is said to help Detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, solve a series of murders that have the victims crucified. Since Cole arrived on the spot, he realizes that the killings have changed a bit and believes there is another killer. It becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered and Campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. Campbell explores the mysterious Cole and learns of a very dark past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I like action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not fun at all, incredibly stupid, and Steven Seagal's acting is absolutely terrible. Keenen Ivory Wayans is not that bad. The only redeemer in this movie is the occasionally good action scene, though most come for dumb reasons. The plot in this film is absolute gibberish. I was not interested in it at all. The whole "shimmering" past of Seagal's character was stupid, all mafia fights and fights in the restaurant were almost without reason. Do not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: High level violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 of 100 (quite generous)
