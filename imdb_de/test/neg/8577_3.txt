This is a stereotype representation. A young fighter tries to compete if he is not ready and does not want to represent his Combat College. This leads to the separation from the Combat College and of course he finds a strange new master who teaches him to fight. <br /> <br /> The fighting is not high. They are way too "easy", so 1 + 1 is easy for any adult. The fighter has trained and goes into the ring, but does not do what he has trained and gets an ass kick. The coach yells this and that without success. And after a few more ridiculous blows, he suddenly does what he's told, beating his opponent once. This leads to a turning point in the fight, although our hero has beaten his life to this point. Think of the Rocky movies and you have a good point of reference, how many beats he really needs. The battles are also badly shot. <br /> <br /> The last thing that messes up this movie is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and uncomfortable moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys could have made really good conversation, but the director was no match for the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I do not know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating 3 out of 10.
