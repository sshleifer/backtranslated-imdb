A group of friends discover gold deep in an old mine. Taking the gold and thinking they hit it big, they wake up a long dead miner, Hell Bent, who protects his treasure. "Miner's Massacre" is a chintzy b horror movie in the extreme. You have all your familiar stereotypes, your group of mentally handicapped teenagers, characters investigating independent sounds, a couple of pop scares, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady, all of whom are crazy (played top by Karen Black no less) and so on. Nevertheless, it is done in an amusing, non-intrusive way that makes the movie entertaining in a "so bad, good kind" way. The characters and dialogue are what you expect from this kind of movie - familiar, routine and unoriginal. The actors are all doing a decent job, considering that I've actually seen bigger movies with a worse drama (I know what you did last summer, anyone?) And give the film a bit of credibility. The villain in this film (The 49'er) is obviously derived from the creeper of Jeepers Creepers, to the brown coat, the hat and the long white hair. Like the creeper he never speaks and is ugly. The Gore is a bit disappointing in my opinion. There are some pretty cruel moments, but too much is off the screen and the death scenes are often ridiculous (spoilers ahead!). There is a really funny moment in which a girl is beheaded by the said villain. To achieve this "effect," the filmmakers hid the actress's body under the villain's cloak, stuck her head out, and put down some false blood. Seriously, you could see the outlines of her shoulders! I think they could have been a little bit better there, even if the budget was low (and I'm sure it was, but still?). The special effects are cheap, but sufficiently effective and mostly moderate for a low budget movie. Either the effect guys or the director seem to have something for explosions and fire. In almost every scene at the end of the movie, at least a few characters are burned (always in slow motion) or something to explode, be it a car or an old grotto. Seriously, nobody has ever heard this term. "Stop, Drop and Roll"!?!?!? <br /> <br /> "Miner's Massacre" (or "The Curse of the Forties", whatever you want to call it) is cheesy and stupid, if entertaining, and as long as you have no expectations through the roof, you will be satisfied to chat. <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so I give 4/10.
