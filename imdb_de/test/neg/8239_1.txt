As I watched this episode, I kept checking the clock, waiting for something to happen. When the class was over, I thought they would really give us a big pop in the end and then - nothing. The whole family huddles around the Christmas tree like the Hallmark Canal and then turns black. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the poorest seasons I've ever seen. Nothing for excitement in the next season. The only incentive for next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris as he examined a sandwich that would find the guys in New York looking for one of the guys in New Jersey. Wow really? I would never expect such a thing from gangsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like they are trying to get everybody to lose interest. You start more storylines that just disappear in the end than any show I've ever seen. They tease and tap, but seldom deliver more. <br /> <br /> What about the Arabs who are in the Bing? They keep throwing them in front of us and in a magical way nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie kills a child after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and puffs in the wind /> <br /> And how many more snaking drug mounts with Christopher will we have to endure? Please, let him arrest or overdose or something interesting. <br /> <br /> This was one of the few shows I've always looked forward to, but now forget it.
