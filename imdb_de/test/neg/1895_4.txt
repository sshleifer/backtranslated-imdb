While the film was filmed beautifully and played reasonably well, the script was boring. plodding and nothing we have not seen before. Not once in this movie did I feel that these people were really in danger. No noticeable highlight and a very standard resolution. I think that this kind of movies was exaggerated and should be paused. Has not everyone on the planet seen "Schindler's List"?
