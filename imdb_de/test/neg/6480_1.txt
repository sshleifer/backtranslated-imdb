I hardly know where to start. <br /> <br /> Great continuity issues, bad spectacle etc. For example, Sam should be far away from all people, but you can see the ski slopes are cut into the mountain next to his mountain. <br /> <br /> But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Sam's thirst for adventure, which paves the way to improving the whole family, is not even touched. Instead, in the film, he is left behind by his family, leaving his wealthy parents to go alone and, when he's tired, go home. Where is its development? Where is the bow? <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book and can come by the hokey 60isms (double / triple / quadruple visions of the hawk) and terrific production quality (crackle, ahem, fire, winter) winds stop the howling for dialogue and then reboot etc.) I think it's OK for an 8 year old maybe. <br /> <br /> But compared to the sophistication of the book, it's a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
