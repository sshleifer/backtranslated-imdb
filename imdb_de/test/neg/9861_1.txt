What's over? Kasparov and the Machine would be best to immerse themselves in the psyche of Garry Kasparov during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. They see that he is becoming more paranoid and becoming more and more unraveled. All of this because Deep Blue made a move in the second game that seemed too human for his preconceived idea of ​​chess computers. Kasparov thought then and still does that IBM cheated. <br/> <br /> Game Over tries to be unbiased, but it's clear the director thinks that IBM cheated. However, they do not provide any real evidence to support the fraud, only hints that IBM's security in the vicinity of the computer room was due to the fact that IBM really did hide grandmasters who override the computer in certain important events, and Kasparovs Claim the computer did not play so well A computer usually makes two at one point in game. In Game Two, Kasparov played a game designed to cheat the computer, trying to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs had taken the pawn, resulting in a final loss of the computer. Deep Blue did not take the bait and Kasparov was so rattling that the computer seemed to be playing like a human, that he did not even see that he could have played Deep Blue and ended up giving up. This game got him so annoyed that he could not recover, and after playing games 3, 4 and 5 against a draw, he lost Game 6 terribly. <br /> <br /> The question of whether IBM cheated on everyone comes down to everything in this only move in Game Two, where the Deep Blue took the turn a human would make, but that had until then computers triggered. Joel Benjamin, a chess grandmaster of the IBM programming team, said in the documentary that chess computers always got out of hand in this situation. Therefore, he spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that the mistake would not be made by other computers. If you believe Benjamin's claim, the case is clear: IBM has not cheated. Unfortunately, the director went on quickly and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie. He preferred to intersect between footage of the 19th century Turkish chess game, The Turk, and Deep Blue footage, suggesting that Deep Blue was really controlled by one human being. As someone who knows programming, the explanation from IBM makes perfect sense - if you know what you're doing, it would not be incredibly difficult to put something into the code so that if and when conditions are met. in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that Kasparov created in Game 2 ever happens. This is not a cheat, it is a good job to program a chess computer. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is clear that the director thinks that IBM has cheated, and the repeated comments on the IBM share increase by 15%. On the day that Deep Blue won, this suggests the idea that IBM was cheating to increase the stock price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue with Enron). However, in both the chess and IT industries there are many outside opinions that Deep Blue won fair and square and lost Kasparov because he just could not pass his view of computers as "stupid machines" and was annoyed with them from a machine that did not seem so stupid. I just wish the director had let us see the alternative. <br /> <br />
