One of the few films filmed at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, AZ, in the late '80s, as well as Just One of the Guys, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and Just Perfect (a segmented film played during the Mickey Mouse Club ) is definitely for kids as the previous comments made it quite correct. <br /> <br /> Coronado has undergone a major overhaul in recent years and many of the buildings featured in this film have since disappeared. The field on which they catch is next to the football field, one of the few remaining areas. I think the inner scenes near the lockers were in the old building of 200. <br /> <br /> If it's not playing late at night on the Disney Channel, it may be a very difficult movie. How they ever did sequels to it is unknown to me.
