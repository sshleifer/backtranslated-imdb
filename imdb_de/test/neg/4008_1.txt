Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day a director on a street in Athens met a male prostitute and decided that the world only needed to know his story because ... you know ... he is robbed ... and he takes off his shirt a lot and ... and so on. <br /> <br /> This film is the result of its revelation. Repulsive, spoiled, homophobic, misogynist ... but of course filled with pretty guys showing their breasts. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, enjoy it if you do not like the plague. <br /> <br /> It is sure that I am going to Greece.
