We all know that special effects cost money, but it seems they could have used the money they saved on writing the script for better recording. The train is obviously a model in most moving strikes, the helicopter is obviously computer-generated, the alien looks like the end of spaceballs, except that it's a decade later and the spaceballs had an excuse The only thing they did was to blur all the special effects to make them harder to see. <br /> <br /> Not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they did not really try it <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time. You're welcome.
