Webs launches in "Chicago: Present Day," when four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas), and Junior (Jason Jones), break off the electrical system to an unused building designed for demolition is. In search of the relevant cables and things, they come across a series of doors that, according to the blueprints, should not be there. They are curious and all they force to open the doors to find a space computer and scientific machines. As they poke around with a few buttons, a portal opens up into a parallel universe, and Dean & Junior inadvertently intrudes on Ray & Sheldon, who shortly afterwards follows their friends. Unfortunately, all of them have landed in an exact parallel of Earth taken over by a mutant spider thing that either eats humans or turns them into mutated soldiers, protecting themselves and doing what they really want. In a desperate attempt to survive, they are working with some of the last remaining humans, including the original inventor of the Dr. Ing. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electrician boys (yes, maybe), could build another portal to bring them home ... Edited & Director: David Wu I thought Webs would be pretty shitty, it's as simple and straightforward as that. The screenplay by Grenville Case & Robinson Young is disgusting, to say the least. There are holes in which you can drive through a tank. For example, this movie really does try that some mutant spider things are not bigger than a few people size took in a whole world? How did you do that? If this parallel earth was the same as ours, where the hell was the army? The police? All our weapons? A few fragile-looking spider things against literally billions of people ?! The whole flawed, stupid and downright nasty concept kept bothering me throughout the movie. Do not forget that in the basement of most of the buildings that have been sitting undisturbed for decades there is an interdimensional portal to a parallel earth and in perfect condition, is not it? Then there is the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase. The fact that an electrician can make it run randomly by accidentally pushing a couple of buttons in a room that probably has hundreds on dozens of devices, and what about the wonderfully thoughtful one guy who's an explosive bobby Trap into his base without telling anyone what if one of his colleagues triggered it and tore himself apart from his self-made bomb? You would not be happy, would you? What about food? Are they growing in small vegetable garden? I could go on all day, looking at flawed, ill-conceived, and poorly written webs, but I can not bother me. The characters are clich√©d and annoying, as well as the movie as a whole, which obviously does not help. The only half decent thing I can say about Webs is that it's short and moves at a reasonable pace, but when it's all said and done, it's still crap. <br /> <br /> Director Wu has a big part to blame for, for starters the film looks cheap & the editing it is attributed to is horrible. There are many annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come out of nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical and quickly become incredibly boring. He uses this extremely annoying quick-cut technique along with a little bit of the old jerky camera movement. Now I do not know anyone, but I hate this editing style because it's just a completely incoherent mess. In fact, I do not know a single person who likes these kinds of things, and I'm surprised why filmmakers believe people are doing this. Forget about every Gore, just a few bullet wounds for the spider zombie soldiers, and they do not have any red blood anyway, so it does not relate to the reality in my head. <br /> <br /> Webs was made-TV, the American sci-fi channel, I think, and it looks just as cheap, has a low budget and is in a hurry, as you would expect. It's all so boring, forgetful, shallow and boring. The special effects are anything but special and the spider thing has no imagination when it's finally revealed. Acting was okay, considering everything else was so bad and I still can not believe the sweater that Grieco wore here, Webs is crap, I really can not help it when I say I've been eating worse movies and that's the only reason I can not get a star. A quick look at the IMDb user ratings for Webs confirms what I already knew, as there are more "1" votes than any other very good reason why ...
