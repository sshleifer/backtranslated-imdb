The movie was half over before I figured out what was going on. It is a dog breakfast from a movie about four thanksgiving meals for families. The clich√©s and stereotypes are overturned. When it's all over, it's ten hours later. Well, it seems like ten hours. I do not want to see a movie about the argument at the table. There are enough of them in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.
