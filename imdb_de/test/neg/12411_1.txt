No, that's sick. It is not sick. I really wanted to puke because I spent $ 2. It is boring, retarded and annoying. I did not see the MST3K version, which is shit because I bet the MST3K version is funny. It's sad that people are wasting money on this type of movie. I am amazed that it is not on the "100 worst movies list ever"
