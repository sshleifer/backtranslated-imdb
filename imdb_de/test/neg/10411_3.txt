A family (a teenager, his mother, and a stepfather) who is tired of city life decides to move to the mountains to escape from everyday life and make a fresh start. However, her idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who do not welcome newcomers in their midst. If objects are thrown through the window and threatened on the street, this is only the beginning. The youth decides to make matters worse by having a relationship with the sister of the terrible trio. Since the law is not ready to do anything about it, and the violence escalates quickly, the guy decides to take the matter into his own hands ever. First, you can enjoy some of the pounding acting and ridiculous dialogue of the characters, especially the over-excited villains. Then you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the sister of the thug who gets beaten up by her siblings because she dared to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole point of view of the women in the film, who are seemingly pathetic creatures that scream a lot and can not defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But of course there is the obligatory nude scene where a young lady dives under a very thin T-shirt into a pool without a bra. Who cares about the consistency of the plot when you have willing young stars ready to throw their things? Right ?! <br /> <br /> The focus is on the teenager, who was previously unable to jump without jumping, suddenly turned into a Rambo clone and blew his attackers left, right and center to save his stepfather, the one from the gang is held hostage. It's completely implausible, but hey, so is everything else in this movie. So at least you can not say that he is not consistent. Instead of trying to find logic in a place where the word does not exist, look at the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie, and so on. Note that a pattern appears here? Her career all hit deadlocks. Why? Sit down and everything will be clear. Remember, kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer. Please .. 3/10
