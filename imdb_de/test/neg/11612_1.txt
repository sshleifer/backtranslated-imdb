The plot seemed to be alright, the actors seemed to be alright, the movie should have been alright. But it certainly was not - it did not take us any further, the scenes are weird. Maybe it should make something new, <br /> <br /> think. At least that's what it did: where is the rest of the movie? For me it was a waste of money, time and talent. Someone wants to see this <br /> <br /> out of curiosity to see if they can find out. Others that I personally would not recommend.
