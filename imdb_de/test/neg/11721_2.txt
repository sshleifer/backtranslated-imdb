Ahh, nuthin 'as cheesy, explopative, semi-pornic, disguised as horror ... This one plays Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet, who also starred in "Femalien", "The Erotic House of Wax", and this family favorite "Nude Bowling Party". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinemas' line-up of talentless cuties starring in mindless, soft porn commercials. "Head of the Family" is actually trying to be a real movie. A cheater and a tramp try to say goodbye to the said man's husband. They turn to an evil genius with a big brain and a wheelchair, and his family of moronic outsiders using mind control to send out zombies to deliver his vile bid. This genius has a huge head, hence the clever title of the film: this is about the extent of the humor of the film. But basically it's an excuse to show the rich talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). With some of the craziest dialogues a herd may be involved (what the hell is "oat-plowing", is not it?), And just stupid, this titanic thriller will appeal to the Drive-In Theater's breastplates, but no another one says The MooCow The void, unless you are looking for a rent for tacky T & A / horror night. : = 8P
