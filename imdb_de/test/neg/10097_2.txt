Eric Roberts "Stars" in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut jail film. He plays the leader of a corrupt Guardian ring. Although he is evil to most people, he is the type nice enough to give you supportive wires while you are chained to the ceiling while torturing you with "Lethal Weapon" electric batons. The movie has one complicated conspiracy about corruption in prison, which makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's tiny eyes, Dolph Lundgren's one-liners, the acting abilities of JCVD, and the body of the tiniest man you knew at school, who took steroids after graduation shares that low point with Roberts. In the movie, it's hard to say if Kove's character is going to be drunk for the entire movie or if Kove just came that way. I could not blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for everyone involved, this movie has a "so bad that it's good" quality that can be fun when you have absolutely nothing better to do.
