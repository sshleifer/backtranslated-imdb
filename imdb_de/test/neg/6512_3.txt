A not so good action thriller because he unsuccessfully pursues the same water as the early Steven Seagal movies because there is not a very good standard. Steven Seagal plays the same type of character he has been playing Above the Law. In my opinion, the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average movie and belongs to a much better movie. Bob Gunton is fine as a priority. The best actor in the entire film is Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the movie reasons to watch The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the short appearance of the beautiful and voluptual Nikki Cox. It's too bad there were not more scenes with her in it.
