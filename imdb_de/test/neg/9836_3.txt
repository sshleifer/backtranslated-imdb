A young man named Danny ran away from home and meets a drifter named Bix, who's ready to say goodbye to Danny and pay attention to him and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl who works in her father's restaurant. Bix starts to meet Carrie, but he wants to leave soon (because he's a drifter, you know, he's not good, do you understand?). In the meantime, the city of Jesse (played by a perfectly cast Jack Elam) keeps sneaking in the diner and upsets Carrie. Danny accidentally gets whores to the left and right (because he's loaded with money, he's got nearly a hundred bucks!), Which Bix has to chase away all the time (there are many ambiguous gay overtones between Danny and Bix in this movie). Eventually, Bix and Danny decide to leave the city, but because of the horror, Jesse, brews trouble. <br /> <br /> My review of the movie itself: a terrible, dated "Troubled Youth" streak from the 50s. <br /> <br /> My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I have to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K. The riffing is dead all the time. Apart from the somewhat run-down ending, this film is a simple material for Joel and the Bots, especially Danny's constant mistake that Bix must rescue him from. The host segments are also pretty good, especially the segment with the "Train Song". Hopefully, Rhino will one day release this episode as a home video.
