The female hot numbers in this show are breathtaking. You can also talk as if there is no tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would quickly go to the bathroom. How much money do you earn with all the people who write text messages with the hope of being called back to win $ 100.oo or whatever? Boy, that's a scam now !!! Can I buy stocks in this money maker? Let's be honest, with today's technology, thousands of people could call every minute. And with ten thousand channels and nothing worth a crap, thousands of people watch this show. "Oh, I know that answer!" Is probably a very common line among the audience. With these super hot women who constantly say that 'Lounge' caller needs, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Often someone who comes through, surprised that he actually speaks with the host. Many of them sound depressed and exhausted because they have probably waited so long and tried so often to make some money. Wow, the producers just have to tear it. No wonder that there are so few commercials. Commercials are just temporary, to have more (mostly losers) time to text and wait and hope and dream and fantasize about it - what? --- win enough money for a tank and dinner at Mc.something? I only watch it now and then on my brother's TV because he likes to watch it on the computer. I sit 15 to 20 minutes and look at Mel (one of the tastiest women on TV) and laugh at the scam that's in front of me. Then I have to go; even if I do not! People who lead an active life can only take this show in extreme moderation. Mel, get into the movies or TV sitcoms or something. Many of us are in love with you! Even with the super-carriages I am amazed that this show is still running!
