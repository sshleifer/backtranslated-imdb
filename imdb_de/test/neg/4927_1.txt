Waste of 1:45 am This nasty little movie is one you should avoid, it's like a cheap, badly planned cross between Saw and a couple of other new films about abduction, why the author wrote this is obvious money , The twists were obvious when those who were in danger could escape, did the obvious and did not do it, etc. All right, I've discovered a new actress worthy of being seen. Peyton List There are too many better, more beautiful films than these that make you unhappy and less of the world think. Spend your time wiser, watch good movies, do some exercise, cook a good meal ... all, but waste your time with this garbage
