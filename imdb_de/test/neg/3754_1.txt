Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first, the premise tickled me - after all, a teenager who grew up in the Reagan era was worth a trip back in time. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'em Sock' em Robot? Loved them, not * despite * the fact that they were stupid, but * because * they were stupid and stupid and funny. When VH1 decided to do the series "I Love Last Tuesday," I knew enough was enough. Goes Hal Sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic Slinkys are. (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no, no, it looks like he's not doing it.) Snarky, nasty over-the-hip posture has its place, but already enough!
