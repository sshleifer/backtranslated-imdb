I went to a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I will not say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I was satisfied with every item I bought there before this article. On the front of the shop was The Bell Witch Haunting. (May I mention that this is the only place I've seen him for sale.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered that it really had happened. I was very excited and could not wait to see it. I had great expectations. I could not believe what I saw when I saw it. It did not look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I had the impression it was a horror movie. I mean, the movie was probably about a witch hounding you. This is not a horror movie. You will not jump from your seat when watching this movie. I've given the film every chance of getting better around the world. I swear, I did it. It never got better. There were several scenes in which this little kid was thrown on him and piss. I did not find that entertaining at all. I looked at the film in disbelief that the store was actually going to sell it to me. I think that's how bad this economy has become. I have to tell the actors and the crew. Do not show this movie as a material to get other movie jobs. Do not do it. I mean that sincerely. I recommend you try it. For people who bought this. I say that. Do not sell your copy to anyone. They could get very upset. I wish you all a good day.
