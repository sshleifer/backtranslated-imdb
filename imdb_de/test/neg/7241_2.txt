If I was five, I could find it terrible. It is (I think) a low budget movie. Acting is not good, but could be worse - the movie and special effects are terrible. The plot is thin and not worth thinking about. For boring screaming scenes too much time is needed. The chases or the fight with extraterrestrials remind me of children who fight with scary masks. A bit of blood and body parts - would scare a 5 year old kid, I guess. Apparently, some of the people in the movie scare the crap. <br /> <br /> It's far from reaching anything like the movie Tremors. <br /> <br /> This turns out to be an "incident". and we see alien ships near Earth. You wonder if someone will do a sequel ...
