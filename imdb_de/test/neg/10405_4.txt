It is another variation of the often told story that two people have to marry and share their brood. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGS ROLL, directed by Howard Morris (from TV), shows that this is a story that plays like a half-hour sitcom drilled to the length of the movie - but with a lack of laughter In other words, just the number of laughs that would have been possible within half an hour of a TV show. <br /> <br /> DORIS DAY decided to stop the movie after this movie - and that's pretty easy to see why. Even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast does not help. Brian KEITH, BARBARA HERSHEY, PAT CARROLL and ALICE GHOSTLEY do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have remained untouched for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said. Skip it and see Miss Day in a series of her more rewarding films.
