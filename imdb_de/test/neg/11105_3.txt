Seriously, sci-fi has to stop making films. They are all terrible. And here was John Rhys-Davies and he could not help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures Mexico's legendary goat eater, the Chupacabra, and takes him aboard a cruise ship led by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature escapes and begins killing crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go on the creature. But they can not stop it. So call the navy. You can not stop it either. Then the thing kills all 5 (or how many of them are). Then the captain and his daughter, along with another guy, find out how to kill it. Stay away from this movie. The Chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, the Navy men shoot at the slightest movement, throw grenades at the ship and the acting is terrible. 10.3.
