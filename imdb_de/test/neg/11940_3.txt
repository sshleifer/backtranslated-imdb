When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected a bit of fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a bit depressed. Honestly, there was no chemistry at all between the leads and the movie had little, if any, that was funny. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought she might have needed someone a little younger in the role of swelling opera music. I'm not an anti-opera, but I would have preferred that they spend this time to get to know the characters, all of them stiff and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed with this movie. All the while, I always thought about how much better it could have been.
