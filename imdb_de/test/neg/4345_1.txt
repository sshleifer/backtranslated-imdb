The producers of this film should be sued for misrepresentation of copyrighted material, particularly the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Handbook. Fear and ignorance brood the kind of mindless propaganda that inspires garbage like this movie. If any of you have any doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why not go to your local hobby shop and see how you are sitting in a playgroup.
