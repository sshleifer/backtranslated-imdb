I feel very generous when I give this movie a 2 out of 10 points. Okay, I've noticed that the special effects are "okay" and Renny Harlin has made one of my favorite films for Genetically Modified Shark Attack Research Station, of which you can know as the Deep Blue Sea. Also the opening credits are done pretty well with a remix of WhiteZombies "more human than human", and it fits in pretty well with what's related to this "movie". But enough praise, let's understand the reason of this movie sucks so much. <br /> <br /> Since Uwe Boll's "Alone in the Dark", I never had the feeling that the special effects in a movie were completely wasted. Okay, our story starts with four boys who are descendants of four different families. Each of them has a never fully explained power from an unexplained family background that traded a never fully explained wit witchcraft. For some reason, these offspring are all 17, everyone goes to the same school The swim team and everyone is sitting in bed with shirts off, sweating and talking to each other for some reason. I have nothing against gays, goths or thirteen-year-olds, but that's the purpose of this movie with ... 13 year old Goth questioning her sexuality, yes, there are girls in there in her panties or whatever on her Beds, but why do not they take off their shirts? Hey, it's only fair. Anyway, the characters in this film are told that when they turn 18, they'll rise and get new profound, almost god-like powers. But before I move on, I forget to mention that as they use their powers, they slowly age and become addicted to it. That explains why they got people in their late twenties to play the 17-year-old. Oh, and if something needs explanation, do not worry, someone will explain everything in a big dialogue. God, this movie is shit ... where was I? oh yes, the ascent part. Okay, apparently there was a Super Secret Alpha One family that the others forgot, or some s # * t of it, I do not know it had fallen asleep at this point. But some things have been written, and the new kid in the school, who befriends the group, is "secretly" one of those descendants of the Fifth Family. And I say 'secretly' because anyone who has seen one of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. He has more power than the others because he is older, I think. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (say it aloud), things happen and we come to the last fight in the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was all game for a witch fight. You know how Saurmon vs. Gandalf or anything along the magic battle, because it's about witches and stuff. Well, when these two witches throw down, it's more like ... how can I say it ... a very, very fucking version of a Dragonball Z battle? They throw things at themselves, talk, throw things, talk, throw things, talk, and so on. When I say 'throwing stuff', I just say that because I have no idea what the F #% k are throwing at each other. It looks like big drops of slimy water. God, this movie is annoying, when our main witch "ascends", he does not get very strong at all. He just throws bigger drops of slimy water. Things happen and it ends so that as a viewer you know that there will be an end to it. The good witch wins bad witch who loses. <br /> <br /> You know how shitty a movie is when the villain says such an incredibly stupid saying, "I make you my joke." I wanted to hit there. I got myself in the face because I was eating through this whole thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit, the idea that witches are fighting and using forces in this day and age sounds kinda cool, but if the execution is so bad, I really wish they would NOT make THIS movie , If it had been R-Rated, had had tits and thrown in more deaths with a dash of blood, it might have worked ... Maybe it would have worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing this, do not buy it or even rent it. Wait until it comes on TV or lend it to your friend of a friend who has bought it. Do not waste your time with this hack of a movie. If you spend money on it, there is a good chance that you will stand up for a sequel that Uwe Boll called The Covenant 2: Alone in the dark with the House of the Dead.
