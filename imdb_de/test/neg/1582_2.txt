It is inexplicable to me why every week two million Danes are sitting together for this terrible show. The dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simple. There is a hard man, a tough woman and a sensitive man. The authors actually say that they modeled the characters according to Greek mythology! Give me a break! All characters are of course brilliant policemen. When I saw this show, I longed for District Hill Street and NYPD Blue. These are brilliant shows and "Rejseholdet" is a lousy copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish television is currently suffering from.
