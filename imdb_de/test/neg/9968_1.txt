The only interesting thing about this movie is the theme. A look at the "family" of Manson from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. However, trying to understand the incomprehensible is something that can only be done in a masterpiece - and it is not. <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in a faux-documentary style and re-enacted. The problem is that writing and governing make it impossible to identify the things that make a movie look like characters, stories, themes, etc. Worse, there is an incredibly weak subplot that follows a small group of recent mansonites while they go after a reporter working on a story on the anniversary of the killings. It's stupid and pointless and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a great opportunity. The only ray of sunshine is the acting of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life did most of the killing. While the female characters in the 60s act as gigantic airheads, Pitman conveys real feelings. <br /> <br /> In short, do not worry about this movie.
