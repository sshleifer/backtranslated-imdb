Wow, I was told that this would be a B-movie worth seeing. I have the feeling that I was misled after this preview event. The plot is a twisted film version of all possible films. Even the title is a take on another movie if you can give the film so much credit. I'm sorry that I was brought to the cleaners. I would not waste your time with it. This movie seems to be a bunch of wannabes who, along with a borrowed camera on a weekend, had a bad idea of ​​a movie. Since I'm in the entertainment business, I can judge a decent movie, and this movie should be earned. My advice, stick to a classic like the 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10, even a 1 is nice for producers because this movie is BLOWS. (Below the limit of what sucks) The producers must stay with their daily jobs. If you are watching the movie, please be honest in your post, this seems to have been played up by a few people. There are some who have seen this and posted it correctly. Sorry, but I have to say that this is one that should be skipped.
