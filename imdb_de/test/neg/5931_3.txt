Kudos to Baxley's DP because this movie looks like a real movie was the first in this series (with the notable exception of the F / X scenes). When approaching the movie production values, most of the entertainment value of the first two lost. They were in the category of "so bad that they are good" horrendous movie entertainment. Can one argue that the "believers" simply tried to make a generic action movie by praying? There are so many times in the film that they reject their own belief system to be annoying. If everything that happens is in accordance with God's will and they are simply his tools, then the people who got the virus infected have that as part of their plan, right? Apply it to any situation where someone of faith does not submit to God's will, and you will receive a rather hypocritical little movie by the director of 'Action Jackson'.
