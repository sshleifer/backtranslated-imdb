One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is ​​above all too fat to be a novice firefighter. The NYFD does not recruit Pillsbury Dough Boys. John Travolta does a bad job at dyeing and the strange glint in his eyes throughout the movie made me think he was in some kind of extended Scientology bend. The plot meets all the tropics and clichés, as the average Joe really considers firefighter's life to be right: they all get drunk, get into fights, have trouble expressing their feelings, their wives are crying at home, they all have father problems Everyone has a Boston accent and so on. A disgusting piece of swarming, which after 9-11 on our continued cultural hero worship of firefighters - which incidentally was a valid culture heroes worship. Unfortunately, this movie does not feature credible heroes to worship.
