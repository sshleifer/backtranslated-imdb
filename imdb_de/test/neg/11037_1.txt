I have been reading comments on IMDb for some time now. An average of 8.3 for this movie just gets on my nerves. I do not mean any of these "I just signed up for an account so I can post in this movie" - bits ... but I did. The only topic you will get from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> Now I realize that many "hoity-toity" filmmakers love this movie. Nevertheless, it is crap. The thing that REALLY comes up for me is the fact that the director expects you to be sympathetic to the "bad guy" in the movie. If you have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast of society. Only my personal feelings, I think. Nevertheless, I spent 2 hours of this * explicit * game expecting some really deep reasons for imprisoning Dae-Soo. I tend to like a lot of foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean flipping and it was the last thing she put into my book. Oh ... I feel better after a small vent.
