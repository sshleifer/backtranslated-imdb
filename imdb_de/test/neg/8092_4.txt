All right then. This movie is totally funny, pueril, has gags from other films, has songs from other movies (Blink 182s "Mutt", Grand Theft Audios "We Luv U"), an uncommonly leading man, a ridiculous plot and lame movie parodies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Redeem functions? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough said.
