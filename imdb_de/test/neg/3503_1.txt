I am amazed that everyone likes this movie. I never go out of movies, but my friend physically had to stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. The white characters are saints and the Asian characters are virtually non-existent and worthless to the story. They exist only as objects, surprise. Characters of other races are much better off. The twists and turns were ridiculous and predictable. But if you read that, you already know that. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can not even make multicultural films. Do yourself a favor and look at a much more honest view of the race relationships: Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!
