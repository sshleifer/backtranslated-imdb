Film critic of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to moviegoers so they can choose wisely what they want to spend money on. But I have ignored your advice and have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see "The Cat in the Hat" was not accidentally hit. You see, three years ago, all critics said that we should all avoid the "calamity" known as "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". Then some of my friends took me with them and it turned out to be a colorful, fun and almost hypnotic Christmas. When the critics unleashed their anger against "The Cat in the Hat," another big budget update from Seuss with a big name in the title role, I thought it must be the same old song. How was I wrong. <br /> <br /> For five minutes I thought I was in the open air. The opening credits are smart, the kids are charming and the production values ​​are first class. Then the cat appeared. There are many problems from this point on, but the biggest problem was the unfortunate misuse of Mike Myers. Where "The Grinch" was rescued by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, "The Cat" was destroyed by Myers. He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. Any movie he really made fun of was really just a comedy sketch, from "Wayne's World" to "Austin Powers." So he's trying to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff they hold at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful. Not that the authors helped him. After the charming prologue, the film turns into an hour of disgusting physical humor jokes, ill-timed Pratfalls, and insulting restrained attempts at hip-humor. This movie was the most discouraging cinematic experience I've ever had. Period. So much talent and work went into something so mean. I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unharmed by this mess. I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will have more chances to show their charm in far better films. If you are a parent, avoid it like the plague. With films like "Elf" and "Brother Bear," which are currently in the cinemas, you have far better options.
