Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau are in their third film - YESTERDAY ONCE MORE - again directed by Johns Actioneer Johnnie To ... Fans of Tos action films will be disappointed that not a single gun was used in the shoot. , In addition, fans of Cheng & Lau's earlier films, NEEDING YOU & LOVE ON A DET, will be disappointed that YESTERDAY is not so funny or lovable ... <br /> <br /> Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) are a divorced couple ... both wealthy HK citizens ... both incredibly mischievous ... both were by chance professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather" .... A few years ago they divorced because they were unable to split the loot. Now she's getting married again ... with the son of a wealthy heir - a son of the entire mother (Carl Ng) through and through ... The soon-to-be mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious of Mrs. Tos's past and believes she's only her son marrying the jewels of the family - the priceless ruby ​​necklace of the heiress ... <br /> <br The necklace is stolen ... is it Mrs. To's materialistic eye that makes the most of it? ... or is it her ex-husband, Mr. To's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself? .. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about two people in love who fall in love or revive a love ... it's about two people who have always been in love, but somehow stupid to realize it. .. They allow pride and greed to overpower them ... <br /> <br /> Overall: YESTERDAY is part of a caper / heist movie and a part of homage to the classic Hollywood glamor of its golden years - ie Cary Grant and Grace Kelly's TO CATCH A THIEF ... Johnnie To is riding too much on Cheng / Lau's chemistry from her previous films ... hoping for Cheng / Lau's huge popularity and the fanbase will be the justification for this third movie ... I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most likable / charming entertainers working today. & Lau is definitely the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed her first two films and considered the Cheng / Lau pair to be comparable to the classic Hollywood couple of the 40's & 50's ... YESTERDAY, however, falls far short of expectations ... terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements in abundance, and all subplots and minor characters were unnecessary ... Come to think about it ... this movie was unnecessary. .. unless you've just done love celebrity ...
