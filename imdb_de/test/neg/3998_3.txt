Is that supposed to be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most wretched movies I have ever seen. Considering the fact that I bought it on the shelf "bad movies" for a bargain, it will certainly do justice to his shop in the store. What can I say, the Gore effects are sprayed everywhere (proverbially), some look quite real, some look like a teddy bear who had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. The music is one of the most frightening I've ever heard, acting is one of the funniest elements ... do I have to keep going? Do not bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop, and that's all that's left.
