This "movie", and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at eighteen months: "P.U., stinking shit!" <br /> <br /> Like this joke, this film can only appeal to very young, very immature or very stupid people. <br /> <br /> That means there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects that the majority of the alleged 100 million dollars was invested in are kinetically convincing - I mean, as compelling as these kinetic CGI effects can be. The CGI baby effects are not great, but I imagine they are very hard to do ... although they could be better for a hundred million dollars! <br /> <br /> Moose, the dog of "Frasier", he called in his usual model performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was good as Alan Cummings as a rogue we saw before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The actress who played Mrs. Avery was cute, as you expected, and Jamie Kennedy stank as one would expect. His best role to date has been in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) and Three Kings. He should perhaps stick to more subtle forms of comedy. He is not Jim Carrey. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction were worse than Kennedy's performance, if any. I half remember a clever (albeit seven-year-old) line that I'd like someone to accurately quote for the section "Memorable Quotes." Something about the costume offered by Averys was the "craziest bitch in Craptown." It was a joke of the second grade, but somehow weird in context. I give this movie a "one".
