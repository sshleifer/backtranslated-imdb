My only regret is that you can not rate a movie on IMDb with a 0. "A Cena ..." would definitely have earned that! AT LEAST. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? The film begins with a group of people entering a crypt to raise an old vampire. When a man cuts and his blood falls on the foul and dried corpse, which is supposed to be a bloodsucker, the metamorphosis takes place and the vampire acts in an ANIMATION-like effect (believe it!), Quickly becoming a more human form just to Show that he wears a tuxedo and a bow tie! A loop, yes. Red, if my memory is right! I tried to try random scenes by skipping a bit, but it did not get any better than the opening sequences. That was when I turned off the movie and cursed it for hoping to see a vampire movie. This is certainly not, unless you are 5 years old and could take such stupidity seriously. <br /> <br /> So if you like vampires and do not want to feel outraged or even disgusted, learn from my mistake and draw inspiration Do not even try to see this garbage!
