Debbie Boone had with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" The eponymous film by Didi Conn, however, was a terribly embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically stupid-secretly-vulnerable girl in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie wannabe type. They are engaged, but everyone knows that Zaslow will not marry anyone who is not blond and constructive. Therefore, only Didi is surprised when he lets her down. Needless to say, Didi is pretty embarrassed. Luckily, she did some songwriting in her free time and she has a tune that she thinks is quite skillful. She calls it - can you imagine? - "You illuminate my life." She jumps into the car and drives to the big city to sell her song and start a new life. Now I remember sitting in the theater and watching her hopping into the big car and thinking, "Well, Heaven, we've got all the explanations right now, and maybe something interesting is about to happen . "And something interesting has happened. The credits rolled. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. The movie was not only badly played, poorly written and badly shot, it also ended in the middle. This movie is really bad and we are not talking about cult film here. We are talking about an undistorted flop that is a true Jawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song anyway, buy a copy of it. But do not waste your time or money on this movie. This is a movie you will be glad you missed. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
