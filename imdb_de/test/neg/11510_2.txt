For the first time, I saw a commercial for the show when my sisters saw the Kim Possible movie. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing. It's one of the dumbest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like "Nothing is something, so technically, nothing is something". When I saw that, I thought there was another lame Lizzie Maguire knockoff from Disney. But I had no idea how bad. <br /> <br /> Fast forward of about 3 weeks when my sister turns on the TV. Of course, Sadie was there. What I saw was one of the most funniest shows I've ever seen. How did it go? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian tree-trotter, has an incredibly unhealthy, obsessive crush on the very monotonous and bad-acting Owen. For some reason, her friend Margret decides that Owen must be "tested" to see if he's as good as he seems. What exactly do these tests involve? One thing is that they put a cockroach on their notebook. Why? So that she can be squeamish and ask her monotonous knight in shining armor to get rid of her. How is this a test? Because when he crushes it, he is mean and callous and does not believe that mistakes, as Sadie says, "are also innocent animals". They spread disease and plague! YOU MAKE SQUISHED! But of course Owen just brushes it out the window and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margret says he has to be challenged once again, to something that "no man can survive". This is where shawls are shoved (yes, you read that right), and you have to buy it to see if it notices its big asses. Predictably, he does not notice it and we see Sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, wants to start a family with him, and as she puts it, "she lives like a wood duck with her brood." That's just wrong. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is the strangest, craziest show I've seen. For those who make fun of stupid stuff, you will love it. For everyone else skip this show.
