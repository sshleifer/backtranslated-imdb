I really liked this movie. Sure, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the rogue was the most annoying thing I've ever seen. Michael Bernardo as Dante is worth laughing for himself, with an incredibly funny slogan and wicked laugh. But it's worth seeing just for the worst explosion you'll ever see outside the Power Rangers TV series. You will know it when you see it. Honestly, this movie must have the budget of inferior porn. I almost stopped watching after an hour, but I recommend looking through the whole thing; At least there is a lot of eye candy for everyone to enjoy. Recommended for viewers with a high tolerance of bad movies.
