The basic idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not all bad. Acting is bad, however. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The torture scenes are without emotions. There really is not much to recommend this movie. You know what kind of movie you are in when the credits show "Special Guest Star" and list someone you've never heard of. Could also say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln". because in this movie, there really is nobody you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly towards the end, and I think the basic sketch of action may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to wake you up by this otherwise incompetent Yawner.
