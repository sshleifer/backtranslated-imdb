Another French film with absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and fuck. One of them is a pornstar who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend. The second is a hooker who kills her roommate and sees her boyfriend shot. After these incidents they meet at a subway station (both miss the last train) and then the whole thing starts. They find a border and come very close. They abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive through the country and have a lot of sex. That's really all about Baise-Moi. We can see that they have no mercy for their victims. They even kill a woman for her money. Both actresses are real pornstars in France, influencing the film in two different ways. They look so enjoyable in sex scenes, but they can not make the whole movie worth seeing because the film does not require me any further acting skills. It's a version of Thelma and Louise on a different level. I could recommend a lot of things to you instead of watching Baise-Moi. So, take a look if you want to see a pointless, nasty movie. * out *****
