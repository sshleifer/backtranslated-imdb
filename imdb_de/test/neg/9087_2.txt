Whoever compared with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, certainly knew what he was talking about. He might as well have compared it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "Kay Hoog" is more than reminiscent of Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, an epitome of the mystery - and the very first "Dark Knight" - was also considered one of Kent Allard. If you take Savage's name first and add Kent, you end up with Voila. Clark Kent. Funny, is not it?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog does not lie before the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more obvious and less "charming" than Jones's). Unfortunately, this two-parter is far from the following series in terms of overall quality (from all eras). One of the first signs that something is wrong with cinematic storytelling is a scene where Desperados on horseback, who literally sit on the back of their necks, watch as Hoog escapes from their claws in a hot air balloon. Why they do not bother to shoot the balloon is just one of the many secrets that plague these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. Granted, this was one of the first series ever and should therefore be a bit loose - but tolerance is limited. (Once the hero is not caught on the screen, but in the narration itself! Talk about corners and edges ...) Fritz Lang is one of the greatest filmmakers who has ever made films; Unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he has done, THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill to swallow ...
