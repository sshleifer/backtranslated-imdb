Strange, often effective hippie zombie streak with the unforgettable Husband / Wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby. While not as bad as most others in its genre, this movie still has a high profile. Includes several zombies with bargain bases, outrageously camping dialogues, a scene-chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay / kinky grave robbers, and a peculiar soundtrack. Ms. Anya plays a performance that is so strange that you have to wonder if she is really acting. There are a lot of worst pictures of this kind during this time (look for an Al Adamson movie), but it is not a night of the living dead. The director / writer "Benjamin" Clark is really Bob Clark, who then created the purcut "Porky's" exploitation disasters of the early 80's. Only after an inexplicably good movie ("A Christmas Story") he has surfaced again to return to his terrible ways with "Baby Geniuses". Spott Alan Ormsby later wrote the kinky Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell version of Cat People. Moocow says you should check this hippie horror movie for fun, zombie jokes and Campy dialogue: = 8)
