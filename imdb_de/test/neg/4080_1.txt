Was that funny? This is one of those movies that just do not work. The first one, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very funny moments. This one had none. Steve Carrell, who was brilliant at Bruce Almighty, could not deliver here. His performance is very ordinary and he can not carry it around like Carey. <br /> <br /> The good news is I only paid $ 1.95 for the rent. It's a movie for kids ... very young kids who have only seen about 4 movies in their short lives. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to know where Jim Carey starred in a movie and make her a sequel Without him, it's usually a big turkey. Does anyone remember Mask's son? (IMDB Worst 100 movies ever) Avoid this movie lover.
