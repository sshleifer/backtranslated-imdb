"Escape from hell" is not enough art to hide what it is: blatant exploitation. The direction and the writing are both sloppy: For example, the camera work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can hardly tell what's going on. Had the alcoholic but benevolent doctor not killed the guard, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the plan of "fake disease" had worked well until then, but he just had to ruin it. I would have given this movie 4 out of 10 points (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an incredibly beautiful face and body), but a particularly nasty scene of abuse forced me to score two more points. Of course, this is perceived as a recommendation for some patients. Even more disturbing than this movie is that some people actually rated it positively!
