I started to look at it because I thought it was a really crappy porn. When I kept watching, the only thrill I got from this movie was finding out what the name was so I could look it up and tear it up. I just finished it and thought about ending my life, knowing that somebody actually made this movie. <br /> <br /> For the people who have commented on this movie as a good script and good drama, my wisdom words for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie. You probably wish that you spent the entire time of your life producing this film. <br /> <br /> There is no way that this is a serious movie. There was an old man who was stabbed, and it did not hurt at all. And when everyone else is stabbed, they die dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important for these people to kill and indiscriminate people and to go with an 80-year-old man who wanted to put the pieces in his body <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found the "hemoglobal" or whatever you spell him because it made the film very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was that they decided to throw this random scene over the college girls who go into the woods and search for the wrong skulls. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to watch this movie, you should probably fill up in your bathtub and leave your hairdryer in it and get ready to jump. <br /> <br /> THIS IS A MUST SEE !!! .... for anyone who thinks life could not get worse, because this will be the case Make it clear that there are people (the creators of this film) who are even more pathetic and nowhere to go.
