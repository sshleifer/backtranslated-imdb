This is a really scary sci-fi / horror movie from 1957. Although Ed Wood Jr. and his horrible films get a lot of advertising, this turkey is as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is slightly better than in the Wood epics (like PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects were far worse than those of Wood! Bad movie lovers will be pleased to hear that it's so bad it still offers a great advertisement. Like a Wood movie, it's great to see and laugh with this crap party with your friends. The film starts with a scientist doing some tests in his jet. From nowhere, however, a UFO flies past and his report on the radio triggers a panic of the Luftwaffe. Later, however, they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and they believe that the scientist is a nut! As these planes disappear, however, they realize that something has to be seen. <br /> <br /> So far the movie is not great, but it can be seen. By the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. First, airplanes are constantly changing during the flight due to the terrible use of footage and crappy models. Some of them may not be disturbed, but with airplane enthusiasts like me, driving me crazy about turning an F-80 into an F-86 F-102 fighter-especially as the planes do not look alike. Secondly, through "clever" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a ball of fluff for half the movie! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally see it, it will be worth the wait. Well, no such luck !! The "Monster" looks less realistic or scary than the duck from Groucho's "You Bet Your Life" TV Show! In fact, it is far less realistic than one of the Japanese giant monsters !! In fact, Big Bird from the "Sesame Street" is even more frightening and realistic !!! It's just terrible in every way and could be the dumbest movie monster in history - about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE !!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely horrible movie that healthy people do not like. Bad movie fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! Everyone else ... are scared, .... VERY scared !! <br /> <br /> For your information - You may find that some clips in this movie are from other sci-fi movies !! I'm sure the crashed Washington Monument scene was stolen by EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, but I've also seen a few other scenes that I swear are from other films. What a hack job!
