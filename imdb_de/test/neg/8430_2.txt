I remember seeing this mini series in 1984 for the first time with growing anger and indignation. After reading the comments on this title, I have to agree with those of the people in Greece. Produced for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, this seemed to me nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic flag-waving American nationalism, glorifying American athletes at the expense of everyone else. Some other nationalities have every right to feel deeply offended, as depicted in this series. However, it may be helpful to explain how many American viewers behaved at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and the TV coverage seemed to be only interested in events that Americans would likely win.
