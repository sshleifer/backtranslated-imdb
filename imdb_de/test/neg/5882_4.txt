The Hebrew hammer is a clever idea because the execution is weak. As so often with iconoclastic humor, it relies too much on indignation to make laughter, which is just not enough. Humor with a bad taste has two elements - bad taste and humor - and both are needed here, but the humor is pretty scarce. As a result, it's often painful to watch, all the more because of the actor's good attempts, especially Adam Goldberg as the HH himself. The Shaft credentials are funny, but only for those who know these movies, and they certainly do not wear a Hebrew hammer. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that many of the jokes rely on the knowledge of American Jews culture, and many in the audience just will not understand the jokes.
