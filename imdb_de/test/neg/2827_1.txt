You know, I have no idea what everyone else's life was like, but that does not reflect the people I knew and left alone. And just in case you're wondering ... NO ... we were not a flawless / clean cut / Pat Boone teen. (If ever there was such a thing !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm NOT saying being a teenager is easy. The better, actually the best teen movie of the time is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Well, those kids I knew and were as realistic as they were then (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> That was crap. This was a low-cost version of Fast Times, and even then I did not care much. It had a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend or even say so, "it was 1982 for teens". I could not relate. The main girl (girl) did nothing for me and asked if they really wanted to keep their virginity if they had done so in this case this movie would not have been made. Pure crap and a bad idea left behind in the early 80's as a time capsule cinema for teenagers / young adults.
