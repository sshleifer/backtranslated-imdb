Deepa has again tried to boldly highlight a topic that nobody wants to talk about. The plot is fine, the cinematography is excellent, script and drama are far below average. I guess the blame lies with the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, where their original set was destroyed in 2000. This led to a completely different cast. Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. The current actress Lisa Ray (who in Bombay is just wind-blown Dyeing sheets) and John Abraham are pathetic and need basic acting lessons. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the movie as much as possible. The boy had done an excellent job. The editing and the flow of the film is not something you would have expected from Deepa. Great topic, sends out a strong message about a practice that is still prevalent in rural India, but does not meet the standards set by Deepa in Fire and Earth. Take a look ... if it's on DVD, do not pay $ 10 to see it ... Well, it's better than the average Hindi movie every day
