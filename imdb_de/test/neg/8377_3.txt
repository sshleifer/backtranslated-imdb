This movie looked funny on the cover and I honestly thought, "How bad can that be?" I did not know it. Outside the gate, the dialogue was UNBEATABLE. It was unrealistic and not even interesting. The dialogue in UPN syndicated TV broadcasts sounds more natural. The story was not plausible and had almost no playoff at the end. The end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. The only remotely interesting character is Rose McGowen, who is dumb, which prevents her from being ruined by clich√©d garbage dialogues (at least to the end when she has to speak for herself). The only thing that gives this 3 even a 1 or 2 is Rose McGowen's nude scene. Really terrible. Save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a Barney video.
