I rented this movie because I'm a big Dudikoff fan. I thought it could not be that bad. Boy, I was wrong! At the 15-minute mark, I started with the others to rip out the DVD and throw it back in rental, but they refused. They swore it had to get better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! Everything was missing in this film. The actors provided their productions with as much feeling as a comatose rock! The conspiracy was ridiculous and I was offended that the people in Hollywood were so stupid that they enjoyed it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T is one of his worst performers here. <br /> <br /> After watching shots of the fake plane, bad guys getting up to get shot, and clips being emptied and missing everything, I wanted to scream and hit my head on concrete. The film reached its plateau of ignorance when people on the space station used a lift to travel. Space suits are not required and there is gravity in space, regardless of what real astronauts can say. <br /> <br /> I did not finish this movie and I hated it. I do not want to end this movie. This is a slow suicide. I could feel my cerebral cortex avenge the torture I went through.
