Impressive! After the first five minutes of seeing this "movie," I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life. It's really hard to describe exactly what this movie is about. I honestly do not know what kind of human being would finance an excrement at all. The movie seems to have been shot on video or 16mm. Usually I have no problems with SOV movies. I only made 16mm movies, but that was just so awful. And where did you find these "actresses"? I have seen bad acting, but that costs the cake. Look at the first 5 minutes and you will see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this God terrible mud. This was the worst movie I had ever seen. I want my 74 minutes back! If you can sit the first 5 minutes without shooting the TV or committing mass murder, take a shot. What have you got to lose?
