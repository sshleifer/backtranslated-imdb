This movie was boring. Similar to Underworld, only less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and not near a horror movie. The main couple was boring. I did not care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I did not care about a role in the movie. The plot was as thin as paper. The transformations were basically zero. I liked the wolves myself, might as well have done a Wolfs documentary, I would have liked that better. I would not recommend this movie. I did not find it funny or interesting. It just tightens and everyone in it is boring. This movie could win a prize for not making a waswolf movie.
