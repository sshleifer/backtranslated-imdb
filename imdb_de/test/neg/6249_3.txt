When Jim Wynorski announced for the first time that he would make a new sequel to my favorite series of all time, the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, I was thrilled. I had been waiting literally for years for a new rate. So the production started and very small pieces were turned from the shoot, and the actors involved were released until the shoot was done. Then the announcement of a title is changed. This new sequel should no longer be referred to as "Slumber Party Massacre IV" but as "Cheerleader Massacre". I was a bit disappointed, but to have another title would be a very low price for a movie I had been waiting for so long. I was still very fascinated and on the edge of my seat to see it. <br /> <br /> A month ago, some very sophisticated copies of the movie were made available to some extremely lucky audiences who watched the movie months before the release date. A few critics leaked and judging by them, I became concerned about Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre". Tonight I watched the movie for the first time in full length and I still scratch my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely NOT a new part of the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a Slasher effect. And a bad one too. <br /> <br /> Before I get into the details of the movie, let me first say what a big fan of Jim Wynorski's films I am. I've always considered him a true genius and a winner almost every time. Yes, his films are low-budget and do not include the finest acting, but they are still fun. They are what they are: combat films that you see when you want to have a good time. From "Sorority House Massacre II" to "Hard to Die" to "Chopping Mall", Jim has produced the goods more than once. One of the reasons why I was excited that this movie would be his last project. <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" does not reflect (in my opinion) any of the films I've seen in this director / writer's past. Firstly, the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape, something I had never seen before. The actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost ridiculous. The murderer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandfather than of a runaway madman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is littered with female nudity. This is a Jim Wynorski movie we talk about, folks. But some of the boob shots you see here seem to be done almost for the time being. There is an extremely long shower scene in which the cheerleader coach is apparently going on forever, reflecting a shower scene in Jim's "Sorority House Massacre II". The girl bathes almost in the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely clich√©, to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in HUNDREDS past Slasher movies. A guy and a girl who are hiding, about to make their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are hacked to pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, whom I've never really considered a tremendous actress, also gives one of her stiffest and most forced performances in her little cameo. We're talking about possible maps here. She recalls some of the incidents her character has experienced through the murderer who was seen here in front of the police twenty years ago, while footage of the original "Slumber Party Massacre" is being played. Why was material from the original film used if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions in this film, of which I'm almost certain that they were recycled from other films. <br /> <br /> This film not only recycles FOOTAGE from previous films, but also the results of other films. Some of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was previously recycled for "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the movie. There are also at least two others that I can not identify, but I'm sure they've been used before. After having sat through the horrible drama, the ridiculous story of this movie, non-existent gore / special effects and the camcorder Like the quality, I have serious concerns about Mr. Wynorski's career. Has the man who has thrilled the audience with films in the past lost his niche for good? Only time can tell. Oh, and let's not forget his latest movie. A new episode in the movies "Sorority House Massacre" titled "Final Exam". I think I see a pattern here ...
