I can not give it under a star, I tried. Right now I'm not sure if I'm halfway through or not, but I stopped being active when part of it turned out to be a dream. Or not. Or maybe yes? I think viewers who posted a comment that did not contain the words "awful" or "awful" or "made to swallow a ball" are probably nice because it's an indie movie. Do not listen to them, listen to me - there is no nudity in the movie, skip it. It took me ten lines to file this warning. I'll also say that the goth girl some users have called "hot" is fat. She has thick elephant legs.
