This movie is so bad that he can not believe it. Even for an independent low-budget movie ... it's just good. I can not believe that even Troma would bring such a crap out. I've been a fan of some Troma movies for years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampires, just to name a few). But, LLoyd, come on, this goes way beyond the boundaries of every taste. It offers some of the worst spectacles you can think of unemployed street people who could have been just as good ... oh, wait, they did. I mean, these characters have a negative impact. With a bit of luck, the producer and the director of this movie will have a great karmic debt like the special effects people. But apart from the terrible acting and the terrible special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic for the ear. The worst part is that it's not entertaining in the least possible way. And that's the most unforgivable sin in filmmaking. But do not take my word for it. Go get out and waste four dollars renting them. Just do not say I did not warn you.
