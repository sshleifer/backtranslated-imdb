I rented this movie because I love to see things in it with Lauren Graham. Well, she was the highlight. Everyone else seemed to be separated from the picture. You kept looking around while you watched the movie while you go, huh? However, she did provide some clarity, as she was the only normal character in the picture, which does not really mean much for the movie. Personally, it was too far-fetched for me. However, I am glad that I have rented, although I never want to own it. I still have the feeling that Lauren Graham was a strong actress, and even thought she was not the main character, she seemed to steal the film. My husband and I were happier and more concerned with their character, which ended with Josh's character, than with the two main characters.
