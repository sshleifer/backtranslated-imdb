Ok, I'll make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie. Everyone knows the ratings of the Motion Picture Association of America: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. For the purposes of this film, I think the MPA should create a new standard of evaluation: IQ-20.
