Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent movie, but I have some problems with this movie. First, I do not blame the actors in this movie, but more or less I have a problem with the script. I also understand that this film was filmed in the 1930s and people wanted to escape reality, but the script made Ann Sothern's character look weak. She kept going back and forth between the applicants, and I felt she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He was really interested in her and her family, and did everything for her, and he did it by giving her up in the end to annoy Neil Hamilton, who in my opinion was just for a good time. Paul Kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and really loved Kitty (Ann Sothern), unlike Neil Hamilton, though he loved her, I did not see the depth of love he had for her character. The production values ​​were great, but the script could have needed some work.
