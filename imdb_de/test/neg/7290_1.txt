I wish I could say a few good things about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) of Atlantis: The Lost Empire, but that would be a very short comment. The magic that had the first one is nowhere to be found Here the animation is pretty bad, the characters themselves are not very well drawn. Also the backgrounds and the foreground are not good. There is very little attention to detail here. Instead of a captivating and compelling story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and do not make much sense. I swear, even the characters sounded boring and would rather be somewhere else. What says the speakers are bored and wanted to be somewhere else That's the impression. Some of the same actors return for this grim effort, but an integral part of the success of the first was Michael J. Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch. I have the distinct impression that this film has just been thrown together from the success of the first without you much thought or worry. But at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of "Kida". That's probably the only good thing about this movie, and even she does not seem to have her heart in it. I think you think you could not blame any of the performers for not having given everything, considering what they had to work with. Or rather not with. This is a direct video (and I use the term loose), which should have gone straight to the nearest landfill. Anyway, be ashamed of Disney. Consumers earn much better than this. This one gets a 0/10 and a well deserved on the .pu
