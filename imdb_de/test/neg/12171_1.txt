When this series aired, I saw most of it. I think it should be a long series in the series of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk," in which the protagonist is chased around the country to find a solution to his problems. In this case, the hero's problem is the reverse progressive aging. I liked what I saw from these shows. The acting was good, especially the sad relationship between the main character and his wife. Problem is, they canceled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They also had no chance to complete the story because they knew it had been canceled. Poof was just gone. As I said, I might have missed the last episodes. But my proof is the opposite: I borrowed the tape. Where I left off in the series. The main character's wife dies in a fire triggered by a chase between King's famous The Shop organization. While leaving hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing that they need to rescue him from the shop. The end. Last episode. Video: His wife does not die, but escapes with him the fire. The moment he should be touched by the shop, he and his wife share a strange moment and then go out of existence. Abrupt, stupid and extremely cheap. They just wanted to kick that video out and decided to mark an end that did not care how bad it was. You might as well show a few shots of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The show had a cool opening title sequence for the eponymous David Bowie song
