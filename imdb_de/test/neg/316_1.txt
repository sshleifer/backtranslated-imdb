Warning Could contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I spent only $ 5 on this movie on Amazon and wish I had never spent it. I've never seen sucking terrible affects or acting. I mean, Jack-0 is just a ridiculous monster and his costume looks like something you can buy in a Halloween shop or make yourself. Acting is just awful, especially Sean Kelly. I mean, come on, he's so pathetic with his little lines. I mean, the movie is so awful that he had to put in a few minutes of nudity, just so people would not turn it off. I think the most ridiculous scene is when the woman puts a butter knife in the toaster and gets an electric shock. I mean, come on, that looked so phony and the pacifier I could buy in any Halloween store or do it myself. Well, I recommend not to watch this cheesy movie, as it is time to never come back.
