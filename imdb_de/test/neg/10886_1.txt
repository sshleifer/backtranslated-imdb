I can not say it easier, this is a horrible movie. I've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so my standard is pretty high, but seriously, I absolutely hate this movie. I have not commented on IMDb yet, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to come and warn others. It's a piece of sh * t. The writer / director is an idiot who simply has no idea how to make / write a good movie and has the writing skills of a teenage teenager. The characters are unrealistic (The lead actress does not think about using the policeman's gun, but is resourceful enough to improvise a Molotov cocktail ... please ...) and not even sympathetic. I do not understand what the director was trying to do with his demonic Redneck idea, but it just looked like sloppy writing and practical bullshit without any real thought coming to me. This is the officially worst movie I have seen EVERY YEAR. Congratulations, Shiban, you are now ranked with such greats as Micheal Bay in the prestigious "rank" "It should not be allowed to waste millions of dollars on creating a movie club." I hope you really read that. And the 163 idiots who rated this film 10 out of 10. Oh my god, I hope a redneck demon pops up behind you and tortures you.
