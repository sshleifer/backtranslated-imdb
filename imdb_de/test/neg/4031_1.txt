That was so bad that I had to shut it down in the end. I have never seen such a pathetic movie. I love B-movies and was looking forward to more of the same movie, but unfortunately was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This has the worst drama / storyline / directing / writing etc of anything I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to all who think or watch, buy, rent, do not go there!
