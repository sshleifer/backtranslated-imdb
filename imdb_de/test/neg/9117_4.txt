The critics were like "a movie that will break your heart," etc. A friend of mine and I had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie to others about the content. This movie tries to touch you to reach your heart. But it fails. At least for me. And also for my friend. Everything that happened happened just on the screen. It was always there, not here where I am. I thought most of the time "hmm, something happens on the screen, but it's just on screen, it's not real."
