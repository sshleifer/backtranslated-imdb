If you can overcome the slow start and the bad spectacle, it is worth a look. The story was pretty decent. The father had a bad temper because he was unemployed and he could hardly see his child in the summer because his ex-wife had custody of him. The father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster in the story was not too scary. The movie breaks the permanence of the monster, which is so incredibly strong. The only scene in which the filmmakers do this is one of the situations in which the child is in the basement and the monster attacks him. When the monster attacks the boy, his arm falls into a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is about one foot away from the child's face. Throughout the movie, the monster is strong enough to break or break everything. But the steel trap and chain prevents him from getting the child! More than likely the filmmakers have done this for the shock factor because no one wants to see one of the main characters die. The filmmakers just wanted to scare us with the thought that the child might die. Instead of breaking the consistency, the filmmakers should have replaced the child with someone they could dispose of!
