Anyone who grapples with PC culture is appalled by the dogmatic Christian view of the film, claiming it contains racist ideas and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who do not care but who are geared towards smooth production values ​​and competent action are shocked by the lack of such dismay. <br /> <br /> Those who suspect both are of the opinion that this production was released in public, as shown in the comments here. <br /> <br /> What is an interesting premise that is not original, but a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND is treated in this film in a rather immature way, but with enthusiasm. What the crew and the actors lacked in sensitivity, professional skills and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they show. <br /> <br /> It's not nearly as bad as many think here, and would have been fine hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it's below mediocrity enough to elicit laughter and groan. However, it unfolds with enough intensity to consistently maintain interest, and is roughly comparable to a Corman-produced entry from his earliest working hours or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you got it for $ 2 (or less) like mine, you will not feel disappointed, but would wish you could have a say in how it was done.
