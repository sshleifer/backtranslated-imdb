This is really an exhaustive exercise. Disguised as a tribute to firefighters, it contains stupid scenes of "We're just a bunch of crazy guys" in the midst of "Geez, that can be really dangerous". Mostly it's just stupid. One could not believe for a minute that real firefighters act that way. It's so terrible that I could not stand watching sometimes. If my daughter had not rented it and insisted on keeping it to the end, I would have no choice but to turn it off. Every interview I've seen just raises my opinion about him. I think that was just for the money. I am sure he will be happy if he is forgotten.
