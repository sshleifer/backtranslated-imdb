The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who imagines he will become a writer someday, if he really tries. Presumably, this film is the years in which he receives his material for writing, the adventure years, hence the title and the previous quote. In it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a slight twist here, which is very interesting, and that's when Sebastian's stepfather (Clark Gregg) makes the big decision early on to make a sex change that has a big impact on Sebastian's family and relationship with his move has -Dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather, and he is very good in the role, very credible, without being over the top. This is a path that this movie could have taken relatively easily. Luckily they did not do it. Adrien Grenier, whom I know only from Entourage, is also very good in his role as Sebastian and he and Gregg have a great relationship on screen. It's always intriguing to watch these guys (?) Relationships as they develop and sometimes are really heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And that's the best this movie has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it some mediocre camera work, directing and camera. It is not bad, but it is far from being good or memorable in the least. The characters are also spelled thin, and it's clear from the beginning how most bows will swing out. The only truly fascinating character is Clark Greggs Hank / Henrietta. I've already said that Grenier played well, but the character of Sebastian is not only not captivating, but absolutely unlikely. I honestly do not understand why someone in the audience directs his character into anything he does. He hops, whines, cheats, lies, and lacks something other than complete lethargy. It would be different if he was perhaps a minor character or a comic relief, but to have him as the main focus and asked to take the character seriously? Come on. <br /> <br /> And I do not really think so, but I just want to say ... Choose a different song in all these movies, Hollywood! No "where's my mind" from the Pixies anymore, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in any other movie! <br /> <br /> I feel as if I could tear this movie apart, but honestly, I hate it. I just did not really care and I would not recommend it to anyone. The adventures of Sebastian Cole are not a bad or boring movie, but also not a very good or captivating movie. It is very uneven and the script would have needed some work. I think the purpose of the film is to take a loose look at a writer's life before he did it, and it worked ... if this writer brought out pieces of fiction that I did not want to read.
