Okay, maybe the acting was not bad, but I'm writing this review as a public service to keep everyone else following the intriguing beginning of the movie from throwing away two hours of their lives and waiting for a plot never to be in the game Location is coming. The chief investigator has a good feeling of who has abolished the missing naval officer (Guy) and few other persons as uninvolved spectators and the prosecutor appear to dispute them. What's the point of staying with this drama? Damn it out of me. I kept thinking (or hoping) that there would be some kind of twist or new revelation, but none came. In conclusion, I can not imagine a single reason to sit this pointless television movie based on a true story or not.
