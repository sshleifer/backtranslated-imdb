If you are a fan of the original series, you DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical when Aeon expressed her motives for murder. In the series, Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures beyond selfish interests. Obviously, the responsible chimpanzee author thought the film was necessary for "bad grrl" demographics by killing the character, but he had a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You did not think so, but the movie is two-dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all well represented by nature, with a conflict of interest that will eventually be resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and every character who dies in this movie has the same thing. <br /> <br /> The selfish, twisted, perverted, dominating personas of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. In the end, they literally become a cute couple ala Annie Hall. The only character who stayed true to the show was the Relicle, the hovering machine in the sky. I suppose, if you've ever thought, "I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it was more like any other faceless good-v-evil sci-fi movie that Hollywood has out here," then you've got something good , <br /> <br /> You did not even get the right look. I suppose a Black Metal bikini was asking too much, but the whole thing is wrong. 400 years into the future certainly looks like 30 years into the past. Instead of a clearly urban post-apocalyptic world, the eyes of the beholder are injured with a 70s Mod squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood-paneled walls, earth tones and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Bregna, this is the only city in the world according to the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the film, the "Monicans" are just Hollywood freedom fighters. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case on the show. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real author of this movie was a high school kid and that he wrote it the day before it was because of the studio manager, and he has never had a whole Aeon flux seen. The overwhelming amount of contradictions with the cartoon is confusing. In addition to using specific names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the movie is in no way comparable to the show. Blade Runner, Logan's Run and Grave Robber, who produced a boring brown mess.
