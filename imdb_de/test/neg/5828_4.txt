All in all, this is a movie for kids. We saw it tonight and my child loved it. At some point, my child's excitement was so great that you could not sit. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books, which are very subtle and hide a dry intelligence behind the childlike quality of their main characters. This movie was not subtle. It seems a shame that Disney may not realize the benefit of making movies out of more of the stories contained on these pages, though it may not have permission to use them. I wish I wished the theater would play "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger" instead. The character voices were very good. Kanga really only disturbed me. However, the music was sometimes twice as loud as the dialogue, and did not match the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the story, she was a bit preaching and militant in tone. Overall, I was disappointed, but I would go back to see the same excitement in my child's face. <br /> <br /> I liked Lumpy's laugh ....
