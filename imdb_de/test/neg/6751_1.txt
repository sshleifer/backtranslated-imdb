that was pretty bad. Pedestrian work or worse. I do not think it was homophobic, just bad. If anything, it was really amateurish, like when you're 14 and you discover cursing words and skin mags for the first time. <br /> <br /> The main point of this movie, the romance, is really flat. I can not help wondering if the authors ever had any serious relationships before this movie. <br /> <br /> Plotting and tempo are terrible and go nowhere. In a minute we watch these guys catch scammers, then we're in a gay club, then we're on a date. From nowhere the girl seems to like comics, and then they sleep together. None of it feels real, like a Shakespeare elementary production, when Hamlet was written by a lad boy. <br /> <br /> The ending was a kind of spooky revenge fantasy of a loser who was laid off by a loser girl. Needless and somehow disturbing. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, you have to look at it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the director's commentary is actually funny - what kind of expert talk about "hitting" or "pairing" with the actresses? The dialogue was bad, the relationships lacked the chemistry. They will be on the ground, laughing at this presumptuous donkey.
