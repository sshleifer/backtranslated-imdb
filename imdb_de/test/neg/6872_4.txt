Jealous husband keeps dealership hostage, while Williams burdens the viewer with his worn-out Mork ticket at every opportunity. Yawning. <br /> <br /> payment channel. An unusually bad script paired with a less-than-convincing Robin Williams as a glittering, frugal and impractical Queens car salesman who had been in a hostage crisis. The laughs are not there, the message (s) or morality are just wrong, and the movie can never decide if it's a comedy or a drama. Pretty good, they all looked pretty bad. If a movie ages so fast, you have a stinker. Not much else than maybe to avoid, at all costs. More mediocre textbook films like these are usually boring and less enjoyable than the overburdening bombs.
