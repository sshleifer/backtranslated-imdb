Teenage Exorcist is one of those god-fearing films that feature videos that make viewers abandon expectations of decent entertainment for low-head sexual antics, youthful humor, and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what he wanted to deliver. It's about a girl who moves into a house where a Baron de Sade (hmmm) once lived and was eventually attracted to his inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, together with an Irish priest, her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy, try to rescue her and drive her demon out. Well, not much here to protect yourself from terror and tension. In fact, one line of the movie summarizes the expectations. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) tethered her (by the way, the name is Diane and is played by Brinke Stevens) after trying to chain her sister. He takes a gag out of her mouth and says something like, "This will not be the last gag we see tonight." In fact it was not. The special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the movie uses this by playing out its comedic appeal. Some of the lines and situations are funny. Robert Quarry, the old Earl Yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an Irish priest. He brings it up and whines Biblical verses and Irish songs. However, you know that you are in trouble when Eddie Deezen receives the highest billing. Deezen does his fate and also has some nice moments, but the material is just too threadbare for it to be anything more than a teenage fan for young people. Michael Berryman of The Hills Have Eyes also has a short but interesting cameo in the movie. As for the other relatives, they are all pretty good at being mediocre. Stevens is sexy in fishnet stockings and panties with a French cut, but beyond that you do not expect too much from her. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun, and she shows a bit more than Brinke (a very pretty young woman), and Brinke performs far away. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to be mediocre and to be funny. Again, not a bad movie to waste some time thinking NO thought. If you're a fan of Robert Quarry, at least pay attention to his performance.
