While traveling with a Misses team to tackle the Miss Galaxy, the aircraft controlled by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) crashes in a remote area where Noah's Ark under the Jurassic Pork lies. As the group struggles to survive, alien monkeys plan to use the Ark to destroy humanity and dominate the Earth. I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an offense to human brains. The terrible story and the special effects are very, but really, very bad. There are parodies of Lost, Castaway, Jurassic Park, Sixth Sense, Titanic, Planet of the Apes, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Congo, MIB, Perfect Storm, Austin Powers, Jaws, Mission Impossible, Third Kind Encounters, Star Wars, and Hulk, but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny. In the end, the trailer is better than the movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível"
