With little experience (both of life and industry) and no cash, Sofia Coppola's early short position is almost invariably an observatory set up in a high school. The cast is rather weak and can not be shot in black and white (the characters are hard to distinguish). Sound editing does little to support a simple history of fickle youth loyalty. <br /> <br /> However, there are one or two things to keep in mind. In the contradictory editing, the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant widths and intimate close-ups. Editing music also generates interest and impulse (without getting into the underworld of the music video). Coppola clearly tried to vary the tempo of the film. The dramatic change is quick and to the point and the second act is almost non-existent. We know that it was actually played in unison with the first, which is the narrator's point on crutches (which in this first act is an otherwise oddly attached character). Despite these comments, it's an awkward short film. 2.10
