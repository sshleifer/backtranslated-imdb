There seems to be some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a movie that was planned and executed so badly if I had not really started it. <br /> <br /> First of all, once we're in The Cave With The Characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've met in horror movies since the early '80s), the movie is almost completely shot in close-up , Because the actors wear helmet lights, it means that everything we see is bright lights that alternate with absolute darkness. We can never see what the characters see. So, if you see, look! we have to beg "what? where?" Ultimately, the film has a disgusting, confusing flash effect that does not make sense until the end. <br /> <br /> And I will not tell you what "the end" means - but you will. Know it, if you have ever seen the old laugh party of the early 60s "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what crazy man would ever have a topic like "Eegah!" which has long been remembered as one of the worst films of all time ?! But we have that here, people. Except that "The Cavern" in contrast to "Eegah!" No idea of ​​silly fun is. It is unsurpassable. (I ran at normal speed, just to get it over with, hoping I could actually see something at the end of the movie, but when I did, it was just stupid.) A satisfying moment though; since it only cost a few dollars after I got it out of the DVD player, I could smash it with my own hands - what a relief!
