With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples, the battle lines were sometimes not so clear), this should have been a good movie. However, the story is sabotaged by the director's overwhelming delusion with his own cleverness, paired with a very bad script. Yes, the natural environment is beautiful and the film is authentic to the historic backdrop of the 19th century. But the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily and adds layer after layer of outstanding musical accompaniment to the soundtrack, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice that ultimately overpowers and draws the viewer's attention to even the story itself. <br /> <br /> It was clear to me that the director, with his microscopic close-ups and the endless repetition of the musical theme of "Danny Boy" (of all!) was trying a New Zealand version of an epic by Sergio Leone, something in the Size of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the seriousness of the story (most of Leone's Westerns were tongue in cheek) and not to forget that she's not 1968 anymore, he manages to make a parody of it. <br /> <br /> Pity.
