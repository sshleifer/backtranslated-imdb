Buyer beware The Alpha video version uses an expression that does not match the description. The movie was shot in color, but you did not know it for the first 25 minutes. The print used is so faded and decrepit that it looks almost sepia-colored. After 30 minutes, some of the paint seeps back into the print, but from then on, the color comes and goes. Remember, even when it's best, the color is pale and washed out. It looks like the print was taken from a TV that did not have the best reception. Add to that the most cumbersome delivery of lines that I can remember. Even the spoken narrative is stunning. Each line is delivered in this irritating, trashy way. I wish they would hurry and get the words out. Because of that, I could not wait for this movie to end. It's one of those bad movies, but it would be good if someone could find a reasonably decent print.
