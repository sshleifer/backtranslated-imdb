The first few minutes of showing the cold and crispy Willis figure were quite enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but after that it got really hot. This is just a deceitful big man and little irritating kid stuff of that time without any innovation. I know that the casting probably selected this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self, but I found that kid particularly irritating and nervous.
