OK, we got JP from Omas Boy and Chuck from Chuck. I thought this movie would be pretty good based on the reviews, and it started pretty high on my film scale, but half of it was just so long that I lost interest. I actually got so bored, probably because you can immediately see what will happen in the end. The story is actually pretty straightforward, I skipped for 15 minutes and missed nothing! This film should have been a short work, maybe a maximum of 45 minutes to an hour. It starts well and ends well, too badly, the filling is boring, boring, boring and it lacks everything except time. Some people say that they like music; I do not care about jazz, and I do not watch movies for their score, I go for the story and if that's tense ... Well, the reviews are in my book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good open, well closed, boring filler. The story was cool, but if you do not know what will happen in a quarter of the way, you have not seen too many thrillers.
