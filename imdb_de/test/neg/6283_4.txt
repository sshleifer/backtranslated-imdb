"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is the third Tenchi movie. It seemed his creators had taken elements from the first two to do this. At the risk of dumping spoilers, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back. Nothing new there. A love of yosho is the bad guy. That was done in the second movie. The fight between Aeka and Ryoko is getting boring. The movie has almost no action scenes and little comedy. Personally, I do not know what the AIC, the creators, thought. I gave this movie a vote of 4.
