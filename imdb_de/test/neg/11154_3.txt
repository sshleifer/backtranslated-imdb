What does this movie have? Many shots and expensive effects. At no other level does anything make sense. <br /> <br /> If you see Arnold cry, the drama gets so bad that it's ridiculous. The plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you think the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun, this movie is for you!
