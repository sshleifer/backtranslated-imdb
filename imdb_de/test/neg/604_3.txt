In short, this movie was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The drama was subordinate, the only decent actors in the group were Trisha, the murderer, and Molly. The music was a bit lame but suitable and the special effects were far too stressed. The story / script was bad, the unnecessary torture / romance scenes were dragged on too long and ended disappointingly. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie was rather slow, the fake Gore little interest. Trisha arrived at the house, and there were some conditions for a good action. <br /> <br /> Trisha received the threatening phone calls, which increased the tension. This momentary suspense, the film's best function, began to develop, but then the friends toppled the place and destroyed all the potential tension / horror in the movie. <br /> <br /> The action becomes dull from here on. The chemistry splatters between the two couples, and the killer lifts Frank and the other girl off. This scene was pulled along and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The killer then makes his way to Trisha and captivates her. There is an exaggerated torture scene that lasts at least ten minutes too long. Since the bladder is made bad, this is not entertaining at all and bores more than shocks. <br /> <br /> In summary, the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising, but then poorly written dialogues and a general lack of action ruin this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
