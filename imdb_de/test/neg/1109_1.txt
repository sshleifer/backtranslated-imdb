All I could think about watching this movie was, "Will it ever end ?!" It was unbearably boring to look at. I wish I could just switch it off, but I wanted to do it, so I fought the good fight and resisted the torture of going through this movie all the way, so you, the good reader, would not have to endure this pain br /> <br /> This film sounds like it has a great chance of reading the premise on paper. However, the actual film does not deliver on this premise at all. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, in the early 1900s, there is a Mineshaft in which children are forced to carry dynamite into the tunnels that are not big enough for the adults to fit in. This seems to be the prerequisite for an interesting movie. After 4 minutes, however, it becomes clear that this is not the case. The adults who committed these crimes will never be punished. The film does not show any consequences for their actions. The opening scene is much better than the rest of the movie and completely irrelevant. The last time an opening scene so painfully misrepresented a movie was the opening scene of 28 Days Later, the only good scene in the whole movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie so shitty he changed the title to dress and sell it again) is exactly the same in this regard. The opening scene is the only observable scene in the entire movie. Instead, the film is flashing to this day. A single mother and her two good, stinking children. Right here it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never go near the movie again. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, the zombie children are barely seen. You may get 3 minutes total screen time. All they do is kill a pig. The rest of the lesson is shown to the dumb mother and her stupid children shopping in the local shop, walking in the woods and talking to each other. The stupid, teenage daughter goes around with some other idiotic teenagers and smokes weeds with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to even care if the zombie kids would send anyone in this movie. Every single character is both stupid and annoying, without any redeeming qualities. Not to mention one-dimensional and clich√©. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been greatly improved * if the mother and her stupid children were dropped off the zombie children in the first 10 minutes as they pulled up to their new house, then the credits rolled. This right would change the score immediately from 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When the stupid mother takes her eyes off the street and almost meets a pedestrian, her daughter scolds her: "You almost killed us, Mama!" Of course, anyone with common sense knows that if the mother had hit the pedestrian, the pedestrian would be death - not the people who wrapped the car safely. I think this line was included in the movie to show that the stupidity of the main characters knows no boundaries and runs in the family. Wicked Little Things / Zombies runs 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me. It was an enormous challenge not to fall asleep. It has not been over an hour in the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie kids actually bother killing someone. Then the scene shows the stupid teenagers drinking beer and walking around in a car and lines like "If you ever want to get back in my pants, start the car and get my ass out of here." Seriously, that's literally from the movie. The teenagers are so cliched, one-dimensional, bad-tempered, stupid and annoying that the zombie kids, when they finally hack 3 of them into the movie in 1 hour and 5 minutes, feel like a reason to celebrate. Of course, the "Princess", the dumb, weed-smoking, consuming beer-drinking loser daughter of the main mother figure, gets away scot-free. What a buzzkill that was! She was on the screen longer than the others and therefore the most annoying of the four of them, and she deserves a pickaxe on her head. All the more it should, as already mentioned, be sent within the first 10 minutes. To keep her around for 1 hour and 5 minutes, she is totally inexcusable. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is of course that feature films with a length of at least 1 hour and 30 minutes must be filled up. So you still have 27 minutes left to run the movie with her and her mother through the woods if she's to stay alive for a long time. After 1 hour and 22 minutes, this is the * second * time in the movie that the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle that does not start the engine while the zombie kids come to fetch her. <br /> <br /> The zombie kids are totally generic. Never say something. No character development for any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all 3 of the annoying, idiotic characters are living. In my opinion, this is the way in which the filmmakers give the spectator audience a last gesture of bird gesture. In my opinion, the filmmakers certainly know that they have beaten anyone who had the big misfortune to watch the whole movie. Why not rub the faces in them and not even give them the satisfaction of seeing one of the three main characters who should have been dropped off in the first 10 minutes, dying? <br /> <br /> Avoid nasty little things / Zombies the bubonic plague
