As long as you remember that the production of this movie was a copyright trick and not meant to be a serious release, it is actually surprising that it is not absolutely terrible. I even liked the theme music. <br /> <br /> And if there's ever been a movie for treatment of Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K bots, then it's here! Take a look at a bunch of smart asses and you'll have a good time. Drink a beer, smear some big pretzels and enjoy. <br /> <br /> To get a copy you need to buy a bootleg or download it as shareware. Probably smart enough to do this. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part .... where dr. Doom tells the FF that he has 12 hours to fulfill his wishes ... and he actually gestures the number "12" with his finger ... it's like "Evil Sesame Street" ... hoo boy , <br /> <br /> ... and of course Mrs. Storm explains "Just look at ..." ..the Fanstastic Four "is just so heartwarming ... you'll laugh, you'll cry .... . <br /> <br /> So if you love Sci-Fi, this is fantastic!
