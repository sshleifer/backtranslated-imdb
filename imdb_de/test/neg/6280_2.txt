While I last read Mr. Well's "War of the Worlds," "The Time Machine," or one of his works, many decades have passed, I think, that they were all played in London, or at least in England. This "B" ("C"?) Film plays an excellent radio adaptation in the eastern part of the United States, as did Orson Welles 67 years ago. However, this film does not reflect the quality of the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's emotion would be unacceptable in most high school theatrical clubs. It was really embarrassing for me. His rolling around in the grass on the hill saying "My family, my family" was almost ridiculous, as was his reaction to his brother's death. Of the three movie versions of the story I've seen, this was by far the worst, with Gene Barry's 50's being the best. I also saw for the first time that a "machine monster" was dripping sticky saliva, as was the case with Alien.
