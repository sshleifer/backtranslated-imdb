When I saw the first Octopus movie, it was a laugh, the kitschy acting and horrific effects. This movie seemed to compensate for acting but not the special effects. Sure, after Jaws and Piranha, why not make a movie about a killer octopus? The Octopus invades New York's waters, where two police investigators are trying to stop the wild beast before July 4th. <br /> <br /> A pretty clean conspiracy and relegation events, but the octopus was pretty awful, it's nice to see you actually made it, but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better for a big budget, This movie could have been a good watch. There are a number of bugs that would not surprise me if they did not explore the way octopus is live ... <br /> <br /> See this when you buy cheap dvd Sequels like, or you'll better see Jaws.
