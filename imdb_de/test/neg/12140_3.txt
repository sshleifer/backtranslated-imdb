<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a wonderful feeling for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you do not get any memorable performances from this "A List" then the problem is this movie must be attributed to the pathetic direction and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after I liked "Angels & Insects" (1995), also by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can not believe how boring this thing was. It kept on going and nobody could save the poor thing. This is not even an interesting, alien dudes-and-young-in-pretty-little-decorated movie! <br /> <br /> "Tea with Mussolini" Gone Amuck!
