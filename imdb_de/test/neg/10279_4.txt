"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow B-strip in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective involved in a murder investigation. "EG in B" is a mediocre film that includes some members of the band Chicago, a touch of action, a bit of philosophizing and a lot of boring dramatic filler. Not worth the time.
