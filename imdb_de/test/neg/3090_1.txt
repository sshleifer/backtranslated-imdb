What a waste of time! I expected better from Cameron Diaz! I think it was not really her fault because he was in a horrible movie. the film does not capture the beauty of europe ..... and he did not succeed in bringing the audience to tense. weak attempt to tell and tell stories - the dialogue is boring and could not convey what I sometimes think simplicity is beauty. No love, energy, electricity on the screen. what a shame !!!!!!!! 1
