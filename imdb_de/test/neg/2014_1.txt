Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge" (cheap money for another lamp-like vampire strip) when I saw that it's a master class, how not to make a movie. A Lump Tag collection with a scrapped rescue board aboard a previously lost cargo ship "The Demeter" in the (coughing) Carpathian system (later upgraded to the Carpathian galaxy) and a relentless evil (in this case the script). The film is a bizarre bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the lascivious vampire movie of all time. **** Spoliers Follow **** After a plethora of logos and a credit sequence of the production company Most of the budget must have been bloated, we open with a cheesy speech by Casper (stupid name), the Captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name ) and instead of the actual character development the twisted, incomprehensible picture describes curiosities that make up his crew. Van Helsing himself has a stubble spray and a bodywarmer in a kind of retro 80's homage to Han Solo (I think). Occasionally, the captain of the demeter appears in a kind of crazy video diary, to say nothing to us with a pronounced German accent (subtitles unfortunately not included). Crew member Mina enters the deserted ship (alone ???), armed only with a pistol-shaped torch and a dense Eastern European accent, while conversing with Van Helsing on his ship's bridge (which is basically a single glittering wall). Mina, wearing a gas mask and glued to the front with rubber hoses, meets something that can only be described as a skateboarder in a black coat who is constantly sliding along the camera. Why this happens because the vampire is not yet flesh is never explained. This leads to a shaky camera that chases Mina down the corridors until she meets Humvee. It's possible that Will Smith was drafted to write Humvee's lines, as most of Humvee remember that he's black every ten seconds and says the word "donkey" enough for a Guinness book of records entries while he does all this in a "" supplies. From DA Hood's accent (that's the year 3000, is there "DA Hood" anyway?) One of the main problems with this movie is that it's trying to set its set in 3000. Unfortunately, anyone with healthy eyes won 'Buy' this may be because the Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet tanker, and maybe the film crew thought it was okay to have hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of Lenin next to a pile of lockers, and it was a kind of futuristic communist comeback special The crew clothing looks like it's been stolen from an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993), and it's armed to the teeth with the latest automatic weapons of the 20th century (with an additional 3000 in firing) which, of course, is absolutely nothing to it Vampires Health care is a thing of the past (in the future), as the intimidating professor does not just have glasses, so also sitting in a wheelchair ??? My God, what happened to all the genetic engineering stuff? <br /> <br /> The professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip-off from Alien Resurrection, who had her own rag-tag crew with a man in a wheelchair (who strangely was not killed). The fans did not take notice of Prof because he appears scared in many scenes. If I were locked up in a Soviet ship without wheelchairs, being pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me because I was such a howling wimp, I would be scared too. <br /> <br /> During the UN-dramatic Mina Pursuit scene, the professor informs us (with feeling) "that is disconcerting". The rest of his lines is also confusing "bugger", and "We'll all die" X 100 follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak Appears as Vice-Captain (What happened to the first officers?) In what I thought, this would be the tired standard edition, a hard nose, no nonsense: "Do not look at me, if I do not tell you either, "suggested 10 stuntman at once, super-babe, but that's a z-stripe So she basically wears a tight, low-cut top and even tighter leather pants. Coolio's performance increases the ham factor by 90% and is more than a tent row, but luckily he dies early enough. Although he seems to keep his heart on the right side of his body. <br /> <br /> After running up and down the same corridor, working with bulky Soviet controls and sitting in Soviet-style locker rooms, crew members find themselves as their own ship's bowlers to (probably) find a more interesting crew. Why Dracula is mentioned at all is unknown, as the biggest villain is called "Orlock". Space Transylvanian is called "crime against fashion" as he walks around in a big, puffy, ruffled shirt and an even bigger starched collar. Orlock stops to explain his entire off-camera story to Erica Eleniak, but can not kill her in yet another distraction from Alien Resurrection. His backstory is so much minced that it's not worth repeating. Since the budget can not afford combat coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee), and even real final titles (the first cast list I've seen, same characters, but completely different and Italian names), the movie begins to destroy the sanity with which you started. Fortunately, the crew can defend themselves with the help of a ship's computer containing obscure, millennia-old hints on how to kill fictional creatures, and some useful 20th century pool cues they find in the ship's hold ("holodeck"). The end is terrible and a little suspect, either they have no more money or the ex-Soviets demanded their ship back. I went into this movie and knew it was bad but did not know how bad it really was.
