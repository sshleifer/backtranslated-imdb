It's the early morning of our dissatisfaction, and some of my friends and I have just come through watching The Wind. Really a disaster movie. Not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc in an unsuspecting population, but rather a terrible movie devastating an unsuspecting audience. To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to see this bomb, let me give you an example that I cited at my first painful sight. If I have the choice to watch this movie a second time and, for example, to cook myself, I am afraid to say that the decision would not be immediate. But instead of simply cursing "ad peliculam" with lousy singles, I'll know exactly why exactly my friends and I burned that particular movie out. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, I like doing low-budget horror movies. I even like low-budget artistic horror movies. I liked "Cold Hearts," "Midnight Mass," "Jugular Wine," etc. Films that were ambitious and daring, even though they lacked production value, execution, and even acting. In general, an interesting premise, unusual camera technique, or just one or two well-made scenes will save a movie that runs a bit rough on the edges. In light of these reservations, I would like to conclude by saying that I hated "The Wind". <br /> <br /> The movie was probably very disappointing in the sense that it was unbelievably frustrating to look at it. From the actions of the main characters to the flow (?) Of the action to the great signs implied by the opening, which ultimately aspired to dust (and did not even logically cling to what was happening in the rest of the movie and left the viewer, expecting something more, with a feeling of fuss about nothing). The dialogue was stained at best, wooden and absolutely unrealistic. By that I mean that in none of the situations in which the characters were, would anyone have reacted like the characters or the things they said, as they said. There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. <br /> <br /> The interaction and development of the characters was miserable. Claire, the "flaming goddess of sex" or the harrowing, passively aggressive Lamesters in the movie, thought so openly with her manipulations that she might have pulled a gun on the characters as well. Nevertheless, she was the brilliant highlight of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milfy Mom, which was not terrible) are so unclear that they may have been portrayed by the same actor. Let's see if I've missed anything: Borderline personality, submissive idiots with deep-seated sexual confusions and inadequacies that have been provoked by the artless orchestrations of a loosely-lipped bimbed - suddenly and unconsciously turned Caligari - to bouts of puerile rage. No, I think that covers it. <br /> <br /> The lack of scope was also problematic. How did those involved in this movie expect the random onlookers from this amateurish, unbelievable, ill-portrayed Lust pentagon (well, what would you call it?) Be the end of the end of the world? largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? No witnesses of the "atrocities" were presented. There were no witnesses in this movie. <br /> <br /> The credibility issues resulting from this lack of attention to detail have been rampant from the point where the story begins to fade. Case Example: If this guy took Bob's way through the forest to get home from the gym, and here's the key, every day, then chances are there would have been someone else to see something later, while the perpetrators fought violently over the crime scene. One might think that with the murder of a young man in the woods, the city would have been in turmoil, the characters would have been questioned, etc. But instead, no witness was in sight (except Earl, the (psychopath without inner monologue) suggest that there are no witnesses for this film either. <br /> <br /> As for quasi-homosexual movements, I have no problem with that, it's not as if they're surprising Considering that we have been asking for most male characters since the second scene, again not problematic in itself, but thrown in for the wrong reasons, it was absolutely unnecessary to be thrown in for pure "shock" and / or "dangerous art" values neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective, what we had instead was an awkward attempt to release a boring, awkward film with a boring, awkward plot ht implied sexual tension, which was pettily implied in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene, only pushed this film further down the totem pole from "mediocrity requiring criticism" to "sucking so badly that it lacked attachment grace enough to suck, to mock and harangue properly. "<br /> <br /> It's like most movies, a lot of artistic fumbling, very little meat and a lot of trouble, it's not that we do not understand it, oh, we got it, we just want it Do not you see, the fact that in the final scene we were celebrating as the only tableau making sense on his face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this movie, rather than moving fast, As the name implies, this film has lazily slipped forward like the sweat path that runs along the nose while your hands are full, Argh. This sensation sums up the savory frustration that was observed at the train's turn There is no fresh air about this film, just the stale miasma of bad ideas that has been poorly realized and rotten before it came to fruition.
