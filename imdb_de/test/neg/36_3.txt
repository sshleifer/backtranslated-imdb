This movie, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation / horror movie; But what I got was a very boring, standardized "spirit extraction". In this case, the mind was that of a religious cult leader who tried to reject the treatment, but whose request was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: his spirit seizes sister Sherry and forces her to commit murder. The only voodoo connection was one of the three black characters, in this case a blind former football player whose mother practiced voodoo. The movie is very slow and very boring. There is a very normal ending that causes excitement, followed by a dreadful stupid ending (warning: SPOILER), in which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by claiming she is possessed. This movie is slow and bad in a not funny, but amazing way. Avoid it at all costs.
