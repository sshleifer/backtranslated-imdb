The 1935 version of "Enchanted April" manages to be boring and superficial at the same time. It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy in a studio where only stereotypical Italian behavior can be seen. The transformation of the four strangers who fled London has stopped immediately from the first day to a week later. Instead of evolving, the script turns a switch and the <br /> <br /> characters are different. <br /> <br /> The husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without showing up, even if their presence does not propel four women back into their shells and / or hostilities. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph has the most fun (to move, rather than chewing the <br /> <br /> scene completely), and Katharine Alexander has a poignant charm from the shadow of her husband (and away from his vile roar). Ann Harding is unremarkable here <br /> <br /> (with the production code enforced). She had a <br /> <br /> corresponding line in an earlier (pre-code) movie, "When Ladies Meet": "You are not worth a minute of a worried hour one of us has given you", but in "Enchanted April "can only look hurt, run out and declare allegiance to her erroneous husband.
