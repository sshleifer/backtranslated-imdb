I can not understand why many seem to hate that. <br /> <br /> This film combines many of the overlapping attitudes of the historical and biblical epics of the 1950s. It uses set pieces, props and costumes used in other films. Here, however, the story tries to go through the entire history of humanity, with a fringe story about the human race in court and a guilty verdict stating that h-bombs will land around the world. The prosecutor is the devil, played by Vincent Price. Okay, it's kind of hopeless to call the defender "The Spirit of All Men," but I think that's one of the things that gives this film a sense of historical charm. Incidentally, the Spririt of Man is played pretty well by Ronald Coleman in his last movie. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx all appear, but not together. Groucho plays Pire Minuet, who buys Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene that is only played for camping humor. Chico is not funny at all, because a monk thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, it is said, is said to be Isaac Newton, who discovers gravity. Most other performances, however, are well done. <br /> <br /> Other tricky things are that the process supposedly takes place in outer space, which is depicted as a region of clouds and blue. There is something called "The Great Clock of Outer Space" which, when it hits midnight, can signal the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But the core issue is the problems of weapons of mass destruction and the eternal question of whether man is basically good or basically evil; and posing it in an interesting way in my opinion. Who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties, should also like this movie.
