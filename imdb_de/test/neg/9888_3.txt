I think the best way to check this title is to break it down into its pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PROS: ~ They turn into wolves, not plastic monsters. ~ The hunting of wolves through the forest ~ Hard-Fi's "Cash Machine" is being played <br /> <br /> CONS: ~ Some parts of the script are frightening (eg the terrible part where the woman is The "Fortunate Five" boys escape games, and there are about half an hour "Dear Cousin" and a round "Yes, we see, we know Gabriel's Law" - the dive transformation is ridiculous - the obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden is told thousands of times to leave and then goes, "if you took care of me you would have left me" ~ the obvious signs ~ the unnecessary parcour ~ the completely unnecessary cutting up of the arm by Aiden ~ cringey speeches by Gabriel <br /> <br / > You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I admire werewolf films, and I've tried to look at them a few times to see if I'd prefer it, but it only made it worse. I think I'm just reading the book and see how I can get on. <br /> <br / > Do not bother unless you have a 12-year-old brother or sister in eerie things. Anyone over that age can suffer and have an hour and a half back.
