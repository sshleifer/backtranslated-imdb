I was expecting much more than I saw with the movie. It's not that I objected to literary licensing (if that's how it should be), especially if there's no obvious attempt to say "based on a true story". But this movie is about Beethoven - a real historical person so well known and deeply embedded in our musical experiences, and I expected the movie to be at least in the primary elements of the story. This movie made such a big exception to the historic record that he could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My assumption (because I had not researched the movie at all) was that it was true. Halfway I stopped the movie to look it up in the IMDb. The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that this was not true with the story because it was so hard to believe much of the story. To enjoy this movie, I had to recognize it as a fantasy, as "what if he were like that". The film lacked this honest disclaimer. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was the fictional conducting of the Ninth Symphony. Even the concept presented in the film has stretched my imagination to disbelief. In the end, I doubted that anything but the story of Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship to Karl van Beethoven was a thing of the past. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role hold out and that was it and for that I give a 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who think this movie is as good or better than Amadeus have no clue that composers are alive and just looking for what this movie really is, because in the end it was a cheaper one Novel of a story - Pulp Fiction.
