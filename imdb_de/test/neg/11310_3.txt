Only one word can describe MR MAGOO - Slapstick. Unfortunately, this is not a PLANE. Looks can put you off, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie plays Nielson Magoo, a clumsy blind man who comes across a pair of jewel thieves. Now he has to hunt them down with ... blindness basically. And that's all this movie is about. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Well, maybe if they had some funny jokes with this theme, but it's actually just one of those "stupid, silent grins on your face, because you're ashamed to admit that you've paid for these" movies "too But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it was hacked, it has at least some funny jokes, and it's a good healthy fun for the whole family (Nielson tried to make a "NAKED GUN" for families in MAGOO, but it's not nearly as good.) Look, you could hate it, you love it, whatever I personally did not hate it, but I did not like it or even rated it as "okay" 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
