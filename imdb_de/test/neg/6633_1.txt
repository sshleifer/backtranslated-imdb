Bad movie! Bad! Go into a discount container. Carrot Top should really opt for under-lit comedy clubs. It's movies like these that make old Jerry Lewis movies like Shakespeare and John Agar look like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a fine talent) is absolutely wasted. Their purpose seems mainly to look pretty and unconscious. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is that Raquel Welch plays a role in Alexis Carrington and Estelle Harris as Harridan a landlady. I can only imagine that someone thinks it would be a good idea to shoot this movie (beyond the sophomoric), if the child of the fourth grade producers is allowed to select the script. Well, maybe his third student. What this movie really needs is rubbing its nose in the hands of its creators.
