There is a reason to call this a teen movie. From 100 possible points I would put it somewhere in the teenager. It's predictable, the drama is terrible, especially the supporting roles, and above all, it's super predictable. The end is so hokey that I should have gone earlier and maybe it would have passed. Incidentally, could you call male leadership a pervert? I'll bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said it. After all, in the school I grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have turned a cheater like Josie into a fraud, and we picked her out of the crowd. My last word is, save your time when it comes to seeing something better on television, like stock prices.
