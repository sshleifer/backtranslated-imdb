This is a horror movie by the numbers, starring Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as the psychology duo, buying an old mansion and inviting a small crew of friends and patients to clean the space. Unknowingly, the villa houses a cellar door - the gateway to hell. If you're in the mood for a stereotypical horror movie, then look no further, but if you want something imaginative, then you will not like this little movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLINCE: $$$ (Ely muffled, though the scene where a man cuts his hand with a saw is pretty cruel.) Fans of imaginative death scenes will not like that, as every character gets up <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Nothing to say, Mary Louise Weller adds the good looks, but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ $ (Clich√©, but still worth watching, this does not bring anything new to the genre But Victor Buono's casting - which is about as threatening as Santa's store - seems to have attracted a few viewers. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ $ (The best performances are from Crenna and Pettet with the other actor "just call their roles." The scriptwriter does not develop characters outside of Pettet's character and seems to have forgotten Mary Louise Weller (Animal) House, who spent about twenty minutes disappears and reappears only to like al the others in a boring way to be electrocuted.
