Dark Harvest is a group of friends who go to a farm (it belongs to a relative or friend of friends) for a short break. But there are killer scarecrows lurking there (there was also something about a curse in there, but I forgot what it was about.) <br /> <br /> The drama in this movie is awful, I do not know what the director is thinking when he was acting and actresses. The script is the same story as the terrible "terrible" (this statement is very obvious, but ...). If there was better acting and a better script, this could have been "okay". <br /> <br /> The director smells too, I see no potential for the future of this man. After all these negatives, this film still retains a "fun factor" that raises it to two. The last advantage is that they do not use CGI! My general thoughts on this movie are bad, really bad, but it's so bad "fun", so it gets 2/10
