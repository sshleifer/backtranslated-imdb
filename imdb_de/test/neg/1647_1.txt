Mr. Shore admitted in his recently-banned reality show that his film work is best enjoyed. No, he must have said "best seen". A healthy stuff can see you through the credits, but there is little pleasure except a sporadic chuckle of the picture, not the picture. Titular hyphen absence is the least complaint. Other hyphenate, wholesome Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (I dare you that "Patina of Purity by the Bell" is rubbed clean) is an abuse as a rural vampire. It is too round for betrayal. Mr. Shore himself occasionally shows the strange talent for mimicry (I thought I recognized a Jimmy Stewart there), but he's never used appropriately. The rare fish-from-water formula still needs to be implemented with less grace. Our hero crawl does not care much about charming his aggression opponents quickly. Finally, I had to announce that it was stated: THE WORST MOVIE EVER. P.S. As another fish Adam Sandler fared better with "Mr. Deeds". It can take a shore to appreciate a Sandler.
