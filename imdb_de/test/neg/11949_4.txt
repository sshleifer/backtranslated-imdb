As much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I once again wondered why a good movie is being re-made. This version lacked the excitement and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip-off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing than a hurting child who was healed with love. I could not believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck had this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones should have found another one she could own (she has other roles she owns). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyous Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed dispassionately by comparison. This version was pleasant, but bland. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable, but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting piece of color that did not seem important. I liked it when he finally said he was back, but the movie was over before his return. I mostly have Martha at home. From time to time I visit it again.
