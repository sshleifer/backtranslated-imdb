This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Can someone please explain to me the plot of this movie? Yes, I know that the gas in the middle of the desert runs out of gas after the driver has never noticed that his compass is not working, but what then? And how did it end? Maybe I'm too stupid to understand this movie, but for me that was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Do not worry, there are much better movies to watch. This film ranks with my other all-time low-low films (Overboard - Adam Sandler and Amazon Fire - Sandra Bullock)
