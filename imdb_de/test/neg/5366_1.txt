I was thrilled to see this show when I saw the promos on A & E. I have been fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal since my childhood. I love catching "Ghost Hunters" when it's running (sci-fi channel). I tried to watch three episodes of "Paranormal State" and just need my time to comment on it because it's so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak. "Paranormal State" is more than cheesy. Cheesy's "Director's Log" voice, where you long for Captain Kirk. Cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are completely taken out of context. Everything Paranormal in this show is automatically considered "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychologists ... as in "poltergeist" you almost expect the team to go and say, "This house is clear." I very much appreciate the approach of the "ghost hunters", where they refute the allegations and then take away everything they can ... and they are almost always reassuring for the client (if they find something) that haunting does not equal evil. "Paranormal State" is not "that bad, it's good" ... it's just bad. Was not A & E "Arts & Entertainment"? The art area is long gone, and the entertainment factor subsides.
