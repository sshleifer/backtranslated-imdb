This movie was a big disappointment. The plot sounded great, like a half-human, half-Leopard creature in Africa that is the subject of a documentary by young American adults. If many of the crew members are found dead, the two survivors are questioned. I would not even call this a horror movie, as the movie is mainly about the (dreaded) adventures of the above-mentioned, narcissistic 20-year-olds who have sex and smoking animal dung to get high (not as entertaining as it sounds like - trust me You rarely see the creature, and the lead actor (who's also a director, scriptwriter, editor and producer!) is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I was so upset about Never Dialogue I was guessing the end in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I was right, so this terrible movie is also absolutely predictable - as if it were not bad enough. "Moral of the story: Avoid Films that are played, directed, edited, produced and written by the same Nobody, and avoid this movie if you are not held at gunpoint.
