Very boring show. What's worse, it's very racist. The whites are stupid idiots and the only romance is between a black and a white. There's nothing interesting about this romance, it's not exciting, it's not fun, they do not seem to care about each other at all, it's more like the writers and directors were looking for some interraciales. Why is this so popular in the media today? It is social programming and leads to no good. There are always tensions when too many people want the same. This show is not worth the $ 20 for the season, it is a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use TV programs to sell products, they are more discreet. The sale of Agenda is obvious, and without clear thinking, some may turn out to be wrong if they oppose it.
