The first twenty-five minutes may be the worst in modern British film. Director / Adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. Fortunately, the quality of the direction and the processing improves significantly after the first half hour, but until then the damage has already occurred. From the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they appear on the screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, who are allowed enough leeway to give their lines the true comic sense Wilde intended. The alleged leads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are dull and wooden in comparison. In an apparent attempt to get every penny out of a meager budget, the game was nominally updated to the 1990s, but in conjunction with the original script, the effect is more of a bad screen TV drama of the 70s. Real moments of comedy are rare and far apart, but when they arrive they are extremely amusing - a sign that a more prudent trimming of the rest of the play could have resulted in a better, more consistent film.
