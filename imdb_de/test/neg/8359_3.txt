There must have been a lot of background information that was excluded from the movie. In the movie, the girl Lizzy did not even look depressed. She just seemed like a girl who got out of hand when she finally went to college, mainly because she was taking drugs and drinking alcohol. That seemed to be her problem, not a mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad had gone and she barely saw him as a kid, and her mom seemed to be out there a bit. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just mean and I do not think she was caused by depression. She was very much needed, which Rafe got out of hand, but she was like that because of her father. <br /> <br /> But I think the main reason why this movie never got a theatrical release is that the plot does not do enough and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: To be honest, I would only recommend it if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first nude scene. Otherwise it is not very interesting.
