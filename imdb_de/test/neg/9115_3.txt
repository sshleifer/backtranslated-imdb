The setup for "Nature of the Beast" is ingeniously simple and with boundless potential for tension: The hunted salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) is causing trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who appears to be engaging in overburdening possessions Information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars have been stolen from a casino, and someone called 'Hatchet Man' is shattering people in the desert. Sounds good, right? A bit like "The Hitcher" meets "Psycho". One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems! Unfortunately, author-director Victor Salva (of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder" fame) does not have enough ideas to keep the movie going. The scenario does not trigger tension or tension (poison for what is a "thriller".)), And the inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone seems inappropriate. Henriksen is reminiscent of an unusual, not quite earthbound Everyman (even with a big belly), but Roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in "Death Wish 3". We've never gotten to the point where we really care about what's going on, and the conclusion slips into unlikely territory (I always thought it would be Fight Club again, but I was wrong). Too bad. "Nature of the Beast" could have been something else ... instead of nothing else.
