By watching this kind of movie, I realized I did not like it very much. Caged Women is another "women in prison" movie and like the rest of the genre; The plot is completely abandoned in favor of the mere portrayal of naked women. Do not get me wrong now! I love naked women, but I also like that there is some kind of nudity plot, and since this movie only goes through the basic theme of "women in prison" (of course, the essential escape), I got something before the end boring. The movie is good because there's hardly a moment when women wear clothes, but that's the only positive thing. Director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich is happy to show close-ups of the naked female body, but it's never very erotic. The director was the producer of a number of garbage strips, including Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should stay on producing because his writing skills do not exist and he does not know how to film a sex scene. This type of material is often quite dry, but I think Franco could have made more of it. Overall, this may be enough for people who are really interested in such things. but I can not say that I liked it.
