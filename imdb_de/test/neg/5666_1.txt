This show is just awful. I liked seeing Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that, The Amanda was also funny, but that's just WONDERFUL. In my eyes, it felt like watching these --- films from Seltzberg, painful and blurry. That's about 3 stupid @ $$ kids doing a crappy web show (while stealing the hole Ithing), while their backward brother does sculptures (he has no life). the cast is crap, Megan from Drake and Josh carly (AHHHHHHH!) is an ugly b! tch is sam and a kid they pulled off the street plays fred. All I've seen here (ugg) are random "jokes" that include the brother making a sound movie movie. He also played an arcade game called PAC-rat (ingenious), Sam and Carly are delays in their web show and Fred is a dork The only episode that saw a saw (can not remember the title) where Fred gets bad luck if he does not write an e-mail. I find videos on YouTube funnier than this garbage. and why the hell do you get youtube jack @ $$ fred? Just skip this show.
