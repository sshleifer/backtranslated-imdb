It started as a good sketch comedy. The first few shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really funny was the imitation of Mariah Carey and the launch on Beverly Hills 90210 with the hair fight. The battle of Delta Burke against William Conrad was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows went downhill relatively fast. The writing was uninspired and oh so predictable, as if the show had acquired a cult in their young days. Nothing new was offered and the recurring skits were boring. An example is the weapon family (or whatever it was called), which became a weekly feature. This sketch was not that funny at first, let alone being a regular feature. An example of a quick and promising start and a sudden crash.
