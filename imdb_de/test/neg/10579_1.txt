Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meeting Spartans, No More Teen Movie and Another Gay Movie. "Superhero Movie" was the eleventh in a series that easily ruined the parodies genre. Now I admit that I have a thing for classics like Airplane and The Naked Gun, but you know that you've milked a franchise so badly if you can see the gags a mile away. In fact, the only thing that can really get you to see this catastrophe is the incredibly funny but sold out Leslie Neilson. <br /> <br /> You can see that he needs the money, whether or not he sinks like a good Capitan. By no means does he bring down this genre, but he does not help to hell. But if I'm sorry about this movie, the decent actor is Drake Bell, who is experiencing an immense amount of embarrassment. However, the people who are by far the most tortured are the public forced to spend 90 minutes laughing bile, which is no funnier than herpes. After spoofing disaster movies in Airplane! Police show The Naked Gun and Hollywood horror in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker satirically targets his superhero genre with this anarchic comedy that features everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, Rick Riker (Drake Bell), a high school giver, experienced an amazing transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel and he has the strength of ten men. Determined to use his new powers to fight crime, he creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly - a fearless crime fighter who ensures the streets of law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after being caught in the middle of a terrible experiment, Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) develops the power to deprive everyone he encounters of the life force of becoming evil Hourglass. To achieve immortality, the hourglass tries to gather as much vitality as possible, while the noble dragonfly defies the archenemy and realizes his fate as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and directs this parody about the fly. <br /> <br /> with Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. Hell Superhero Movie Maybe it deserves some credit that it's a lot better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. However, one of the worst experiences of the year 2008 comes with great responsibility. Laughless, but less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense much more than the Spartans get to know. But that may be a good reason. There are still some of us trying to remove the stain that Meet the Spartans was from our memory. <br /> <br /> My final judgment? Avoid, unless you are one of those people who like such a car crash movie. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super villain.
