As a big Disney fan I was really disappointed when I saw this garbage. The animation was pretty and the backgrounds were awesome, but I think good animation does not balance a weak script and story. I do not have to agree with the people who say that it is not suitable for children. Yes, there are some deaths in the movie, but is not death something that at least children should be exposed to? But I digress. The script is full of bad puns and lame jokes ... as you would expect from most Dreamworks movies. The music was grumpy, morals forced (and forced without any charm.) And the characters would erupt to songs at totally inappropriate times. Bar irritation). I'm a big fan of the jungle book, Aladdin, and the new groove of the Emperor, but this Disney movie was a total waste of time ..... do not look at it !!!
