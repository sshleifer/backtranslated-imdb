I just do not know how this stupid, crap, garbage, trash & good for nothing movie is a blockbuster. It was so boring with a very, very weak (or no) story and was not even a little funny. The movie was about 135 minutes long and had only one paragraph of the story about Prem (Salman Khan), a love guru. He helps the hapless and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) to find the girl he wants. I'm not saying that I did not like the movie because it was not funny or anything, I accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons I can say it's a super hit are: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan and Govinda are together on the screen, but for the first time we were in Salaam and Ishq, what it was not a flop, so it can not be. But it was a really good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan's name is Prem and all movies with that name were a hit, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard it's a remake of Hitch. I did not see it and I'm glad I did not. Music is okay, the only good songs are: Do you want a partner? You're my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what good is it in a really bad movie, though someone like Katrina Kaif dances with two left feet She's totally crap. She knows neither acting nor language (her voice is always synchronized for her), she dances and always can not impress. I do not like her, she was disappointing even in Koffee with Karan. Overall Partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. It's better that she gets kicked out of Bollywood and never comes back.
