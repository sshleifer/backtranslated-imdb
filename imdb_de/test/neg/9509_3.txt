Granted, the only reason I've seen this movie - since it's been around ten years since it was released - was Ian Holm. I was curious to see him as my second most popular character in this piece. In any case, this film is as pithy as anything the old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth". But some of the best parts of the game were left out. I understand the direction / cut selection, but I do not think it really does it justice. Maybe I'm too puristic. I would have to direct the people (who have read so far) to Branagh's version, if I did not despise his tendency to overdramatization. Nevertheless, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But did not we all wait for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now all he has to do is prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages. <br /> <br /> ... Perhaps Scofield as The Ghost is the only Shakespeare-worthy actor.
