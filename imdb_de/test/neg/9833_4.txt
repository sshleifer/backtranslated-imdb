I've found that many of the films shown at the Mystery Science Theater have received a lot of lower ratings on IMDb. However, some of the films shown in the films were not so bad and it is not fair to rate a movie that has received the "MST" treatment - with hosts making funny comments during the film. Now, I'm NOT saying that "The Girl in Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it's not nearly bad enough to earn its current IMDb rating of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The film starts with the meeting of Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a veteran drifter and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no special reason to roam the country. Once they are blown into a small town, Bix has to keep saving because Danny is pretty naive - a nice way to say he has the mind of a tomato. On the way, something happens to the confident Bix - he finds a nice young lady and finds the temptation that he stays with him. And in a strange subplot, Jack Elam plays a super-scary Sicko wandering around the city scarying everyone's crap - but strangely, the police do not seem to notice much, nor does anyone alone do anything against him. Eventually, when Elam shakes hands with a girl Bix falls in love with, things are going at full speed. All in all, though it's not a great movie at all, there were many interesting plot elements of this movie - enough to earn more than 2.1 points. The biggest negatives are a simple conclusion to the mystery that comes at the end, as well as the total stupidity of Danny once too often. Given the tiny budget, however, it is a worth watching small movie.
