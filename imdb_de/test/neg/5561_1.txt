Another try, another miss. France is doomed to fail because it can not produce a good horror movie. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the movie in the forest of Broc√©liande, but even the forest is wrong! It was filmed near Paris! The theme is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the lyrics make you wish you were deaf. Nothing could save it. <br /> <br /> Bad ... to the bone. I was not warned. I want my money back.
