I accept that most horrors of the 50s are not scary by today's standards, but what the hell is that? If you see a title like this, you expect blood and a bloodthirsty animal. Instead, we do not get any blood and a beast that either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth ... yes, what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The whole story is good the astronaut comes alive again and one with the beast ... but the title really does kill the movie. Night of the Beast would have made the fans happier because there really is no blood to talk about. <br /> <br /> I like the end of the 50s movies, which left room for a sequel, but wisely never did one. This movie is not the worst I've ever seen, but it's almost up there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
