Jason Lee is doing well to promise this doggy movie, but it is not enough to distinguish him from any other bland family comedy. <br /> <br /> This live-action CG-amplified adventure sees a shamed police dog (Jason Lee) in an accident in the lab of planning scientist dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) turned into a super dog. Underdog sets out to save the city as he tries to keep his identity a secret - a challenge as he can both talk and fly. The weird gag smiles, but Underdog's human buddies (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as boring as the predictable storyline. One for children too young to have seen Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog?
