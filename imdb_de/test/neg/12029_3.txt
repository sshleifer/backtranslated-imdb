Detective Burt Williams has been tracking the infamous Poe killer for nearly three years. The daughter Kris Williams, a murder agent for the FBI, along with her partner Sean Michaels takes over the role of Burt. Burt reluctantly abandons his mandate and withdraws Over the next seven months, the "Poe Killer" continues his murderous rampage until Kris finds out that the killer uses Internet chat rooms to seduce his prey. She signs up as Annabel Lee and is quickly captured by Poe Killer. It's time for Burt to find the sadist Liberate his daughter before it's too late. Amateur and confident Braindead horror movie with no excitement and a bit of a bad gore. The drama is hilarious, the characters are painfully stupid and the killer is not threatening. I've still seen worse indie horror movies .3 out of 10.
