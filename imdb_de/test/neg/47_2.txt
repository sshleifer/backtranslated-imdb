I saw it last week at the IFC and thought it was typical of the indie short film short: stylistically, with little substance and originality. Is not it amazing that a coming-out movie shows an unusually attractive (and blond) 70s-haired boy and too cool school clothes? In addition, this film circulates in the late 70s, which come to mind for some (Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides"), but do not agree for this director. However, I do not consider this to be positive (what has he done lately?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you see it on the cable late at night, turn the channel and look at something else instead.
