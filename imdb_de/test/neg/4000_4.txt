I know many people have automatically rated this movie 1 just because they do not have the huge budget and the best special effects they're used to. However, I knew what I was getting into when I put this in the VCR. <br /> <br /> I do not think we will get much more money than this, unless we are filming a family reunion. The lighting is terrible, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible and the spectacle is extremely bad for almost everyone involved. BUT, this is still a funny movie and the plot is interesting enough. In the center stands a companion named Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt), who had no luck with his work. He is very protective of his wife and does not let her work, putting even more pressure on himself. As he begins to work for more hours, we see him slowly turning into madness and obsession, and he becomes suspicious that his wife is cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men (most of the repairmen) whom he calls for responsible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the Gore effects are extremely cheap but match the overall tone of the movie. The brutal ways in which Tom Russo murders these men give us an idea of ​​what he has just gone mad. The speed of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. The end really does not follow the rest of the plot of the movie, as it seems to go from a psycho-slasher movie to a wannabe of "Dawn of the Dead", but it's still entertaining and I have to give something to the knight credit for the use of an unconventional ending. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I liked this movie, but it's definitely not a good movie if that makes sense. The budget is the main stumbling block, and the consequences are almost too much to miss. I do NOT recommend this for people who are totally spoiled by the big budget movies and can not open for movies on an extremely low budget. You just will not enjoy it. For others and fans of gore - I say, give it a try. At least you will find something that will pay for something! <br /> <br /> My grade: D
