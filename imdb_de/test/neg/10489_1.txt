I'm a fan of bad horror movies of the 1950s and 60s - movies that are so ridiculous and stupid that they're good for a laugh. That's why it's natural that I chose this movie, especially because John Agar was really bad at it. Although it was a bad movie, this was unfortunately the worst kind of bad movie - boring and unbelievable. At least with stupid and overly bad movies, you can laugh about the cruel monsters and the terrible directing and acting. Here you never really see so much of the monster (mostly because of the darkness of the pressure) and acting, although it is bad, it is less energy poor ... bad and boring. The movie starts with some young adults walking to Satan's Hollow. Well, considering the name of the place, it's not surprising to find it later torn to pieces. Duh ... do not mess with Satan's Hollow !! Well, there are reports of an object that has fallen from the sky. So what are the teenagers doing? Yes, we do a dance party - a very, very, very slow dance party, where the kids dance almost in slow motion. So it's up to the sheriff (agar) and his men to make sure the kids can dance in peace without fear of chewing - a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high-tech. To make matters worse, it makes snorting noises and moves very, very slowly - so slowly that even the most corpulent teenager could easily overtake it! It is a mystery to me how killing is repeated. <br /> <br /> All in all too boring - even if you're a fan of lousy cinema.
