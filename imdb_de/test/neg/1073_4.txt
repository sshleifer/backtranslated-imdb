I could not relate to this movie. I am surprised that people praise it because they are so "realistic". How many people at your school were victims of incest? How many gay jocks were there? How many quiet people you have never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK, you would not even know if it was hers. But in reality these are blasting problems that many are not concerned with. Yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could have been studied. But where is the "entertainment"? <br /> <br /> Regarding the girl who committed suicide - I found that exploitative. I actually believe that MANY people in high school eventually feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what does a person who violently commits suicide on another day ignore and go unnoticed? The filmmaker decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide makes him even more provocative. I did not buy it as a real scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problems of the other students, with whom I did not occupy myself completely. Bullying is being explored, but that has been done to death, we all know it's going on and it's really a matter of determination within that person. Cabinet homosexuality? Pfft, another cliché is being rolled out. That's really the thing, too many clichés. I guessed the end at the start. It was a predictable unpredictability, if that makes sense. They all have these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none. And I thought, what's the point of this character if she's not the unsuspecting suicide victim? And sure enough. <br /> <br /> One thing I'm going to say, and it's the saving grace of the movie, is that it does NOT glorify suicide. Suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking. It's a powerful scene (regardless of how it's invented) and one that rejects suicide as the simple option. But the movie is really not very imaginative and uses stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but by no means groundbreaking or worthy of making a 17-minute standing ovation in Cannes ???
