I was looking forward to seeing this when it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Far from the strange world of dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and disgusting, I do not think Dr. Seuss would have approved. How Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand that there were a few subtle jokes for adults, but my children have yet to prevail. While The Cat shrieked in the hat vulgarity, they caught much more than I would have liked. When I met Dr. Seuss grew up, it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic was scrapped on the big screen. Who? Seuss brings some justice.
