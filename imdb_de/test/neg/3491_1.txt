Crash is said to be a movie about racism in Los Angeles. In fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between multiple characters connecting in one day in one of the largest cities in the world. Who the hell will believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, the film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks and Whites. The big mistake, however, is based on an already existing racism of the writer. Mainly because the white characters in this film are usually portrayed as having better socioeconomic status than the other races. The Iranians are as poor as the Asians. And Latinos are as always a portrait as housekeepers, policemen or with a very inconspicuous job like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Do not you think it's time to change those stereotypes? The same applies to Schwarze, portrait as a gang member, with the exception of a Black TV director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie is so hard that I am so disappointed with the kind of cinema that comes out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotypical characters. No realism. Nothing to identify with. It's just a big waste because it would have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians and Blacks from a different perspective.
