Half Past Dead was unlike any other Steven Segal movie I have ever seen. Very little of Segal, he himself is in action and I agree with the last review I have read. Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything really new here. The best action scenes were Nias when she kicked her ass again. It was interesting to see her as the bad guy after watching her for two years on Walker, Texas Ranger, who still kicked his ass, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
