The story of a volcano erupting in downtown Los Angeles sounds like a nice conspiracy for disaster film. However, this is missed bigtime. The film looks chaotic, has an action that is hard to follow or believe, and acting was very bad. I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is only good at having people as a boss in a certain area. In this he leads the emergency office. As the boss of such an office, it is obviously a good idea to bring your daughter to dangerous scenes. Smart thinking. Ann Heche touches walls and runs in tunnels that reach 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah right. Apart from the bad acting, these facts make the movie look almost as stupid as Armageddon. The only good thing about this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck that makes things worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
