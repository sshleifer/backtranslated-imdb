With actors like Depardieu and Richard it's really hard to make a boring movie. But Weber controls a slow pace and makes supposedly funny scenes without mind and depth. This movie is high in history but little in character. You never get to know any of the characters except superficial slapstick. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style can be described with hit and miss. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone sinking on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor to this lot. It's a shame how badly he uses good talents. Many good French comedians were wasted by mediocre directors.
