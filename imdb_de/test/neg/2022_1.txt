Space is a vacuum, right? So the room is shit. Vampires suck too. A really bad vampire movie in space would have twice the suction power, right? <br /> <br /> It started with one thing that could have been a fun premise. Retell Bram Stoker's Dracula story in the future. There is a rescue team being sent to investigate a cargo ship called Demeter, which has been lost in space. Fans of the original novel will unknowingly assume that this will be an uncomplicated retelling of Dracula's set in the future when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you that he is the best actor in the movie, and that does not say much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should sell his goods daily on television. Erika Eleniak should have given up after leaving Baywatch, and poor Udo Kier has trouble reading from the cue cards. The guy who plays Dracula is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 70s version. If you manage to go through the entire movie, you will be rewarded with the worst possible end. In the end, you're wondering if the actors and the crew noticed what kind of garbage they were doing and left the set. <br /> <br /> Attention vampire fans. This one is twice as hard.
