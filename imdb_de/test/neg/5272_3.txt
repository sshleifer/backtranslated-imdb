Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he's undoubtedly on the list of others when it comes to great actors. He even left a good Irish accent on Ordinary Decent Criminal. But Kevin Spacey as mafia leader? Or even a burglar? I'm not so sure he could go that far. The movie just did not make sense to me, and some of the stories just did not feel right for me. I know again that IMDb will force me to write ten more lines. I'm not so sure what I could say about this movie because I'm still trying to figure it out. Stupid, right? But I'm pretty sure that more than a few of you were IMDb users in the same situation I'm in right now, where you just want to say a few lines about a movie, but now you have to make ten lines? Wow, that should do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
