Italian filmmakers love to tear down American films. All our films and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I do not say that this is par excellence against Italy as a whole, but I would like to point out that the Italian film industry is doing itself great damage by allowing such overseas trusts overseas. That's all I say. <br /> <br /> And no serious injury done to the Italian people is, if not those who let the world see "Shark rosso nell'oceano" to be punished with a harsh punishment is indeed a rip off the far superior "Jaws" (as if you did not know). <br /> <br /> Let's dive into the plot (Get it? Haw-haw ...): Here's a huge, monstrous, floating thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark, and Steven Tyler , attacks many innocent Americans (eg Italians) off the coast of Florida (eg Italy) and the intrepid, beer-hungry Peter (Sopkiw) with his anorexic, beer-drifting girlfriend and other beer-driving people whose main purpose consists of to be eaten to the creature killed by mysterious powers who want the creature to be left alone or just standing around and otherwise useless (and beer swells) .. or the doctor in this movie who repeatedly defibrillates dying patients ( 20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for his paddles to charge (must be) a damn good battery there, doc). <br /> <br /> Then there's the monster ... Brother, if you thought the shark "Jaws" was fake, look here and have changed your mind IMMEDIATELY. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that was subsequently shot (by a bava!), edited with an onion chopper, played by ambulatory driftwood pieces, and written by (PRESUMABLY beer-swaying) people who should never ever be left near a typewriter, movie studio, or big city in the world. If the people who made this movie think that they think real people in such a situation, they obviously made too many of them zombie movies. Or drunk too much beer. <br /> <br /> Do I have to say that this movie is bad? It's as bad as green cottage cheese; bad as a Hawaiian shirt at an official wedding; Bad as the "Bad Theater" sketches that Dan Aykroyd presented on "Saturday Night Live"; Bad How Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets - Can You Get It? Well. <br /> <br /> Mike and the SOL gang keep banging their heads off this beer-drunk beauty, revealing this "horror" movie for what it is: awful. However, with a certain European charm, it is charming when watched by a European - preferably one who spills a beer. <br /> <br /> No stars for the wet, dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; Six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
