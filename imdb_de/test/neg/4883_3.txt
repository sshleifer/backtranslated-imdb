This film is, to say the least, overrated. It's not good as a comedy and not as a "serious" movie. The tempo is much too flat for the first, and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter. The only laugh comes from Bud Spencer's reaction when angered by his brother's behavior. The dubbing is excellent, but the fullscreen setting is frightening. (* 1/2)
