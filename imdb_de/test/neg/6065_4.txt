According to "Lucien Rebatet" in "Histoire de la Musique" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973, page 338) Beethoven's figure was not very compatible with women. He had a number of "Platonic passions" with female members of the "Viennese aristocracy," to whom he dedicated some "sonatas." But musicians, even composers, did not qualify for husbands of "fine ladies". Haydn was a "servant" of Prince Von Esterhazy, Mozart died of alcohol or poison and Bethoven was a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in Vienna, according to Rebatet. A British biographer, Newman, says Beethoven participated in syphilis before the age of 40. It is possible, but not certain, that the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, along with the inauguration of the House Overture and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis, became deaf. This was the first appearance of the composer for twelve years; The hall was full. Although the performance was conducted by Michael Umlauf, the theater's Kapellmeister, Beethoven quietly shared the stage. <br /> <br /> So what's left of this "female fantasy"? Ed Harri's interpretation and characterization are pretty good, but too linear, based on the painting by Ferninand Waldmüller from 1823. I have it in front of me. It shows a man who despises (perhaps hates) the world. For good reason.
