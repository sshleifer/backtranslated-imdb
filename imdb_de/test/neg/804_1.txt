Where should I start? The story was so bad that it must have been written in a high school movie club! The acting was so wooden that I regretted the actors! An actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when he looks into the headlights of a car. Another actor has this constant expression of constipation! But it was the dialogue that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero says to his kidnappers who are holding all submachine guns in their hands. If you touch a female prisoner with your finger, you will be dead. Moments later, the strongest guard built like a truck and the only female prisoner set to work. When our fearless leader, who has this very annoying gangster voice, gets wind of this transgression, he quietly walks to the guard while machine guns are pointed at him, and in a split second this huge guy breaks as if he were breaking a toothpick. He bets then back in the line, while all the bad guys with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially scream at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on! This movie is a camp jewel. And if you have a sense of humor, you're guaranteed to laugh so hard that your eyes are ripped apart!
