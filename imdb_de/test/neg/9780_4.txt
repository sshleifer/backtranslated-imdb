This is another alien imitation and not very good. Replace space with the South African desert, add the same ingredients, a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, let them succumb to an alien creature and you have the same old story of an ordinary movie, trying to monkey a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists set out to hunt down some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert freed from meat. Their vehicle collapses and they embark on civilization while being persecuted by the monster. The African place is pretty good, but basically this movie has it all. There is a vain attempt to build tension, but I found that this did not really work, and made the movie rather boring. The creature did not appear much and when she did, she did not really have a sense of horror. A scene where someone gets the flesh torn from his arm, but that's basically it at the front. Finally, I found this movie as exciting as the dry looking at color. I give this movie 4/10 and that's just because of the interesting location, which alone is not enough to save this movie from a total snooze feast
