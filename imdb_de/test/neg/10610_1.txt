The Mod Squad will start "after" the creation of the "Mod Squad", without worrying about developing any of the characters or showing us why someone does what he does. <br /> <br /> Events in the movie seem negligible to the plot. Without even a hint of character development, the plot of Gen-X club scenes winds its way to action scenes and back again. <br /> <br />
