The thesis of Father Brown is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. A bit of proselytizing I do not mind, but that sometimes gets a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some good actors have played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this movie and does everything right with him, but you did not see much demand for future films from Father Brown. <br /> <br /> I think if you're a committed Catholic, it all makes perfect sense. It is much more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than to see him put on trial. <br /> <br /> But that was what was asked here to accept. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to return stolen items stolen from one of his parishioners, Sidney James, during a robbery. That's the story he tells the local cops, and of course that's something James trusted him to do, so he can not break the confession. <br /> <br /> Now for a bigger game. Master Thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, stole a cross entrusted to Father Brown, and it was said that it once belonged to St. Augustine. But Father Brown is more interested in getting Flambeau to return to his faith than to bring him to justice. So he misleads the cops so he can fulfill his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it was just too much for me to swallow. Father Brown, I would hate to say that it was due to disability and should have been arrested. And he was not obliged to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to him as a penitent in search of absolution and spiritual counsel. Author G.K. Chesterton, a well-known Catholic layman of his day, finds it all very reasonable. As a logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with an army of priests. Guinness borrowed from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne of Child Hearts and Coronets and Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to Create Father Brown Granted, Brown is a lot smarter than the other two. There is also a bit of Colonel Nicholson in this presentation. In The Bridge on the River Kwai, Guinness also played a character whose rather strange interpretation of the rules meant he lost sight of the essence of Nicholson's situation. Father Brown is a fun guy when he solves puzzles and makes the authorities look stupid. We enjoyed Brother Cadfael doing it in a medieval setting, and the American crowd liked Father Dowling, played a few years ago by Tom Bosley. <br /> <br /> This movie should be entertaining.
