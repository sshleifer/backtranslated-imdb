This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got their hands on it. It leads from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that culminated in the slide-up of a miniature web server. <br /> As G4 ratings dropped, they moved from their original audience, gamers, to generic hormone guided young men who added a visual treat and sex counseling segment to the staff. Now even the players who initially applauded the show turn away in disgust. I'm looking forward to the show and the network, which is overwhelmingly overdue and deserved.
