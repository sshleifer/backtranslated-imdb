I feel in conflict with this movie - it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, and provides insight into a lost culture. There was an early scene where men in hats and mustaches sat around a table, serving a woman and playing an accordion that brought tears to my eyes, just because it captures a lifestyle that many people find incomprehensible today. It shows the lives of the characters as inextricably linked to the life of the village, another concept lost in today's world. Symbolism is always fun, but it seemed a bit old-fashioned. The fatal flaws of the film were for me the lack of compelling dramatic drive and the total lack of humor. I never had the feeling of knowing one of the characters that went beyond basic generalities such as mourning for the loss of a loved one, and so on. The people were stick figures on the shelves, where natural disasters, war, etc. occurred. The film was just beautiful tragic scene after another, with no narrative thread and no humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract and irrelevant to the lives of real people. In the end, I was too bored to finish it.
