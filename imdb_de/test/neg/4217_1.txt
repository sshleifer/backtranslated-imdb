I am offended and upset by the idea that a sequel to Gone with the Wind should ever be performed. With these words I have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. The performers are talented people whose talents have been wasted on this garbage. The hype around this book and the movie happens to be a pointless exercise. I think it will go down as one of Hollywood's misguided films. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should be polluted by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of the worst ideas developed in the world of publishing and filmmaking. The sad part is that people have made money with this tripe.
