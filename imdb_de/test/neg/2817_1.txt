Kill the Scream Queen might sound like a good Slasher movie, but it's awfully boring and very stupid. <br /> <br /> Kill the Scream Queen is about a crazy filmmaker who has girls auditioned in his snuff movie. He rapes and tortures her. This is garbage that is not amusing, exciting or entertaining. The killer has no motive, okay, maybe he's just sick ... and very boring. Maybe they could give their victims a story of their own. Everything could be an improvement. It took much more. <br /> <br /> They could just bring in a bit more. I love horror movies, but that's ridiculously bad.
