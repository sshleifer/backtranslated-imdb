I checked this at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed. <br /> <br /> The only area of ​​the movie I enjoyed was the commentary on filmmaking. In most cases, this movie was random and a bit awesome (but I do not say it is complementary) and just stupid. It was like mixing fantasy with everyday life, which may sound intriguing in some movies, but the fantasy just seemed unnecessarily perverse itself. I thought it was boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but given that it was a film festival, that would not happen.
