Probably "Cleopatra 2525" is of little interest if you do not see the series when it was broadcast. and I do not think many people did it. If you are still fascinated, this is a "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" premise without spaceships and no budget for wardrobe or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case, the Buck Rogers part (Cleopatra) is played by Jennifer Sky. What to expect as a good thing, as Jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented; and has a nice comedy. However, a quick glance at the promotional material reveals that it's a little worse than bad hairstyle and a Salvation Army Thrift Store wardrobe. If you recall how Jennifer was picked up while at Xena, her gritty Cleopatra look will be a big disappointment. With a target group of teenagers burning their eyes and looking for "hot, fetish-clad girls", it's not a good idea to reduce the exploitation value of your heroine or costume, and they wonder why some series do not Whether you love it or hate it, "Buck Rogers" had hotter costumes and much better-looking guest stars. <br /> <br /> The other two elements of exploitation are the two female coworkers of Cleopatra, Hel (basically Gina Torres) She plays her "Firefly" character and Sarge (Victoria Pratt - another "Xena" connection - an extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge) Torres does a good job playing the Cleopatra character and most comic relief Torres sings the title song, a somewhat lame parody of Rick Evans's "In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" (1969), reminding those who use the words " In the year 2 525, If the man is still alive, if the woman can survive, they may find ... "I suspect they have not given t The series has its title, so they could butcher this catchy little song, though, who knows maybe the title is a homage to "Buck Rogers" and they thought about using the song later. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show is that the earth's surface was taken over by aliens called bailies (not the WKRP) and people were driven underground. Our three heroines fight the bailies under the guidance of a disembodied (presumably) female voice (appropriately termed "voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a rickety third-time stooge, still dazed and confused by her cryogenic sleep, or perhaps just disoriented by the creepy haircut. There are many beautiful close-ups of Sky with big eyes and confused. Like "Buck Rogers", the running gag is Cleopatra with a 21st century expression, and everyone finds it either totally profound or completely confusing. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly," the action is more of this hyper-crafted "Xena" drop that's neither realistic nor entertaining. A good gimmick is that the girls are in "Spiderman" fashion, a kind of train carried through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough (or perhaps without taking into account the budget), these are just half-hour episodes, and apart from a two-part show, there's not enough time for any subtleties and nuances. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
