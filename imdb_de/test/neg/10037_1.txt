In addition to the fact that this is just a miserable movie (imagine giving a camcorder to an average high school drama club), people who believe there's something "real" about that legend need to grow up become. This is the 21st century. Guess what? Ghosts do not exist. Most people learn this from their mother when she is about 5 years old. You have to grow up seriously. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was committed nearly two centuries ago makes him no less a fraud. The fact that a large number of Tennessee inbred hillbillies believe that it does not. To go to university. Or at least finish high school.
