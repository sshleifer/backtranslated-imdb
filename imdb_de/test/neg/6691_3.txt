Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There are so many films that have exactly the same plot, and this is just a bad remanufacture. Popul's white girl moves into an ethnic school, does not fit in and will soon be accepted. Originality is not there, and not laughter. It uses so many old bad jokes that it is annoying. I do not know why they think it's a good idea to make video recordings for mediocre movies, but that's not the case. The positive is that all the people in it are pretty competent actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out of ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
