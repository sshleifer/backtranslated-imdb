It was full of bullet holes, inaccuracies (does the clock stop for injured players or helmet losses at Texas football matches?) And not so much salvation (so that your dad throws the crap out of you - exceptionally once and then he'll love you and it's worth it. ) <br /> <br /> Either you make the movie about a team and its looking for a championship or a movie about a player within a team and their personal effort but instead this movie tried to do everything and came out more than a few Meters ahead. The book probably showed the whole story much better; The film would have had to select an element of the story and hold on to it. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from one character dialog to flash and then months later to another character dialogue, without telling people who they were or why they were important - the QB, his sibling Called to take care of the mother - what happened to it? Because the mother was coherent at the end of the final, does that mean she's no longer crazy? His redeeming quality was the soundtrack. Buy it and watch SportsCenter highlights while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
