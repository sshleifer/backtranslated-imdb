Sure, this movie was left behind. But you expected to think the moment you looked at the cover box. It's a B-movie and the T & A factor this movie provided. Honestly, it was funnier than expected. Although it was by no means a comedy, like "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", it was worth the clock for things like B-movies <br /> Christians and morally oriented parent groups, this is a conversation for adults. If you do not want your kids to see sexual content and nudity, keep your kids away from this movie.
