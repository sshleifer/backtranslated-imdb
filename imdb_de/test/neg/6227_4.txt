This movie is not that good at all. He is pretty stupid, pretty annoying and very bad. I really only saw this movie because one of my friends said that he hated this movie. Although I did not hate him so much I still found it a pretty bad movie. The only thing remotely good was that it was sometimes a bit entertaining, and I also feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been just as well What I mean by something better is that if it had been completely reshaped, it would not look as though it had been filmed for a film festival, and if the script had been improved, it would have been an okay Slasher movie. It's not what it is now, instead , a fucking movie. Acting is cruel, I felt like I was watching a couple of teenagers posing like a Halloween show or a thrill ride or so movie themselves, and basically everything else is a lower class. Overall, this movie is really bad and you would not be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
