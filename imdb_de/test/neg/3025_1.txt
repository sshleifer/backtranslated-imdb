Dear sir. <br /> <br /> I'll say, I just watched 20 minutes of this movie. Since I'm a hardcore fan of Eraserhead, you can watch a funny black and white movie with little or no dialogue. Defense does not apply. I just can not see terrible black and white movies with little to no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie happens when you tell a fearless Goth kid with no talent and without a camera and budget, and let him / her bring as much meaningless offensive pictures as possible to the screen. It was clear from the start that this movie should have lasted 5 minutes (assuming it ever existed). Recordings that should take a few seconds will last for minutes because the director has the I-Just-Love-Sound-Of-My-Own Voice syndrome and refuses to make any further adjustments to the entire footage was viewed. From the moment the girl with the mask started masturbating the body of "God" (the opening scene of the movie! Joy!), I knew that it was only a matter of time before I turned off the tape. After at least ten minutes when another body of a group of disguised mystery men was pulled and twitched on a rope, I knew it was time to give up. Rarely do I give up a movie. I sat by Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, though not happy. This did not deserve the 20 minutes I gave him. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eraserhead, do not be persuaded by silly comparisons with the movie to rent this amateur garbage. Allow me to refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man for a worth seeing and entertaining piece of disjointed black and white comedy.
