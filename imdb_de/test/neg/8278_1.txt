For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film - and horror cinema in particular. The reviews I've written so far have respected and admired films I love, and I've eagerly rewarded them with glowing awards and a perfect ten reviews. I'm a lifelong horror movie fan and it's a great pleasure to be able to share my thoughts and ideas about great horror films with others and hopefully help people to show films they would not otherwise seek. I've only recently begun writing films for the IMDB, and it was my original intention to focus only on my personal favorites and investigate those that I believe are substance to the horror genre and have a lasting value. However, the existence of films like "Graduation Day" is a thorn in my side without wordplay. Completely free of any merit, this 1981 lot of undeformed ideas is amateurish, poorly handled, and in any way an unmitigated embarrassment to the horror cinema. During the short years before and after the release of this film, we saw the release of domestic (and Canadian) movies like "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine". "" The Prowler, "Just before dawn", "Final exam" and "Hell Night". Although these films were of varying quality, they clearly strove to achieve something in terms of storyline, plotting, acting, directing, and overall sound. Not every movie released in this prolific season of the Slasher era would be of artistic value or commercial success on the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th", but these films were all well done and clearly contributed to the further development of Wings Horror cinema "Graduation Day," a horrendous farce about a masked killer pursuing members of a high school track team, was led by Herb Freed, who can only hope that he will never again try the horror genre to sully with such a travesty. The task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. This film fails miserably on all possible levels, not only horrible wooden performances, special effects in the Dime Store, an irritating music score and above all a story without the slightest tension or tension. A pointless exercise for wasting film, "Graduation Day," is an absolute shame for the horror movie.
