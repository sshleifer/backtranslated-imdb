I just saw this movie last night and I almost cried. No, not because it totally petrified me, no. It was absolutely terrible! Sometimes you see films that ask you what humanity will become in the near future - this movie is one of them. It's as if the author, the actors, the director, etc. just came together and copied and pasted scenes from their favorite horror movies, packed everything up and said, "Hey, this is Satan's whip !!!" After seeing this movie, I could not help being tormented by the sight of people calling themselves "actors." As if they were some kind of talented artistic performer ... do not be fooled, they suck! Do not waste your time or your money !!!
