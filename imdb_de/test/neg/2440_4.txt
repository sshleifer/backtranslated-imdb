Justine can not find the perfect partner to find the perfect partner for her first time. With a geek friend in tow, she enters a virtual machine to improve her look. If she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, it will explode and the results will be left to your imagination. The problem is, how many obvious sex jokes are left? How predictable can such films be? A few funny moments here and there, but nothing too outrageous or unlike jokes in other movies or even in normal life. If you liked WEIRD SCIENCE or "fish out of the water" jokes in conjunction with "Gender Identity Crisis" then you could definitely enjoy those 90 minutes.
