I saw this movie to see where one of the most promising young talents in films was going. Unfortunately, with this film Leelee Sobieski has chosen a path that is not only leaked, but completely free from any meaningful goal. With every fraudulent trick in the book, the screen left the screen, tapped you on the back, and politely asked if he could have your heartbeats so he would get a good move. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer will feel the love shown on screen. During the emotional climax of this movie I laughed. Warmly. In order to save you time and money, I would suggest taking a meal with check syrup and Velveeta instead of this movie. It's about the same.
