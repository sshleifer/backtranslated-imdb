It's hard to find something worth celebrating with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever made, but that does not say much. The plot is pretty incoherent and unbelievable; It seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie, but decided to submerge it to participate in the success of The Abyss. In some scenes, it seems as if the story was initially put into space; The submarine has a landing gear. The technicians are worried that a rubber dive suit will break several miles, where the pressure would crush the diver and suit like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The film begins fine with planning a restoration of a lost naval submarine. After that, the movie will appear together with the siren 2. <br /> <br /> effects are so-so. The navigation screens are all running on Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983). The submarine is steered like no other submarine. Instead of control panels, the officers have keyboards to enter long sequences of numbers to control various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship is not too convincing either. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jump from unfavorable to absurd. Welcome to the 50's, you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I do not see a pleasure factor here. The movie is neither good nor funny bad in the MST3k style (until the final scene), it's like eating a slightly bad apple.
