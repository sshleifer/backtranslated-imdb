I thought that this movie could be a good parody or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. It was more like someone in high school doing their parent's camcorder. Not only is it the low budget that makes this movie bad (many great movies were made on a low budget), it's just a bad movie and it was not even bad enough to be a good camp. A typical example: Nothing happens in the first ten minutes of the movie unless the three main characters are sitting in their room, smoking dope, putting on their make-up and then answering a phone call. They keep waiting for something to set the story in motion, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn up the TV completely to almost understand what they were saying (which was not interesting anyway). When I pay to rent a movie, I usually suffer even when it's bad, but it was all I could do to get through 20 minutes. It looks as if the person in front of me had the same feeling because she did not rewind the tape and stopped in about the same place as me. The only reason why I rated this as 1 is that the rating system has no negative numbers.
