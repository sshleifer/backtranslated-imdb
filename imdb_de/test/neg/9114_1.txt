I had a bad feeling after ten seconds when a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. The uncomfortable feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory, anxious human sacrifice lowered his rearview mirror for no apparent reason to see a shadow in the backseat. For the next five minutes during the opening credits, we get a top view, in which the car swings back and forth. Only the dramatic TV movie music tells us about a murder, not a make-out session. For the next twenty-seven hours, we'll be treated to two idiotic psychotics who, for some reason, seem forced to ride together through the desert west in the southwest, chasing each other like a denied Abbot & Costello. Despite the "shocking" twists in the end, all we have to do is shake our heads and wonder if the producers and directors / writers feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should to create this inconsistent, incoherent nonsense.
