Just as CURSE OF THE KOMODO was meant for the genre of creatures, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straightforward parody of slasher films like SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psychologist who escaped from his upholstered cell (... he was thrown into the garbage thanks to the killing of eleven people), works in the mountainous area of ​​Bobcat County and attacks anyone within his reach. A pack of cheerleaders, their teacher, two equipment hands and the driver are on the way to a competition, if their vehicle has no more fuel during a supposed shortcut, so as not to have to return. Fortunately, the group finds a cabin in front of them, but falls victim to a murderer who attacks each victim individually. The psychopaths in the county could not have killed a girl because she was in a cheerleader's locker room while he was elsewhere, which means someone among them is the culprit. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his deputy track their psycho's whereabouts while trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad. <br /> <br /> Seen cheaply on video, Wynorski does all he can with the limit. Clever ways must be found for the budget to assassinate characters off screen without having to afford the luxury of truly effective special effects. In other words, many melons were stabbed, and the sound effect let us know that certain victims were torn into darkness by a black gloved hand and died wildly. Wynorski contains a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE about Brinke Stevens' character Linda being chased by a killer with a drill (this killer and Linda are both dead, but I think Wynorski still wanted to connect his movie to this movie.) pretty bad though .. it was nice to see them, even if it was a cameo. Tamie Sheffield, as Miss Hendricks, the teacher of the students in trouble, has a long bathing scene in the shower that lathers her naked body and her false breasts. The girls that make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing because they are obviously in their twenties. The aging softcore pornstar Samantha Philips (as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she seeks) and Nikki Fritz (a hiker who falls victim to jogging over a dangerous bridge) do not have to undress surprisingly , Wynorski veterinarians Bill Langlois Monroe (as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (as a detective supporting Murdock in his case) are signing the search for John Colton's serial killer McPherson. Interestingly, McPherson's story serves as McGuffan, for in fact the meat of the movie is dedicated to the cheerleader group and its dangerous situation. I'm not sure Slasher fans will love this movie because it takes too long for the kills to flare up and when they come into the picture, the violence is not strong enough or shocking to satisfy them.
