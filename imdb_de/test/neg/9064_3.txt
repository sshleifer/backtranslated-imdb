Honestly - this short film is shit. The dummy used in the Necro scene is pretty well made, but still looks spurious to ruin the viewing experience. The DVD without Earth is clear and clear and I have not decided if this helps or hinders. If the film was a bit grainy, it could have added a certain "scary factor." I have no idea why this film surrounds so much hype besides the theme - but frankly, the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are more shocking than AFTERMATH. All the talk about the film about loneliness and all other kinds of deep philosophy is bull ****. This is an expensive, nicely filmed crap. It's not that shocking, it's not so disgusting. If you insist on seeing it, rent it. I give a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit films about necrophilia (there should definitely be more choices for us sick;) - the shootings are good and there is something "gore" (if you look gummy Looking at the doll.) Is considered bloody ...), but otherwise - absolutely nothing for this exaggerated chaos. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's "sequel" by AFTERMATH (now released as "Double Feature" by Unearthed Films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film. It really shows what a good director Cerda really is when he gets the right material. Although AFTERMATH does not interest me at all, GENESIS is so well done that I will forgive Cerda and definitely look after him in the future ...
