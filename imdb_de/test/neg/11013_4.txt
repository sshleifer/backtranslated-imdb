If you really really REALLY enjoy movies, where ants build filthy mirrors, eat non-ants, and conquer the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a few scientists working from a bio-dome are communicating with highly intelligent ants (the smartest actors in the film) to try and thwart their conquest and extermination plans. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl they've rescued from the ants) use whatever they have (computers, green dyes, and terrible drama), but to no avail. I think they could not afford pesticides because the movie was over too fast. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie "Phase IV" is a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts right after the opening balance, while "Phase IV" is not reached until the end of the credits. Apparently, the director knew that the film would be boring to get through, and placed stages 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: "Come in, buddy, just one more phase to the end credits!" As an MST3K episode, it was not very good for two reasons: 1) This version is from the first season of KTMA when they first started, so riffing is not as good as in later seasons. and 2) This movie is so bad that not even J & TB can lighten it. There are one or two Gamera references as they have just riffled 5 Gamera films. <br /> <br /> The film has a surprise ending, but I was so happy to end up with the effect that was lost to me.
