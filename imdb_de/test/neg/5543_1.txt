Well, they made a new pumpkin-head movie again, the first pumpkin-head movie was perfect for their time, a stupid, bloody and clich√©d monster movie. So it goes on, someone loses his loved one, goes to the witch in the forest, makes them to lift pumpkin head and let all those responsible murder. Unfortunately, the filmmakers have considered it irrelevant to do anything other than that, for the fourth outing of the film, which considers it far more appropriate to add some lame Romeo and Juliet sub-plot, with an idiotic family feud (over a car! !!) and surprise you with some bloody pumpkin seed killings, so far so formulaic, but it does not stop. The acting talent in this movie is bleak ... oh, so bad that half of them can not even sustain a southern accent without slipping into their native and often posher accents. Lance henrikssen is on board, so he would certainly bring some gravitas into the filming ... but no lance just walks around on the canvas, dropping the words out of his mouth without any emotion or apparent direction, and walking away, I think Frankly, he's just turned around for the money and then went to his trailer to be drunk and remember aliens. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete nonsense. There are no salvation characteristics other than the end credits that make up everything. <br /> <br /> despite the shortcomings of ph: bf ... if you want a breeze that makes you laugh for the wrong reasons, have a look. <br /> <br /> If you want something with an Abitus, avoid more meat and originality.
