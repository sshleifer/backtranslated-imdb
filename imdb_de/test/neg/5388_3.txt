This movie may be great, but it's a complete departure from Bill Forsythe's comfort and joy. C & J is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen without becoming diabetic. <br /> <br /> It's okay if you like it, but realize that EVERYTHING in this movie is a direct rip off. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost everything from forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That Sinking Feeling. I prefer to go for a few tonight. Local Has a young Peter Capaldi and an old Burt Lancaster. Unfortunately, he gave up filming after a really shitty treatment in Hollywood. Sad.
