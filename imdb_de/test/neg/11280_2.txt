I have published these 2 stars out of a possible 10. <br /> <br /> I went into that question and did not realize what it was - and realized that it was obviously a kind of African musical - because people broke into a song every few minutes None of the songs rhyme, most do not really say anything reasonable, and they all have the same nonexistent melody - if you could call them a "melody". <br /> <Karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman with the longest pigtails I've ever seen. [The actress looks like she's probably modeled a bit.] <br /> <br /> The film opens in a women's prison, although it's not like any other jail I've ever heard or heard of - the Inmates wear what they want - and seems to have a party. Karmen is dancing wildly, and prison guard Angelique [a gorgeous pretty woman] is definitely interested in eroticism. She and Karmen are dancing together. Later, Karmen visits the Guardian's room and they love each other - unfortunately the scene is not detailed and very brief, although there are some nudity. Karmen then escapes from jail and next you see her dancing In front of another group where a man named Lamine, maybe a colonel, never quite knew who he was, watching her. He's with a young woman who does not like Karmen's seductive dance, and there's a dance evening between the two women. <br /> <br /> Then the story [as it is] gets even more confused. <br /> <br /> With Lamine in jail, out of jail and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> More singing. More dancing and a scene from Angelique, who obviously suffers from a heartbreak. <br /> <br /> The film confused until the end and I sighed with relief that it was over. <br /> <br /> <br />
