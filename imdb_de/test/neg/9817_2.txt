An absurd dichotomy confusingly amateurish and incompetent - or perhaps more, since the unbelievable lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and more, combined with Walter Pidgeon's bovine charm attempts to create a cinema classic to give some of Fritz Lang's other amazing failures. (I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang, but apparently not - it could have been twins.) If you can not predict the end out of multiple time zones, you're not really living. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed with such a terrible crap (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can wash my mind off by putting Viaggio in instead) Italia look and for the umpteenth time). <br /> <br /> Will someone use a DVD once? (It's possible to make a film about the genesis of this horrible movie and how many talented people could be so completely wasted).
