Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as it was originally, but just as funny. The film itself lacked details that contained the original, which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel that was made to make money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainers' terrible apologies for flashbacks ruined the film and seemed like a bad way to get the audience to adapt more to the character. Total Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel that was not needed without the original charm, the soul and the spark.
