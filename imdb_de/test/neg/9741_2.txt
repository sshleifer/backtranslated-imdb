Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife Joan like to sleep with their heads under the covers and feet on the pillows. They have two equally vulnerable children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid realizes that his trash has disappeared ... it must be someone stealing him from the curb. He starts in roller blades for the garbage truck. When he finally comes to the dump, he is surprised when he learns that not only "garbage of other people" was stolen, but that there is a secret organization meeting in the landfill. He is determined to defeat the world's garbage pits, it seems. In the meantime, Petunia and Buster visit the police station and a Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, because Joan is also missing. Will they beat their problems? This is just a stupid, stupid movie, the culprit is the terrible screenplay. The books by Allard and Marshall are hysterical and only a few situations from the books end in this movie. Arnold is actually quite nice when Mr. Stupid and the other actors try very, very hard to get the movie to work. The production values ​​are very high, with the dog and the cat, who are among the idiots, giving the movie a little boost. But it's all in vain, as the conspiracy goes around and is weak. Maybe someday someone will make another attempt to translate the very funny Allard books to the big screen. If you enjoy laughing, rent something else while you wait for a new production, and definitely get the books as well. But stay away from being stupid yourself, because if you look at this movie to the end, you can hardly call it intelligent.
