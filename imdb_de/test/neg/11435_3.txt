I was told that Jon was on spiritual experiences for a while. I suspected that the movie will be interesting. Not at all. Not so profound for such a topic. "Eternity" never ending life. Experiences after death and "Dejavu". The film is not a comedy, but not funny at all, at least not yet expressed. It is so naive. Charming movie, but naive movie. A must to avoid. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to come directly from fairy tales and it is not at all the matter. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight does his best. Normal is co-producer and scriptwriter of this movie. The movie was started directly on video, so I discovered it in a video library. It's a pity, because I know that Voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film is not that profound.
