The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films that Charlie Bronson filmed in the '80s. Unlike most of the Cannon movies in which Charlie starred, this movie was neither funny nor entertaining. Charlie tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see that! <br /> <br /> In this case, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the people that the person complaining to Chuck or his people has to pay the piper. That's not fun. It's not kitschy or fightless, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I did not like these. I have no love for this movie. No recommendations, as it is not worth seeing. Maybe if they did not condemn it. Be careful with care. <br /> <br /> Do not bother.
