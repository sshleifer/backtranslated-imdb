I sat through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look at IMDB here, although it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surprised. Although yes. I'm very impressed with the acting skills of Robin and Matt, they still have not saved the movie. I'm not sure what I really did not like about the movie. Maybe it's because I'm teaching math. Maybe I'm not too much for bleak talking for 2 hours. Although I loved "American Beauty," but that was it. I only want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If something is missing in this film, please send me an email. I'm curious why this is in the first 250. And do not say "Because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
