To be honest, I have not seen much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I seem to recall that they postponed it in the weekly schedule. Some shows are not worth following every week. But I really tried it first, so it was not all bad. Maybe I just expected it to improve, but I can not give this show a 1. Honestly, I can not give her more than a 2. <br /> <br /> It was not MASH (I will not type these stupid ones * every time). And it was trying to be MASH without trying, as if it were just magical. Guess what? No magic The best thing I can do here is compare it to other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D. was by far a much better show. You should, however, B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ, but not at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else in mind, just change his name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH, it was not the only successor who completely bombarded and dishonored the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame sequel to All In The Family. It had no heart, no conflict, no depth? all the things that make All In the Family so memorable. Similarly, MASH was funny because the doctors responded to the impossible absurdity of the war. Remove the war and remove the drive for 99% of the humor. Potter can not yell at Klinger for wearing a dress because Klinger wears no dress because he does not try to get kicked out of the army because he's already dropped out of the army because the war is over. (exhale) All the jokes were forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer to watch the show. <br /> <br /> And by all accounts, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger, and Mulcahy, who just stood unnatural and liked to face the audience a trio of vaudeville artists. It was reminiscent of Good Times, where 90% of the show spent standing behind the couch and talking to the audience to try to make it look like they were having natural conversation. They were not And on After MASH it felt even less natural. <br /> <br /> Another coincidence that I remember is that the people who did MASH did not get royalties from the spin-off. The studio used the absurd apology that After MASH was really a spin-off of the MASH movie they owned, not the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I suspect studio managers will do anything for a bit of money. Anything but a worthwhile sequel.
