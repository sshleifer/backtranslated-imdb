This is the one movie that presents everything that is bad in the movie business. The actors are pathetic and the script is terrible. The special effects, if any, are so bad that it would be better to use cartoons instead. Besides, it's great! I think the creators of the movie meant humor, but I just laughed when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and the colorful costumes everyone had. The scenes in the end were good, but they were not part of the movie. In the end, you will ask yourself, "Why did I waste my time and money with this crap when I was able to grow the plants or move the clouds?" I do not think I'm a critic or anything, but this is a really lame movie! DO NOT LOOK! DANGER OF DUPIDITY OVERLOAD!
