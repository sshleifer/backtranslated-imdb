This is probably the worst of the most important films by Ava Gardner. Yes, she is beautiful. But that may diminish over time, especially after the insane and predictable end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend to be Eddie Bracken (which has certainly embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) role. Dick Haymes plays a kind of weak buddy (!), And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a number of other clever female half-comedians). Yes, the movie contains a well known song "Speak Low". But look at the other, completely forgotten parts. Of course, Dick Haymes sings very well, and so does the singer not playing the credits for Ava. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the script is filled with clich√©s and failed humor, and Tom Conway looks like he's been fighting alcohol (as he actually was). In short, if you want to see Ava in bloom, buy a photo and stay away from this movie.
