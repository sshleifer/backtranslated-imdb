Caricature of the 1940s, which today is probably banned because of the 'Black Beauty' gag in which Daffy rides a black horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in a bookstore where the characters of The Books come alive every night. So we have, among others, the Ugly Duck (Daffy) and the wolf of Wall Street. You find yourself in a chase after the Wolf has tricked Daffy with a fake duck (hence the title). The persecution is all that is in this little cartoon, all that has no real appeal these days. Just kidding, if you're a fan of Looney Tunes, I think ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
