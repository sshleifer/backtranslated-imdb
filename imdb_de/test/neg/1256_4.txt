Well, the movie was not that bad, but whoever created the script did not even create the essence of being hungry. This movie was a bit below average and did not tell the story on one of the most interesting people ever born. I suggest reading the book "one of a kind". They left out large parts of his life. Sometimes they did not understand the true Caractor he was. The actual facts of his life were temporarily out of order. And in the end, they really did not portray the actual personality he had. So please do not watch the movie; read the book. By the way, I'm not just an idiot who feels 100% dependent on the real story, but they did not even come close !!!
