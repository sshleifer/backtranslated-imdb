This movie was completely outdated and uninspired. The central premise of this film was essentially a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barber shop exchanging painfully unstable drummers. I did not even laugh during the entire movie. I could have sat in any hair salon in America and heard that banal banter and maybe even had a decent haircut. I can not understand why this mess got positive reviews, much less why so many people wereted money on it. None of the characters here were funny or worth taking care of. I really did not care if the rival barber shop across the street forced Nappy Cutz to go out of business. Do not waste your money on this, folks, because this is the only way to make Hollywood stop producing those Shambolic trash pieces. 1 * of 5
