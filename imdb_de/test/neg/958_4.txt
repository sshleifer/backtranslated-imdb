This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Flat from the start, 'D.O.A.' At least it starts off as if it were a smooth, entertaining piece of nonsense like Finchers 'The Game'. His central character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that seem to show a twisted and cunning thriller. However, the plot rattles off too fast, resulting in a dramatic twist that does not pervade halfway when the character learns he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days left to live. And that's just too big to casually add to a story. Once this is done, the only chance of success in the film is that he regards a person's psychology in this situation as his main theme, in fact his only topic: but "D.O.A." continues, as if this were just a normal revelation like any other you would normally find in a thriller. The problem is twofold: First, Quaid's actions do not convince, as it is likely that someone is in his situation; and secondly, even if they were convincing, it is difficult to worry about what happens next, when the most important point of the conspiracy has already been prematurely resolved. The rest of the film is quite common for a film of this kind, but is bored by the somewhat overbearing of the characters boring than usual, which logically outshines the events that the film is interested in. Convince yourself neither as a burned-out professor nor as a man who should die: Meg Ryan is just as annoying and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly sound of the 80s. Instead, look at 'The Game', which remains closely and character-driven by similar roots, while 'D.O.A.' Drifts into developments that only undermine one's own premise. Since the premise in itself is quite intriguing, it's a shame to see that she drowned in an excess of excessive plot.
