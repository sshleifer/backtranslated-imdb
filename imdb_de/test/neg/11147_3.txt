The plot of this movie amounts to Ah-nuld against Satan. I remember the film most about explosions, shots, blood and noise. Let's not forget the flammable satanic urine. The story is nonsensical, absolutely predictable and so full of holes that I could not take it seriously. Stay with "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a really good devil movie and ... um, I can not think of any good action movies right now (probably because they're so far-and- little in-between), so you're alone in this category, this strip gets me a rating of 3 out of 10 for its stock value and a pretty good performance from Gabriel Byrne as that old Debbil Satan!
