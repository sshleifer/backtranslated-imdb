I was really impressed with the movie that watched the promos and looked at it. FDFS The movie was horrible, to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they come to London, things are fun but slow The tempo is getting quieter and they are not kidding about it. <br /> <br /> The Manoj Joshi subplot is funny in places, but unwanted and contributes to boredom. <br /> <br /> The drug part is funny, especially the monologue by Govinda <br /> <br /> The movie goes on aimlessly, just like a little kid wrote it. <br /> <br /> The interval brings a twist to the story, but until then I have lost hope. > <br /> The second half starts okay, but the way things are handled makes a mockery. The entire angle of Arbaaz-Jackie is half finished. How do people get to not identify them? <br /> <br /> The climax is pretty big funny, if stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not at all in his elements, from this movie he made craps and his films became bad and bad. Music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN and AFREEN to Camera Work I'm good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has got white in his stubble and looks old, but he does fine, though that role he's been for many Male has done, works. But thanks to his natural comedy, things are bearable. Govinda looks bad His act, except monologue is too boring, too surprising. From Govinda he seems to put too much pressure on him, and Priyan fails to use him. Paresh is okay in part, but overall the act repeats itself. Manoj Joshi is weird in places looks overweight and acts asleep in sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad, Lara Dutta screams to glory, but can not act
