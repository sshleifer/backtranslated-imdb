Everyone knows that late-night movies are not Oscar candidates. Fine. I mean, I admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and thought I was going to get some skin flush. It's pretty bad when the information on the TV program channel makes fun of the movie in the description. There was even a half star. To be fair, I threw the whole thing because it was sooooooooooo bad. I could not stop laughing. I mean the words that come out of these mouths and how they are serious. Most of the time, I think people on the screen are trying their best not to laugh. I think they laughed in one scene. The movie did not make sense anyway. It was like that one fat-gay episode of Sopranos. Only the sopranos are a great show. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, only sex scenes from the 90s. You know the kind that uses shadows and silhouettes instead of meat. I gave it two because this movie makes for a good movie. I mean all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. When it's late at night, and everything on TV, this and that Tony Little guy and his exercise coach, I suggest Tony Little.
