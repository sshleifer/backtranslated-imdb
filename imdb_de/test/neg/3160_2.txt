Spheeris used this documentary to advance a stereotype of punks. This documentation is biased and directed, not objective. The cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview can be used to put the interviewee's spoken word out of context. If you look at the movie, the persistent idea from the punks' interviews is that they are pretty stupid. Band members and other punks seem to be less intelligent and unable to explain their motives or to give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all. I strongly doubt that if some respondents knew what Spheeris created or saw the final product, they could be included in the project. This film casts punks in a bad light, making them look dumb and stupid. Spheeris' film should not be considered a representation of the punk scene of L.A. If you want to watch a good punk documentary watch "Another State of Mind" with Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.
