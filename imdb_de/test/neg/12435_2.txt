I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow I was dragged to almost every one of his films. Well, I like independent movies and I grew up with punk rock, and I want to say that this movie is disappointing for both viewers. Not every punk song contains "Oi!" In his choruses, as in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this movie is that it changes mood every 15 minutes and has no cohesion. Clark earns his living by making his fictionalized stories "like children really are," and as such, allow him ten minutes of stupid dialogues that go nowhere, because that's the cinematic feeling he wants. But when he does a ridiculous death scene (choose one of them apart from the opening pass), the over-stylized attempts I suspect to be black humor are completely out of context, in most cases ridiculously shot far worse than a student film) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of history. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" make bad bedfellows as the rambles into the latter style take you out of every kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - a really, very, very bad one.
