I saw cheats with my friend a few years ago. He made it a great funny movie, one of the best comedies of all time. I think he was down or something. I recently learned that this movie did not hit theaters. I can understand why that is perfect. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of guys cheating on pretty much all their assignments at school to get high grades. That's the main problem of this movie, that the moral is all bad. There are other teen comedy films where students do bad things, but most of the time they are things that are not done at school. So I think the concept of having a whole movie where kids basically cheat on everything is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I did not like the characters in this movie either. The main character is a completely self-satisfied arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. I am not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist because everyone at school is cheating on what is wrong. The other minor characters were not funny at all and basically the cast hits in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad message and even worse drama and characters. There are other teenage movies that are much better than this movie. So you do not have to watch this movie and that's a good thing, because I do not recommend this movie at all.
