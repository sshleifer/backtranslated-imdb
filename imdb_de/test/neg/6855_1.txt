These rubber monsters did not manage to be cool, scary or even funny. Looks like a wannabe movie by Porkys or Animals House, but the sequences and the story are not always clear and can not grab your attention. The whole movie looks cheap and is amazingly bad taste, the only thing that makes you laugh are the horrible rubber monsters that cost a dollar because the work or they never look realistic, the movements and expressions the muppets as Make a Pixar 3D movie look like this when you compare them. Hope Marie Carlton is the only one to support this horrible movie, and if she dies in the movie, it will be even worse than before. A film that can only be seen in fast forward.
