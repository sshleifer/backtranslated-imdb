This movie was one of the few that really hurt me. Anyone who thinks it would be fun to see his mother in a crowded disco full of people only half as old as he has invented "a totally ridiculous dance" that is "hip" in a totally misguided effort ( in the language) of this age). It was hard to see Ingrid Bergman leaning over to such a miserable performance on the disco dance floor. I was embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the music in the disco was not realistic at all - it's the wrong idea of ​​a Hollywood director about what pop music looked like back then. This is always embarrassing in most films of that time - the replacement music is canned and has only a painful, transient resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the '60s. Mathau is as hopeless as a Miscast a kind of lady-man; he just looks awesome grotesque. Hawn's far-flung innocence is just too stupid. The pretty neighbor in her apartment is far too serious and seriously portrayed. He seems to be a Brady boy who lost himself in this farce. Painful, miserable mess.
