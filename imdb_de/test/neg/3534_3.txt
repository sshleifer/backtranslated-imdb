This is Wes Craven in his worst form! This is the worst horror. If you can call it horror, you'll ever watch, especially by one of the masters of horror. Wes Craven, Poor Direction, Poor Acting, Poor Set, Poor Atmosphere makes this the biggest garbage dump ever! The villain is absolutely unconvincing, you can not even apologize for the guy! The blood and the horror of the movie are ridiculous, it's just garbage! The only good points I can think of are: It plays Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but even this cast could not prevent them from getting out of control and becoming one of the worst horror ever. If you still do not see it, do not worry, you will just hate it.
