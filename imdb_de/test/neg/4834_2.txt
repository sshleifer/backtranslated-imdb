I saw it on TV and wanted to see it because I remembered the article in the spin magazine on which the film was based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the lead actor in a movie, it should be a sign that this is not exactly an A-list production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately not a great actor. <br /> <br /> Actually, the drama in this movie is either flat or hammy, which is only attributable to the director, which is the weakest link in this movie. Charles Carner seemed to be trying to monkey Oliver Stone's "JFK" in the alleged plot to cover up the "real" kidnapper, but without the benefit of a good script, an A-list actor or such a talent said. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that such a worthy theme was not treated better for a movie.
