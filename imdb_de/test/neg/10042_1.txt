I love ghost stories and end up watching a movie, even though I do not really enjoy it. I rarely feel like wasting my time ... BUT this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was terrible! <br /> <br /> It was not scary at all. What about the funny relief moments? The dialogue was boring. Inconsistent act The film was much too long and some scenes were shown unnecessarily in my public. (Like the birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good thought I can mention is that costumes and props were done well. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about other adjustments, but until then I'll continue reading about the story.
