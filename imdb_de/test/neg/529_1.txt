Just terrible I'm adding a spoiler alert here just because a coupla joke from the movie is included - otherwise there's nothing to spoil as it's already lazy. This slag was made at a time when Sellers had been on a "For a few dollars more" series when he took part in a few dollars' of manure. I had seen that in 1972 as a 15-year-old high school student and then detested. No need to look at it again; After 35 years, I now remember one of the top five of the worst movies I saw as a kid. Sellers, as far as I remember, had a sequential cameo role rather than a lead role here, but even his presence could not improve the outdated jokes, the lame plan, and the infantile repetition. One ongoing theme is the use of Sellers' fingers: in one scene, he holds his open hand up to a group of paramedics, and by dropping his fingers he enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists - the interns, the Nurses, the stewards, etc. - until only his middle finger is left, whereupon he says "... and the patients!" Har Har. In another scene, to avoid costly lab tests, he dips a finger into a urine sample and puts it in his mouth to look for sugar, and reminds the interns gathered around him to do the same thing they do. Then he advises them that he put his middle finger in the urine, but sucked his forefinger, and warned her to be attentive. Hee Hee. (The only reason why I remember this film and this movie and write this article is that a friend told me today a stupid version of this "joke"). If you do that, you will be loving. If not, see "Hospital" with George C. Scott (same year, 1972), for some real, wonderful black medical humor. Better yet, read "The House of God" by Samuel Shem, and if you can, you will see the movie version of it that has never been published (please make a copy and send it to me - I would like to see it). ) it).
