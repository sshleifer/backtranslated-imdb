This film suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no idea how Jackie Chan would be packed for the masses. His low-budget films in Hong Kong were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic abilities and his talent for light comedy. His early Hollywood movies put him in the same films that were packed for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian except that he is the star. In his Hong Kong films, Chan is never bored, the movies are one fast martial arts sequel after another, but "The Protector" is lifeless. Danny Aiello does not have much work to work with, and the lack of chemistry between the two is more likely to be a result of the script and direction than the interaction between the two actors. Both were better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie are the settings of Hong Kong. The worst part is that Jackie Chan is so colorless and drab. It would not be before the Canadian "Rumble in the Bronx" that the West would finally find out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
