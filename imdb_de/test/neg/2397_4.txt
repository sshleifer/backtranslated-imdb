Your time and brain are much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's war. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the most beautiful character of the film, Gust, the Greek, and plays him as a eunuch. Gust is a hard core in the book and completely free to voice his opinion. In the movie, he is not even shown as equally important to Charlie. And poor Charlie never gets blood (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is too bland and the story is too old for our modern age. The end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which was not Reagan's, not the result) by a well-funded group of people who were extremely ready to fight, we do not care. Not quite the lesson we need to hear and see, considering how well the wars are going in Iraq and Afghanistan. (As I read the book, I always got that feeling of deja vu, except that it was today).
