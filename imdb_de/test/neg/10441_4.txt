The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on the Troma DVD is disappointing. This seems to be a censored imprint for television. Some of the more violent scenes were edited and parts of the colorful language were removed. Anyone who has watched the movie uncut will go crazy with this poisonous DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theater cut. Despite being released on DVD, the film is still one of the better portrayals of Bushranger life in nineteenth-century Australia. After visiting Old Melbourne Gaol with captive death masks, it's "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to my mind.
