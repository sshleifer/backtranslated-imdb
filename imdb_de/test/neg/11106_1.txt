Horrible script that apparently was headed by ... nobody? The Marines can not fend off the monster with machine guns, but it dodges when a 15-year-old karate girl kicks it a few times. It's supposed to be a luxury liner, but the Fancy Dining Room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. It would appear that they hired a high school for the summer and pulled out chairs and other things to decorate the set. In the end, they are pulled out of the water and pulled into a boat, and less than three seconds later they are apparently about three kilometers from the ship as it sinks. How are these films made? I think everyone can be in a movie these days. Aaron James, NYC
