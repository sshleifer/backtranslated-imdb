I'm a Boorman fan, but that's probably his least successful movie. The comedy has never been his strength, and here his attempts at screwball farce become awkward. For Boorman's eye, it's almost worth seeing when it comes to talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first leading roles, and as always, she's thrilled. (As a sad side note Boorman wrote the screenplay with his daughter Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
