I love to disassemble this movie. My colleagues are always trying to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this one is appreciated. Here are some reasons why: A: The plot goes from the hijacked road trip movie to the vampire-infested strip bar slasher movie with no setup whatsoever. Suddenly, something very real becomes something wrong. This is like putting the audience on a Thanksgiving holiday and then exploding it with dynamite. B: This untalented Juliette Lewis is in there. C: There are many absurd ideas like real torso-and-leg guitars, siblings with the last name "Gecko", bad make-up jobs for vampires, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?), And a weapon in the crotch who only fires "straighten up" and belongs to a man who calls himself "Sex Machine". If Robert Rodriguez did not try to be so innovative with his violence, maybe I would have enjoyed this obvious popcorn movie. The whole project is as if he got the ideas through playing with action figures. The only thing that's almost considered my favorite scene is George Clooney's weird soliloquy after he killed his bloody, awesome-looking brother who's hot for kids. I swear, I think they made it up here and there. This film wants to offend and offend those who want the offensive. Terrible movie.
