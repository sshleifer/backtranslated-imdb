The movie made no sense to me at all. Good actors (SergioCastellittoaparticular favorite, great in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker", but this was done by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director, as opposed to the mediocre director who made that effort), but horrible, changing screenplays , terrible cut and a director who apparently had no idea what he wanted to say, and in the end said exactly nothing. A terrible load of garbage, but the kind of film that certain Italian pseudo-intellectuals I had come to know in the dark and distant past would have loved, and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on them, they are everywhere and likely to find it Do this as a great masterpiece. I have never thought much of Bellochio as a director. I remember seeing his first movie "PugniNella Tasca" / "Fists in the Pocket" (or a similar title) in Rome when first shown 50 years ago (I was living there then). All the usual pseudo rave about it, but it left me pretty cold. I did not think he was a great director then and still not. Age certainly has not improved it, and this movie must be considered one of its worst.
