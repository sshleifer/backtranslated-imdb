This movie must be rated "Welcome to the Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" out of sheer fear of God. They have the most disconcerting heroine in the history of the story, who spends most of their time sobbing, lamenting and screaming - all the time in the most horrendous restroom toilet ever to feature film. Why she spends so much time in this horrible bathroom from hell is never explained. Even if the killer's ordinary driver tries to assassinate her, she refuses to leave the Crapper. When a motorcycle cop comes to their rescue, the driver of the killer truck runs over the policeman's legs while the heroine is watching. Instead of grabbing his weapon for protection, she tows the poor guy in the chisel and locks the door. Then the policeman orders her to blow out his brain because of the pain. She does it - while she whines and sobs and hurts - and blows the back of his head off. Then - the surviving police officer asks her to shoot him again because he is still in pain. He says this while his entire back of the head is on the floor. The sobbing, howling heroine shoots him again. The movie goes on and on, nothing makes sense. The heroine is so unwelcome that you really want the killer to let her go early. I saw this streak on the sci-fi channel, so it did not cost me anything to see it, but still I saw out of pure fascination how a movie can end so terribly.
