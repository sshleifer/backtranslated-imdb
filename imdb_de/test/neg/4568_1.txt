Completely idiotic "jokes" that fall flat, amateurish drama (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogues that are mediocre at best. After watching this movie you have to wonder how in the world a producer might come across such a project and think, "I MUST make this film". No wonder there was no theatrical release.
