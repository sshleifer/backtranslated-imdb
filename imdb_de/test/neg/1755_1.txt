What gives Anthony Minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction? First, he destroyed the English patient, which was bad enough, but now I realize he slaughtered Cold Mountain - slaughtered !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to the English patient. My son and I looked at the first weekend when it came out and I was so disappointed but told my son I felt like I needed to read the book. I went straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what critics around the world were talking about when they said that Minghella had enough confidence in the moviegoers' intelligence to give them a great movie. Surely he did not do that. <br /> <br /> I do not usually read a lot of fiction, but Cold Mountain was so much recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I did not see Cold Mountain, the movie, when he was in the movie theaters, and that was also because of what Minghella had done to the English patient. But I rented it like a fool today, and I'm so upset that I had to give free rein to my frustration and especially my grief that someone could have taken that beautiful story and turned it into something almost beautiful in the world Screen, and now they will never. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND RETAIN THE FILM ON THE SHELF RED. I will never be picked up by a Minghella project again. I think he's one of the worst directors working today, and I'm sick of praising the Hollywood crowd on his head. It must be that nobody reads in Hollywood anymore. This movie bears no resemblance to the book, except the names of the characters. Minghella's ego has no boundaries, and if he did not like the book, why did not he write his own script and leave the book alone? Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider this film the worst I've seen since 2003. and I've seen almost everything that has been released in the US. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you will not like them either.
