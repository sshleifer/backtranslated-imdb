To sum up, skip End of Days and look instead at the ninth goal of Roman Polanski. This movie is the perfect stereotypical American movie against Ninth Gate, which is the perfect stereotypical European movie. <br /> <br /> Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, well-rated, atmospheric, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful landscapes, good cinematography, funny one-liners, intellectual, minimal expression, thought-provoking. The only flaw is that some people did not understand the open end and said the movie was "crappy" and there were some questionable scenes. <br /> <br /> End of Days: Overly violent, liberal use of bad language, NO musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne trudged as Satan in New York (USA) all that could be selected was incomprehensible screaming from Korn Davis) had nothing to do with the plot, violence, unpredictable violence, and did I mention much more violence? I think some of the special effects were good, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I was wrong, but I thought that Ninth Gate was far more interesting, original and intelligent. But maybe the Americans do not need that. * dripping with cynicism * Although I'm American, I sometimes wonder.
