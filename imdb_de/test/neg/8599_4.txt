Well, I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start. I also like toilet humor. Like Young Ones and Bottom, etc. This did not even bring a little <br /> <br/> little smile to my face. The story tells Johnny around after his wife threw him out (how he got to his handsome wife and child, I do not know) while trying to exploit everything that moves. Normal mistake I was looking forward to it, but found it totally boring and a waste of my time altogether. Unless you are stuck for 90 minutes beyond washing the car, then do not bother ..... <br /> <br />
