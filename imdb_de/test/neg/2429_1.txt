It hurts that a fantastic movie turns into a lame, repetitive and lazy series. It's filled with potholes and the plot is confusing in a bad way. Whoever was the spiked who decided to turn such a great movie into garbage, would have had to do some research, rather than confront him with one-liners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes from the first movie "Over And Over" and " Over Over "to fill up again. Sure, they get a bit creative, but it's like watching the same episode with a twist. Pretty much like Creed or Nickleback. Kuzco has to protect himself from failure, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to save time easily and just use a potion, someone asks the monkey and the beetle, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she Yzma disguises herself as "Principal Amzy" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit, this show has its moments. Another problem is that Yzma looks younger and Pacha ... looks weird. Nobody can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Yours, Kuzco and Pacha have made Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I'm giving this show two thumbs down.
