My main criticism of the movie is the animation. I fully agree with everyone else that it was very bad. Some of the characters seemed to have dark skin tones than in the first movie, which is much better. The background colors were rough and somewhat static. It's a pity that Michael J. Fox did not speak to Milo, he did such a good job, and James Arnold Taylor was not sure if he should sound like Milo or Aladdin. I have also considered the lack of a good plot. The third story was confusing and awkward told, and the second story suffered from poor scripts. To make things worse, the first thing I can not remember, except for a fishing village that is being persecuted or something like that. However, there was some nice music and good vocal talents from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the movie from the catastrophe. All in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
