OK, if you are looking for a fun lesbian game. This is NOT the movie. If you're looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the vane of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things'), this is NOT the movie if you're looking for a classic vampire-lesbian temptation movie. This is NOT the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you want to waste an hour of your life, this is your movie. It is badly written, badly directed, poorly rated, badly filmed. It had bad special effects ... I mean really bad special effects. I think Imovie Lol can actually produce the same special effects. <br /> <br /> IT IS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL FILM. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic starlet beauties, but looked more like porn out of stars. It's turned like a softcore porn, but you never get the money, and the actors look bored out of their heads. The "Girl on Girl" scenes, which by the way suck, were so LAME that it was hardly worth mentioning. Check out the "Fast Sex Scenes" on youtube, because that's the only reason you want to watch this movie, and even that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> A WAST OF MONEY AND TIME !!! Do not even record it, look instead at "Cruel Intentions 2" - the same movie with no bad special effects, bad plot, bad writing, bad dialogue and bad acting. Actually, I could look at it now just to purify my mind
