This movie has entertained me with a lot of laughter about the actors who were running the movie in all sorts of crazy ways. If you like suggestive language and sexy-looking girls, they were all in the picture, and the girls and boys all looked burned out even before they graduated from high school. There is a scene where teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then throw it into a lake or a sea, which is repeated over and over again. There's no horror in this movie except the word Horrible for the whole picture, and Arnold, who plays a plastic cop, is really a sick character. Please do not waste your time watching this movie.
