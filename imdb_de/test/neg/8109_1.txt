There might be a couple of Spoilers Ahead, but I doubt it. I have no idea how the script for this movie passed the shredder. It is terrible. Totally unsurpassed I stayed there for 45 minutes (about half the runtime) and just could not take it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fanatic in the 1990s (see "The War"), and this year I've taken the shifts of Mandy Moore from bubbly too seriously (see "Chasing Liberty," which is surprisingly entertaining). I have seen pieces from "Run Lola Run". For three leads, I liked that to be okay. It was not no one has shown a good performance. Woods Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer, he had almost no imagination (his violent fantasies looked like they had been torn off by "A Christmas Story", and his lusty ones were - hm, a mixture of boring and worrying behavior). Potente is utterly unlikely from the first second and I would just know that she should be "THE girl" when I read the box. Speaking of synopsis - whoever was hired for this job made the movie funny, quirky, romantic and quite enjoyable. Whoever that person was, should rewrite this script. Halfway, NONE of the characters interested me anymore. Moores Lisa is an up and coming actress who is bubbly and a little engaging (for no apparent reason), but her ridiculous period play (which is supposed to be funny in the presentation) is similar to the rest of the script. There is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy ending with this turkey - given the character material with which they had to work, I can not imagine that. Save your money. Warn your friends. DO NOT watch this movie.
