First, your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colors. These do not do anything for the story, but they will keep your lazy eyes busy for about 50 minutes. A good example is the perpetual use of a computer screen that displays every fingerprint from the database while comparing it to what it wants to know about. Yeah right. <br /> <br /> Second, these guys are like real professionals. They will engage in fascinating pro-talks: "Look, Grissom, these are fingerprints that are different for each person, and we can actually find those fingerprints ...". <br /> <br /> Yup! Just like real professionals would talk to each other, if there was not a completely uninformed and stupid audience nearby. <br /> <br /> However, not everything about this show is bad. Some stories work to a certain extent, and the colors are really beautiful. They use red, blue, green, yellow ... all the colors I have loved since kindergarten.
