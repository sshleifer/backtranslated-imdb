Maybe like most of the others who saw this movie on TV long after its premiere, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure ways. That's exactly 'Slow Burn'. Apart from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good. Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, who was hired by Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), a prolific artist, for the residence of his estranged son Brian, who has lived with his mother Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) in recent years , In a manner of Phillip Marlowe, Jacob Ash tells what would be more than just a study of Brian's whereabouts. As soon as Jacob locates Laine, his discoveries open up a lot of trouble. Perhaps because the events in the movie are moving too slowly, this little thriller is never particularly tense, not even when you reveal the culprits and their motives. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is likely to attract attention for its then relatively unknown performer group, which includes both the very young Eric Roberts and the gorgeous Johnny Depp, who plays Laines stepson Donnie. That could be reason enough to try ... if you can find it.
