This movie has the language, the style and the attitude ... plus big rides from Occy (a world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as a turtle has the surf behind him and the surf scenes are still the best ever. A true classic that can often be seen. Nia Peeples is a baby, and Laird Hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him number one in the world's extreme surfers.
