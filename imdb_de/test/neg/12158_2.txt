I saw this movie a few nights ago and it was awful! <br /> <br /> Terribly long - though they have managed to skip the majority of their lives! <br /> <br /> Terribly boring - the parts they contained were lengthy and for some reason the director decided to cut some of the action off and left much of the film unclear! <br /> <br /> Terribly inaccurate - the whole "mystic" side of this movie was a joke, and the last time I checked Ghengis Khan was not exactly a nice guy! <br /> <br /> Awesome - I thought some of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and had little and some depth. <br /> <br /> A salvation of the movie was the cinematography. That's why I gave this movie a 2-star rating and not the bare minimum! However, if you want to look at something pretty, I would recommend buying a picture instead! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a terrible waste of time and money! Please do yourself a favor and miss this Mongolian turkey!
