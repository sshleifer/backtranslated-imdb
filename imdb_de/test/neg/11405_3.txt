As a rule, you can ask two questions about low-budget horror movies of the 80s. and this `Demon Wind 'in particular. 1. Is it a good movie? No .. 2. Is it a funny movie? You bet Demon Wind is a grisly, dirty and disgusting story filled with cheesy make-up effects and vicious violence. The story is virtually non-existent and includes a group of young people who reveal the terrible secrets of an ancestor of the group. Apparently, his grandparents lived in a devil-worshiping neighborhood, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still lives there. But I had to hand it over to this movie. From beginning to end, it breathes morbidity! The devilish undertones, the playful Gore and the (relatively) decent actors make this movie sure to stand high above the mainstream regulators. It shows some creativity and courage (literally), where other productions of this decade are easier to get into routine and oblivion. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of 'the Evil Dead' and perhaps even by Lamberto Breicha's demons, but what the hell? It's fun and a lot of enthusiasm. Although this movie has a pretty high "what a F ***" standard. Especially at the end, when flashbacks and laser shows like to be mixed. And what is the story about these two would-be magicians? However, "Demon Wind" is recommended if your preferences regarding Misthorror are not too high!
