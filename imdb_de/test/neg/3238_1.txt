Every time I think about this movie, I feel physically ill. Reading such a great book and later discovering that a movie of it was a great feeling. Years later, I imagine my joy to turn on the sci-fi channel and find that it starts in just 5 minutes !!! On the tracks and then uggg. If only a few things had changed, OK. Everything has changed. Numerous signs are removed, completely new waste is added. The main hero has shrunk and aged by 30 years, and funny is his girlfriend / wife now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-class skills. This is really a horrible movie in its absolute worst form. I would like to remove my own toenails with pliers instead of undergoing another terrible contemplation. If you have a copy, burn it now and think how much better your life would have been if this celluloid insult had not occurred.
