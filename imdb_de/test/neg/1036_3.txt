Try as much as possible, I just could not get into it. Maybe it was the washed-out sounds; Maybe it was the tedious approach - I'm not really sure, but while this was not a "bad" movie at all, I did not really find it an "effective" movie I understand are so much more arbitrary than their usual uses. <br /> <br /> So, basically, the deal here is that a series of deaths of teenage boys trigger an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, causing a witch hunt. What has the death of the boys to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who turned up in the city? Is the crazy recluse involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of crime drama and horror, while the various inhabitants of the city are all suspicious and repeatedly appear dead bodies, while bloody violence sets in. <br /> <br /> Good enough, but for me most of it was a bit flat. Oh, it had moments ... the one boy who came in for a beautiful naked temptress was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers beat the recluse was a bitter comment (even if the effects themselves fail when you do considering that her skin seemed to peel away, as if they were whipping her with hot irons). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end. I've already added spoiler tags to this review, but be warned, here's the big spoiler: I do not believe it. I do not believe a priest could convince himself to kill young boys because they became sexually aware, without any hint of that psychosis that occurred earlier, along with other boys, with a story or any other personal affect. The movie does not really deserve its end. END SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fulci is a big name and I am more than sure that there is an audience for it. In any case, I have to check more, what he did, because this could have been a bad introduction. Most Italian Giallo is a hit or miss anyway, so I'm waiting for what else this guy can do before he writes it off. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
