This is the film based on the departure of Rob Halford from the British Metal Gods 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to have a Priest tribute band on the front line. Originally titled Metal God, this film could have been something great. Instead, someone decided in an office that knows little or nothing about metal music, watering it down. From the title change of Metal God on the "safe" middle of the street "Rock Star" to the lame soundtrack, this film is played poorly. After spending most of my life in a professional metal band, I was looking forward to seeing it. I was very disappointed with several points in the film. The soundtrack is very NOT Metal for you, and the end of the movie is also lame. The film has a few bright points in writing and acting, but overall it fails in the end because ... 1) A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2) There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard, and Poison are your idea of ​​Heavy Metal, then watch this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio and Black Sabbath are your idea of ​​Metal, read this movie for a good laugh.
