That was so bad, I want God to give me two extra hours after I got my way. At first, acting was equally bad. There was hardly any action unless it included "Shaggy Dog Story with a guy in a rain poncho and a skeletal mask instead of a dog." <br /> <br /> Editing took place everywhere, and the slow motion shots of the "Gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air - no doubt thrown with a spoon) became irritating after the tenth time and after the hundredth time annoying. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rooker. He did a good job. That was not good. That was less than good. And I mean that it was shit. Heavy. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, do not watch this movie.
