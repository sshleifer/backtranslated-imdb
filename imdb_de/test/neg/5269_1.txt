"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, which was already discussed in 1998 in John Boorman's film "The General". Cahill was educated in a slum area and completed from small war to armed robbery with distinction. He explained his criminal career by showing his bad background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals, who conveniently overlook thousands of slum dwellers who are not called to steal post offices and sell weapons to make ends meet. Cahill fooled the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a kind of "Folk Hero" status and made him many enemies. In fact, he was an amoral, selfish thief. <br /> <br /> My main problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is a lovable Irish villain. Kevin Spacey is doing a good job showing Michael Lynch with a mix of oily charm and soft threat, but the character is too amoral and too selfish to be seen as any hero, even an antihero. <br /> <br /> The film is well-filmed and played well by a good cast, but the stuff is what the script is all about. The writer Gerard Stembridge can not decide. is he writing an Irish "lock stick" or a harsher treatment of Martin Cahill's theft career? That's the problem when a writer supports his main character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also regrettable that "ODC" followed the release of John Boorman's The General, which was a more detailed account of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity. Therefore, it is not surprising that his actions have received the movie treatment happy end in Hollywood style. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-funky-bigamist thief Michael Lynch drives his motorcycle into anonymity in ODC. In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA just to prove that nobody fools and gets away with an outmoded, sectarian and corrupt paramilitary organization. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never have strayed from his celebrity, because he strengthened his self-image "man of the people". If Michael Lynch gives up everything to avoid death in "ODC", that's a cop-out for a weak and flat movie.
