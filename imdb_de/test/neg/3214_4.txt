I do not like anything more than a kung fu movie that is laughing. That's the main reason why I do not like Jackie Chan (or his lookalikes). He was not always a clown, I must add. "My Young Aunt" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. It is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought to mud by endless dumb antics and childish behavior. If you are not 5 years old, I really do not understand how anyone can find this type of movie funny. But humor is indeed a very subjective thing. I personally believe that this kind of approach has permanently damaged the beloved subgenre. I found the lead actress Kara Hui very good here. But it was so hard for me to go crazy that I could not enjoy her good performance. If you do not mind the whole stupidity, you can enjoy it. I dont know.
