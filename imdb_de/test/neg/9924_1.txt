This contains some perishable information, but the movie is not worth it anyway ... <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson have agreed to be part of this debacle of writer and director Damian Harris is not mine , The story is full of unrealistic police investigation methods. This includes having a suspect attend a party and invite the suspect into your home and become familiar with them. The story also tells of a male psychiatrist who seems to have only female clients - and he sleeps with everyone. <br /> <br /> Even more exaggerated is the notion that female victims are part of a horrible S / M crime to a large but secret group of lesbian S / M executives. <br /> <br /> The film is full of bad cut and continuity errors and is sterile in all its hip locations - including Barkin's detective pay home. And the lame dialogues are apt to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably to create a noireske atmosphere. Besides, he could not get Ellen Barkin to give 110%. I'm sure she realized the movie was pathetic and gave up trying. <br /> <br /> Outstanding players were Peta Wilson, who spent time with a dominatrix for the part. The very underrated character actor Marshall Bell gave his absolute best as always. <br /> <br /> And since Damian could not compete on any level, it was hard for any of the characters to feel emotions. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, he does not know much about the real world of BDSM and has decided to create the typical "Hollywood reality" of great men and women who are perverted and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save time, money and braincells and pass them on.
