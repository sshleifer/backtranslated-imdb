This formula film (the hero's girlfriend marries the villain) did not move fast enough given some circumstances of the story. Scott seems to be too old in this case, and too often his character turns away from a determined action and vents the scenes. He answers feebly to the death of some of his hands; he flees from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; His flight to the Highlands and his quest for John Russell seem to be as superficial as the movie. The action could have been tightened. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the movie: "Tennessee" see Ernie Ford singing without a mustache "Man in the saddle"; Alfonso Bedoya too short scenes as a cook; the color photography of the highlands and the fight scene there with John Russell.
