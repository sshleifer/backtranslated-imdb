Got that from Usenet, so I was not prepared for the serious (and I mean EXTREMELY serious) religious issue. Not that I'm one of Satan's students or anything, but it was very cumbersome. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting has stunk. It could be that they had to make good little boys play bad little boys, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> There were quite cool filmmakers involved, so any fan of the style of directing would like to check it out, but be prepared with the fast forward buttons. <br /> <br /> There was some negligence in editing. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Compete against a white 240Z. The wheels spin, the camera changes, and what else do you know? White 240Z is transformed into a white civic. <br /> <br /> I gave up early, so I can not vouch for the moral impact. However, I would like to point out that this kind of film preaches the chorus entirely. When the director / producer / producer tried to bring religion to the unwashed streets, they were all wrong. I think I'd rather see an adult diaper commercial than listen to a biting bible knocker about the death of Jesus. Yawning. <br /> <br />
