I give two because there is a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first "road" picture I've seen. I expected waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says these are the best films on the road. If that's true, I do not have to look at the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's offset by just one production number with dancing throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie. Neither Hope nor Crosby came so well, their characters were not very charming, the movie was not funny at all, most of the dialogues were just fillings, there was not much action, there was no spectacle. <br /> The movie was not what I expected. I had expected more "Road", but there is not much. They make it to the palace quickly and then most of the film takes place there until the end. I've also expected much more of the famous "street" style to break through the fourth wall, with the characters talking directly to the audience or commenting on the plot. There were only about 4 cases of it. One of them is an example of the not funny humor of this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope summarizes the previous Crosby plot) Crosby: I know all this! Hope: Yes, but the people who came halfway through the picture do not do it. Crosby: You mean, you missed my song? <br /> <br /> These are two weak points, but at least they are jokes. Most of the script has no jokes. An example is: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Remind me to throw a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirectly, Hope calls a rat.) <br /> <br /> That's not funny at all, it's hardly a joke, but it's a kind of non-witty dialogue that carries most of the movie. Many of the scenes do not come so close to a joke, just with generic, uninteresting dialogues like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, why are you taking me? Do you think you can just throw me to the dogs? Hope: Well, why not? You did it to me, did not you? Crosby: Yes, but I was looking for us. They are not looking for anyone. Hope: Oh yes? Well, why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (the above is just from my memory, it's not exactly, but it shows you what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just a generic dialogue without jokes. <br /> <br /> My Note: Waste of time.
