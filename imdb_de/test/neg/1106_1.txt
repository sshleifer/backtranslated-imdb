In general I love this kind of movie. This time, however, I wanted to step on the screen. Since I can not do that, I will complain about it. That was absolutely idiotic. The things that happen to the dead children are very cool, but the living people are absolute idiots. I am a grown man, quite tall, and I can defend myself well. However, I would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie. Even the mother in this movie is reckless with her children, to the point of neglect. I wish I was not so mad at her and her actions because I would have otherwise enjoyed the strip. What a number she was, take my advice and walk through everything she sees to the end. Is there anybody else tired of watching movies filmed so darkly? You can barely see what is filmed. As an audience, we are impossible involved in the actions on the screen. Why can not we have night vision then?
