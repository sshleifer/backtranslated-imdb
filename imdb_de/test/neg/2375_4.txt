It's not terrible, but what a waste ... Lots of jokes, bad music, bad drawings and animations ... <br /> <br /> Considering the impressive number of entertainers and intervallists on this picture (from, hum ... a Hundreds of different studios all over the world Come on, how can you expect something coherent if you make an animated film that way!) I wonder if a guy in the credits = a drawing! The lines are rough, the 3D work is inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this movie). But the backgrounds are correct. The plot is quite stupid, far from the exact wisdom of the BD, and is obviously aimed at an international audience. Distributing a film around the world does not mean that everyone in the world is a simple-minded guy ... A cultural object is far more interesting when it's challenging, even if it's a foreign film (in this case, a Frenchman) ) It's even worse!). <br /> <br /> Some new things are going well (the Olaf character sometimes, as in the stone explanation, but it's not great), but the modern references are annoying (music, sms -not even a verbal joke, only a stupid bird called short message service: Does anyone know the imagination?). But hey, it's an M6 / TPS production with something Celine Dion ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​underemployed and Obelix speaks too much. Goudurix might be great (as in the book), but he's clearly a "cool guy" with a love affair (with an uninteresting female figure). In fact, only the Vikings (except magicians) are funny. Too much action, not enough laughter. The best part of the movie is the credits. Not the music, but the few stills. BD-style. Asterix is ​​definitely not meant to move!
