Lonesome Dove is my favorite second in the West only with John Wayne, The Searchers. I watch Lonesome Dove about every 6 months and never get tired. I have read all the LD books, though I can not remember Comanche Moon. I was also looking forward to this mini-series and decided to copy it to our DVR so we could move quickly through the ad. Unfortunately I messed up the first part and did not record, but I decided to look at the other parts and try to record them. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can ever compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones. and I expected to be disappointed and it was me. <br /> <br /> Although there were so many things that did not sound right, this was most obvious to me when Nellie died the day before and Gus was on stage. Then he switched to Clara and wrote him a letter Nebraska, in which he told him how sad it was to hear of her death. How on earth could she have known the next day in Nebraska? Also, it should be seven years after she left and her children were about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, but it took even more time to actually move to Lonesome Dove and Lonesome Dove. It was about 10 years or longer there before going to Montana. When they stopped at Clara's in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months, the girls seemed to be between 10 and 13, playing in the yard like little kids. The math just does not add up. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had a lot of his behaviors and looked a bit like Gus could have looked like a young man /> I am also a bit confused about one thing. The trapped white girl they brought back - was that what they captured when they attacked Austin? They said she was captured 25 years ago, but if she was captured in Austin it was only seven years later than it was in the film. Was she captured earlier? I remember seeing a trapped girl after they attacked the city and I do not know if it's the same thing. If anyone can explain themselves since I missed Part One. If it had been Part 25, she would probably have been over 40 when they found her, as she seemed to have grown. As they devastated her when they captured her, it is hard to believe that she would live to marry and have Indian children. I have to admit, nothing is worse than John Voight played Call in the sequel to Lonesome Dove or the incredible marriage of Lorena to Pea Eye in the McMurty sequel to Lonesome Dove, which was never explained. The way he killed Newt was that, despite everything, that he had done the sequel to John Voight without his consent. <br /> <br /> If someone can clear up these discrepancies, I would be happy.
