The sole redeeming feature of this film is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I've never seen Steve Carell stretched too far as an actor, but it does not matter. He always perfectly plays his only role. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman once said, comedy must have an inner consistency. You can put 4 men on the stage in garbage cans, and that's fine, but if you put a fifth man on a non-dustbin stage, you need to explain to the audience why he's not in a dumpster either , <br /> <br /> Why does not Evan accept his role as God's messenger? Why is he so embarrassed if he accepts it? Why is no one impressed by the way animals follow Evan (they are explained by the doubting doubters as "trained animals", possibly from a circus). There is a terrible flood at the end and most of the people we see leap into the ark and are saved, but surely thousands of people were killed by the flood; In the end there is no emotional atmosphere after the disaster. Instead, most congresses have finally seen the light and are about to pursue the lonely, hopelessly bad congressman for "profit-making" Evan.
