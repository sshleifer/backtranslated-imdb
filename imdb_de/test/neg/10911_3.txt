and absolutely not-scary movie. The characters are not interested at all, and most of the time is spent in a car. The dog is ugly at best, never really scary. Interestingly, a more threatening threat would have been needed, at least a few people you care about, and emotions are evoked in you. And last but not least something interesting has to happen. Something unexpected. As it looks like, this film keeps on going, seemingly forever. Maybe a Saint Bernard was not smart enough to choose the terrible threat to life and society. <br /> <br /> In the most creepy movies / thrillers / mysteries, no matter in which genre, there must be characters who want to arouse interest and excite you knowing what's going on. You really do not care, you just wait until everything stops, and wonder if it would not be better to see something different. One of the weakest adjustments of the king.
