This game is a good looking first person shooter. ----------- Keep waiting ...... <br /> <br /> But of course, a story has to be put on this genre, so a pretty innovative conspiracy about soldiers being shot by now Driven to save the world and kill the terrorists, nectar is the drug of choice that creates a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Great, now just give us some fun, challenging missions, throw some great new weapons and free off-road vehicles that can be ridden in our free time, and I'll be pretty happy. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The maker of this game decides to create a propaganda, military-driven game that seeks to understand our fears of terrorism and the acceptance of democracy. The game has distorted the ideals that only enforce the moral that we learned in elementary school, nothing new is told, but "drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then pushed a kind of ... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjjj! (join the Navy) on how you stand up for the common good, if you renounce normality and abnormality, right and wrong ... TOOOOOOOOOOD WE GET IT! LET'S KILL !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can not, you must have extremely long gaps in reaching BULLSH! T-goals like "Run to Helicopter" ... "Go to a group of troops" endure. ... then that's done ......... CINEMATIC takes over ......... You sit at least half of the game and look at small scenarios that are played by the characters CAN NOT skip but sit and wait, sometimes, when people do not even talk, we wait until a helicopter lands! <br /> <br /> Bad game from a ridiculous programming group! Do not bother making another because I'd rather watch the movie!
