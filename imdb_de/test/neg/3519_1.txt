I saw this movie recently because I'm a big Kinski fanatic. But my god. Do not get me wrong. I love this guy. But in this movie, all his acting is simply a refusal to work! But fortunately, not only is he guilty. First of all, when an armed man searches for a killer, the whole plot is completely weak while Kinski is in jail for a crime he did not commit. That's all. All dialogues and characters are so bad that it makes you scream. But maybe that's fun. If you know the Kinski biography, it is obvious that Kinski was not interested in these films at all. Especially all his Italian-Western roles. He only took the money and that was it. This whole movie is totally weird again. Only for hardcore fans of the genre.
