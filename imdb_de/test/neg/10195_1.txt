How awful is that? Let me count the ways: 1) It's a bait-and-change movie that first refers to a UFO investigation and then becomes a sales job for Christianity. Come on! If the creators of this movie felt so much about their message, why should they disguise it? It annoys infidels and pushes fence sitter in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this movie asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They are scary! 3) Acting is awful. They all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) Cinematography is bad at home. Wait, actually it's not even that good. 5) script bad, bad, bad. All dialogues, no action. Like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between close-ups of the "talking head". 6) Direction ... in which direction? Oh, there must have been a director somewhere. I challenge you to find out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments on this film. The cut seemed to be professional but could not make a difference. Good editing of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening motive was actually very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad that the movie was not about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can not tell, this is the end result. I wasted my money watching this movie and it made me angry. If they had not disguised what this movie really is about, I could say it was my fault.
