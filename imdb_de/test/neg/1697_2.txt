Forced, casual, formulaic. Do you want to run because of these adjectives to rent his? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde". A few other early films of her, especially "The Story of Temple Drake," are never shown, but labeled as excellent. Ray Milland as a Greeniwch Village bohemian certainly does not convince. <br /> <br /> The two child actors are scary and have no relation to the village, as it was back then. I was born in Greenwich Village and find the setting generic and wrong. Not that I've been here for several generations, but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not funny. It is not authentic from afar. We are not interested in the characters. <br /> <br /> So many films were filmed at that time about the fighting masses against the capitalists and filmed with verve. "Easy Living" comes to my mind. It did not take place in the village. But it sounds very true. This rings with a dull bang.
