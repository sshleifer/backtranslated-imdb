Thirty percent of this film seems to be the prototype of the card channel. You see a huge map for about ten minutes, then unleash the big shots as they roar over the radar (thunder, get it?). Apparently there are many radar stations in the far north that protect the borders of North America from attacks by deadly polar bears. The bears never show up, but a giant mantis. It had frozen in the ice for over a million years until it was earthquake-free somewhere in the world (yes, right, for my money it was released by global warming). It is a huge prehistoric insect and it needs a lot of food. Since there are no cows in the frozen north, she decides to enjoy the bovine creatures she can find up there. I. E., people. It's starting to attack radar stations, probably because the hum of radar dishes was getting on their nerves. <br /> <br /> Enter Col. Joe Parkman, the local smarmy type of movie. He examines an airplane that has crashed and is amazed why there are no corpses in the wreckage. The only thing he finds is one of the mantis' claws. He apparently decided to cut his nails while sitting with the crew of the plane. Parkman takes the tip of the claw to be analyzed by a millennial scientist. <br /> <br /> The grandpa scientist can not behead the claw, mostly because he misses his nap, so his mind is not 'it works too well. So he calls a complacent paleontologist played by the man named P.I. in Perry Mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he has decided that the claw must come from a praying mantis. Only as big as a commuter train. <br /> <br /> It's Luke's warm love at first sight when Col.Parkman looks at the female photographer for the first time. The men in the base, who have obviously been deprived for many years, think she's the hottest thing to come with since Grandma Clampett. A self-centered scientist and a smarmy soldier begin to work together to track the path of the Mantis, which has destroyed some stick shots of an Eskimo village. It comes to the base, which is looking for a snack after dinner, and destroyed some cheap sets quite effectively. Then he flies south and disappears. <br /> <br /> Now comes the tense hours when the Civilian Soil Observation Core is asked to sweep the skies looking for something big to fly up. I doubt they were actually told that they were looking for a huge flying praying mantis that would eat people, as it would lead to panic. Probably they were told to look for a huge green painted 727 that was buzzing because its engine was not right. <br /> <br /> Col. Parkman gets on a plane trying to shoot down the Mantis and abuses the mission. The Mantis lands in New York City, probably for a show on Broadway or Sex World in Times Square. The army keeps it in check in the tunnel, and Parkman and his men put on stupid suits borrowed from the Orkin Man to go in and blow up the Mantis. Success! Well, almost, with the Mantis still twitching, almost killing the terrible Eve Arden photographer. In the end there is a lukewarm love scene, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis as Colonel Hair Grease and Ms. Gender Unspecified are busy smooching. Such a disgusting end.
