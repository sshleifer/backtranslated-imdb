If I could have given this movie 0/10, I would do that, and this is the first movie I wanted to rate so low. It is worse than terrible. If I saw it in the cinema, I would like the cinema ME to be paid for watching (at least minimum wage). Some of the camera images were quite effective, but many were garbage, for example. Rogues reflect in a mirror that separates their heads and shoulders from their bodies (seeing is believing). Several completely pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh aloud because of the victims' actions / facial expressions. I only saw it to the end (fast-forwarding about 10 minutes of boring, meaningless dialogue) and hoped to see Seagal in a decent close combat, but there was almost none of it (knew he had thrown somebody in the beginning while he had one In a scene, we see Seagal chopping his neck in slow motion, which makes it obvious that his hand never had any contact, the chief is always On two different occasions, he is shot in the chest, the first time with a shotgun that blows him onto the street on the 2nd / 3rd floor, in summary this film is a total waste of time and a total joke looks very cheap (also for Seagal) The color is dull and gray I could go on and on ... just like this movie but I will not do it Watch this movie if you have Sleep Disorder suffering. It is guaranteed that you fall asleep.
