This is a really bad waste of time. I would probably rather see a documentary than this one; It's really that bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is really terrible, and it can be said that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality. It's by far the bottom end of the scale. Do not waste your money with it. <br /> <br /> I have a hard time believing the person who made this film to be fine. I had to watch it with the kids when my mom rented it because she thought it was good for the kids. Even the kids (3, 4, 6 and 8) thought it was pretty boring. <br /> Overall: Just do not look at it. Not not
