I disagree with Dante, who portrays Democrat-Supporting Zombies as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I believe that their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than this, something in the order of a Pelosi IQ ... A one-digit number, please <br /> <br /> The MOH series is quite patchy and this is the worst Episode. Dante, another mindless Hollywood Liberal (or a non-political nerd who engages with the left-wing establishment to revive his miserable career?), Must have finally realized that his directing work has been in bad shape for nearly two decades Now came this frightening, inconspicuous, left-wing satire of the Bush administration, the republicans and capitalism. Maybe he had the feeling that he had not been openly political before. He would not be the first talent to use his political propaganda to advance his career when everything else fails. Dante, the producer of Turks such as "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee", was just as useful a contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler was to world peace. TH uses humor with the lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable gags that even the blauste of all union members would not understand. Or have you ever seen a smart, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? Populist manure has the lowest of all messages. Therefore, the language and the way in which this message is delivered must be as simple and fundamental as the name of Sean Penn. And what's better for humans to send this message to the popcorn-eating sheep than a couple of Tinseltown cocaine snoopers, all of whom have fallen so low they are forced to write for television ... <br /> <br /> I do not want political propaganda in any movie, neither Left nor Right. But frightening it - of all genres - testifies to the endless stupidity so superior in Hollywood's anti-intelligence. So vapid was Dante that he even did not notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote for the Democrats ... (That's what you get for completing a film school: no source of wisdom or useful knowledge through any part the imagination.)
