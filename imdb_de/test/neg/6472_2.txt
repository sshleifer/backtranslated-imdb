This remake is titled "That Darn Cat," but the DC cat is more of a sideline than the main character. Patti Randall was not likeable at this remake. It reminded me of one of those Goth idiots in high school whom you have read that they have been angry since the day they were born, and that one day they will open fire on the rest of the school. The federal police Kelso was okay, but not as good as the original. I think Disney's been trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever heck of a foolish name) stars, but they do not hold a candle to Hayley Mills and Dean Jones. I'm an animal lover and a cat lover, and I make D.C. not to blame that the remake is so much inferior to the original movie. They almost cut him out of the whole movie. All in all a very bad remake.
