The only reason I even give this movie a 4 is because it was made into a sequel to Mystery Science Theater 3000. The terrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters' complete inability to act. The lead role is an actor I've never seen before. No chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost do not care what happens to him. Dick Sargent could not convince as a villain, least of all this guy should be considered super bad ... he was more annoying than anything else. Peter Graves was the only person in the film who was not terrible, his role was small and even he could not compensate for his lack of talent. In 2004, someone tried to restore this mess. It was called The Island ... Personally, I did not see the movie, but in my understanding, it's the same movie. If you want to laugh about this movie, get the MST3k episode, which is really funny
