I have no idea how exactly Flynn's portrayal appears in this film, but even as a fiction, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is omnipresent and you wonder how it got from one scene to the next - you just do not get the minimal amount of information needed to maintain some continuity and its current situation understand and understand the motivations of Flynn and other characters for their behavior. <br /> Add a number of stupid and implausible situations to this, and you have a movie that appears as one of your dreams that makes sense in your sleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it is just weird, disconnected and totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There are many long, boring musical sections of the film that are either a bad direction for me or a bad director trying to be artistic /> None of the characters is sympathetic and The Flynn Character Comes Over As a self-serving liar, thug, thief, robber, murderer, pugilist, gigolo and cheater who takes everything and puts on anyone to realize his own dreams, and somehow great opportunities just seem to be miraculous to hit his lap. <br /> <br /> This film is neither entertaining nor satisfying in any way and in any circumstances even historically accurate, so why look at all? To squeeze salt into the wound, the DVD had one of the worst transmissions I've ever seen, not even in widescreen or Dolby 5.1, it had terrible telecine wobbles and many, many artifacts that looked like a roll of film that had somewhere Dust and scratches collected.
