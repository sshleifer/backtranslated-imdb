I really have to count "Sex is Comedy" among the worst things I've ever seen. The film unintentionally shows those who are the worst aspects of the French or at least, as they are stereotypes, narcissism, snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism. I myself am French-Canadian and a little ashamed that the creators of this film come from the same culture as me. That should give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really was! You do not see this movie as much as if you were tortured, lacking in humor, and it seemed to me that the entire film was a documentary that interviewed people who were neither famous nor talented, as if they wanted to celebrate something, that has never happened. Instead, check out Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three fantastic modern French films.
