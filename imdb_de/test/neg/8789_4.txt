Mid-1990s, the career of animator director Don Bluth seemed to have fallen on his all-time low. Previously, Bluth had made a number of popular animated films, many of which are still popular today, such as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" (1986). But since 1994 with "Thumbelina", his films have been falling in quality and popularity more and more, and one of the many unfortunate submissions was the 1995 movie "The Pebble and the Penguin", a movie that attracted no audience beyond parents and Children under seven years. To be honest, the latter are the only viewers I can understand when making fun of this rather bland animated film. <br /> <br /> The story is absurd. The film features a poorly drawn, stuttering and plump penguin named Hubie (spoken by Martin Short), who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (voice of Annie Golden). As in real life, penguins present their brothers with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But as Hubie gets carried away by the current, he's working with a lonely Rockhopper (James Belushi) on a dream of flying and they're running against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they may be late are one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak history, which would be weak even then. <br /> <br /> It soon becomes clear why this animated children's musical does not and will not work for anyone over the age of six or seven. It simply has none of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature. First, the film looks bad due to a very poor character style. The animation in this film is very cardboard (even if animation films occur); It's dark, bleak, there's no vibrancy in the colors, and besides, the design of the movie and the elements in it are universally droll and ridiculous. Take, for example, the penguins who play a major role in the movie. With just a few background exceptions, every single penguin absolutely does not look like a bird. Hubie, for example, looks absurdly ridiculous with broad cheeks, a stocky beak, big eyes and the absurd hat he wears everywhere. In combination with his handmade "fins" he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. Result: He is an ugly, badly drawn cartoon character. But the most absurd and absurdly designed character is the evil penguin Drake, who frankly looks nothing like a penguin. He is a muscle man with a penguin mask. He has a broader chest than Arnold Schwarzenegger and teeth that are larger than the teeth of leopard seals and killer whales, which serve as predators of the film. He's basically a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a skull cavity, he wears a cloak, laughs a lot and becomes angry when people laugh with him. Result: who cares? Bad and maybe even worse is that it's an animated musical and there's no noteworthy or memorable song that can be found anywhere within the runtime. The opening song was harmless - not memorable, but harmless. But after that, the songs became darker and gloomier, and there was one that made me go all the way. It's the moment when viewers press the fast-forward button when they appear. <br /> <br /> I felt that "The Pebble and the Penguin" was paralyzed, except for the few moments when Hubie and the Rockhopper penguin were in danger Rockos are being endangered in the pines of leopard seals and killer whales Thankfully they do not get dialogue and are treated as animals rather than comic characters. But in a sense I can not wholeheartedly recommend this film to children. That is the reason. The movie shows killer whales are the natural enemies of penguins. My concern is that children who are familiar with "Free Willy" (1993) might be insulted or downcast if they see their favorite inhabitants of the sea as bloodthirsty carnivores. The leopard seal was a better antagonist, and it was funnier to see his jaw open wider than a rattlesnake and how he seemed to smile during the growl. But the point is really, these moments with the predators - and there are only a few - the only interesting moments. And they are not very interesting, mind you. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I can not recommend it to anyone under the age of seven. My tip: If you have children on this site, you can rent them for them. You could enjoy it.
