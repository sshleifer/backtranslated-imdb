When this film came out in 1996, director Mark Lester has been making tight, sharp little B-action images for over 20 years. He was responsible for the big "70s Truck Stop Women" and some other little gems. Unfortunately, he is also responsible for this Dud. It's a shame to see the talented - and still hot-smoking - Theresa Russell again, but she's still the best actress in this picture. Eric Roberts appears for a while, does his Eric Roberts thing and then leaves, a not unwelcome event in a picture with Eric Roberts in it. Frank Stallone is actually not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how really pathetic this picture is. As already mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes - why such an image is made in the first place - are almost illogical and unrealistic and somewhat inappropriate. Apart from some "old" clothes and a few old cars, there is no feeling for the 1930s when this movie is playing. A script after the numbers with irritating logical errors and low historical accuracy - this is of course not a documentary, but the filmmakers could have TRIED, at least for some authenticity - and their achievements range from level B to the elementary school banishes this cheap little quickie on Sunday from HBO at 4:00. I just saw him there.
