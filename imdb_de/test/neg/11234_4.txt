"Many of the films I made might have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because I have a lot of old values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this movie is a loose remake of "A Guy Named Joe", "A Matter of Life and Death "and" Wings of Desire ". <br /> <br /> 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt to be Frank Capra. <br/> <br/> 3. Spielberg has often said that he wants to shoot a "Frank Capra movie" in the style of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Mrs Smith Goes To Washington". After his recent attempts to launch a "Harvey" remake, Spielberg still seems to have that dream, and the director is rightly not satisfied with his last three ventures in Capracorn. Critics of the time suggested "Always", claiming that the thoughtful action sequences distracted from the film's romance, but that's not really the problem. The problem is that Always needs a lot more special effects to prevent us from being able to film a dialog line that does not end in an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The movie is full of comedies that just do not work. Spielberg's comedic taste is not very sophisticated and seems to be ripped straight out of the 1950s and the Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe, but in a movie, it seems like a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The main couple of the film acts as brother and sister, not as lovers. Spielberg's films have always been concerned about sex and intimacy, but this film is extremely tedious: she's an insane tomboy and he's a shaky old man. They are more irritating than adorable. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains a good scene in which John Goodman paints with Holly Hunter, but the characters are usually too annoying. There is no subtlety, every emotion is dubbed, every joke is designed, every sequence is filled with unnecessary bustle. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg how to talk. After their failure (and the double financial failure of "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun") Spielberg renounced the corrupt color cinematography of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" in favor of the more desaturated "black" white " Worlds of "Schindler's List", "Munich", "Minority Report" and "Saving Private Ryan." From then on, "less light" and "dark cinematography" were equated with "serious issues." <br /> <br /> 9 After the financial success of each "dark movie", Spielberg resorts to his color cinematography and falls flat on his face again, "Amistad" followed "Schindler's List", "AI" followed "Ryan" and "Lincoln" will follow "Munich" These "color" movies are always praised for being too sticky, sentimental, cheesy and hokey, but the truth is, if you remove the desaturation, all those "serious" movies would feel the same way. <br /> <br /> 10 Spielberg has been trying since the 1970s to to differentiate themselves from the other rulers of the Balg group (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.) pretending to be "optimist" and "humanist". He would find this again and again in many interviews at the end of the 70s. The reality, however, is that he is probably the greatest sadist of all these directors, as the shape of his films often undermines their content and their box office appearances are always in proportion to their stunning slaughter. <br /> <br /> 11. Spielberg's failure to connect with the characters in "Always," and the enjoyment he shows when he films forest fires, crashes planes, etc., perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography on. People who run in front of dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks, etc. ... that's what Spielberg loves. The moment his characters stop talking, everything destroys. A film like "Amistad" failed in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many white people talked. <br /> <br /> 12. The film's air scenes are not up to the standard set in the Megahit "Top Gun" a few years ago. Of course, if your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's difficult to make things cinematic. <br /> <br /> 13. Failures like "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. are often more revealing than the more successful Spielberg films. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show what the amusement ride looks like if it does not work and makes the vacuum visible under the broken machines. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is a good sequence here (two actors in a room just improvising), but this is usually an annoying picture with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> It's worth considering.
