Unfortunately, this is a boring movie, and the only way to spot it is the shabby public domain version, which is so blurry and dark that sometimes it's hard to figure out where the screen is. The main actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen acting nonchalant, charming, and sexy, completely forgetting what the movie is about, and that he's a murder suspect because a lady first played him as a goose. The lady herself just goes through the movie and is dignified when she's not busy looking cute. It's a pretty poorly written stuff, never interesting or funny. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets. It's just scratching the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this totally failed movie.
