"The Evil That Men Do" begins with a truly repugnant torture scene, followed by graphic depictions of equally repugnant torture methods that the sadistic, heartless villain likes to use. However, despite the use of such severe shock effects, the filmmakers can not hide the fact that this is just a boring, inferior Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is stuck here, but he should've chosen a better script.
