Well, I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but I can not believe Shane Black wrote this bunch ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are there. I showed it for a film festival. Dreadful. Everyone laughed. It's preachy and cumbersome ... not to mention stupid. It is also surprising how little L.A. Cambodia looks like. The whole idea of ​​traveling through a post-traumatic stress disorder is pretty stupid. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July" was mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I took the example as an example to really show how bad this movie is), but directed by Michael Bay's 2. Director. So bad. The 2 stars refer exclusively to the production value.
