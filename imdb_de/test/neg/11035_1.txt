Have seen this movie with a total of 5 spectators! I had the choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (I realized that I should have gone for Lakshya). A typical plot ... India vs Pakistan ... but it's not cricket since you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian superhero goes on a mission to rescue the President of India from some Pakistani rebels involved in drug trafficking. I left the film halfway because it was just boring and the plot was confusing and everywhere. The songs were also terrible, the movie tries to hide the flaws with its special effects, but unfortunately they are also out of date. I have seen this year.
