The creators of this film must have sat down one day and said, "Let's make fun of the Russians and show people how far we are (Americans)." The film portrays the Russians as inferior people who can not understand the brilliant ideas of the Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and based on more expensive studies than campaigns in other countries. However, this film goes too far and exaggerates the differences between East and West. For me it looked like a propaganda movie from the Cold War.
