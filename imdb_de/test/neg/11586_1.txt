I just caught it on Showtime ... ewwwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie. One of the most raging monster strips I've ever seen. The TV reporter in the film was also the annoying Jerri from a previous season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the "secret base" was the home of Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows, located in the Los Angeles area). I absolutely expected Mr. Roarke and Tattoo to welcome the visitors. If Tattoo had been eaten by the snake, I might have given this movie a 2, but oh well. Watching the people yelling and screaming for five minutes while the komodo or cobra was sticking over them instead of running was pretty funny, especially because you could really see them screaming in an empty spot where later the computer animators stood paint the monster. I almost fell out of my chair when, in a Flashback scene, they brought either the Cobra or the Komodo - then normal size - into an indestructible massive steel container with a few air holes. Would not a wire cage have been enough? LOL! Presumably they could not afford to hire a real Komodo and a Cobra. I have to remember that I'm lending Showtime for their series and not for their films.
