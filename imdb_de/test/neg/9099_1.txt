If you look at the first few moments, you realize that it's going to be a parody - and certainly * is * a parody, but I'm not sure what (a fairy tale, an opera, a Hollywood C movie?) - if there is such a thing), and I can assure you that it is not worth seeing. It's just a senseless movie (see A good parody is anything but pointless), with overbearing, flat talk of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or rather, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sung in intentionally incompetent ways (something that Greenaway uses much more efficiently), it's painful to hear (unless someone is wearing earmuffs, haha). Take quality films (eg A. Mitta's marriage of Tsar Peter, 1976) and avoid this mistake.
