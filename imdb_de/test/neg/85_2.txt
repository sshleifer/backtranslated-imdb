I have no idea how anyone can give this film good grades. I did not rent it because I thought it would be the next big horror movie, the next big horror parody, or the next big low budget horror parody. Obviously, this should not scare you, but a fatal error in production has completely eroded the enjoyment of viewing. The sound processing was terrible. I had to edit the volume control the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even if it's a cheap spoof - if you either want to increase or decrease the volume or anticipate next time. The regular dialogue is very quiet and all screams, sounds etc. are very loud. It is not about switching between 5 and 7 with the volume control, but finding a satisfactory medium at 6. We speak from 2 to 9 at the volume, where it is practically impossible to leave the volume alone. This movie may be a good example of what it should be, but you will spend so much time adjusting the volume that you will never have the opportunity to enjoy it.
