Usually, I start my critiques with an explanation of how and why I watched the movie I'm discussing. I just can not explain that. The next day I had to wake up early to work. The last thing I wanted was to watch a movie I did not know about. But something stuck to my comfy futon as I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh, that's right. Boredom. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Joline, an unconventional nut case who seems to be more obsessed with her marriage vows than the man she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her husband decides to search for better things (work, women and scripts, presumably), Joline starts a fanatical search for her husband and frees him from his "spiritual wheelchair". It sounds like I can think of it, but unfortunately not. In fact, this is nothing more than an acting exercise for Graham, as she playfully gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a workout. Oh and Goran "ER" Visnjic is there for some reason as well. <br /> <br /> The TV programs had this as a comedy, but I could not find a single laugh anywhere. I noticed that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger (the director and author), in the same way as "Girl, Interrupted," but even that had more laughter than that. Graham's character is just too selfish, rather than that the audience would take care of him, and I felt sorry for the chicken-picked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly spiritual wife. Very little of this film made sense as the characters simply appeared in the story as if they were standing around waiting for Graham to appear like the extras in "The Truman Show." In fact, the only positive note I can get from my doodles is "Heather Graham - nice baps." And that was not because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. In fact, it is very difficult to think of someone to whom he can recommend this film. Graham purists (a very small number of moviegoers, I think you'll agree) must feel obliged to see that slag, and possibly hippie students who collect American Dreamcatchers take something away. I was amazed that the average rating (at the time of writing) was 5.0 - that would make this movie as good as "The Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book and that's just not true. "Committed" is a quirky mess of a movie that's neither entertaining nor enlightening. It's complicated, pointless and just too boring for my taste and probably for yours too. Do not think about seeing this.
