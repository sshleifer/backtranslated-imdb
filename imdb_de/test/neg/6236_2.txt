The business executive is abducted and made to wander many days and days in a woodland and exchange the dialogue with his kidnapper. And we have to hear all the nonsense. Snotty wife and family are at the FBI's home wondering what to do .... .... at no point does she seem worried about her husband's fate unless there is Ransom goes ..... A love story "Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, and almost every scene is filled with the expectation that something significant will happen, but that never happens Case is. <br /> <br /> The result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it will still be stupid if we learn The Fate of the Kidnapper. <br /> <br /> That's garbage: <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points.
