After the whirlwind success of The Wrestler (see my review) Mickey Rourke had this "gem" directly to the video. Each copy was rented for months and I even heard a few good voices. Months later, I caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all ... one of the places in the film (Walpole Island) is a place I visited regularly as a kid because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool what? There the coolness ends with this dud. I mean, the story is decent enough to justify a four, and even the direction is not bad, but the performances are just horrible and absolutely ridiculous, with really wasted star power and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays a Canadian / Native American?!?! What did you think in the name of the Lord? He does not even resemble Native American blood and his attempt to use the generic Native American accent made him look even more ridiculous. You could have gone anywhere with this story ... you could have hired a local actor or changed Rourke's character, how about a white man raised by his parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete joke. <br /> <br /> Since you may have caught Mickey Rourke's "Stars" in Killshot, I use that term casually. I've never really liked Rourke, even though his Oscar performance was decent. This shows and confirms my aversion to him. He looks bored and bored, and his lame attempt to portray an aborigine is insulting, I would think. He makes a decent cold-blooded killer, but history never explores that part of him that is completely backward. Although Diane Lane is highly regarded in Hollywood, she plays another brutal performance. She had her moments, but overall, she usually does not participate in any performance. She looks like she's going to be great, but if she's not, she's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I always felt that Jane deserved a bigger career than he did. I think he has an action star in his blood. All in all, his performance in Killshot is not bad. He does not go too far and in a way is hard and almost heroic. He and Lane manage to have decent chemistry, but he does not stand in the way of his character. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) made this film and B) had any character at all. Her character is utterly useless and had no sense that the plot or the story would perform as well as she would play. I've rarely seen a character that supports so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this film is the mini-killer given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who wants to band together with Rourke's hit-man. Gordon-Levitt is overly crazy and entertaining and his character is really captivating. If it was all about him in this movie, that would have been a blast. He literally saves that from dead crap. His performance is almost worth seeing this drivel. Oscar-nominated director ... whoa wait? Yes, Oscar-nominated director John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job). I've never actually seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical applause it received, and it surprised me because the direction in this movie and the characters was downright horrible. Screenwriter Hossein Amini did not do anything I know, but apparently the next Jack Ryan movie is to be written. After this mess, I can not even imagine why they want it. I understand that this is based on a novel, and I really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. A bit of action and a kind of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a batsman and his partner and the chaos they are involved in. Unfortunately, if you're not a huge Rourke fanatic or really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt, there's no reason to face that pain. I have done it for you and I still feel the pain. 4.10
