A thinly veiled attempt to get Hulkamania to not become a wrestling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this movie produced both when Tiny Lester went to the WWE in the mother of all advertising bugs that summer. See the dictionary under Oops. As a card bearing a member of the stupid kids of the world, it paid for the theater, and when I came out I immediately checked in H.A. - Hulkamaniacs annoying. I am proud that I have not been in Hulk for 17 years and have never had a desire since then. Since this was meant to attract more fans to the juggernaut, this was the WWE in Hogan's hey day. You have to wonder if there were not more fans like me who turned to other times when they did not dare celluloid as much as gas and Russian roulette.
