"The Italian Job" is a caper movie that consists of numbers. On the back of each capricious cliché it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote towards the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "The Italian Job" does not have any imagination at all. I've seen everything before and done better. Acting is alright, cinematography is perfectly acceptable, but this film is absolutely new territory. <br /> <br /> Let's get rid of the clichés: <br /> <br /> - criminal father figure of the old school and his protege <br /> <br /> - another gang member jealous of protege <br / > <br /> - a double cross <br /> <br /> - only bad guys use guns while criminals with good guy are not required <br /> <br /> - good criminals always outsmart the bad guys <br /> <br /> And that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the raids and chases, which are supposed to be the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true as they appeared in the trailers for the movie, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a caper movie only works if it has an element of realism - that maybe just maybe it could be subtracted without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. Parts of "The Italian Job" just throw it out the window. Computers do things that computers can not do. The good guys do not beat anyone driving (especially when climbing stairs) and not a single police car reacts to street explosions, reckless minis or even a low-flying helicopter. This must be a city for these things, so as not to evaluate a reaction. <br /> <br /> The acting is passable, but the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) at least enjoy watching them. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the "nice guy" hero, while Charlize Theron is the only actor who shows some reach. As always, Donald Sutherland is a class and shows Wahlberg's deficits every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a pretty uninteresting movie. In light of the IMDb reviews, it's the girls who really love this movie, which I can understand to some degree, but there are so much better Caper films - even the dullness of the recent "Ocean's Eleven" outshines the non-Caper. Event "The Italian Job". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Finally, take a moment to think about what will happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to rejoice the good because they caused his downfall, especially as it seems long and painful? He did not deserve that, he had a creeping feeling. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
