Well, it was not a complete waste. Armand was as usual very good in the movie, the whole thing between Turks and German was sort of weird because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie. I would not bother to review the central theme. It's about the serial killings, in which the entire gang warfare is loosely woven. I have never seen a movie in which the characters looked Italian, supposedly Turkish, and took English (American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The climax was the most intriguing part, and there are parts that still did not make sense to me. If you have nothing better to do, you can definitely watch this movie.
