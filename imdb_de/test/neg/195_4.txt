I should start by saying that I have something with a hatred for musicals. Some of them are fantastic, others are just crap. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it did not fall in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the song "Sodomy" made me smile and everything looks outdated. But the movie did not attract me like others, like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, since I hated Rocky Horror for years, I suddenly got it and have loved it ever since. Maybe Hair will be the same. Although I doubt Rocky Horror gains so much popularity as Rocky Horror because of its language and nudity, I doubt I'll get the chance it will grow on me. Gettit? Hair .... grow ... oh, take care. Anyway, I have not seen the last fifteen minutes due to a technical breakdown, which was a shame as I would do it. I liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here would have. <br /> <br /> No film for the occasional moviegoer, but definitely one for music lovers. I really hope they will not make it new, as I think such a rerun would be a flat, pale PC version of the original. <br /> <br /> Worth a look for lovers of the genre.
