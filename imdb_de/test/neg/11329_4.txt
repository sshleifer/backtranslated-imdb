I only saw this movie once when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled to have made a movie about the 45th Division. Since I'm from Oklahoma, and especially now that my two sons are members of the 45th, I'd like to see it on a DVD. I may be a bit biased, but sometimes the 45th Division does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History Channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about World War II and Korea, but you rarely hear that the 45th is mentioned. One of the scenes that really struck me was when the Indian Code Talkers were at work and the confused expression of the faces of German soldiers when they could not understand that language. I am glad that all Native American Code Talkers receive the recognition they deserve.
