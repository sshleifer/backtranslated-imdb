We brought this movie as a joke for a friend and could be our worst joke. The film is barely visible and the acting is bleak. The worst kid actor ever used and Hasslehoff gave an inferior performance. The plot is shameful and in some places we were so bored that we wondered what the hell was going on. It tries to be cruel in places, but it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Just awful
