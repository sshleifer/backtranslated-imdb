Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of the worn VHS is a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written down. I think the only reason they could sell the movie in the nineties was Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans do not have to disappoint. Sandra is just one thing you can only look at in this movie, and her performance is the only thing that can be called acting. Rest of the movie? It's fun to watch in the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but it gets worse afterwards. Much worse. Director is terrible. Acting is terrible. Script is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. Action is terrible. Music is actually quite good. Typical score for action movies of the eighties. This movie is so bad that it achieves almost everything that Andy Sidaris has ever produced. It is so bad that there is no right word to describe this bad attempt to be a movie. But there was still Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta, who's been trying to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can release the movie on DVD now. It could be cool! And you should write on the cover: ACADEMY AWARD WINNER SANDRA BULLOCK IN HANGMEN 1 out of 10
