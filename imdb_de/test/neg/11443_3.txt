I've been watching this movie lately mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster. I saw that this movie was made right in between their two Oscar-winning appearances, so my expectations were pretty high. Unfortunately, I found the movie awful and I still wonder how she was ever convinced to shoot this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself might be believable if someone like Mel Gibson played the role of the hit song. The idea that Jodie ran away with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent, I could not afford. I really thought that Jodie looked great throughout the movie, which was probably the only reason I saw the whole thing. Maybe that was the only reason Jodie was being led around with as little clothing as possible. I saw a television biography of Jodie, in which all her films were commented in chronological order, and this film was the only one that was never mentioned. After seeing it, I can now see why.
