I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devils Advocate), but since a woman's scent, he plays pretty much the same role and screams a lot. This movie had no loveable characters to get used to. Brandon, played by Bongo McConnahey, is the least sympathetic. Nowhere did he approach a real man. Pacino was hopelessly unlikely and how old is Renee Russo? The only highlight of this miserable mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has a total of 10 lines. Even the normally reliable Jeremy Piven was unlikely. <br /> <br /> Note for film writers: They usually do not work, unless one of the main characters is at least a little sympathetic (except Scarface). When the movie comes to an end and old Brandon is at the airport, I just thought: Drop a plane into the airport and kill Brandon.
