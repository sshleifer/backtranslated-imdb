At first, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But I can not imagine how stupid someone has to be to believe that! What a waste of money the faithful. They would better use it to feed some starving families in Third World countries. I do not want to talk about the acting or the plot of this "movie" because I could not find any of them in this movie. The story is simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) has given up religion for some reason. B regains his faith in religion and teaches A a lesson - to believe in Christ or go to hell. This message will appear after about ten minutes and will be repeated until the end of the movie. People do not believe in the rating of this "movie", read the reviews first. I did not waste an hour of my life: (PS: Why is it classified as Sci-Fi?) Because of those few strange sounds and some bright light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil deeds? This is a new one :)
