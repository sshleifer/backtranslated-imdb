Thunder Alley notes that Fabian was suspended by NASCAR tracks after causing the death of another driver. Stanley Adams may want to include him in his team of racers, but the other riders are not in favor of having him around. <br /> <br /> Desperate for employment Fabian meets with Jan Murray, an owner of an auto-stunt show, who pays him peanuts and tries to take advantage of Fabian's bad reputation. He has to accept it, but Annette Funicello, Murray's daughter, gives another reason to behave. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Fabian's effort to get back to the NASCAR circuit while juggling both Annette and his current girlfriend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has everything in Annette. Thunder Alley is helped by shooting on the southern NASCAR tracks and good footage of NASCAR racing. Not helped by a rather stupid story that sheds light on the real reason for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from them. <br /> <br /> NASCAR fans still like this.
