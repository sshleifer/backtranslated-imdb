What a nuclear bomb of a movie. The story goes nowhere and can not be found anywhere. It leaves the theatergoer with one arm and says, "Is that it?". What happened to Redford? He was once a good actor. Now he thinks he can turn up on the set and make some scenes, and that's a take. Not correct. What an emotionless movie. I do not want to be so cruel, but what a crap. Incredible amateur crap. If I were in this movie, I would be so embarrassed that I would not show my face. I'll tell you something, if I was associated with this movie, I'm in big trouble. This movie will go down as the king of bombs in the annals of filmmaking, with all the others are compared.
