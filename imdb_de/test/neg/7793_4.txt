This seems to be one of the lesser-known films by Noel Coward, and it's easy to understand why. That's not a bad movie at face value, but it's not very good either. Not much happens in the course of the film, it's just the story of Chris and Leonora's unfortunate affair and Barbara's reaction to it. The only thing that keeps the movie interesting is the fact that we already know that for some reason it will end badly because of the first scene. Oddly enough, there are many perfect opportunities for conflict in history, yet none is used. It would have been much more interesting and credible, for example, if Barbara had gotten out of hand with Leonora. Instead, they stayed in good condition throughout the movie. The idea that Barbara was betrayed by her boyfriend was not investigated at all - in fact, she did not even seem to feel betrayed by her husband; She even encourages him to go on vacation with Leonora. Similarly, Chris' two secretaries in his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who happen to be close friends of Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. Tim is afraid of conflict by telling Chris that he likes him and Barbara terribly. Despite the strange conflict, the biggest flaw in the movie is that we do not care if Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara. The personalities of the two women are indistinguishable anyway, so we do not know which of the two women is better suited to be with Chris. Moreover, Barbara's freedom of movement gives the impression that she hardly cares about the matter anyway. In addition, I found the relationship between Chris and Leonora somewhat convincing. I can overlook the ridiculously short period in which they fall in love because that's so common in movies of that era, but even then the relationship seemed superficial. Coward's character was too stern and too cynical to deal with Leonora's affection. He reminds me of the socially incompetent genius Sir Earnest Pease from the film "Very Important Person". I'm sure they got along well. Chris's coldness and severity made his love for Leonora seem insincere. I think Coward should have left this out there and given his role to a younger man. I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in a sombre, mostly emotionless, balding middle-aged man. Despite all my criticism, the film can still be interesting - just not very convincing. The fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic character that is a bit intriguing. The astonished heart is certainly worth seeing, but it is a flawed piece of cinema.
