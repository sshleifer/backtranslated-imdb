OK - say, a college in Southern California has a film lesson. And some guys were just enrolled for movie girls and gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or just stupid to use a camera, and they gave this to their degree. AND NOT INITIAL. <br /> <br /> That's my only explanation for this. My God, they have left the date and time for some time. The picture started in a new scene before the sound and forgot an action. Well, apparently there was one and they had to tell you everything after the three-hour introductory sequence was completed. But I'm glad they did, because I would never have had it if I had looked at this.
