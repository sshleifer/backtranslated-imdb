If the league had been unknown to the script, supporters would simply have turned around and said, "No - you do not have the money - that's terrible." As a fan of the League of Gentlemen, this is the worst trip so far. Not very funny, not particularly entertaining, there are few laughing moments. They exist, but there are only a few. I found the format tired and really sluggish. The film refers to the writers getting bored and showing it off. As for a movie. I had the feeling that the Christmas special had a better production value. The FX are generally pretty bad and it's obvious they did not shoot in the original Royston Vasey (they made this cheap in Ireland). The score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. Also, the accents of the characters were largely removed from their TV equivalents. Tubs and Edward, barely used, did not sound like themselves. Really disappointing because I was hoping for something far more entertaining. This was really the league equivalent to the comedies of the 1970s, when the actors went to Spain ...
