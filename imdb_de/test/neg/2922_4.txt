This film would generally get a much higher voice from me and I'll talk about why, but primarily four stars, and stay four stars for the ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault. Not far into the film, Oyama sexually assaulted a woman he had previously rescued, and while being briefly upset by his actions, this attitude lasts only about five minutes before the loving worship begins and her character continues through the rest of the movie wearing. I know many will argue that it's not so important in a kung fu beat em up, and as a fan of the genres, I can not say it's all weird, but that does not stop anyone from doing it completely tasteless when I see it. <br /> <br /> What I'm going to say in defense of this movie is that it's refreshing to see martial arts or even action movies of any kind that will not leave any real heroes behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer. a social outsider whose only student is completely mentally out of balance before being gunned down by the police. The film's final shots suggest that Oyama himself is ready for a big breakdown and does not seem to be interested in the woman he attacked earlier to love, and has followed with puppy devotion ever since. <Br /> <br /> Whether this was really the intended message of the movie or not, one can not help but hope that Oyama could be on the brink of suicide before the end of the movie. This is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a movie in which you feel like your violence is not being celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had handled the topic of sexual violence better, either through more emotional depth and more recognition between the two characters involved, or by omitting the whole thing, this would have been a much more interesting film.
