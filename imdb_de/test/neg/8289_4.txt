A female high school track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race against the community in a riot against community coach George Michaels (Christopher George plays him as a big butt VERY demanding the athletes under his supervision). He is canned after the school has missed the motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopaths in outbreaks of sweat (similar to what Michaels often wore) used a stopwatch to determine his executions and murdered the members of the track team the dead runner belonged to. Soon, disturbed parents call the director Guglione (Michael Pataki) and wonder why their children have not come home after a prom party. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) begins to snoop on the worried desire of parents on campus. Immediately, a besieged Michaels becomes a prime suspect after a gymnast's body is found in a locker. Ensign Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned home from her base in Guam to receive the diploma from her dead lane nurse and soon confronted the killer herself in the fast-paced pursuit scene. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is the tired friend of the lost track star. <br /> <br /> A rather leisurely Slasher spreads the death sequences quite a bit by trying to mix humor and fail miserably. Low quality killing sequences only enhance laughter, such as a sword embedded in a soccer player's belly in a footballer's belly, or a pruner that decapitates a poor soul that gets a leak. Linnea Quigley has a fun role as horny student Dolores, who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher class and always chases after a male stud (the recipient of the secateurs, before letting Dolores sleep outside the prom party). Vanna White has an early role here as a stupid blonde who discovers the body of the dead gymnast in the locker. Vergil Frye has a stupid role as a clumsy officer.
