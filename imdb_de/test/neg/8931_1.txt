This is currently on my TV ... but only long enough to finish in this commentary. The previous comment lets me know that this movie does not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I agree that this movie is a colossal waste of my time and would be of your time ... it will not get any better! I can not believe that scriptwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved millions of times! I see some other credits in his resume that have received good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with his work, please write something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged and hate it when that guy turns it into the garbage, as this movie has turned out.
