This movie is called "Solomon Kane". What it is not The main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane, as he's been known from early pulp magazines and many releases ever since. It's a fantasy movie, not really that bad and it could easily be passed with a pretty good review - if it had not been called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is definitely not SK. The story is not Robert Howard either. <br /> <br /> A fantasy movie is another movie that follows the traditions of the genre: simple story, bad CGI, bad actors, bad direction. But it can be fun, you know: the cheaper, the better. But since it's called Solomon Kane, I can not accept it. Imagine a movie about the Lord of the Rings starring a hero, Bilbo, who fights the black sorcerer Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with a final fight in which the three use a magic ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has become the dragon Gondorian. Imagine. That's exactly what this movie did to Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would rate it as 4 stars if it was just another horror movie, but since it's called Solomon Kane, I can only rate it with 3 stars.
