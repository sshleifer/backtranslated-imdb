I will be generous here and only award a 3 because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. The movie was pretty bad. It's as if they started off with hardly any script, and the director just ordered the actors to look meaningfully at a lot of music playing about it. And Billy D. Williams looked like he was somewhere else than in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I could write a better script than the filming for this movie, and I'm not an author. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I mentioned in the reviews and message boards - everyone is under the impression that the film is about World War II and actually looked more like it should be in the late The 1950s / early 1960s begin. While the military has not been separated by then, I'm pretty sure all the troops waiting for the train would be separated in a place like Huntsville, Al. If the beginning of the film was the 1940s, then Billy D, Lesley Ann, and Rae Dawn would have been in the 70s and 80s rather than the 50s or early 60s. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, unless you really like the actors because the story is not very interesting.
