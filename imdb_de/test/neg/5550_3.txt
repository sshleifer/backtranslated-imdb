Say what you're saying about cinemas "Wizard of Gore", Herschell Gordon Lewis, it must be acknowledged that he's from his first films (1963 trashy "Blood Feast" and 1964 Crackerbarrel massacre "Two Thousand Maniacs") to to his last (1972 "The Gore") Gore Girls "), the man remained faithful to his muse and happily chopped the bodies of young men and women for the delights of the camera." In Gore Gore, for example, someone mutilated pasty-clad and pasty Dressed strippers at Tops & Bottoms Club, and offensive ex-detective Gentry hired by a Hotty Cub reporter, the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, abysmal acting, repulsive characters, problematic sound, and of course some Lewis's patented gross-out scenes, such as one of the strippers poking her face in boiling oil, one tearing her head; another has ironed her face and cut off her nipples; and yet another has her butt paddled with a meat tenderizer until her entire back is covered with a buitoni tomato sauce. (I could have been wrong here, it could have been Ragu.) The film also throws some lame humor, though some of the lines are pretty funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the slain stripper Suzie Creampuff ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says "Made In Poland" (I do not know why, but I thought it was funny). And some of the stroke club owner Henny Youngman are of course amusing. However, this is NOT the movie shown to Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. It's one of the sickest you've ever seen, with only one surefire, mass-loving moment - the title card at the end of the film, labeled "We Proudly Announce: This Movie is Over"!
