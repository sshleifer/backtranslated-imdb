This is a pale imitation of "Officer and a Gentleman". There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialogue is made of wood, the situations are exhausted. It is too long and the climax is anti-climatic (!). I love the USCG, their men and women are fearless and hard. The action scenes are great, but I'm afraid this movie is not much for recruiting. The script is formulaic but confusing. Kutcher's character tries to save himself for an accident that was not his fault? Costners rages against the dying of the light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this sneak preview for free and I felt like I got my money.
