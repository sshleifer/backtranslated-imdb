After a series of successful films titled "A Man and His Monkeys," which included the title "Every Path but Lax," "Every Path You Can," and "Peter's Friends," the genre fell heavily times. In an effort to rejuvenate the once celebrated area, director Frank Marshall brought the acclaimed novel by Michael Crichton to the big screen. <br /> <br /> Think 'Gorillas in the Mist' meets 'Tron', minus Bruce Boxleitner's headlines. This is a man who is doomed to failure. Not helped by bad accents (Tim Curry fights with a Romanian), a baboon of a script, hungry hippos, falling primates, and Bruce Campbell. Ape-Sh * t.
