Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script some leeway. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that changing just one variable can change the way the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> But what I do not understand is the way that time has changed. We are exposed to a series of "time waves" that are gradually reversing the evolution of the planet. While this is a practical plotter, it gives our heroes enough time to solve the problem, but it makes no sense at all. If you change a variable and that variable has significantly or even completely changed the evolution of the planet, then the evolutionary process, when you come "back to the future", is already established and there is no need for waves? Why should a change that took place 65 million years ago have to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth was projected in time may be somewhat credible, but the life of this moth 65 million years ago had changed radically. Therefore, any change in the history of evolution would have begun and would not be dependent on a return of our current time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team returns in time to prevent the variable from ever changing. If we do this successfully, we will see that the evolutionary changes have never happened, and that nobody remembers the events! Sure, what works for the solution should work for the original change? I like a great sci-fi adventure, but if it's not "in a faraway galaxy," it has to have at least some theoretical foundation to make it really entertaining. <br /> <br /> Good premise, bad plot, sensible acting and, in all fairness, just a twist in Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "watch again" list.
