Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin arrives in the same studio, apparently another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries after Chaplin's action after the studio head Hollern "Next!" Chaplin, however, manages to go beyond Turpin. Charlie manages to do jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he makes a big break, but is a star born? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes that affect the buttocks. The initial scene with slapstick by Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight. Notice that Gloria Swanson is the typist in the background, at the very left of the screen, in the movie opening. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> *** His new job (01.02.15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
