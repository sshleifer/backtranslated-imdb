I can not really remember the details of this movie except that the shot looked very familiar. Then I realized that he was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. That was one of my favorite places when I was younger and wandered around the country. The guy who owns the hostel managed to get into the movie. All I remember is the plot of the movie: Jeeps and naked women. It's great to just look at the landscape (I mean the rock formations) ... If you're just looking for softcore porn, you'll probably be better served elsewhere. I do not even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
