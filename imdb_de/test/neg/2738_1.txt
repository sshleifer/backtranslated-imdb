The script of this film is indistinguishable from others, especially The Core, another bad movie. It's pretty clear why Luke Perry does not get much work, but seeing the beloved Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) resign is simply sad. <br /> <br /> I really can not imagine an action that is not a mile away. That's not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very bad even for TV standards. The lava flow at the beginning of the film, which signals the impending global catastrophe, starts at a very amateurish level. And from that point it does not get better.
