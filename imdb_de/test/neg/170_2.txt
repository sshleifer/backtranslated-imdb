There were so many classic movies where the leading people were liars and still look good. I never bought this stuff. The "Screwball Comedies" were full of this stuff and so were many of the Fred Astaire movies. <br /> <br /> Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous "country" magazine author who has been lying to the public for years and feels she has to lie to keep her person (and her job). She even lies to a man about marrying, another subject that has always been trivialized in classic films. <br /> <br /> She's a New Yorker woman pretending she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies. Of course she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast that you lose track. I think all this should be fun, because in the end the lessons are learned and the true love prevails, etc., etc. Please enter the Barf bag. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is NOT funny. Stanwyck was much better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, return the bag.
