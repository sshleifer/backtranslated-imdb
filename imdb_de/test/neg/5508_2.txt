I'm a fan of Jess Franco's bizarre style and a lover of even his trashy films, and my personal opinion is that in addition to some very entertaining films he has also created some masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" ("Venus") In Furs "from 1969, for example, but it is an indisputable fact that the more than 180 films that this highly prolific filmmaker has made in his career also include a number of big time stinkers." Sadomania "from 1981 is certainly one of those stinkers, only a very bad movie with the ability to pull hell out of you despite the constant sleaze and nudity. <br /> <br /> Sure, Constant Nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but as it keeps on going, you'll be down The only thing that really got me watching was the intensity of the sleaze, which, generously speaking, is a bit amusing. <br /> <b After a couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on an island, they are sent to a local detention center by a woman carrying weapons. As the husband is banished from the island, the woman is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation ruled by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and a very perverted governor. The prisoners are of course very hot girls, most blondes, the guards are completely topless women carrying rifles. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, is of course extremely stupid, but who's going to watch it for a good conspiracy anyway? The (only) interest in "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a "Women In Prison" movie. There are probably two short scenes in the movie, in which we see a woman actually wearing a top, the Sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really evil. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a movie with this extreme amount of sleaze can still be so boring. The Sleaze will watch you at the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes I found it really hard not to fall asleep. I'm also wondering why Jess Franco chose all pornstars for Ajita Wilson who, according to most sources, was a transsexual born man (well, maybe for that very reason). If you really want to see this, make sure you have enough beer at home to make it through, and make sure it's just for letting off and exploiting (and possibly for the slight unintended fun factor). Do not expect to be entertaining, but it's almost unbelievable how boring a movie with such a high sleaze level can be. I'm and always will be a Jess Franco fan, but Sadomania is just bad. 2.10
