It is sad to say that a movie is really horrible and you try to find ways to say it. This is a horrible movie though. Gene Hackman is wasting time (and suspecting many dollars) of playing his most famous and often newly created role as Gene Hackman. Otherwise, television actors have the opportunity to become movie stars and successfully resist the temptation. Patrick Swayze played a subordinate role and moved on to bigger things, for which he must be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a result of a review by someone else and said it deserved a different point of view. You may not agree with my rating, but at least now you have been warned.
