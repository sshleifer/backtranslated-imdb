This movie is the # 1 in the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, with "Lessons for a Assassin" in 2nd place. <br /> <br /> The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, as well yours.) Performance was terrible!), the music could have come from a bad X-rated movie and the story was ridiculous. It had it in common with a typical action movie: The dialogues were short and consisted mainly of monosyllabic words. But unlike the average action movie, there was no real action in this movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> The only reason I kept watching was the hope that there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie at one point. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this one.
