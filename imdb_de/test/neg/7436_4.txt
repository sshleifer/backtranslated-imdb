The overriding problem with this film is that he can not possibly use Bill Murray to the best of his ability. <br /> <br /> If this was a road movie with another comedic actor it might work. Even if both tried to get the elephant across the country, it would at least allow them to have an amusing dialogue. Currently, Murray is talking to an elephant who can not answer with funny babble. In essence, this means that Murray talks to himself, and this makes the movie more boring than he could have been if he had another character he could jump off elephant, but who see Bill Murray's biting delivery and a terrific one Must enjoy a script, look elsewhere.
