Terror in the jungle is a real find. If you have seen it, you are one of the lucky few. It is strange! <br /> <br /> The story is about a plane crash in the middle of the South American jungle. The crash scene has to be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the crash or is then eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blond boy survives. A nearby tribe brings the child to his village and they (all men) worship him for his golden hair! That's no joke! In the end, there is a lot of wrestling between the natives and the man looking for survivors of the crashed plane. Meanwhile, the child sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he screams endlessly !! It's a scream !!! <br /> <br /> Very obscure and contains very questionable subtexts. A must if you are interested in obscure movies.
