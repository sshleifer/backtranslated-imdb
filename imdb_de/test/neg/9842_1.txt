This movie is awful. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations in which the characters fit themselves are so stupid that they are not shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, has decided that this would be a career move. The idea is interesting, two young girls are coming of age very quickly. But sex is not even exciting. The film is stupid, the story is stupid, the performances are stupid and the whole concept is interesting. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls are going around with guys after having their first period and trying to flush their panties down the toilet. Good luck next time, guys. My scale * T-scale *
