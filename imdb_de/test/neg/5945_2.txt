My dad insisted that I watch this movie with him, and I regret that I wasted my time watching it. The "funny" little movie is about the older Don Ameche who stays with his son Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not just "forgetful", as he was told, but has dementia (it seems to be Alzheimer's). And because Papa is so often "out for lunch", he gets in trouble again and again - almost like the delightful Tyke of BABY'S DAY OUT. The problem, however, is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is just fantasy and the baby will be fine. In addition, you do not laugh at the baby because of a deformity or illness. But in that case you are asked to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind - and where is the humor ?! If this movie had been more successful, would the producers have made films that are fun or people with cerebral palsy or a meat-eating virus?!?! There are a lot of people who need to be ashamed to have made this movie.
