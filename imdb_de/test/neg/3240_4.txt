So many bad reviewers have been asking me what people think while watching a simple movie made by a pretty bad director? Did you all expect a super successful movie? No way, you can already see Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-star movies ... All his previous work was multi-star, but no one was flawless. Take, for example, the first Jaani Dushman, so many shortcomings, but still a lot of fun. Anyway, the movie Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy movie about a snake that can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli), who avenges the man who killed him for the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) have caused. It's pretty good, with a great starcast. But I think it could have been a lot better. Take the script, for example, can not say it properly. For example, take the age: <br /> <br /> Are you still 40-48 years old, are you still studying at the university? <br /> <br /> There is much more, I will not list anymore, but there are a dozen more. A solid 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> **. 75
