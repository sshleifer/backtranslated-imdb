I saw this movie at the New Festival in New York. It was by far the worst movie there. It is the use of an uncircumcised, complete nudity of the front and a faded script assignment that requires neither a redesign of "Maurice" nor a Neil LaBute movie decides. I feel like, "Why would anyone ruin such a good cast?" '. It lacks irony and fills the vacuum with emotion, which causes the times in which the film is spinning to cause you to wipe your face while your mind and heart are searching for what is in the film could go, but not. I wish the director and editor had reworked the movie because there may be more stories that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
