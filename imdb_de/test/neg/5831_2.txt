Again and again brings 4kids new shows in his company. In recent years, they have brought pure gold like Kirby: Right Back at Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But back, 4 kids were gone. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to write a negative comment without beating the show, but in truth, Weekenders is pure garbage. It's about a group with an overactive brain. The catch is everything he thinks is bad. It may sound good on paper, but once you've seen it, you'll see how far away the good show is. <br /> <br /> The Pizza Guy is an extremely stupid character. He is very one-dimensional, there really is not much for him. He is hyperactive, end of story. Although many feel that all the characters are a rip off of the South Park, I think the opposite. Mechazawa from Cromartie High School is an interesting character and he can make me laugh. Tino can not do both. <br /> <br /> The cast for the show is not better. Like Tino's mother, she suffers from lack of character. They only stay with one property and that's it. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can make you smile. Whether it's that the scene is actually funny, or you just grin because of how stupid it is. Thje Weekenders is a very shitty show by Disney / 4kids. Although it seems to love some fans, it really should be up to the kids.
