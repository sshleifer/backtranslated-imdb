Calmly boring, absolutely predictable and in the end just ridiculous. That pretty much sums up the Indecent Proposal disaster. With a decent premise, the whole thing just starts and becomes chaos. Basically, it's all about the question, "Would you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Here, of course, the answer is yes, otherwise we would not have a movie. To be honest, it would have been better for us if we had not had a movie. <br /> <br /> Our married (and financially disturbed) couple is played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yes, that will work. Anyway, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, likes the woman and makes the offer in the millions. For a night with the wife, he gives them financial security. The after effects of this one night are what the movie really is about. Unfortunately, nothing is the least entertaining at this time. The script is so predictable that you can tell the lines of the characters in advance. The performances leave something to be desired. It would be better for Harrelson to stick to comedy, as this attempt at serious acting completely fails. Fear is not something he seems to have portrayed. And one can say with certainty that Demi Moore never has to vacate the space in her house at Oscar awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotions, she gives none. Only Redford largely escapes unscathed. He is appropriately slimy yet confident and clearly the best actor in the group. But he can not save this movie. Terrible screenplay, bad acting, jerking, zero entertainment ... The indecisive proposal is downright terrible.
