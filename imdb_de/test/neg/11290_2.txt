I have to admit that I was deceived by the title and the abstract on the back of the box. So I put it in the VCR and waited ... and waited ... and waited for something good to happen. But of course it never does. The creators of this film should be tied to a chair and see "Saving Private Ryan". Maybe they would learn something.
