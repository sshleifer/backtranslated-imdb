The success of the French original series "Emmanuelle" (I only saw the first one, which was not bad) led to a series of imitations. The Italian counterpart, which even changed the race of his heroine, was much less polished and exploitative - it became more vulgarity in the course of the series. Incredible, there were a total of 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies, the heroine had even changed the spelling of her name to avoid copyright issues !! Nevertheless, Laura Gemser - the title object of desire - became almost as iconic as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (though she is personally too thin for my taste)! Here she is even charged as "Emanuelle" and not with her real name - the director is also "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film is not very interesting: in fact, it would be best to consider it as a travelogue with some decent shots of African wildlife. As for the sex scenes, I do not know how complete the version I had looked at, but although there was a lot of nudity, none of it was very explicit - or even nervous (the scene that came closest perhaps was back then Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other, of course without clothes, in the middle of the jungle)! The film also features an artist who looks like Salvador Dali, but luckily his scenes do not make much of the runtime. The score of Nico Fidenco is typically fidgety pop of the 70s and really nothing to write about.
