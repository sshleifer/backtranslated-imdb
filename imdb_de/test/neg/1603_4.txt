Yes, there is a "sleeper" watching Sleeper Cell, and it was me. After reading comparisons with "24" (as on the cover of the DVD), I expected a fast action-romp. But no ... this series just goes with it. In my tired, half-awakened state, I would think, "He will ..." and poof, it would happen ... "I think the van will roll off ...", and then she goes <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwyn pursue a baby in an extra letter? Could it perhaps be to provide a little T & A? Hey, that works for me, so four stars instead of three. <br /> <br /> This show is not a "24". I saw "24". Sleeper Cell, you are not a "24".
