A true Yawner and a bad movie also for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie or even a pretty good movie, but this movie lags far behind the mark. Charlie is to help find out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house stole the plans for another power. The puzzle is very pedestrian and the drama is not much better. The only salvation for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the movie a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but then the picking is rather slim. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and mates with Chan's daughter. What about Sidney Toler? He's pretty decent, but he looks like he's trying to make the film. What struck me most was how the movie was made. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of his posts, uses many long strikes without action (like Charlie's first walk into the house). Why? The movie only takes 64 minutes to scream out loud! Such recordings tell me that the director had to fill up the time because the script was even weaker than he was used to. This is probably not the worst Chan movie ever made, but so far it's the worst I've ever eaten.
