I had known Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early '70s when he was an inspiring, resourceful writer whom I thought would lead to greater fame. Well, well, the time was not good for Mr. Linaweaver. I suppose the pressure to earn a living makes a higher aspiration superfluous. Another flower whose blossom has remained unrecognized in the summer breeze. Amen. Nothing left to say. And nothing more to add. A sad obituary of a once flourishing career as mentioned above. But it's the price you pay for tracking shadows without a solid foundation or goals for your own life. Because this movie has no purpose and no purpose, and I kept telling myself what happened to Brad's creativity, his once brilliant genius? The years of neglect have worsened his once brilliant mind.
