Rent this Tonite from my local video store. It was titled "Black Horizon". I think someone thought that was good enough for a reissue of 2004 ... <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie, one of the main flaws of this movie. Another big mistake would be to steal Ice-t action scenes from other films, especially from the first scene of his rescue, straight out of the Wesley Snipes movie "The Art of War", with Ice-T paid for the footage , <br /> <br /> The plot is awful, the special effects had little trouble in it (love the wires they hold in space), the acting is wooden (also like the New York / Russian accents)). When Ice-T is in the movie, it's pointless. These guys have also forgotten the fact that there is no gravity in space, but I think they were not worried. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should do what he does "well" again and make American Ninja 6
