This movie really made me think ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, a message behind it or a clever script. Far from it. I wondered what went wrong behind the scenes at Sam Hill. Obviously, something was completely wrong from the start. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at the positive comments on Jodie Foster's film and performance. It was clear from the beginning that Foster had called this phone. An earlier comment even mentioned her facial expressions. I must have seen another movie because Mrs. Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed totally disinterested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward looks like he's also distracted by her energy shortage and he's passionately fighting for his own lines. When he was called to a supposedly desperate search for the runaway Foster, Ward also seems embarrassed about the project because of the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a one-dimensional performer, so I did not expect much from him ... and he delivered. <br /> <br /> Yes, that made me think long after the end. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to link their names to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved. But then to learn that the director has preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> But why are you listening to me? I always think Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, but sensational in lace underwear.
