"R Xmas" looks into the Christmas holiday season into the life of a family of Narco distribution partners from the middle class. There is no story here - just a disjointed collection of events. Ferrara seems to be leaving the juxtaposition of holidays and life with narcotics in NYC jumping between the two. The players occasionally seem to improvise and act, resulting in an unconvincing clock. Overall a bad effort not worth the time. (D)
