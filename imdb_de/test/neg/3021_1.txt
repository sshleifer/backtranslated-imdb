GAME .... Huh ... game. I'm not even sure the damn hosts of this special reality game know what the term "GAME" means, let alone the damn PLAYERS in the game! <br /> <br /> An aspiring PUA would look at that and think ... Hmmmmm ... What was the flying FORK the pointless apology for a demonstration of seducing women? I have seen how my neighbors DOG women with more weakness than the seduced! And it's a UGLY damn dog! And his main tactic is to bend his legs frenetically! <br /> <br /> I challenge the frustrated fools of this show to a showdown. a demonstration of their so-called pickup capability ... Can they deliver? If you want to look at this piece of unreal things, you would realize that these great, mentally masturbating, fucking-loving friends, host to Queer Eye or something like that (not that there's anything) are wrong with that ...), are unable to dehydrate their penis long enough to provide a demo of a REAL customer. <br /> <br /> As you, dear Americans, say: "... 'Nuff Said! ..." <br /> <br /> A message from Down Under ... with love ....
