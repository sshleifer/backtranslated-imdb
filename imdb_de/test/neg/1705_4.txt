Apart from the performance of the talented Austin Power imitator Richard Halpern, this image was your run of the mill-movie parody. Dated movie references will not help the audience, which may face this venture in the future. Watch out for "Groovy" Austin Powers in the hot tub. It's a shit and a half. <br /> <br /> Bad special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous asterisks in tight outfits, so that at least one should entertain (if that inspires you). <br /> <br /> For my money I would rent the DVD of classic parodies like "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
