I liked the whole setup with Ceasar's Palace, the Roman guards and announcers in togas. This event also featured "Torch Ripping Off" as far as the voice of the WWF. Gorilla Monsoon, who had been performing the game for each WWF PPV by that time, opens up and gives the typical introduction, making it look like he's here to announce another PPV. Then Jim Ross introduces himself, who gives his WWF debut, and JR makes the WWF commentary to this day. Apart from that, however, this event is garbage. Good old scientific wrestling was thrown out the window and enters the birth of gimmicks. This was for me the event that the WWF began to go down the toilet, and only recovered in the era of the attitude of the late 90s. Here is a look back at the event. <br /> <br /> IC title fight: Tatanka (Challenger) vs. Shawn Michaels (Champion): A decent start, but considering what Shawn can do, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why WWF apologized to Tatanka. They should realize that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just a hyper wrestler in an Indian gimick. The end of the game itself was very slow. Shawn grabs the referee and pulls him out, then he is counted. It was fun to see Sherri being beaten up after the words. Shawn had to carry this match and had trouble with it. <br /> <br /> The Stenier Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers: Steiners win the victory over a Franknsteiner. This match had its moments, but the crowd just did not seem to be there. There was no heat behind it, I think it was a game just to throw two day teams. <br /> <br /> Crush Vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! AWFUL! AWFUL! This game was totally crappy. Two very lame gimmicks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The end surprised everyone. In the coming months, Crush's heels and Doink's face turned, but it does not seem to interest any of the fans. Unfortunately, this was not the worst game on the map. Razor Ramon Vs. Bob Backland: You have a brand new heel that is very much against a wrestler who was forgotten 10 years ago. The fans giggle and laugh when Backlund comes out. And as with Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel wrestler gets a loud cheering in the face. Luckily this game was short. The right one won, but I wish Razor had made the crap out of the dust and beaten Backlund instead of winning with a small package from nowhere. Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake with Jimmy Hart I would like to hear the full story on Hogan's eye, well, the crowd was really interested in this match, but it had no flow Hogan and Beefcake obviously suffered from ring rust since both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year, and it was Dibiase, the big technical wrestler, who helped make the match a complete trash Dibiase and IRS won the DQ, but to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake ended up playing as if they had won the match. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The Best That match was the four hot girls who escorted Lex Luger to the ring, otherwise that was completely forgotten, the Mr. Perfect gimmick was born for a heel roll and he just lacked the heat as a face and Luger is just a waste of time no matter what hem trick he is. Luger wins by relapsing, although Perfect had his feet on the ropes. Then Perfect spends the post-match to kick his butt. First, Luger knocks him out with his elbow. When Perfect regains consciousness, he goes back to the locker room to find Luger just to get the crap out of Shawn Michaels. <br /> The Undertaker Against Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE CRAP !! What did the WWF think about bringing such a dreadful wrestler as Giant Gonzales? Sure, he was big, but I'd rather see the Brooklyn Brawler in a match than him. It's not even worth commenting. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP GAME: Bret Hart (Champion) Vs. Yokozuna (Challenger) You have one of the best technical wrestlers of all time against a man who only has the advantage that he is a gigantic lard. Bret was able to carry the match, but it was a pretty predictable ending when Mr. Fuji Bret threw salt in the face. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna Vs. Hulk Hogan Pure crap here. Hogan comes to the ring for no apparent reason and Mr. Fuji challenges him to a match after Yoko just won the title. Even diehard Hulkamaniacs perceive this as total BS.
