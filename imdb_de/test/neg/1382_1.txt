Okay, I like to dispel the doubt. I saw his show. <br /> <br /> It's not funny for me. All I remember were many "weird" noises and screams. I do not think I have a smile on my face. The only thing that was a bit like humor was his Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can get dull by the minute you see it. <br /> <br /> Also, what about Ask Whitey? Section? Is this a rip off of "Ask a Gay Dude? / Black Man?" from the show of Chappelle? Is not that obvious? But when Chappelle did, he revealed the ignorance of the subject. Like borate. But what's wrong with picking random white people and shouting at them? That's not funny, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure I've heard certain "jokes" from somewhere else ... it seems a bit like he's plundering "little things" and shouting something "loud" screaming. <br /> <br /> It was not funny anyway. Serious. Do not even waste your time.
