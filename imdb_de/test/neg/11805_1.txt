Nobody can say that I was not warned when I read the reviews (both user and externally), but like most of us were attracted to horror movies, curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we're shouting at people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that horror lovers are always waiting to know what's in there, even though we know it's going to be bad). <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie made me angry. Not because it's as if it's real (who cares ... gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and the dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) Or even because the movie is so bad (and it's me.) being polite here). What really made me crazy is that the movie is not just a rip-off from BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy rip-off. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in sacred cows and when they thought you might outperform BWP and then kudos to them, but they did not even try. The film was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in the horror film (or any other) movie!
