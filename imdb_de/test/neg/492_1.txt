Well ........ how and where do I begin to describe this nonsense? Imagine the morals of a cheesy Hollywood Western, add a lavish portion of the most mundane soap opera action, and try to get the kids to find themselves cool by calling it something "contemporary". This film is all packaged and absolutely without substance. <br /> <br /> It begins with the promise ... young men who dream of becoming rock stars and engaging in the kind of over-the-top hero worship that everyone can laugh about. Then it goes downhill ... faster than a bob without brakes. The scene with the first gig with Steel Dragon is one of the most miserable pieces of "Cine Kitsch" that I've seen in a long time. The singer performs on stage for his debut and falls down a few steps ..... will he get up and sing ??? ...... or does he stay on the ground and does not sing ...... who cares? It's getting worse, but I do not want to be bored, remembering all the agonizing details. If you look at it after this review, it is your own fault!
