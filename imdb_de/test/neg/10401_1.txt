Kubrick was perhaps the best director of all time. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He was perhaps a perfectionist. But man, his first attempt was ever bad! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had a good reason to make this film disappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood movie. It has weird narratives, cheap recordings, bad dialogues, ominous music reminiscent of your '50s sci-fi / horror movie, and what does it look like relatives of the cast of "Reefer Madness" going mad for no reason. > Sure, you can see a vacant Kubrick there. It's a psychological / cruel study of the war. The characters became dehumanizing and crazy. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and certain facial expressions of different people. And there are a few interesting shots. But that is really a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course I do not discourage you to look at it. When you get it, join a select group of me and a few thousand people worldwide who have access to it.
