No spoiler had to distract you from it ... well, bizarre movie. Canada becomes part of the USA. OK. I think I'm unusual, but I expected something with the impact that Canada will become part of the US. Silly me. Continue with this movie and go to the Cloud Coocoo Land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, in which you (trust me) do not have to worry about one of the squats. Slings and Arrows and Due South are among the most imaginative series of all time. But in this case, Paul Gross, I'm so sorry, had no idea of ​​making a coherent film and wasted many talented actors. A real disappointment.
