It's sad what they leave at film festivals these days. I had to go through this bleak short show for over twenty minutes, which was not funny at all, to get a good spot for a feature film that I wanted to see at a local film festival. The festival designers have combined these terrible shorts with a great feature. I'm just glad that the feature was good, otherwise I would not have been a very happy camper. <br /> <br /> It was not fun for a short comedy movie. The title says it all.
