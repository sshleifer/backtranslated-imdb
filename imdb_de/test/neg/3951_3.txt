Following the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers owns Stay Alive, a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of Erzebet Bathory, known as The Blood Countess. The group begins to play the gruesome game Soon, they are killed one after the other in the same way as the character they played in the game. As the boundary between the game world and reality vanishes, our heroes must find a way to defeat the evil blood countess. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly poor teen slasher strip without tension. Director William Brent Bell does not have the damned idea of ​​how to make an observable horror movie. The fear of terror is irritating, the blood / blood level is almost non-existent and history makes no sense. The dialogue is extremely bad and the actions of all concerned are embarrassing. "Stay Alive" is by far one of the worst 2006 mainstream horror movies of 2006. Stay away from that stinking crap.
