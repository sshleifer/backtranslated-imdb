Why spend a moment getting around this awkward and self-confident movie? Every now and then, after an hour of boring acts and amateur drama, we begin to swing parts of the big band that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey separate and together the great musicians they were. Occasionally - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra "Marie" and an outstanding piece by Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra in front of Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes", we get a complete song , <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the movie is in the public domain and the DVD broadcast is as bad as acting. My copy has only four chapter stops. That means you can get arthritis in your fast forward finger when trying to get to the good things. The swamp you go through is Hollywood's version of the life and battles of the two Dorseys. Tommy, who is great on the trombone, and Jimmy, who is outstanding on the saxophone, could not stand normally. In 1935, they finally parted when Tommy founded his own orchestra. Everyone had more success than alone. They reconciled when her father died in his forties, where the film ends. Later, they managed to tolerate Tommy's orchestra when the big-band era failed to materialize in the 1950s. Tommy died in 1956 at the age of 51 years and vomited while sleeping for alcohol, pills and a large meal. Jimmy died in 1957 at the age of 53 years of cancer. Jimmy was enormously talented and of all things a pretty cool guy. Tommy was hugely talented and of course often a presumptuous jerk. But good music offsets many mistakes, and the big-band sounds the two have created have significantly shaped the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the movies, and we see them developing, from Tykes (with children actors) to adult men fighting and wailing. The film is not only tainted with her two parents, but also with the clich√©s of Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, all smartened up by Hollywood, who only want their boys to get along, but also with an important sub-story, a romance between Janet Blair As the childhood friend of Dorseys, who becomes a singer with them and is an intermediary and enabler for most of the day, and William Lundigan as a pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to know why she never became the star she probably should have, just watch the films she used to put her in her studio. Lundigan just takes a seat. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie unless we actually hear the Dorseys play? Well, here is a song that was written specifically for the movie and Blair was given to dream. It means "for me". <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of a rosary ... the rise of a rising sea ... the glow of a star ... <br /> <br /> The rose of a rosary? The movie does not get any better than this and it can not get any worse. But if you like the Dorseys and the price is right ... Well, in retrospect, I still would not buy it. The highlight for me are Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes". You can watch them for free on You Tube. You will also find some of each of the Dorseys there. I wish I had known.
