While I was in Madrid, I could see a copy of this movie. Impressive! Gallo is great. He gives very unusual performance. However, apart from Gallo's genius, the film is a boring movie I've ever seen in my life, and sometimes it's so badly made that it borders on ridiculous. I'm also a fan of Val Kilmer, so that's why he was part of why I tried so hard to watch the movie. The problem is, Val is only in one scene. Having his name in the cast as the lead actor is an insult to my intelligence and the rest of the cast. I have only seen Stranded the directors of other films. Both films are far below average, but both contain very interesting Vincent Gallo performances. If you're such a Gallo fan, I watch this movie no matter how bad it is. If you do not like Gallo then there is ZERO to love.
