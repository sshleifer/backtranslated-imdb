The problem of this movie is the same problem the TV show had, and that's stupid Stan and Jack. There's nothing wrong with filthy characters, but Stan and Jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s / early 50s! And there's something to complain about - not to mention creditworthiness - dealing with young girls who are young enough to be their daughters. Basically, it's a 30-minute episode that spans 90 minutes, with all actions taking place in a camp instead of a bus stop 10! Come on, guys, this movie does not deserve more than a 5
