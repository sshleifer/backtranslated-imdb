I know we should not expect much from a low budget indie movie. But the idea behind it is reasonable: an attempt to open America's eyes to the friendly relationship between the government and the journalists who should keep an eye on it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it comes from his drama. The protests during the 2004 Republican Convention in New York were not so compelling to make a documentary about it. Such compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to stick to a drama format. Perhaps a slow build in which the young journalist's eyes are gradually opening to conspiracy.
