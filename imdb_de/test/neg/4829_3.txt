The speed at which I believe it is a direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I have not seen it) gives an impression of a test match that is very exciting in the first four days, but in the end a very boring draw Has. I saw this movie on rented VCD on January 12, 2008 today. The release date is October 19, 2007. Fortunately, I did not know much about this movie yet, unless it's a flop at the box office. When I look at the movie, I feel like this movie might have been a very good movie, but then the director falls back into the trap of Bollywood traditions and wasted a very good chance. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a Bhatt movie, it has to be copied from somewhere else. But it does not matter to me today if I did not see the original movie. I just found the main theme very similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the film, Sanjay Suri is shown a secret agent, but his wife thinks he is a cook. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use of the phone. But even what I found out now comes from the movie Cellular. So when a movie is made with a mix of so many other films, its future is clear. <br /> <br /> The things I like about the movie are its speed. As the name suggests, things are happening really fast, and there's not much time to think between the scenes. However, in the last 20 minutes, this is where the movie in the traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum Dhishum goes. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is also pretty interesting. Three stories in parallel one after another. One of the abductions of Urmila, the other the Zayed, who tried to help Urmila, and then the Prime Minister's murder plan. Of course, these three stories are mixed together as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> But then the ordinary style of playing and the unnecessary extra style have destroyed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri makes no other impression. This also applies to Urmila, who is always promising in RGV films. Due to this common drama, some scenes do not convey the feelings the director wanted. For example, The scene at the end, where Urmila leaves all hope and cuts off the phone, would have had a good effect. Instead, we just wait for the end of this scene. <br /> <br /> Apart from acting, some unnecessary love for style discourages the movie. Showing cool bad guys is good for Hollywood movies, not for Bollywood. The background of London is synonymous only for style and not much intelligent advantage of this background to see. Especially in the end, all these dhishhumdishhums were absolutely unnecessary. Maybe the director has the impression that the climax in Hindi films must have such struggles. They look unrealistic, lengthen the length of the movie, and make people leave the theater before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the movie can be seen once. If it's on TV or you can rent it, it's fine. But make sure once again that you have the remote and forward buttons on hand. Next time the movie is on TV, you can watch other channels safely.
