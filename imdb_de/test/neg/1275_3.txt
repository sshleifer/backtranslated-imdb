Maybe I do not understand it right. I mean the movie. It does not make me happy or whatever has to do. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, this is a simple family movie with children for actors. Just admit that all films of this type can not overcome the barrier of 4 out of 10, no matter who is in the movie (example: Antonio Banderas played in this kind of movies ... two or three of them can not match the exact one Remind counting). I got bored I almost fall asleep just because the topic is so clich√©d and the acting was so predictable. But I'm sure my kid will love this movie when he's big ... Hey, I'm not a monster, I found some funny or good moments in the movie. The owls in the movie were sooooo cute. The trick with the painted police car windows and the blows that the child got from a golf ball in the head ...
