That's 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom! <br /> <br /> In this action movie, even the weapon Baldwin uses (HK G3A3) shit. It was sent for recycling by armed forces worldwide in the mid-1980s and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. If I had known that this movie was so bad, I would rather watch 10 episodes of MacGyver save the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no drive and no feeling. Are you looking at the Tupperware channel? it's more exciting than this apology for a movie. This movie does not deserve '0' on the scale. Good luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, I will sit here and see my toenails grow? this is far more exciting than 'Target'.
