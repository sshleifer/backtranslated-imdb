Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who goes out with a young actress who has teamed up with the head of a movie studio (she's too young for both!). At a party, when he lights his cigarette, the studio boss throws a high-alcohol drink in the face and he catches fire. In the hospital his face is completely connected and he still lights a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of the Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also lights cigarettes! <br /> <br /> Mitchell recovers more or less from having burnt down on one side of his face, which looks really bad, has gray putty and tape and an eye patch. If Mitchell does not smoke, he kills people. Well, he sometimes only kills people because he prefers injecting them with something that puts them into a kind of waxy coma. If he does not manage it on a regular basis (and he never seems to remember), they start to move a bit again, even though they are in a kind of hypnotic zombie state. Not all his sculptures are human. Obviously he has talent as a sculptor. <br /> <br /> The ending, which seemed to come from a much worse impression than the rest of the film, is really absurd. They did not seem to know what to do and returned to the title for an idea. Apart from the odd grainy final shots, the rest of the film is in pretty good condition, except for the sound in some scenes that sounds like it's going through a blown speaker. By no means one of the better wax film museum films.
