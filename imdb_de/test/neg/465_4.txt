I have to say that I was not impressed at all, probably because I expected much more from this movie. Maybe an accent on religion versus science or the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So if you expect to think about something after the movie, do not do it. It's more psychological than philosophical. I choose 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit and because I pay great respect to BBC documentaries. There are a few very interesting scenes that actually make sense. It was a brilliant idea to include it in a movie about evolutionary theory, too bad it was not the main topic. Ah, I just forgot to say that the movie is pretty boring and somehow cruel for more than 1 hour.
