After spending two hours of my life watching this movie on late night television, I went back and read IMDb footage again to remind myself why I even saw it. In retrospect, I can only remember that the genre appeals to me. But this movie was a waste of effort. It fails on every level and seeing that it is described as a comedy on IMDb really baffles me. I can only remember a few giggles. There are more laughs in every episode of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Too much interaction of the characters just seemed to me to have no foundation and was therefore very unlikely / unbelievable. <br /> <br /> If that was not the case I was for the almost unlimited bikini shots. Well, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or pick it up and just rewind to the bikini shots. Do not even spend $ 1 to rent it.
