It takes forever to get this typically over-simplistic and idiotic film by Stephen King out of the starting blocks. About half an hour is spent on unnecessary introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal issues that might thrill bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or naively thought). The mutt does not look as frightening as Leonard Maltin, the notoriously perplexed / hopeless and always grinning film critic, would not agree with: he considers Cujo to be "really scary". (I often wonder if Maltin is really fat - or just fond of his Hollywood friends ...) It's both illogical and inconsistent how Wallace survives an attack with just one leg injury. And of course, her car stops when it needs it to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror film clich√©s; Trust King to use it with minimal impact. The premise is too stupid, too banal, even for a horror movie: A rabid mutt attacks a family. Is that it? This kind of thing barely represents a 3-minute sub-sub-drawing in an average zombie movie. I think even Cujo must have felt that he plays in Turkey. Mutts have awful agents ... But what I really do not understand is how people really can throw themselves on the "Cujo" book and read it from scratch. These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, d. H. Why do you treat time as a pointless commodity? <br /> <br /> Body count: 3.
