Well, I like watching horror horror B movies because I think it's interesting to see stupidity and inability of the creators to make really good movies. (I always compare these films to - for example - some Spielberg's works and do not understand the big difference in what I see.) I like the films of Ed Wood because they are so inappropriate that it's very funny. But people !!! "The Chilling" is not funny and not even "interesting". It is an extremely boring horror movie without EVERYTHING, which also makes bad movies to watch. There is no drama, no script, no direction, no thrill and not even blood. It's an extremely inappropriate amateur movie. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen (and I've seen many "worst movies" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1.10
