This is my first comment on a movie here. I have to say that out of all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead as an example, that's really BAD! I promise. Do not even look at it. It's boring, bad acting, bad script and conspiracy, the whole movie is a big crap! If I could I would award 0 out of 10, but since the lowest is 1, which is awful, I have to vote for it. But I would say the movie is worse than horrible. <br /> <br /> Do not hurt when you see this movie and hope it gets better because I can tell you now that it does not! I hoped that there would be a single scene that would be worth seeing. There was no good scene at all. <br /> <br /> What an excellent crap. <br /> <br /> And Coolio as a vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!
