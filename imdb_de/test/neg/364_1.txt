To begin with, I have been a dedicated follower of C Thomas Howell's career since The Outsiders and The Hitcher. In the 80's he was an aspiring star - also with hits like "Soul Man". The future was bright for this young actor, and he had the potential to continue from there and really prevail in Hollywood. To put it this way: Tom Cruise had a small role in The Outsiders while Howell was in charge. Take a look at Cruise today !!! But if you pick material like this drivelies, Howell's career is only vilified more - if that's possible. Why does he choose such things? A small part in a big movie would be more useful to him than this trash. In essence, the story takes place here in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground, where chaos reigns. Howell is a shepherd who protects the flock of various religious leaders by killing unwanted individuals. In other words, he is a hit man. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad that they would not look inappropriate in a Thunderbirds episode. The use of slow motion repeats itself unnecessarily throughout the movie, but is supported by bad acting (and bad here is a friendly word), no continuity, scenes thrown in for no reason, vehicles that look like made from a cornflakes box and a directorial style bordering on stupidity. Oh yes, and the story was pathetic too. <br /> <br /> I hate to write bad reviews about movies - especially the ones I really like the star - but this movie is so bad that I do not believe for a second that someone was proud of it could. I am not a filmmaker or a director, but I would hide my head in the sand if I spent so much money and time on this film. <br /> <br /> In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to ever see this movie. There was a DVD player I bought for free, but I still put the thing off halfway because I was embarrassed by Howell. Come on, C - give some credit and get rid of these unrepeatable wonders and try to squeeze you down and get a good deal - no matter how small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.
