The glory of a movie is that Martin Sheen's younger, lesser-known brother plays the lead role. They know that it will not be really good. "Soultaker" is a stupid low-budget movie about a group of 20-year-olds who are being persecuted by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it's pretty entertaining and in its stupidity even a little bit sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot in the movie is very small and stretched as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not a big actor, and fortunately he has only a few lines and his role mostly only when walking. This movie really feels like it wants to be a horror / fantasy franchise because it has the same plot layout as a Slasher. 4 characters, each one dies one after the other ... will everyone live? Who cares? Although it sounds like I hated that, I did not do it. I just did not like it, but most of what interested me, so that counts for something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 min. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
