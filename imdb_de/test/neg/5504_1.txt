This movie is the worst ever !!! Sorry, but that was a waste of good hours. quasi-psychology and b-actor makes a baaaad horror movie. You can say that if you are into bad movies, you will love them. and the "hot chick" was not that hot. There is absolutely no highlight of the movie, and the worst part is the final song. Some homemade things with these words "It's in a terrible state, the world is a mess, when the heads fall and the girls are not dressed, the police are at a loss and eat donuts in their car." Jesus! Sorry guys, but the milk has gone bad.
