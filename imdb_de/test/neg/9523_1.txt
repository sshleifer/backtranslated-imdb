Unlike one of the reviewers below, I do not think that the director of this inept and boring navel gaze should face a great and glittering career. While it is good to see a British director trying to break the boundaries of convention, AKA's only claim to an innovative reputation lies in the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this could be an interesting device, but the only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a two-dimensional movie does not make it more enlightening or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which is very difficult though), you have to deal with the unintentionally funny script. The audience is subjected from Chiche to Chich√© via the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. In summary: the new clothes of the Emperor. And also a rather poor outfit.
