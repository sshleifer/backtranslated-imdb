Can anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K, etc.? It used to be crazy, cool stuff instead of watching Bam Margera act like a douchebag, spoiled 5-year-old, super / rock star wannabe fame and fortune have made him believe we're enjoying it now when he looks childish and idiotic, more than really cool stuff that used to be in ex. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> The acts are so repetitive, there's nothing new to annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments ... The only thing we see is Bam Margera, how much money does he have or whatever. <br /> <br /> I really have nothing more to say except give us back CKY2K because BAM suck. <br /> <br /> I like watching Steve-o, Knoxville etc. a thousand times more.
