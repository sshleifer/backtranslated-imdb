A British teenage film about a girl (Justine) who accidentally creates her dream husband (Jake) by using a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well, not just one) in which it includes being His body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person who can trust them. It sounds a lot worse than it is, I found it more observable because Laura Fraser played more than the film content in it, and she looks really stunning, especially when she dresses in a red Lycra dress to impress Jake , WOW !! if only I had a virtual reality machine ??????
