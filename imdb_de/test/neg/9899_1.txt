There have been some great TV movies in the past. Epics like "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove" come to my mind. Category 6: Day of Destruction will not be remembered when it comes to making television movies. A ridiculously bad story, surpassed only by the terrible script. Cat6DD, as I like to call it, creates more sympathy for the actors involved than the horror in nature that the film should produce. The sound you hear during the movie is probably wind noise, but instead it's actually the careers of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy, and Thomas Gibson (Greg, of Dharma & Greg Duo) who rush faster than homes and trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes that we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film was advertised as the "Amok of Nature". Instead, we get a bad story about how 15 different weather systems commit themselves to produce 150 degree days in Chicago, and then the next day a blizzard from a hurricane that was in the Gulf of Mexico with a storm system from Canada whose Origin, however, was originally created in a global warming altered jet stream ... ENOUGH !! It did not matter what the story was, the acting was awful, the words the actors said were stupid, and 13 scientists had coronarists nationwide after hearing the dribbling that came out of the movie. I did not care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were below average even for TV standards and the storylines were useless. All in all, I really do not like this "TV event".
