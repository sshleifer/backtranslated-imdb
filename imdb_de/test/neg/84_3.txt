The title of the movie "Stupid Teenagers Must Die" made me believe that this was a kind of parody. I later discovered on the original title "Blood and Guts". Both titles are misleading. This is not a parody nor a serious splatter movie. This is something in between, which fails in both areas. A group of teenagers visit a s√©ance in a spooky house and then the murder begins. Sounds familiar, right? Well, this movie does not add anything to the endless stream of similar films. And it's done badly. Due to the lack of light, the entire film is grainy. Now this effect can be very effective, but not in this case. The young cast is not so bad, but the director has no idea what to do with actors. In many scenes, the actors are clearly waiting for instructions, but they are given too late. It could of course also be a mistake of the editor. The characters are unrealistic and the plot just stinks. The tone is sometimes terrible: conversations can not be deciphered, but when you speak or shout aloud, the actors are indeed very loud. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still bad. For me a 3 out of 10.
