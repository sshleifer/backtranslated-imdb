Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) is constantly ripping conservatism and everything Republican. This liberal comic is anything but when he pours his dashing "humor" into the throat of impressive youngsters. I watched the show while I was bogged down in a waiting room while my car was being repaired and the guy was bordering on betrayal. He will bring Al Queda's side over Bush every day. He is shameless and everything he says is interrupted by a false laugh. I remember four years ago "interviewing" John Kerry. The two faced each other, which seemed to lessen a make-out session. It was like, "Get a room, you guys." I do not like it, little treacherous traitors selling their propaganda. Call me flat. The Daily Show has been around for a long time and there are many like-minded liberals who have a brutal hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised about the success, but do many people actually watch Comedy Central? This man from Mancia makes me baref.
