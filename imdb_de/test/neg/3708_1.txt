It's a sin how these things are done, but on the other hand, we would not see the best "dummy scene" ever made. Ahhh, the beauty of low-budget bigfoot movies, you tend to see the beauty the more you watch them, unless your brain melts first. As I said, this has the best dummy scene ever! Words can not express it, you have to see it for yourself. Wonderful lines like "Smells of Meat", "You are human ..." (You will know it, if you see it) The creature makes a blah, Blah! Sound and the scene where the baby is shot will make you cry (with laughter), you will rewind it. Has a chase, snowmobile hunting, a bigfoot folk song as well as a disco song. It did not end there when the friend noticed the "K-Mart wardrobe". You ask, how could you even get to the credits and then see them? I could only explain that as a kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you can not move, and I think you need to know who was behind the mess. All in all, this is a must, especially if you want to mentally punish yourself. It's a keeper!
