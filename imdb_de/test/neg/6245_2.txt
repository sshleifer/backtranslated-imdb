In my search for the worst movie ever, my friends and I came across this little gemstone. It's weird through and through, especially if you do not know (as we did not) that it's a half-sequel to another horror series. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to worry about the plot, except to mention that everyone is complaining about the terrible snowstorm that was coming (this was just like the characters who were shouting "FORESHADOWING!" waved with the arms), and in a strange twist of fate the snowstorm occurs. Budget problems, I think. <br /> <br /> Add this to a magical front door that will open or close depending on the fright effect the director wants to generate and the power is turned off until the physical education teacher decides to take a gym shower with plenty Soap. I admit it; I had breathing problems in some places. <br /> <br /> The only really decent part of this movie, as it turns out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's so much funnier that I know that now. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * In the end, it turns out that the Slasher did it because her drunken friends ran into her and a girlfriend broke out and then the A friend who gets on a train or something , is probably the funniest source of Psycho Killer, reinforced by the fabulous use of blur and archive footage. I'm glad all Slasher's friends forgot about the incident until a flashback was needed. <br /> <br /> Run, do not go to pick this up and see the joy. Of course, the continuity editor should get a prize for that if he did not just get stuck in this terrible snowstorm ...
