El Padrino: The Latin godfather - while this seems to be a direct movie to DVD / Video - my fullframe copy obviously looked pruned - so maybe this movie had a limited movie run. And the title character looks more like a gringo than a moi (I'm half Honduran). Pretty typical rise and fall of a drug dealer movie with the A-list of B-list actors - Robert Wagner (drug lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (crusade judge), Tiny Lister (mob enforcer), Gary Busey (child racist), Brad Dourif ( White Power Jailbird), Stacey Keach (Surviving Governor), Joann Pacula (Surviving Milf), Faye Dunaway (Criminal Lawyer) and Galo Make Canote as uncredited party guest The Skins Game - the only thing that saved her was Jennifer Tilly crazy latina drug traffickers - she was over the top and sexy that made it fun to see her scenes. It is not worth renting or looking for it. D +
