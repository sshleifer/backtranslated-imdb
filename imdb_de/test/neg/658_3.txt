Compared to the recent Gore-strip HOSTEL, which this film reminded me a lot, I would say that See No Evil is a bit better, but not much. The very complex property includes a handful of offenders who are being taken to a run-down hotel for a shorter prison term. The children are soon killed by a lumbering religious psychopath who cleanses them from their sins (I guess). The only thing I dreaded most was the fact that it was staring at a WWE wrestler, Kane. In the end, he did a decent job, considering he only had two one-word lines in the film. There are a few pretty bloody moments, especially window dressing and a memorable scene in which a girl gets a cell phone stuck in her throat - probably the most effective demise in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this movie is really new and definitely anything but great. Can not recommend it.
