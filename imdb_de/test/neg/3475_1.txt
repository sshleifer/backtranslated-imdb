What a disaster! It's usually a joke to criticize a historical film, to point out the inaccuracies added by the authors to create "dramatic" situations. "Imperium: Nerone", however, is a whole animal. In this film you strive to find EVERYTHING, which is confirmed by the historical records amid the Farrago of nonsense and fiction portrayed as the life of the Roman Bad Boy artist. <br /> <br /> And it's a pity, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all Roman emperors. His life was filled with enough turbulent events and interesting people to make a really good movie. The producers of this mess chose a different path that only makes every informed viewer crippled. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is portrayed as a 6-8 year old boy when Caligula killed his father for treason, exiled his mother Agrippina and the boy of slaves in the country has set in the world. Ten years later, the story continues shortly before the assassination of Caligula. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four-year reign and was only three years old when he was murdered. Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly banned for bad behavior, not for treason; and Nero was not educated under slaves, but had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. Okay, according to the authors, Nero is now about 16 years old when his great-uncle becomes Claudius Kaiser (in fact he just wanted to be 4 years old); Agrippina constructs the sinking of Empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero. Then he sets out to conquer Britain, and is poisoned soon after his victorious return from Agrippina. Nero is declared Emperor, although he may be only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 BC Two years after the beginning of his reign. He lived until 54 AD. Nero should have been 31 years old by that time, but at the age of 16 he had passed the throne. History tells us that then followed the "Five Good Years," where Nero wisely and well ruled under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian Commander Burrus, this is shown, to some extent, except that it is wrong Senatorial opposition to Nero began when he showed signs of insanity and killed senators for real or imagined treachery. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's mother Agrippina is the controlling one Sort of murdering her uncle husband to make her son emperor After a while, Nero gets tired of her interference and decides to kill her In the movie, he sends his henchman Tigellinus to kill her, all right, but the reality was so much better! Agrippina was a survivor and was not easy.Nero tried to poison her three times, but as an old poisoning artist, she was very skilful ick in it, and he failed. Then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedroom, but that failed as well. Next, he sent her on a journey with a ship deliberately designed to fall apart and sink; As it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam to the shore. Finally he stabbed her. If you now show everything that would have definitely improved this movie! <br /> <br /> There are plenty of other mistakes: Nero's lover Acte was not a childhood chattel friend, she never rejected him, and there is no evidence that she became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by slicing his wrists on a lake. Etc. etc. The sources for Nero's life are primarily the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both from the Senate class and hostile to him. The evidence, however, shows that he was very popular with ordinary people, unlike one of the last scenes in which he is thrown from the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide and producers take an inherently interesting story with a lot of good stuff for every movie and do THIS bitch? Oh, and did I mention how kitsch the sets and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> A star because there is no way to rate it lower.
