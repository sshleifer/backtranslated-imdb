<br /> <br /> I saw this movie during a festival here in Munich with a lot of real fantasy fans. Approximately in the middle of the movie part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was shopping. Boring dialogues, badly choreographed combat sequences, a terribly stupid story and even worse special effects. At least the actors did not have much to do except look anxious or (if they were female) to show their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who later became part of the audience, acknowledged that he could understand the audience's disappointment. Be forewarned, folks, before the cheapest fantasy movie ever.
