The alleged "Screaming Queen" Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes travel west to the title site and are exposed to cruel murders that prove to be a cult of a former Confederate psychopath attempting to revive the South through mindless massacre. <Br /> <br /> Action and suspense leave a lot of boring dialogue and uninteresting character development. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful (not to mention meaningless) role of the urban mortician, but anything else about this would-be slasher Western is extremely bad, including the city and the fort, both how modern-looking Western tourist traps and costumes look like they were bought in Party City. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch Ravenous instead.
