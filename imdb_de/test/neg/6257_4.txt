"After a joke that Jim Wynorski once told" ... I read that at the end of the credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski must have a horrible sense of humor! This movie is really terrible. I loved the first two chapters of The Slumber Party Massacre series. The third movie was pretty useless, but compared to this bitch it's worth seeing! There is not even a driller killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the places, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reason to see this turkey are the girls: If this movie was a porn, it would have worked a lot better in my opinion! Also, the movie lacks blood: The first scene (in the tent) could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking on the door took a second! Some moments with a light thrill can not save a plan that does not exist. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only wearable character in this movie! Oh ... there is a nonsense part with Brinke Stevens, who performed "Linda" in the first Slumber Party massacre: The police bothered her to learn more about the killer; But what we get is just a few shots from the first movie! No dialogue, no monologue, or anything about this still traumatized adult girl, who has to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says) and give us no clue to the killer! > <br /> Watch at your own risk.
