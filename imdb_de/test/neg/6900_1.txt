When my six-year-old fell asleep in the theater during the movie, that was the confirmation that I needed this movie to be a stinker. It was boring. The scary parts were boring. The maudlin parts were boring. Even the funny parts - with two minor exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I foresee predictably? Examples: 1) The rough but loving dad is indulging his child. 2) The rough but loving father who buys the farm (while singing a song ?!). 3) The brat of a child who decides to cut and run, but thanks to his friends, it puts things out because they need him. 4) The brat of a child who gains incredible chances. 5) And a naughty character voiced by an African-American actress. I have to attribute to this filmmaker this piece of originality and the existence of this stereotype. I mentioned two funny parts. In both cases contributed by minor characters. The mouse bouncing off the farmer's pulse was funny. The farm dog, who fell victim to his doggy weaknesses during his leadership matches, was funny. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a Hipness Thru committee movie and make it even more hip by making it a computer animated film, and that was the result. And why do the coyotes mute the Batman villain by monologizing with their victims rather than just eating them? Oh yeah. In this film, children do not need blood, which is already focused on fake alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. And the fuzzy thing in a box? What exactly was that? A porcupine? Tasmanian devil? What, apart from a really stupid plot, with which Otis the cow can win the mother of all battles? Barnyard is a bomb. And I did not even have to mention the udders.
