The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima. It just does not make the transition to a credible story about Britons and Americans. <br /> <br /> The story is sluggish, especially the part in which Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director intervenes with the clich√© shots of a ship's bow cuts through the waves and the small route line fills the charts while her letters are heard in the voice. The movie moves so sluggishly that I'm even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes that are long but not passionate or erotic. The film gained some notoriety when Kristofferson's then wife divorced for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the shoot. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but for a viewer, it's not quite the same. <br /> <br /> There are no characters to cling to. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikely, the child is abominable. Kristofferson is kind enough, but he just does not have the acting skills to make a difference, though we may not really want to get involved with him, considering his last fate. <br /> <br /> As for the little kid, well, he somehow falls into a bad amount after his dad dies, and they help him plan something evil against the man in his mother's life goes. That's a really bad crowd. They are not just shoplifting and smoking, Nosireebib. You treat a cat to a Mickey and make it alive. This is shown in detail. But of course that's just practice, so they can do the same with Kristofferson. <br /> <br /> So, the movie usually moves slowly without characters referring to it, and when something happens, it's relentlessly morbid. <br /> <br /> The end is about as unsatisfactory as any movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> All this would have made sense if the Japanese area and the cultural context had been preserved. It looks like it's just miserable. <br /> <br />
