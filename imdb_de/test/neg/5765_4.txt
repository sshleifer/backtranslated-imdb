This is an embarrassing nth repetition of the same action in the ninth heap of idiots, young adult who is in danger because they are idiots, Slash movie of the early millennium: This time we get the story of a Mad Miner coming back from the dead to retrieve his gold from the hands of the usurpers. We have almost no thrill, almost no bare flesh (even if the girls are really hot, only one of them shows her bare ass for a few seconds), the usual bunch of Sunset Boulevard horror stars in cameo roles (this time Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), lots of fake blood, only the crazy miner resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to keep you on screen until the very end. Do not waste your time if you are not an executor.
