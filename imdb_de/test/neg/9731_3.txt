Let me first say that I did not expect much, and it would have helped to see it on the opening night at prime time. I think it would have been if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It sucked so hard. Acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I think that was her way of twisting the plot; Leave all important information in the dark, to understand the direction of the movie until the end and THEN explain things and hope it feels like a twist of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unknown until the end of the movie: -What the eff is a Dunkelling? the CG was cool, but I want to understand! -Why can no powers be wanted? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -Why is will-will so bad? your normal after, right? -was it farted? About 50% of the minutes with only men on the screen were shots of her in women's braces, sleeveless t-shirts, and then a disassociating pool scene of all youthful men in Speedo's shortest riding, who knew they'd ever made it were. I swear you could see the start of one guy ... well, it was close to softcore. And, of course, there was a shower scene, and to mix it, that was the DUDES. Butt cracks were abundant, a solid sausage festival. But there was a shower scene for all the girls with nothing to see, and she wandered for about 12 minutes around the best looking bathroom in the dorm. Then there was a PJ party for girls. The other thing I could not overcome was the amount of driving Caleb undertook in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. It was a commercial for about 1/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. or look at a friend who makes fun of bad movies. then it could be worth it. But do not expect anything breathtaking.
