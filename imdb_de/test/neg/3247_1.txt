An insane attack on the senses of the audience. This is a mish-mash of different Hindi and English movies - done badly. The name comes from a multi-star cast of the 70s that the 2002 version also offers. The story is from Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy, the main characters of the 70s - "Nagin" and visual effects (a terrible attempt) by The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> In a college environment ( Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - College Kids !!!? !!), Manisha Koirala is the victim who confuses a deadly attack by two students as a collective effort of our heroes. As it turns out, Manisha is a cobra (nag) natter reborn as a girl in this life, and her buddy from previous life who is now a super-strong all-and-any-shape assumption (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge her injury and murder. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the crazy murderous rush, in which the vengeful lover seeks each man of the group with increasing strength and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely cheap, with computer-generated skeletons, morphing bodies, and motorcycle stunts that complete the farce. Transferring Nagin includes Raj Babbar, who plays a Catholic priest who temporarily gives relief to our boys. Religiously correct "multi-religion medallion (the original Nagin had only an" Om ") Sunny Deol plays Manisha's love interest in her present life and the ultimate savior against the mighty Munish Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you do not fancy cheap thrills.
