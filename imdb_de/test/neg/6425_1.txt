Bad action, bad acting, bad direction. <br /> <br /> It had possibilities, but nothing was achieved. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like someone got started with an idea, a bit googled info and then tried to make meat for one and a half hours with a lot of night shots and poor suspension music. <br /> <br /> Others had to stop because they were 2/3 of the way afraid - I had to take them A break just because I did not care anymore. <br /> <br /> Reminded me of an episode of Days of the Lives with a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
