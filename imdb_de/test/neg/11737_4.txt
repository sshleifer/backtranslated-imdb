The 1998 version of "Psycho" did not have to be reset in the present, but in the 60s. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that appeared like a big thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film, when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) sat at her desk. Her boss brought his client to his office because "it was air conditioning". I imagine the majority of Arizona's businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Purple with the Walkman seemed to be an exaggeration for updating the movie. The movie has scared many viewers in the theater.
