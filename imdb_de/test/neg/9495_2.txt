I do not really know much about the Marquis de Sade because I did not read any of his books, but I never imagined he was a flaming queen. Carson Kressley from Queer Eye For the straight guy or Jack from Will and Grace, it would have been easy to fit into the role Nick Mancuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The film itself was rather thin and looked more like a parody - or an excuse to show the Parisian puff house several times, with men and women talking well on the sofas in the salon. What? You can not afford a room? I thought it was cute that the Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt that she was doing her patriotic duty to take care of the soldier's needs. The movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) might be interested in seeing him in a role other than Inspector Marais.
