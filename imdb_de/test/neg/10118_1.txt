Hm. Where should I start? I usually ignore the IMDb rating when looking up a movie because I think I might like it anyway or whatever and I should give it a try at least, but this time I wish I'd paid attention. > I know some people liked it and I'm not trying to say that they should not. In some places it was amusing. But if you're like me and do not like to watch cats dancing in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random time-lapse scenes, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes, set to "exciting" music, and close-ups of faces while People are talking, you might want to avoid this movie. The actors were either wood or far too high, and the film quality was awful, blurry and grainy and bland and not at all artistic. And I know we should think that Carol was not just a crazy lunatic who shot down innocent people with that weird religious psychosis, but ... Well, she does not really convince me. In fact, I really refused her crazy character. And what about the souls in the universe? I understand that this is a fantasy movie, but come on. <br /> <br /> I'll say the angel ended up being really scary. It was the scariest in the movie, more scary than Darth Maul's Lava Face Demon. I give them props for this scene, it was good. But not good enough to actually see the movie. And the opening credits have been great, but do not be fooled! I would rather have used the money to improve the film. <br /> <br /> Bah. I wish I had not even bought it for the $ 2 I paid to buy a candy bar instead. : /
