There is really little that can be said about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a truly unconvincing hero, and even moreso, when he tries to "undercover" a villain who, we believe, drinks too much and bumps his wife a bit. Margaret Leighton, as wife / underground sergeant, is a little more convincing, but it's still hard to believe that a bonnet worth its salt would not see through her charade in less than a minute. The plot about a bullion raid is stupid, and the action rather than handles. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way that David Tomlinson seems to play all his roles, is the only bright spot in a completely boring affair.
