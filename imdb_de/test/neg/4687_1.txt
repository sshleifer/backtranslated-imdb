You now know the story of "Sweeney Todd," most likely thanks to Tim Burton's new movie. You probably do not know from this allusion to the old story of Andy Milligan - this notorious sleaze trader who fought Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels for their money. <br /> <br /> It had to happen sometime. In my years watching horror and exploitation from the 60s to the 80s, I finally review an Andy Milligan movie. You see, Andy provided us with many commercial exploitation and horror films from 1964 to 1990 - none of which was good and barely visible. "The Bloodthirsty Butchers" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is dialogue and now, people are talking, and that's one of the things you'll find here - lots and lots of talking. The movie sometimes reaches "Manos The Hands of Fate" level, as you wait untiringly for something to happen. Although I like cheap-looking gore effects, the violence is too small and far apart, and despite their reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love cheap and sloppy exploitation just like the next trash cinema fanatic, but "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is the kind of wickedness that MST3K would mercilessly rip. Unfortunately, Milligan would die of AIDS in 1991, and if there is any film of him, I would say I would like it somehow, then it would be the insane "The Ghastly Ones." However, this is not a "horrible" - it's just bad.
