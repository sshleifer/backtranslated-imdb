This show was rushed and relied heavily on surprise cuts on commercials (when she came back from advertising, the noise or the "surprise" was something of a mouse) This is a rip-off from Ghost Hunters and she tries to go beyond them and fails miserably. What about the director's record? Is this a Star Trek? It only ruins the novelty of this show, which quickly subsided. The only reason why it was observed is that people want to laugh about the pure anti-climate nature. They never find anything and most likely never will. Funnily, they always show something they "hunt", and you know what ?! The tower light of the local radio station flashes red!
