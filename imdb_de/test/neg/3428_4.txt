The story of leaving the king is fascinating. An American "Deserter" (I had the impression that he and his three comrades were just trying to escape capture in the Philippines because their desperate escape to Borneo is not your classic desertion). Hardly come ashore when discovered by the Japanese. Nolte's character (a sergeant) walked down the beach just moments before and was not noticed. And unbelievable, no one noticed his footprints in the sand, which had led the Japanese directly to him. In any case, Nolte is visited by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. So he's from the war. Then the British commandos arrive and want the tribe to help them fight the Japanese. Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant Hamming ruins an interesting story. Instead of fighting back to the war like a former soldier, now with a warrior tribe under his command, Nolte behaves as if he had been raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English was almost a foreign language, rarely contractions. When he speaks, he makes extended gestures and behaves as if he were one with nature, as if he grew up in the jungle the tribe. But Nolte's character is never believable. It always looks like he's overreacting. He needed to be a little more American soldier and much less a tribesman. As he is, he does not seem like a royal king, but a madman who has forgotten who he really is. But that's not the intent of the film, as the script is admired and trusted by the British commandos. There is never any indication that the British think his behavior is strange. He is simply regarded by the British as the defacto leader of the tribe. So it always seems that Nolte's character does not fit what's supposed to happen in the movie. Another actor would have done a great job with this role, made his credible and credible lines. It's an awesome movie. But Nolte ruins the movie by setting up every scene and apparently not understanding what his character is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
