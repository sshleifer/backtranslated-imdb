Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a steel plant in Pittsburgh. He works to attract workers for the party, although this isolates himself from his son, his family and his neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a communist to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to strike in the mill, and the strike movement will lead the workers into a propaganda wave. Cvetic also has to contend with the beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school, who realizes that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eve hears the ugly truth about the true motives of the party, the Reds decide that they must be liquidated and Cvetic must help her without endangering herself. The film should be exciting and doubly crossed, but there is very little in this film, but (by today's standards) very kitschy propaganda and little action or thrill. Lovejoy is very good in the lead role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem to be listless. Few surprises here and how did this film get an Oscar nomination for the best documentary? Rating, 4.
