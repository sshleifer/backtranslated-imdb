I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B-movie every day, but this one was awful. The acting (?) Was almost so bad that I turned off the movie completely. I thought I had seen the worst of it all this time, but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! To be honest - it was the acting that made this film for me. <br /> <br /> I found the actor awkward and the lead role extremely boring. This movie had absolutely nothing to offer. I can ask a ridiculous question here, but why the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think that nobody would watch if they let them out? I think they were probably right! Oh, where is Price and The Tingler when you need them?
