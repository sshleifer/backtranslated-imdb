Do not kill me, but I have something to say. <br /> <br /> Pros: Well, the mildest interesting season I've ever watched from all seasons around Inuyasha is the Shichinintai bow. In contrast to the rest of the seasons, I personally think that this one has more of a real plot and these mercenaries. Good God, they are such sympathetic characters. Too bad they were killed. Of course, I would write a 15-page essay, why I like the Shichinintai so much, but that would be boring for some of you. This series actually has some sympathetic characters. I miss Bankotsu ... the poor, poor little psycho boy. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Outside the Shichinintai arc, the series was boring and repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating. Kagome, for example: she overreacts too much to my taste; She looks like Yuka from Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: He is a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword. What is so unique about him? He has ADORABLE DOG EARS! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very naughty. Naraku just has to be the weakest villain ever to exist in the anime world. Miroku and Sango ... they have some color, but they just seem to be too much on the sidelines. But what bothers me most, if they have no COMMON SENSE at all. Rumiko Takahashi did a lot better than this. I have seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like series with a lot of action, no annoying triangle, no excessive repetitions, then that's not for you.
