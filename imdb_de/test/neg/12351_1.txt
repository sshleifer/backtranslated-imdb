I've seen this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style is the biggest amount of tripe I've ever seen. The whole audience (young and old) sat through the movie without laughing about it most of the time , There were literally only about 2 places where you'll laugh throughout the movie. I did not think the movie would get any, but he never did and I wish I had left. <br /> <br /> The humor was really lame and I'm surprised that this ever got on the big screen. I am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie - it just was not funny. The people who made this movie really do not make their money, so please do not pay to see this movie. <br /> <br /> That's not even funny enough to be shown on TV, let alone cinema. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give 0 out of 10, but the system does not allow it ...
