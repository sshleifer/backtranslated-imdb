Move over Manos. Bugs off. It does not take a baby genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this novel) is now and forever (unless someone makes a successor to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie ever. The only horror in this thing is the reputation. I wonder if this was an attempt to get someone through a movie. If that was the case, the babes are not babes, as this is not a movie. It's filth. No wait. I emit the word dirt by calling it filth. Ulli Lommel (by Boogey Man Fame) would call it "over dirt" or shit. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it in a video library on a shelf, just go back and notify the authorities.
