This is a piece of Celluloid CRAP. You can tell when you want to "want" a mafia movie ... and that's it. That did not make NO SENSE at all, did not start at the beginning of his life, characters were everywhere ... and the term "GODFATHER" did not even exist until PUZO wrote the book! ..... THEN, the real Mafia, borrowed the PHRASE and made it AFTER the movie to his own ..... This piece of Claptrap one would think that the sentence (which represents the mafia don) in the 20s Years ago ... when these people were just called "DON" ... outside the original godfather movie: If you want to see another decent mob movie, check out Puzo's The Last Don (Part 1) Part 2.
