OK, that contains spoilers. Now I have never seen such a big pile since the laxative in the elephant enclosure in the zoo has been confused! It has more action holes than moth eaters and the 'realistic' line of action. Well, sexual slavery is a terrible and very real problem around the world, and this bilge heap uses this plague as a mechanism of action to sweat and tease, and shames everyone involved in this questionable verdict. But back to the movie, when you kidnap people from an airport, some of the safest and funniest places in the modern world, then why put a stool inside the car that bugs everything until then. The plot needs a twist. Just wait until you leave the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive quietly to the warehouse and kill the boys, done. Among the passengers, the good guys have put the bad guys out of action on at least three occasions and are armed. WASTE YOU! Once in a movie, it can simply be acceptable not to put a bullet in the skull of the bad guys, but COME THREE times! And after he killed most of you. The guy is also ready to lay down the gun to stop a scarred cheek, but kills a girl for a fungal infection that could be cleaned up with drugs worth $ 20. I could still talk about the number of holes in this thing, but I will not waste any more time. Suffice to say, I was rarely offended by such a terrible piece of awkwardness, and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls voluntarily go to new "jobs" in distant lands and are abused, raped, and often killed by gang masters who meets them from the boat / plane and takes their passports and freedom. This is an insult to anyone whose life is affected by it! Do not waste your time!
