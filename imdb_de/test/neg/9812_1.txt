Incredibly incompetent - like "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon" restored by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Spoiler anticipates: Despite its title and high body count, "Slaughter Trail" is actually a musical with Injun battles instead of dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a B-Movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad in hindsight, such as filming in the short-lived Cinecolor process, which caused faces to change hue within the same setting. But there was definitely some bad advice in the main set of the film, a cavalry fortress that seems to be part of a Norman castle. Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote "The Naked Needs" for Disney's "The Jungle Book," delivers a score full of original Ditties that would have been wonderful for a cartoon, but fits Western action like a fuzzy slipper in a stirrup. A song tells how "horse hooves knock, and their tune sounds like the hoofbeat serenade" ... during a deadly scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally tell the story from shot to shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on screen - and even stopping to promote the Cinecolor process (!). <br /> <br /> The script sends savage Navajos on the warpath to avenge the murder of two of their gang by an outlaw trio. At the end of the film, hundreds of Navajos and cavalrymen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated shootings of the same characters that die over and over again.) But the boss is happy once he kills the Badguys trio. While the singers provide helpful information to those who are not paying attention, the Navajos ride away and their fight is interrupted. The cavalry captain surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades beckons cheerfully. <br /> <br /> The direction is best described as wooden or more than wood-en. Navajos are consistently shot in pairs by their horses - never just one. Virtually every red man on foot dies, throwing his hands in the air and tipping over. The film also engages Hollywood's most cautious stuntmen, who duck before they fall off a single-story roof (and still do not pierce the landing) or turn backwards as they slide "dead" down a rocky slope. <br /> The star is Brian Donlevy, who has certainly earned an Oscar because he is not blushing. After the endless last fight scene - "climax" is hardly the word - he scans a list of dozens of his soldiers killed and shrugs: "It could have been much worse." Trooper Andy Devine sings and robs Gig Young laughs at Andy's antics ... causing a character who was stopped by masked bandits to persuade the gig, "I'd laugh that everywhere!" <br /> <br /> And nobody would forget what a wicked work Howard Hughes might be. Recall that Hughes, as head of the RKO, was the first star of the original star, Howard Da Silva, when HUAC denounced him. It took Hughes six more years to run the once-famous studio into the ground, but it did not help, as he insisted Da Silvas film each scene for this movie and replace Donlevy. <br /> <br /> It took nearly a decade for Da Silva to work in Hollywood again. But if you pick him out of the "Slaughter Trail," he should have sent Hughes a thank you.
