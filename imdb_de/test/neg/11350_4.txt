A Chinese gang attacks another gang at the beginning of the movie and extinguishes it. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed. Strangely, and for no apparent reason, the gang calls on a volunteer who accuses the massacre and goes away until the police decide to stop the investigation. Well, how ONE MAN ALONE is responsible for about 50 deaths is a mystery to me, so I sent that guy away, he just seemed stupid, but that's the plot. Later, when this man comes home, betrayals and intrigues have occurred - almost an hour and fifteen minutes of uninterrupted killing. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a Chinese martial arts movie with a lot of action, then you should probably skip this movie because it has virtually non-stop action and virtually no plot or character development - even if you use it with other martial arts films to compare. I would guess that 80-90% of the movie is fight scenes - endless and pretty well done battle scenes with knives. Fight against scenes again and again! If you're looking for a movie with a body count that may go hundreds, people are cut, kicked and cut, then this is the movie for you. The problem was that at the end of the film literally no more people were killed and the film has lost my interest !! It's not deep, but if you just want to see excitement and action then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie plays in contemporary times and nobody thinks about shooting the hero until just before the end. And if they FINALLY do the logical thing, it is too late and the effort is really very lame! Logical mistakes like this and the lady's suicide (why ???) make this movie a movie that can be turned off like a brain.
