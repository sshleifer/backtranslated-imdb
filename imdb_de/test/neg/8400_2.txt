I really wanted to have this movie, especially after all the turmoil that I've heard. But unfortunately it did not work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion that Lost In Translation did - if you use very few dialogues, study slow-motion close-ups, and focus on pieces of cloth in the area, your story will look magically deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, is for this movie. I was not impressed by the confession in which the protagonist deals with the accident - so we write down everything - so what should we believe? He has since grown up happy and has written a book about his experiences, which is why he was justified for this terrible incident. What, I think, is a movie that evokes empathy for a young man who is? directionless and faced with an impossible moral dilemma, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him and at the end of the movie he has no idea what's right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a mind that only glides through life as it moves on its skateboard. I do not feel for him at all and I honestly wish he had been caught. The entire film is not necessarily about his guilt, but about how he will avoid punishment and / or responsibility for making a bad decision. Not only does he get away with it, he also finds a way to rationalize it in a subtle way. A frightening, negative message that suggests that so many of our youths are so separated from right and left that they simply set the rules as they go about and work for the good or the bad. I think it's an insulting tidbit for today's youth, and the filmmaker's presumptuous arrogance drips with every jerk, overpowering pace, and changing eyes. <br /> <br /> (He murdered the guard, but if you blink your eyes miss you.) Whether it was a mercy act or not is hard to say - it could be that he was so humiliated that he was with flogged his skateboard. "As he runs to the security guard's car, one of his wheels skateboard is stained with blood.)
