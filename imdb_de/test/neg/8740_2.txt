After sitting and watching this movie, I can only wonder why the movie was made. This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen and had no redeeming features. If it was funny, it might have been a very weak comedy, but as an action thriller, it was bleak. <br /> <br /> Slow, no conspiracy, no real action, nothing that comes close to a good dialogue and I have no idea about the characters. What else can I say? Avoid.
