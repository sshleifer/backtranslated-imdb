We can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand binary and those who do not. Those who understand the binary program are burying this movie along with the hackers, while those who love this movie for reasons that none of this crap can happen. Always. <br /> <br /> For a movie to be tried to become a modern movie that uses fiction. It failed horribly. Only an 11-year-old and older can enjoy it and only 30-year-olds may be afraid to have their identity. It loses in the main market for a resale value (I'm looking, it's now boring than at its first release).
