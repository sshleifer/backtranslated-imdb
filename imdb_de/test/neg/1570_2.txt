Let me first say how much I love the TV series. The nature of the class war has always been an issue to have fun with, but this TV series uses it better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy has always been electrifying and the authors each wrote almost flawless episodes. In my opinion, it is the best British sitcom of the mid-to-late 70s and surpasses the sizes RISING DAMP and ROBIN'S NEST. Are you served? and so on. After the ON THE BUSES series had come to an end a few years ago, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it is now called), which had been on the channel for four years. <br /> <br /> But the movie is absolutely terrible in almost every way. The general essence of the TV series has been almost completely removed by the authors of this abysmal film (anyone who immediately notices is not the same person who worked on the series). As a commentator has already suggested, Mildred lacks the sharpness she had in the TV series, and does not seem nearly overbearing. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on the class struggle with the Fourmiles That was the foundation of the TV series, the Fourmiles wrote almost after the first half hour. The plot, if you can call it that, is made up of George and Mildred, who are vacationing in a hotel and mingling with gangsters. First-class talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond is wasted here. Most of them are in their heyday and everyone looks very embarrassed, as if they know very well that the only thing worth paying for is a paycheck (which is not likely to be much). <br /> <br /> The jokes and gags in the movie (if you can call them that) are very much dependent on the traditional British farce, including false identities, embarrassing situations, badly timed slapstick, characters that are in control of the, what happens to them, and generally lose confusion. And everything fails miserably. As another commentator has pointed out, it seems that the authors of this film have never seen an episode of the television series and instead developed a similar result that resembles a CARRY ON-Romp. The scene where George is reduced by Sue Bond's character is especially out of context. <br /> <br /> A secret to this film is the BBFC certification - 15. Why is it rated at 15 when all is visible is harmless, not vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the era of the sitcom spin-off did not end long after the release of this film (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind this film, Hammer, known for producing world-class horror movies in the 1950s through mid-1970s, soon disappeared into complete darkness. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is almost totally washed out. My advice - skip this and stick to the TV series. You will not miss anything, I assure you.
