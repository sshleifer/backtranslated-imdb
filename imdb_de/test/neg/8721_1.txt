The Dune miniseries open with a "flashforward" montage of action sequences. The realization quickly reveals that these are the * best * scenes of the 265-minute runtime, and they are not good. Not good at all. Oh man. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge a book by its cover (even if we're just invited to). Let's give Dune a chance to save himself. <br /> <br /> Well, here's the expected water opening on Caladan. But who is this irritable, strangely ugly man? Paul Atreides? * That * is Paul Atreides? This generic plastic doll? And why does he look so old? What's this? The actor only 25? Well, he * does * not * see it, and that's far too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? Not correct. Alec Newman is a stumbling, muttering buffoon. I imagine him being discovered while sitting in the dark in an acting lesson because nobody liked him so much to let him know that the lesson was over, and he's just too stupid to realize it. If your Paul Atreides has all the signs of wet toast on the screen and a theatrical range from "reckless" to "empty," your production of Dune will be doomed from the start. <br /> <br /> The other actors feel sorry for poor Alec, however, and perform consistently bland and incomprehensible performances, so he does not look bad in comparison. At least * I suppose * that they do that. Because I'm a charity, you understand. <br /> <br /> To be fair, they clearly have no direction. Random gestures, empty or inconsistent deliveries that miss their markers, everything is here. This is like a master class, the way you do not do it. <br /> <br /> Of course there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than in the 1984 movie, but not twice as many because of all of them. Paused filling. Time. <br /> <br /> But we can do it all because of the small budget of $ 20 million, or just $ 5 million an hour. Nobody could expect him to make high quality science fiction films with this budget. <br /> <br /> Except perhaps "Stargate SG-1", which spends $ 1.4 million on a 50-minute episode or "Farscape" of $ 2 million. And frankly, I'd rather see four episodes of both while being beaten in the kidneys than putting me back in the stupidity of miniseries Dune.
