This is utter crap. Do not allow the main character to be so worried that the doctor's bombing is not big enough for everyone. He claims the Doc plays God by telling who lives and who dies during his entire battle, he kills without If he thinks twice and beats people close to death, the main character is a selfish little wiping, because the doctor, who The shelter was built and his friend died. He also killed several nameless police officers. The main character is just a full-blooded hillbilly, who has no concept for the big good. This movie does not make sense. Tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity? (If you say gravity, I'll rape you because the comet is smaller than the moon and you do not see the moon causing volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and avalanches.) Why does a comet cause atmospheric discharges (the red flash, why is it red?) In addition, if you do not know, the FUC KING MOONS have been hit by comets thousands of times !!! That's why craters are everywhere on the moon. The size of an object required to smash the moon into the fragments shown in the film would require a comet the size of the moon itself. <br /> <br /> It takes a large amount of KE to explode a satellite. So. <br /> <br /> An eye-catcher in this film is that the atomic explosion in space has led to a disk-shaped shockwave , This is wrong, because in space the explosion should have produced a spherical shockwave. This inaccuracy also becomes apparent when the comet reaches the moon. <br /> <br /> Someone also tells me why the commander (the person driving the big old broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? I mean, he's just pretending to go to the shelter with them, then he stops and greets the main character. <br /> <br /> WTF?!?!?!? The main character is also an ugly @ $$ hole, he has a huge forehead and thin hair. disgusting. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie !!!
