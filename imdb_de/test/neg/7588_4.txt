It's just that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in Harry Medved's book 50 Worst Movies. Well, I think it's an exaggerated statement to be one of the worst movies ever, though they're still both pretty bad movies - especially the first one, as they've been more eyecatching and "googly eyed look" than I've ever seen In front!! Director Eisenstein and many other people thought the film was "artistic and deep" - and since I'm legally sound, I have to say that I hated this first movie !! The second, though still very incomplete-looking, is a tremendous improvement, as eye-roll is minimal, though in this movie as in Part 1 there are exaggeratedly long and boring scenes! While Part 2 looks rather incomplete and took at least another hour (especially because later in life he never gets into Iran's insane behavior - like killing his son and heir in a tantrum). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse and glorify his own murderous rule, it is no wonder that Ivan's life story remains very incomplete. Even without all the really terrible behavior of Ivan, the very evil Stalin STILL did not seem to have liked the movie and did not allow it to be released during his lifetime. Maybe he did not allow it because he was more worried that people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the movie was, instead of seeing Stalin like Ivan as a crazy guy! <br /> <br /> By the way, there was a section of this boring movie that was so cool that the movie deserves a 4 (without it a 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It's well done and pretty funny in a dark way. The scene was created in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. Incidentally, this is VERY strange, because in the mid-thirties Technicolor developed a significantly improved true-color process, in which everything no longer looked orange-red and greenish-blue. Therefore, during the color sequences, this film looks very much like a silent or early tone color film. Very strange for the 1940s.
