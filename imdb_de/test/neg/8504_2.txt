I only give this movie 2 stars because it has a somewhat liberal plot. Without going into too many details. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is terrible. Really terrible - made of wood, flat. <br /> <br /> The issued graffiti are weak and so damn weak that I can only wonder why they even use graffiti artists. In the spraying scenes, it was obvious that they had got other people to do the 'work'. They could have let the actors do the painting and save a few cents. I would avoid this movie at all cost Something I heard on my iPod will take a while before I can go back there for fear that this movie will come to my mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Unless you think of yourself "Wow, it's been a while since I saw a really shitty movie ..."
