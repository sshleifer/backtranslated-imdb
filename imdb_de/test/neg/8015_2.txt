I hired this because I did not miss the chance to see Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones together before Hollywood fame, but it was definitely not worth it. The only reason I give it two stars is the novelty of seeing it in front of the big pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun, even if she is not the biggest in the world is terrible. Owen seems really uncomfortable being in such a turkey, and he wears a ridiculous, fearfully ill-fitting, chin-length wig (at least I hope it's a wig and not his hair). And the scene in which he dances country jig with Zeta Jones only makes you embarrassed. Joan Plowright walks around the movie stunned - she's probably wondering how she got into a mess like that. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but it's the same with everyone else. Oh, and the writing stinks too.
