Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Minus 50 billion out of 10. If you want hard-boiled action, then do not rent it! If you want a good independent movie, look elsewhere! <br /> <br /> I never thought I would see Burt Reynolds in such a crappy movie. It has the thinnest action of all time. Van Damm-Flicks should win an academy compared to this one. <br/> <br /> Rob Lowe once again proves why he is not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a better drug addict than him. I do not want to bore you with more facts about this crappy movie, except to say you'd rather rent something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point if you get my drift. <br /> <br />
