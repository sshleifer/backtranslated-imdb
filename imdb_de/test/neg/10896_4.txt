There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files writer John Shiban. You feel like the movie is moving so that not everything is as it seems, but I think the movie does not give you enough to really care about it. It's about perception. There are characters that heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) encounters in the movie that she talks and disappears. This may look like a spoiler, but it's something that has only a small focus on the part of the filmmaker. They seem to make fun of us as we watch curiously if we can trust what Nicole sees or not. It never gets a correct answer and I was a bit unaware at the point. There is a time in a movie where ambiguity can only be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose hunt that ends in a dead end and contains little explanation of what we are saying. It ultimately feels like a strenuous exercise in psychodrama. Now, there is nothing wrong with ambiguity in itself, but give us something to catch yourself or you will avoid us. That's how I felt when I saw "Rest Stop". This film is said to be about a young woman named Nicole who decides to flee to California with lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to grow up in Hollywood. They make a supposed little detour to a rest stop for Nicole to pee, but she's frightened when she realizes she's completely missing Jesse. Someone in a crusty, dusty yellow truck is a crazy job that causes Nicole a lot of problems, and we soon find that he disappears behind Jesse when things come in to find a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far away from any existing cities and has limited resources to defend herself against a madman who gives her strong evidence of how evil he can be. <br /> <br /> That's the easy part. When a female character comes into play, the movie makes a really bizarre leap of logic, as we're not sure where she's ever come from, how she got there, and more importantly, where she's going when Nicole tries to to free her from her alleged prison in the toilet cabinet. She meets another, a policeman in the area (Joey Lawrence), who might seem like her savior, but even though he's a victim of the truck driver, startling things come up asking if he even went there at all. The truck driver commits Nicole agonizing acts (as if he were hanging her on the toilet and when she tries to loosen a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock, she gets a nasty bite from him). Then he lights the toilet and leaves her without a permanent sanctuary in front of the animal. <br /> <br /> It's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that makes me listless. Maybe he just torments her, but it seems appropriate in certain situations where Nicole has time to flee or prepare. It does not make much sense, his motives, which bring the film to an illogical idea. Why is he making himself so obvious? Why does he allow her to prepare? It seems I am getting on my feet here, that he likes it when his quarry thinks they can find a way out just to destroy that hope when he finds his next cruel attack. But why does Shiban choose to play with the audience as Nicole experiences unusual meetings with people who do not exist? What are Shiban and the writing team trying to say? And to cover the film's unbridled craze is a family in a camper. They play a small role in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves, but the movie does not do enough for the viewer to explain why he should even be in this film.
