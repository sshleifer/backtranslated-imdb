If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have run mother and son instead of Mirror. I am convinced that this is the most unique film produced worldwide. An unnamed son takes care of his mother, without a name. They love each other, I think. No, that is not correct. These are not characters. They are not even actors who play characters. At least it might be pretty, but even nature seems to be ridiculous and to be changed wherever needed with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have developed a technique that is just as distorted as a distorted aspectation? You should have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1.10
