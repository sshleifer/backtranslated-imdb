This is a fine concept, and the acting of Brando is a fine work. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is pretty good too. Unfortunately, it is a very disjointed, very long piece that should actually be reduced to 2 hours (almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We are tracking the lives of 3 men from 1938 to the end of World War II, and see how they discover who they are and what they could become when they see both the world above and the world around them. what they consist of, discover. For some, it is the women in their lives who accomplish this realization, for others it is the general framework. Too often, however, I have wondered what has just happened or what the import of a particular scene is.
