The most disturbing thing about this movie is not that it's a lot of Hogwash (the CPUSA has never really been as much of a spying threat as the movie). The worrying aspect is the way in which the totally unappetizing tactics of the FBI and the UnAmerican Activities Committee are washed out. Secret informants, gossip articles became accusations, unauthorized searches. This is the kind of thing done by secret police prisons like the KGB, and presumably what the good patriotic Americans fought. But the FBI did it and did not pay any attention. This is the only realistic part of this movie, and they present it without shame. In addition, the Constitution itself is undermined by only Communists calling the Bill of Rights. The film also makes thinly blamed allegations that the black civil rights movement is inspired by communists, another pile of lies. It is extremely difficult nowadays to excuse such outrageous propaganda and even to understand the paranoia of the time, when you realize how harmful it was then to real people.
