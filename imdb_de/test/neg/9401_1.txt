Good to buy American divorce with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, while she has to give in on the price, she then manages to prepare lavish buffets for her workers and to walk through Italy indefinitely without any work or obvious aids.) Tireless boredom and the inevitable Italian lover are the result; This is a chick movie in the most derogatory sense of the term. Lane looks like an unqualified, unsuspecting, teenage teenager who dynamically collides with her seriously fading looks - breaking a plethora of (mostly Italian) stereotypes of cardboard, dykes, divas, senile contessa, and gigolos. Overwhelmed by unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous is an awkwardly used and pointless replica of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar concept was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in "Only You," Norman Jewisons far superior ode to Italy and romance). Tuscan Sun is perhaps the most unoccupied cinema of the last decade despite its admittedly good-looking panoramic views of Italy. A bonus negative point for the alien lover who was parachuted at the last minute to create the target for the target group of Oprah brainwashing housewives in Hollywood. Avoid at all costs, unless you look at Oprah and dr. Phil as a summit of intelligent discourse.
