I do not think that it is necessary to sketch the plot for you because the website and other users have already done a great job. That means, here's my take. This is by far the worst film of 2005, and there were some really bad ones. I do not even have to go into detail, because there is NOTHING what makes this movie. Bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad special effects - you name it. If it's not the worst movie ever made, it's connected to another bitch. I would be embarrassed to let my friends know that I was in this movie. But hey, most people who will see it will, no matter what ratings it gets, so more power for you. If you feel the gaping gap between your neurons for two hours at night, do not blame me.
