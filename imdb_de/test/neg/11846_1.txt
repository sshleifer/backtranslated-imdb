First of all, I want to make it clear that I consider this one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I've seen it almost ten times just because I wanted to distribute the delicious tasteless content of this movie to other unsuspecting victims. It has the intriguing essence of a handheld camera recording the seventh birthday of a distant nephew. It has all the writing of a WWE match. And above all, it has the consistency of a face scratched along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken youngsters in the desert. This scene convinced me that I found something big when I picked this movie out of the DVD rack (it was pulled into the box because of the graphics of a Velociraptor screaming the word "RAPTOR" on the front). The scene includes treasures such as tomato sauce, spaghetti bowels, futile attempts at humor, and rubbery dinosaur puppets that recur in the course of the film. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains unpredictable backgrounds and props where the mind melts at the thought that someone might be so ashamed of creating a movie. An example is when a truck is parked on a rock face in the middle of the night. The very next day they find it in an open grassy area. The driver could not have driven there since his face was bitten off by an unnamed Bipedal carnivore (I'll explain why it's unnamed in a second). So my only guess is that either the Velociraptor drove it, the cattle the driver carried, or Jim Wynorski did not particularly appreciate the viewers. In one part, they expect me to believe that they walk along a main street at night, when the street has no gutters, the hydrant is next to a phone booth, and there is only one street lamp. Still, I feel compelled to watch this movie and watch it again, just to find more stuff that will make me giggle the next time I look at it. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is terrible. Long extended breaks. Strange cuts on characters who were not close to the conversation. People casually discuss things as they look in front of the camera (and again, they look at the wall). You can not even give the dinosaur a coherent species by oscillating between the name of a baby dinosaur and the use of a rubber Velociraptor doll (which is characterized by the extremely long, fat, disproportionate claw). This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The editing is in the foreground of this film. That's not a good thing. I am aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films that have been masterfully made into a single bitch, but there must be a limit! Negotiations end as suddenly as they started. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters that are not limited, well, not explained at all! And an end that felt like driving a muscle car without a seatbelt into a brick wall. You just never know what's going to happen because the movie does not follow a coherent structure. This movie is a masterpiece. Now I just have to mention a single scene (the biggest one) that occurs just before the end. This is a spoiler, but not really. The final scene includes a showdown between Tyrannosaurus Rex and Sheriff Tanner. It's like the showdown between Sigourney Weaver and Alien Queen in Aliens, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic battles. It is actually that Tanner rams the dinosaur with a construction machine. A white bobcat. Within a few minutes, the director creates the white bobcat in a yellow forklift / crane device through a series of insidious cuts. Well, as I said, I know that this movie is made up of scenes from other films, but which two films justify a showdown with a T-Rex in a construction vehicle? This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This film gets 1/10 for the quality of filmmaking, but 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and amuse me.
