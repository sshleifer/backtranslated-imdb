The figure of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is in fact mainly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy by Ernst Marischka (1950), in which beauty, gentleness, sweetness, but also history are omnipresent. This was the sissi, perhaps a myth for some; a powerful presentation. The spirit of the Habsburgs as well as the Bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced these films very much. They just had a soul. Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, although filmed 50 years later, seems to be a misrepresentation of the Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something else, to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; However, there is not much to add, but robs the whole story a lot. Let me analyze that more closely. <br /> <br /> In September 1898 Sissi goes to the port of Geneva. Accompanied by her court girl, she goes to Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), to whom she will tell the entire life story to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists of looking back on important moments in Sissi's life. However, these moments are chaotically portrayed and therefore anyone unfamiliar with Austrian history can be completely misled or confused. Much attention is paid to Sissi's bad marriage with Emperor Franz Josef. The scene of her wedding night is a failure. Nobody treated an Empress like that (I mean, take off and pay). The focus that Sissi misunderstood is historically accurate, but the points that her views are different from the rest of the courtiers are not the true ones. Where is your desire for peace? Where is her love for her nation? Where is your charity? Sissi seems to be very elegant, modern and liberal (from the point of view of the 21st century). She cares about her appearance, which is not true historically. Sissi had an inner life that is not shown in the film. "As soon as women wear trousers," it is said in a sentence that represents the image of the Sissi presented in the film. Sissi abhors the monarchy, which is the film's noticeable criticism of the Austrian Empire. She also accepts some anarchist movements and, to her astonishment, blames her husband, Emperor Franz Josef, for the death of her son Rudolph. Where is it mentioned in the story that Sissi was present in Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, the mother-in-law, is better shown, however, the scene of Sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit clich√©d. Sorry to criticize so much, but another key aspect of the film that I find weak here is performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments as a sissi, she generally does not fit into the role. She looks more like a "femme fa story" than a tragic empress. Her make-up is as inaccurate as most of her gestures, like the Empress. Malik Zidi is slightly better than Rudolph and can generally be considered the one who enhances the value of the performances. Stephane Audran, however, does not have a special job as Sophie: You just do not get the impression why she loathes Sissi. She despised her because of Sissi's young age, while she was crowned, because of her behavior, her lifestyle and her belief. Partially it appears in the movie, but that's definitely not enough. But the biggest mistake, I think, is Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism ... here he seems to be a kind of libertine just to love his queen. And the presentation is so weak that this idea is very pale. The exact choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt, she fits in well with her looks and gestures. Unfortunately, their role does not require much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> A good point in this movie are costumes and pretty authentic venues. The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of Sissi's death seems to be a good surprise from the movie. It does not seem to be what it really was; The moment, however, is good from a symbolic point of view ... The Empress goes and does not know that this is her last moment. That is how she must have felt, so a crazy man has destroyed part of the size of the world. Another good moment was visual when Sissi spoke to Corfu and her son Rudolph. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In sum, it's not a good movie. It distorts a significant historical figure, a significant historical period, it tries to heal the sweetness of the Sissi trilogy, but does not seem to offer anything creative. Charm is gone, glory is over and history is ignored! Not very worthwhile! 3.10
