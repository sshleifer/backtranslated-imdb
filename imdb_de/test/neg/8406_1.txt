I kept looking at it because it looked like the plan was going somewhere. When it was ambiguous, I was very disappointed. I'll tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I will not. Maybe I'll just hint that something is going to happen. The writers had no imagination. This is not even a "B" movie, but a TV "B" movie.
