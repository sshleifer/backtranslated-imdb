Jack Higgins's straightforward thriller about a guilty IRA bomber who was forced to do a "last job" (where did I hear this conspiracy already?) Taken by cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all places), who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the Church prevent Father Bob from talking, but then Rourke falls in love with the blind niece of the priest. They connect to the church organ. What? That's really the story. Alan Bates is close to being a top dog gangster (literally) and seems to be the only actor focused on the funny tone Hodges is aiming for. Bates is ready to do some kind of UK. PRIZZI's HONOR, but no one else, including an effortlessly charismatic Liam Neeson in a supporting role, was informed.
