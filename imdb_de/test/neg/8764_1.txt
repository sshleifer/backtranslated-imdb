I watched the first show of each series to see what a waste of time is. The girl from Emmerdale was fat, so she should be in a big boyfriend, but nobody weighs it. <br /> <br /> When Itv made a big mistake, Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I feel like the whole show was all about big people trying to lose weight but never trying to have a love story, oh my god, what a waste of time and is also airtime. This show was not repeated on ITV2 / 3/4. Yes, that's how good it is. <br /> <br /> I would say that the box is not a waste of money. <br /> <br /> TAKE ACTION
