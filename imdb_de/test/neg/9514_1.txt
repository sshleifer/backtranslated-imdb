It's so depressing when filmmakers try to be cool, and that's so obvious here. This has a substandard dialogue, ridiculous dialogues, split-screens that are hard to see, and many flaws in their attempt to be a historical film and autobiographical. This movie should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to see this movie. I wish I had listened.
